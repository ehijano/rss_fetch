      <title>Feedback Processes causing an AMOC Collapse in the Community Earth System Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is recognized as a tipping element within the global climate system. Central to its tipping behavior is the salt-advection feedback mechanism, which has been extensively studied in box models and models of intermediate complexity. However, in contemporary, highly complex climate models, the importance and functioning of this feedback mechanism is less clear due to the intricate interplay of numerous ocean-atmosphere-sea ice feedbacks. In this study, we conduct a detailed mechanistic analysis of an AMOC collapse under quasi-equilibrium forcing conditions using the Community Earth System Model (CESM). By reconstructing the AMOC strength from the meridional density contrast across the Atlantic Ocean, we demonstrate that AMOC stability can be related to the Atlantic freshwater budget, revealing several important feedbacks. The dominant contribution is the destabilising salt-advection feedback, which is quantified through a negative sign of the overturning freshwater transport at 34$^{\circ}$S, indicated by $F_{\mathrm{ovS}}$. Other feedbacks are related to changes in North Atlantic sea-ice melt (destabilising), ocean-atmosphere freshwater fluxes (destabilising) and gyre transports (stabilising). Our study clarifies the role of $F_{\mathrm{ovS}}$ as an indicator of the background state stability of the AMOC. As many modern climate models have a positive $F_{\mathrm{ovS}}$ bias this implies that their AMOC is too stable which leads to an underestimation of the risk of an AMOC collapse under climate change.</description>

      <title>Predictability of Global AI Weather Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the predictability of artificial intelligence (AI) models for weather prediction. Using a simple deep-learning architecture based on convolutional long short-term memory and the ERA5 data for training, we show that different time-stepping techniques can have a strong influence on the model performance and weather predictability. Specifically, a small-step approach for which the future state is predicted by recursively iterating an AI model over a small time increment displays strong sensitivity to the type of input channels, the number of data frames, or forecast lead times. In contrast, a big-step approach for which a current state is directly projected to a future state at each corresponding lead time provides much better forecast skill and a longer predictability range. In particular, the big-step approach is very resilient to different input channels, or data frames. In this regard, our results present a different method for implementing global AI models for weather prediction, which can optimize the model performance even with minimum input channels or data frames.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Automatic Validation and Application of Lossy Data Compression in Ensemble Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble data assimilation techniques form an indispensable part of numerical weather prediction. As the ensemble size grows and model resolution increases, the amount of required storage becomes a major issue. Data compression schemes may come to the rescue not only for operational weather prediction, but also for weather history archives. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an easy-to-use framework for evaluating the impact of lossy data compression in large scale ensemble data assimilation. The framework leverages robust statistical qualifiers to determine which compression parameters can be safely applied to the climate variables. Furthermore, our proposal can be used to apply the best parameters during operation, while monitoring data integrity. We perform an exemplary study on the Lorenz96 model to identify viable compression parameters and achieve a 1/3 saving in storage space and an effective speedup of 6% per assimilation cycle, while monitoring the state integrity.</description>

      <title>SWIFT: A Monotonic, Flux-Form Semi-Lagrangian Tracer Transport Scheme for Flow with Large Courant Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local conservation of mass and entropy are becoming increasingly desirable properties for modern numerical weather and climate models. This work presents a Flux-Form Semi-Lagrangian (FFSL) transport scheme, called SWIFT, that facilitates this conservation for tracer variables, whilst maintaining other vital properties such as preservation of a constant, monotonicity and positivity. Importantly, these properties all hold for large Courant numbers and multi-dimensional flow, making the scheme appropriate for use within a dynamical core which takes large time steps.
  The SWIFT scheme presented here can be seen as an evolution of the FFSL methods of Leonard et al and Lin and Rood. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional schemes consist of a splitting into a sequence of one-dimensional calculations. The new SWIFT splitting presented here allows monotonic and positivity properties from the one-dimensional calculations to be inherited by the multi-dimensional scheme. These one-dimensional calculations involve separating the mass flux into terms that correspond to integer and fractional parts of the Courant number. Key to achieving conservation is coupling the transport of tracers to the transport of the fluid density, through re-use of the discrete mass flux that was calculated from the fluid density in the transport of the tracers. This work also describes how these properties can still be attained when the tracer is vertically-staggered from the density in a Charney-Phillips grid.</description>
