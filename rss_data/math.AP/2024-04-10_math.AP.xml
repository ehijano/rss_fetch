      <title>Late-time asymptotics of small data solutions for the Vlasov-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the precise late-time asymptotic behaviour of small data solutions for the Vlasov-Poisson system in dimension three. First, we show that the spatial density and the force field satisfy asymptotic self-similar polyhomogeneous expansions. Moreover, we obtain an enhanced modified scattering result for this non-linear system. We show that the distribution function converges, with an arbitrary rate, to a regular distribution function along high order modifications to the characteristics of the linearised problem. We exploit a hierarchy of asymptotic conservation laws for the distribution function. As an application, we show late-time tails for the spatial density and the force field, where the coefficients in the tails are obtained in terms of the scattering state. Finally, we prove that the distribution function (up to normalisation) converges weakly to a Dirac mass on the zero velocity set.</description>

      <title>Gradient and Hessian regularity in elliptic transmission problems near a point cusp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider elliptic transmission problems in several space dimensions near an interface which is $C^{1,1}$ diffeomorphic to an axisymmetric reference-interface with a singular point of cusp type. We establish the regularity of the gradient and of the Hessian in $L^p$ spaces up to the cusp point for local weak solutions. We obtain regularity thresholds which are different according to whether the cusp is inward or outward to the subdomain, and which depend explicitly on the opening of the interface at the cusp. Our results allow for source terms in the bulk and on the interface.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the Abrikosov lattice in the Lowest Landau Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Lowest Landau Level equation set on simply and doubly-periodic domains (in other words, rectangles and strips with appropriate boundary conditions). To begin with, we study well-posedness and establish the existence of stationary solutions. Then we investigate the linear stability of the lattice solution and prove it is stable for  the (hexagonal) Abrikosov lattice, but unstable for rectangular lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the multi-microlocalization functor $\mu hom_{{\chi}}$ of homomorphisms, which is a counterpart of the functor $\mu hom$ studied by M.Kashiwara and P.Schapira. Furthermore, using the new functor, we also introduce several sheaves of multi-microlocal operators which act on multi-microlocalized objects such as a multi-microfunction.</description>

      <title>Second order Sobolev regularity results for the generalized $p$-parabolic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a general class of parabolic equations $$ u_t-|Du|^\gamma\big(\Delta u+(p-2) \Delta_\infty^N u\big)=0, $$ which can be highly degenerate or singular. This class contains as special cases the standard parabolic $p$-Laplace equation and the normalized version that arises from stochastic game theory. Utilizing the systematic approach developed in our previous work we establish second order Sobolev regularity together with a priori estimates and improved range of parameters. In addition we derive second order Sobolev estimate for a nonlinear quantity. This quantity contains many useful special cases. As a corollary we also obtain that a viscosity solution has locally $L^2$-integrable Sobolev time derivative.</description>

      <title>Full description of Benjamin-Feir instability for generalized Korteweg-de Vries equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a family of generalized Korteweg-de Vries equations and study the linear modulational instability of small amplitude traveling waves solutions. Under explicit non-degeneracy conditions on the dispersion relation, we completely describe the spectrum near the origin of the linearized operator at such solutions and prove that the unstable spectrum (when present) is composed by branches depicting always a closed figure ''8''. We apply our abstract theorem to several equations such as the Whitham, the gravity-capillary Whitham and the Kawahara equations, confirming that the unstable spectrum of the corresponding linearized operators exhibits a figure ''8'' instability, as it was observed before only numerically. Our method of proof uses a symplectic version of Kato's theory of similarity transformation to reduce the problem to determine the eigenvalues of a $3 \times 3$ complex Hamiltonian and reversible matrix. Then, via a block-diagonalization procedure, we conjugate such matrix into a block-diagonal one composed by a $2\times 2$ Hamiltonian and reversible matrix, describing the unstable spectrum, and a single purely imaginary element describing the stable eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>Blow-up of classical solutions of quasilinear wave equations in one space dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the upper bound of the lifespan of classical solutions of the initial value problems for one dimensional wave equations with quasilinear terms of space-, or time-derivatives of the unknown function. The results are same as those of the semilinear case. But it is quite meaningful to consider this kind of problems for the purpose to cover the optimality of the general theory for nonlinear wave equations by many model equations as far as possible.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-preserving finite difference method for partially dissipative hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the preservation of asymptotic properties of partially dissipative hyperbolic systems when switching to a discrete setting. We prove that one of the simplest consistent and unconditionally stable numerical methods - the central finite-differences scheme - preserves both the asymptotic behaviour and the parabolic relaxation limit of one-dimensional partially dissipative hyperbolic systems which satisfy the Kalman rank condition.
  The large time asymptotic-preserving property is achieved by conceiving time-weighted perturbed energy functionals in the spirit of the hypocoercivity theory. For the relaxation-preserving property, drawing inspiration from the observation that solutions in the continuous case exhibit distinct behaviours in low and high frequencies, we introduce a novel discrete Littlewood-Paley theory tailored to the central finite-difference scheme. This allows us to prove Bernstein-type estimates for discrete differential operators and leads to a new relaxation result: the strong convergence of the discrete linearized compressible Euler equations with damping towards the discrete heat equation, uniformly with respect to the mesh parameter.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness theorems for one class of Hammerstein-type nonlinear integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of nonlinear integral equations on the positive half-line with a monotone operator of Hammerstein type is studied. With various partial representations of the corresponding kernel and nonlinearity, this class of equations has applications in the dynamic theory of $p$-adic strings, in the kinetic theory of gases, in the theory of radiation transfer and in the mathematical theory of the geographical spread of epidemic diseases. A constructive theorem for the existence of a nontrivial bounded solution is proved. The asymptotic behavior of the constructed solution at infinity is studied. We also prove a theorem for the uniqueness of a solution in the class of nonnegative nontrivial and bounded functions. At the end of the work, specific particular examples of the kernel and nonlinearity of this class of equations are given, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Critical non-linearity for some evolution equations with Fujita-type critical exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for a class of non-linear evolution equations in the form \[L(\partial_t,\partial_x) u=F(\partial_t^\ell u), \quad (t,x)\in [0,\infty)\times \mathbb{R}^n;\] here, $L(\partial_t,\partial_x)$ is a linear partial differential operator with constant coefficients, of order $m\geq 1$ with respect to the time variable $t$, and $\ell$ is a natural number satisfying $0\leq \ell\leq m-1$. For several different choices of $L$, many authors have investigated the existence of global (in time) solutions to this problem when $F(s)=|s|^p$ is a power non-linearity, looking for a \textit{critical exponent} $p_c&gt;1$ such that global small data solutions exist in the supercritical case $p&gt;p_c$, whereas no global weak solutions exist, under suitable sign assumptions on the data, in the subcritical case $1&lt;p&lt;p_c$. In the present paper we consider a more general non-linear term in the form $F(s)=|s|^p\mu(|s|)$; for a large class of models, we provide an integral condition on $\mu$ which allows to distinguish more precisely the region of existence of a global (in time) small data solution from that in which the problem admits no global (in time) weak solutions, refining the existing results about the critical exponents for power type non-linearities.</description>

      <title>Periodic solutions to integro-differential equations: variational formulation, symmetry, and regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider nonconstant periodic constrained minimizers of semilinear elliptic equations for integro-differential operators in $\mathbb{R}$. We prove that, after an appropriate translation, each of them is necessarily an even function which is decreasing in half its period. In particular, it has only two critical points in half its period, the absolute maximum and minimum. If these statements hold for all nonconstant periodic solutions, and not only for constrained minimizers, remains as an open problem.
  Our results apply to operators with kernels in two different classes: kernels $K$ which are convex and kernels for which $K(\tau^{1/2})$ is a completely monotonic function of $\tau$. This last new class arose in our previous work on nonlocal Delaunay surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Due to their symmetry of revolution, it gave rise to a 1d problem involving an operator with a nonconvex kernel. Our proofs are based on a not so well-known Riesz rearrangement inequality on the circle $\mathbb{S}^1$ established in 1976.
  We also put in evidence a new regularity fact which is a truly nonlocal-semilinear effect and also occurs in the nonperiodic setting. Namely, for nonlinearities in $C^\beta$ and when $2s+\beta &lt;1$ ($2s$ being the order of the operator), the solution is not always $C^{2s+\beta-\epsilon}$ for all $\epsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Instability of quadratic band degeneracies and the emergence of Dirac points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$, where the potential $V$ is $\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic and invariant under spatial inversion, complex conjugation, and $\pi/2$ rotation. We show that, under typical small linear deformations of $V$, the quadratic band degeneracy points, occurring over the high-symmetry quasimomentum ${\bf M}$ (see [24, 25]) each split into two separated degeneracies over perturbed quasimomenta ${\bf D}^+$ and ${\bf D}^-$, and that these degeneracies are Dirac points. The local character of the degenerate dispersion surfaces about the emergent Dirac points are tilted, elliptical cones. Correspondingly, the dynamics of wavepackets spectrally localized near either ${\bf D}^+$ or ${\bf D}^-$ are governed by a system of Dirac equations with an advection term. Generalizations are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When studying out-of-equilibrium systems, one often excites the dynamics in some degrees of freedom while removing the excitation in others through damping. In order for the system to converge to a statistical steady state, the dynamics must transfer the energy from the excited modes to the dissipative directions. The precise mechanisms underlying this transfer are of particular interest and are the topic of this paper. We explore a class of randomly switched models introduced in [2,3] and provide some of the first results showing that minimal damping is sufficient to stabilize the system in a fluids model.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the compressible Euler limit from the Boltzmann equation with hard sphere collisional kernel and complete diffusive boundary condition in half-space by employing the Hilbert expansion which includes interior and Knudsen layers. This rigorously justifies the corresponding formal analysis in Sone's book \cite{Sone-2007-Book} in the context of short time smooth solutions, and also generalizes the classic Caflisch's result \cite{Caflish-1980-CPAM} to initial-boundary problem case.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear elliptic PDE from atmospheric science: well-posedness and regularity at cloud edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precipitating quasi-geostrophic equations go beyond the (dry) quasi-geostrophic equations by incorporating the effects of moisture. This means that both precipitation and phase changes between a water-vapour phase (outside a cloud) and a water-vapour-plus-liquid phase (inside a cloud) are taken into account. In the dry case, provided that a Laplace equation is inverted, the quasi-geostrophic equations may be formulated as a nonlocal transport equation for a single scalar variable (the potential vorticity). In the case of the precipitating quasi-geostrophic equations, inverting the Laplacian is replaced by a more challenging adversary known as potential-vorticity-and-moisture inversion. The PDE to invert is nonlinear and piecewise elliptic with jumps in its coefficients across the cloud edge. However, its global ellipticity is a priori unclear due to the dependence of the phase boundary on the unknown itself. This is a free boundary problem where the location of the cloud edge is one of the unknowns. Potential vorticity-and-moisture inversion differs from oft-studied free-boundary problems in the literature, and here we present the first rigorous analysis of this PDE. Introducing a variational formulation of the inversion, we use tools from the calculus of variations to deduce existence and uniqueness of solutions and de Giorgi techniques to obtain sharp regularity results. In particular, we show that the gradient of the unknown pressure or streamfunction is H\"older continuous at cloud edge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the existence of travelling wave solutions for a general one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We construct these solutions by minimizing the energy under the constraint of fixed momentum. We also prove that the family of minimizers is stable. Our method is based on recent articles about the orbital stability for the classical and non-local Gross-Pitaevskii equations [3, 10]. It relies on a concentration-compactness theorem, which provides some compactness for the minimizing sequences and thus the convergence (up to a subsequence) towards a travelling wave solution.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the existence of weak solutions to a multi-component system, consisting of compressible chemically reacting components, coupled with the compressible Stokes equation for the velocity. Specifically, we consider the case of irreversible chemical reactions and assume a nonlinear relation between the pressure and the particular densities. These assumptions cause the additional difficulties in the mathematical analysis, due to the possible presence of vacuum.
  It is shown that there exists a global weak solution, satisfying the $L^\infty$ bounds for all the components. We obtain strong compactness of the sequence of densities in $L^p$ spaces, under the assumption that all components are strictly positive. The applied method captures the properties of models of high generality, which admit an arbitrary number of components. Furthermore, the framework that we develop can handle models that contain both diffusing and non-diffusing elements.</description>

Abstract: The optimal $L^4$-Strichartz estimate for the Schr{\"o}dinger equation on the two-dimensional rational torus $\mathbb{T}^2$ is proved, which improves an estimate of Bourgain. A new method based on incidence geometry is used. The approach yields a stronger $L^4$ bound on a logarithmic time scale, which implies global existence of solutions to the cubic (mass-critical) nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in $H^s(\mathbb{T}^2)$ for any $s&gt;0$ and data which is small in the critical norm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we deal with the fractional Logarithmic Schr\"{o}dinger operator $(I+(-\Delta)^s)^{\log}$ and the corresponding energy spaces for variational study. The fractional (relativistic) Logarithmic Schr\"{o}dinger operator is the pseudo-differential operator with logarithmic Fourier symbol, $\log(1+|\xi|^{2s})$, $s&gt;0$. We first establish the integral representation corresponding to the operator and provide an asymptotics property of the related kernel. We introduce the functional analytic theory allowing to study the operator from a PDE point of view and the associated Dirichlet problems in an open set of $\mathbb{ R}^N.$ We also establish some variational inequalities, provide the fundamental solution and the asymptotics of the corresponding Green function at zero and at infinity.</description>

      <title>Higher order expansion for the probabilistic local well-posedness theory for a cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the probabilistic local well-posedness of the cubic Schr\"odinger equation (cubic NLS): \[ (i\partial_{t} + \Delta) u = \pm |u|^{2} u \text{ on } [0,T) \times \mathbb{R}^{d}, \] with initial data being a Wiener randomization at unit scale of a given function $f$. We prove that a solution exists almost-surely locally in time provided \(f\in H^{S}_{x}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\) with \(S&gt;\max\big(\frac{d-3}{4},\frac{d-4}{2}\big)\) for \(d\geq 3\). In particular, we establish that the local well-posedness holds for any \(S&gt;0\) when \(d=3\). We also show that, under appropriate smallness conditions for the initial data, the solutions are global in time and scatter.
  The solutions are constructed as a sum of an explicit multilinear expansion of the flow in terms of the random initial data and of an additional smoother remainder term with deterministically subcritical regularity. This construction allows us to introduce a new and refined notion of graded scattering.
  We develop the framework of directional space-time norms to control the (probabilistic) multilinear expansion and the (deterministic) remainder term and to obtain improved bilinear probabilistic-deterministic Strichartz estimates.</description>

      <title>Variational structures for the Fokker--Planck equation with general Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the convergence of a modified Jordan--Kinderlehrer--Otto scheme to a solution to the Fokker--Planck equation in $\Omega \Subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with general, positive and temporally constant, Dirichlet boundary conditions. We work under mild assumptions on the domain, the drift, and the initial datum.
  In the special case where $\Omega$ is an interval in $\mathbb{R}^1$, we prove that such a solution is a gradient flow -- curve of maximal slope -- within a suitable space of measures, endowed with a modified Wasserstein distance.
  Our discrete scheme and modified distance draw inspiration from contributions by A. Figalli and N. Gigli [J. Math. Pures Appl. 94, (2010), pp. 107--130], and J. Morales [J. Math. Pures Appl. 112, (2018), pp. 41--88] on an optimal-transport approach to evolution equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Similarly to these works, we allow the mass to flow from/to the boundary $\partial \Omega$ throughout the evolution. However, our leading idea is to also keep track of the mass at the boundary by working with measures defined on the whole closure $\overline \Omega$.
  The driving functional is a modification of the classical relative entropy that also makes use of the information at the boundary. As an intermediate result, when $\Omega$ is an interval in $\mathbb{R}^1$, we find a formula for the descending slope of this geodesically nonconvex functional.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present an algorithmic procedure that transforms, if possible, a given system of ordinary or partial differential equations with radical dependencies in the unknown function and its derivatives into a system with polynomial relations among them by means of a rational change of variables. The solutions of the given equation and its transformation correspond one-to-one. This work can be seen as a generalization of previous work on reparametrization of ODEs and PDEs with radical coefficients.</description>

      <title>Index theory of hypoelliptic operators on Carnot manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.04717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the index theory of hypoelliptic operators on Carnot manifolds -- manifolds whose Lie algebra of vector fields is equipped with a filtration induced from sub-bundles of the tangent bundle. A Heisenberg pseudodifferential operator, elliptic in the calculus of van Erp-Yuncken, is hypoelliptic and Fredholm. Under some geometric conditions, we compute its Fredholm index by means of operator $K$-theory. These results extend the work of Baum-van Erp (Acta Mathematica '2014) for co-oriented contact manifolds to a methodology for solving this index problem geometrically on Carnot manifolds.
  Under the assumption that the Carnot manifold is regular, i.e. has isomorphic osculating Lie algebras in all fibres, and admits a flat coadjoint orbit, the methodology derived from Baum-van Erp's work is developed in full detail. In this case, we develope $K$-theoretical dualities computing the Fredholm index by means of geometric $K$-homology a la Baum-Douglas. The duality involves a Hilbert space bundle of flat orbit representations. Explicit solutions to the index problem for Toeplitz operators and operators of the form "$\Delta_H+\gamma T$" are computed in geometric $K$-homology, extending results of Boutet de Monvel and Baum-van Erp, respectively, from co-oriented contact manifolds to regular polycontact manifolds.</description>

Abstract: Given global Lipschitz continuity and differentiability of high enough order on the coefficients in It\^{o}'s equation, differentiability of associated semigroups, existence of twice differentiable solutions to Kolmogorov equations and weak convergence rates of numerical approximations are known results. In this work and against the counterexamples of Hairer et al.(2015), the drift and diffusion coefficients having Lipschitz constants that are $o(\log V)$ and $o(\sqrt{\log V})$ respectively for a function $V$ satisfying $(\partial_t + L)V\leq CV$ is shown to be a generalizing condition in place of global Lipschitz continuity for the above.</description>

      <title>Convergence rate of entropy-regularized multi-marginal optimal transport costs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence rate of multi-marginal optimal transport costs that are regularized with the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy, as the noise parameter $\varepsilon$ tends to $0$. We establish lower and upper bounds on the difference with the unregularized cost of the form $C\varepsilon\log(1/\varepsilon)+O(\varepsilon)$ for some explicit dimensional constants $C$ depending on the marginals and on the ground cost, but not on the optimal transport plans themselves. Upper bounds are obtained for Lipschitz costs or locally semi-concave costs for a finer estimate, and lower bounds for $\mathscr{C}^2$ costs satisfying some signature condition on the mixed second derivatives that may include degenerate costs, thus generalizing results previously in the two marginals case and for non-degenerate costs. We obtain in particular matching bounds in some typical situations where the optimal plan is deterministic.</description>

      <title>Strongly stable dual-pairing summation by parts finite difference schemes for the vector invariant nonlinear shallow water equations -- I: Numerical scheme and validation on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an energy/entropy stable and high order accurate finite difference method for solving the nonlinear (rotating) shallow water equations (SWE) in vector invariant form using the newly developed dual-pairing and dispersion-relation preserving summation-by-parts finite difference operators. We derive new well-posed boundary conditions for the SWE in one space dimension, formulated in terms of fluxes and applicable to linear and nonlinear SWEs. For the nonlinear SWE, entropy stability ensures the boundedness of numerical solution but does not guarantee convergence. Adequate amount of numerical dissipation is necessary to control high frequency errors which could negatively impact accuracy in the numerical simulations. Using the dual-pairing summation by parts framework, we derive high order accurate and nonlinear hyper-viscosity operator which dissipates entropy and enstrophy. The hyper-viscosity operator effectively minimises oscillations from shocks and discontinuities, and eliminates high frequency grid-scale errors. The numerical method is most suitable for the simulations of subcritical flows typically observed in atmospheric and geostrophic flow problems. We prove a priori error estimates for the semi-discrete approximations of both linear and nonlinear SWE. Convergence, accuracy, and well-balanced properties are verified via the method of manufactured solutions and canonical test problems such as the dam break and lake at rest. Numerical simulations in two-dimensions are presented which include the rotating and merging vortex problem and barotropic shear instability, with fully developed turbulence.</description>

      <title>Derivation of renormalized Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov and quantum Boltzmann equations in an interacting Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our previous work [37] presented a rigorous derivation of quantum Boltzmann equations near a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here, we extend it with a complete characterization of the leading order fluctuation dynamics. For this purpose, we correct the latter via an appropriate Bogoliubov rotation, in partial analogy to the approach by Grillakis-Machedon et al. [59], in addition to the Weyl transformation applied in [37]. Based on the analysis of the third order expansion of the BEC wave function, and the second order expansions of the pair-correlations, we show that through a renormalization strategy, various contributions to the effective Hamiltonian can be iteratively eliminated by an appropriate choice of the Weyl and Bogoliubov transformations. This leads to a separation of renormalized Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) equations and quantum Boltzmann equations. A multitude of terms that were included in the error term in [37] are now identified as contributions to the HFB renormalization terms. Thereby, the error bound in the work at hand is improved significantly. To the given order, it is now sharp, and matches the order or magnitude expected from scaling considerations. Consequently, we extend the time of validity to $t\sim (\log N)^2$ compared to $t\sim (\log N/\log \log N)^2$ before. We expect our approach to be extensible to smaller orders in $\frac1N$.</description>

Abstract: We improve the classical results by Brenner and Thom\'ee on rational approximations of operator semigroups. In the setting of Hilbert spaces, we introduce a finer regularity scale for initial data, provide sharper stability estimates, and obtain optimal approximation rates. Moreover, we strengthen a result due to Egert-Rozendaal on subdiagonal Pad\'e approximations of operator semigroups. Our approach is direct and based on the theory of the $\mathcal B$- functional calculus developed recently. On the way, we elaborate a new and simple approach to construction of the $\mathcal B$-calculus thus making the paper essentially self-contai</description>
