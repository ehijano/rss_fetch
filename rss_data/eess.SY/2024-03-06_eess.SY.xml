      <title>LQ Control of Traffic Flow Models via Variable Speed Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an extension of a linear control design for hyperbolic linear partial differential equations is presented for a first-order traffic flow model. Starting from the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model, variable speed limit control (VSL) is applied through a modification of Greenshield's equilibrium flow model. Then, an optimal linear quadratic (LQ) controller is designed on the linear LWR model. The LQ state feedback function is found via the solution of a Riccati differential equation. Unlike previous studies, the control input is the rate of change of the input, not the input itself. The proposed controller is then verified on both the linear and nonlinear models. In both cases, the controller is able to drive the system to a desired density profile. In the nonlinear application, a higher control gain is needed to achieve similar results as in the linear case.</description>

      <title>Collision Avoidance and Geofencing for Fixed-wing Aircraft with Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety-critical failures often have fatal consequences in aerospace control. Control systems on aircraft, therefore, must ensure the strict satisfaction of safety constraints, preferably with formal guarantees of safe behavior. This paper establishes the safety-critical control of fixed-wing aircraft in collision avoidance and geofencing tasks. A control framework is developed wherein a run-time assurance (RTA) system modulates the nominal flight controller of the aircraft whenever necessary to prevent it from colliding with other aircraft or crossing a boundary (geofence) in space. The RTA is formulated as a safety filter using control barrier functions (CBFs) with formal guarantees of safe behavior. CBFs are constructed and compared for a nonlinear kinematic fixed-wing aircraft model. The proposed CBF-based controllers showcase the capability of safely executing simultaneous collision avoidance and geofencing, as demonstrated by simulations on the kinematic model and a high-fidelity dynamical model.</description>

      <title>Autonomous vehicle decision and control through reinforcement learning with traffic flow randomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the current studies on autonomous vehicle decision-making and control tasks based on reinforcement learning are conducted in simulated environments. The training and testing of these studies are carried out under rule-based microscopic traffic flow, with little consideration of migrating them to real or near-real environments to test their performance. It may lead to a degradation in performance when the trained model is tested in more realistic traffic scenes. In this study, we propose a method to randomize the driving style and behavior of surrounding vehicles by randomizing certain parameters of the car-following model and the lane-changing model of rule-based microscopic traffic flow in SUMO. We trained policies with deep reinforcement learning algorithms under the domain randomized rule-based microscopic traffic flow in freeway and merging scenes, and then tested them separately in rule-based microscopic traffic flow and high-fidelity microscopic traffic flow. Results indicate that the policy trained under domain randomization traffic flow has significantly better success rate and calculative reward compared to the models trained under other microscopic traffic flows.</description>

      <title>Single-level Robust Bidding of Renewable-only Virtual Power Plant in Energy and Ancillary Service Markets for Worst-case Profit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel single-level robust mathematical approach to model the RES-only Virtual Power Plant (RVPP) bidding problem in the simultaneous Day Ahead Market (DAM) and Secondary Reserve Market (SRM). The worst-case profit of RVPP due to uncertainties related to electricity prices, Non-dispatchable Renewable Energy Sources (ND-RES) production, and flexible demand is captured. In order to find the worst-case profit in a single-level model, the relationship between price and energy uncertainties leads to some non-linear constraints, which are appropriately linearized. The simulation results show the superiority of the proposed robust model compared to those in the literature, as well as its computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Convex Optimization Framework for Computing Robustness Margins of Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel convex optimization framework for designing robust Kalman filters that guarantee a user-specified steady-state error while maximizing process and sensor noise. The proposed framework simultaneously determines the Kalman gain and the robustness margin in terms of the process and sensor noise. This is the first paper to present such a joint formulation for Kalman filtering. The proposed methodology is validated through two distinct examples: the Clohessy-Wiltshire-Hill equations for a chaser spacecraft in an elliptical orbit and the longitudinal motion model of an F-16 aircraft.</description>

      <title>Unifying Controller Design for Stabilizing Nonlinear Systems with Norm-Bounded Control Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits a classical challenge in the design of stabilizing controllers for nonlinear systems with a norm-bounded input constraint. By extending Lin-Sontag's universal formula and introducing a generic (state-dependent) scaling term, a unifying controller design method is proposed. The incorporation of this generic scaling term gives a unified controller and enables the derivation of alternative universal formulas with various favorable properties, which makes it suitable for tailored control designs to meet specific requirements and provides versatility across different control scenarios. Additionally, we present a constructive approach to determine the optimal scaling term, leading to an explicit solution to an optimization problem, named optimization-based universal formula. The resulting controller ensures asymptotic stability, satisfies a norm-bounded input constraint, and optimizes a predefined cost function. Finally, the essential properties of the unified controllers are analyzed, including smoothness, continuity at the origin, stability margin, and inverse optimality. Simulations validate the approach, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing a challenging stabilizing control problem of a nonlinear system.</description>

      <title>Design of Stochastic Quantizers for Privacy Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the role of stochastic quantizers for privacy preservation. We first employ a static stochastic quantizer and investigate its corresponding privacy-preserving properties. Specifically, we demonstrate that a sufficiently large quantization step guarantees $(0, \delta)$ differential privacy. Additionally, the degradation of control performance caused by quantization is evaluated as the tracking error of output regulation. These two analyses characterize the trade-off between privacy and control performance, determined by the quantization step. This insight enables us to use quantization intentionally as a means to achieve the seemingly conflicting two goals of maintaining control performance and preserving privacy at the same time; towards this end, we further investigate a dynamic stochastic quantizer. Under a stability assumption, the dynamic stochastic quantizer can enhance privacy, more than the static one, while achieving the same control performance. We further handle the unstable case by additionally applying input Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>Tracking-in-range Formulations for Numerical Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to set-point tracking which aims to reduce the tracking error between the tracker and the reference, tracking-in-range problems only focus on whether the tracker is within a given range around the reference, making it more suitable for the mission specifications of many practical applications. In this work, we present novel optimal control formulations to solve tracking-in-range problems, for both problems requiring the tracker to be always in range, and problems allowing the tracker to go out of range to yield overall better outcomes. As the problem naturally involves discontinuous functions, we present alternative formulations and regularisation strategies to improve the performance of numerical solvers. The extension to in-range tracking with multiple trackers and in-range tracking in high dimensional space are also discussed and illustrated with numerical examples, demonstrating substantial increases in mission duration in comparison to traditional set-point tracking.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions to the Problem of Input-Output Extension of Internally Controlled Underactuated Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we address the problem of re-targeting a commercial under-actuated robotic system to a higher dimensional output task. Commercial platforms are equipped with an on-board low-level internal controller that provides the user some virtual references inputs and cannot be replaced. Such controller may control in practice only a subset of the total degrees-of-freedom of the system. Our primary objective is to augment these systems by introducing supplementary inputs, attaining increased output capability. Integrating such additional inputs into the control framework introduces a layer of complexity, raising questions about the compatibility and cohesiveness of the overall system. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which it is possible to extend the controlled outputs by adding extra inputs when one is forced to keep the internal controller unmodified. We underscore the efficacy and universality of our proposed methodology through the presentation of two relevant examples.</description>

      <title>A Federated Deep Learning Approach for Privacy-Preserving Real-Time Transient Stability Predictions in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maintaining the privacy of power system data is essential for protecting sensitive information and ensuring the operation security of critical infrastructure. Therefore, the adoption of centralized deep learning (DL) transient stability assessment (TSA) frameworks can introduce risks to electric utilities. This is because these frameworks make utility data susceptible to cyber threats and communication issues when transmitting data to a central server for training a single TSA model. Additionally, the centralized approach demands significant computational resources, which may not always be readily available. In light of these challenges, this paper introduces a federated DL-based TSA framework designed to identify the operating states of the power system. Instead of local utilities transmitting their data to a central server for centralized model training, they independently train their own TSA models using their respective datasets. Subsequently, the parameters of each local TSA model are sent to a central server for model aggregation, and the resulting model is shared back with the local clients. This approach not only preserves the integrity of local utility data, making it resilient against cyber threats but also reduces the computational demands for local TSA model training. The proposed approach is tested on four local clients each having the IEEE 39-bus test system.</description>

      <title>On the computation of stable coupled state-space models for dynamic substructuring applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims at introducing a methodology to compute stable coupled state-space models for dynamic substructuring applications by introducing two novel approaches targeted to accomplish this task: a) a procedure to impose Newtons's second law without relying on the use of undamped RCMs (residual compensation modes) and b) a novel approach to impose stability on unstable coupled state-space models. The enforcement of stability is performed by dividing the unstable model into two different models, one composed by the stable poles (stable model) and the other composed by the unstable ones (unstable model). Then, the poles of the unstable state-space model are forced to be stable, leading to the computation of a stabilized state-space model. Afterwards, to make sure that the Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) of the stabilized model well match the FRFs of the unstable model, the Least-Squares Frequency Domain (LSFD) method is exploited to update the modal parameters of the stabilized model composed by the pairs of complex conjugate poles. The validity of the proposed methodologies is presented and discussed by exploiting experimental data. Indeed, by exploiting the FRFs of a real system, accurate state-space models respecting Newton's second law are computed. Then, decoupling and coupling operations are performed with the identified state-space models, no matter the models resultant from the decoupling/coupling operations are unstable. Stability is then imposed on the computed unstable coupled model by following the approach proposed in this paper. The methodology proved to work well on these data. Moreover, the paper also shows that the coupled state-space models obtained using this methodology are suitable to be exploited in time-domain analyses and simulations.</description>

      <title>Are More LLM Calls All You Need? Towards Scaling Laws of Compound Inference Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many recent state-of-the-art results in language tasks were achieved using compound systems that perform multiple Large Language Model (LLM) calls and aggregate their responses. However, there is little understanding of how the number of LLM calls -- e.g., when asking the LLM to answer each question multiple times and taking a consensus -- affects such a compound system's performance. In this paper, we initiate the study of scaling laws of compound inference systems. We analyze, theoretically and empirically, how the number of LLM calls affects the performance of one-layer Voting Inference Systems -- one of the simplest compound systems, which aggregates LLM responses via majority voting. We find empirically that across multiple language tasks, surprisingly, Voting Inference Systems' performance first increases but then decreases as a function of the number of LLM calls. Our theoretical results suggest that this non-monotonicity is due to the diversity of query difficulties within a task: more LLM calls lead to higher performance on "easy" queries, but lower performance on "hard" queries, and non-monotone behavior emerges when a task contains both types of queries. This insight then allows us to compute, from a small number of samples, the number of LLM calls that maximizes system performance, and define a scaling law of Voting Inference Systems. Experiments show that our scaling law can predict the performance of Voting Inference Systems and find the optimal number of LLM calls to make.</description>

      <title>A Simple Finite-Time Analysis of TD Learning with Linear Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the finite-time convergence of TD learning with linear function approximation under Markovian sampling. Existing proofs for this setting either assume a projection step in the algorithm to simplify the analysis, or require a fairly intricate argument to ensure stability of the iterates. We ask: \textit{Is it possible to retain the simplicity of a projection-based analysis without actually performing a projection step in the algorithm?} Our main contribution is to show this is possible via a novel two-step argument. In the first step, we use induction to prove that under a standard choice of a constant step-size $\alpha$, the iterates generated by TD learning remain uniformly bounded in expectation. In the second step, we establish a recursion that mimics the steady-state dynamics of TD learning up to a bounded perturbation on the order of $O(\alpha^2)$ that captures the effect of Markovian sampling. Combining these pieces leads to an overall approach that considerably simplifies existing proofs. We conjecture that our inductive proof technique will find applications in the analyses of more complex stochastic approximation algorithms, and conclude by providing some examples of such applications.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating a Robust Walking Algorithm for Underactuated Bipedal Robots in Non-flat, Non-stationary Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores an innovative algorithm designed to enhance the mobility of underactuated bipedal robots across challenging terrains, especially when navigating through spaces with constrained opportunities for foot support, like steps or stairs. By combining ankle torque with a refined angular momentum-based linear inverted pendulum model (ALIP), our method allows variability in the robot's center of mass height. We employ a dual-strategy controller that merges virtual constraints for precise motion regulation across essential degrees of freedom with an ALIP-centric model predictive control (MPC) framework, aimed at enforcing gait stability. The effectiveness of our feedback design is demonstrated through its application on the Cassie bipedal robot, which features 20 degrees of freedom. Key to our implementation is the development of tailored nominal trajectories and an optimized MPC that reduces the execution time to under 500 microseconds--and, hence, is compatible with Cassie's controller update frequency. This paper not only showcases the successful hardware deployment but also demonstrates a new capability, a bipedal robot using a moving walkway.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Spatio-Temporal State Estimation for Fine-grained Adaptive Anomaly Diagnosis of Industrial Cyber-physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate detection and diagnosis of abnormal behaviors such as network attacks from multivariate time series (MTS) are crucial for ensuring the stable and effective operation of industrial cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, existing researches pay little attention to the logical dependencies among system working states, and have difficulties in explaining the evolution mechanisms of abnormal signals. To reveal the spatio-temporal association relationships and evolution mechanisms of the working states of industrial CPS, this paper proposes a fine-grained adaptive anomaly diagnosis method (i.e. MAD-Transformer) to identify and diagnose anomalies in MTS. MAD-Transformer first constructs a temporal state matrix to characterize and estimate the change patterns of the system states in the temporal dimension. Then, to better locate the anomalies, a spatial state matrix is also constructed to capture the inter-sensor state correlation relationships within the system. Subsequently, based on these two types of state matrices, a three-branch structure of series-temporal-spatial attention module is designed to simultaneously capture the series, temporal, and space dependencies among MTS. Afterwards, three associated alignment loss functions and a reconstruction loss are constructed to jointly optimize the model. Finally, anomalies are determined and diagnosed by comparing the residual matrices with the original matrices. We conducted comparative experiments on five publicly datasets spanning three application domains (service monitoring, spatial and earth exploration, and water treatment), along with a petroleum refining simulation dataset collected by ourselves. The results demonstrate that MAD-Transformer can adaptively detect fine-grained anomalies with short duration, and outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of noise robustness and localization performance.</description>

      <title>Linear quadratic control of nonlinear systems with Koopman operator learning and the Nystr\"om method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how the Koopman operator framework can be combined with kernel methods to effectively control nonlinear dynamical systems. While kernel methods have typically large computational requirements, we show how random subspaces (Nystr\"om approximation) can be used to achieve huge computational savings while preserving accuracy. Our main technical contribution is deriving theoretical guarantees on the effect of the Nystr\"om approximation. More precisely, we study the linear quadratic regulator problem, showing that both the approximated Riccati operator and the regulator objective, for the associated solution of the optimal control problem, converge at the rate $m^{-1/2}$, where $m$ is the random subspace size. Theoretical findings are complemented by numerical experiments corroborating our results.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control for setpoint tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main objective of tracking control is to steer the tracking error, that is the difference between the reference and the output, to zero while the plant's operation limits are satisfied. This requires that some assumptions on the evolution of the future values of the reference must be taken into account. Typically a simple evolution of the reference is considered, such as step, ramp, or parabolic reference signals. It is important to notice that the tracking problem considers possible variations in the reference to be tracked, such as steps or slope variations of the ramps. Then the tracking control problem is inherently uncertain, since the reference may differ from what is expected. If the value of the reference is changed, then there is no guarantee that the feasibility and stability properties of the resulting control law hold. This report presents the MPC for tracking (MPCT) approach, which ensures recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability of the setpoint when the value of the reference is changed.</description>

      <title>Neural Codebook Design for Network Beam Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining accurate and timely channel state information (CSI) is a fundamental challenge for large antenna systems. Mobile systems like 5G use a beam management framework that joins the initial access, beamforming, CSI acquisition, and data transmission. The design of codebooks for these stages, however, is challenging due to their interrelationships, varying array sizes, and site-specific channel and user distributions. Furthermore, beam management is often focused on single-sector operations while ignoring the overarching network- and system-level optimization. In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end learned codebook design algorithm, network beamspace learning (NBL), that captures and optimizes codebooks to mitigate interference while maximizing the achievable performance with extremely large hybrid arrays. The proposed algorithm requires limited shared information yet designs codebooks that outperform traditional codebooks by over 10dB in beam alignment and achieve more than 25% improvements in network spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>Distributed Policy Gradient for Linear Quadratic Networked Control with Limited Communication Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a scalable distributed policy gradient method and proves its convergence to near-optimal solution in multi-agent linear quadratic networked systems. The agents engage within a specified network under local communication constraints, implying that each agent can only exchange information with a limited number of neighboring agents. On the underlying graph of the network, each agent implements its control input depending on its nearby neighbors' states in the linear quadratic control setting. We show that it is possible to approximate the exact gradient only using local information. Compared with the centralized optimal controller, the performance gap decreases to zero exponentially as the communication and control ranges increase. We also demonstrate how increasing the communication range enhances system stability in the gradient descent process, thereby elucidating a critical trade-off. The simulation results verify our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Low-rank approximated Kalman-Bucy filters using Oja's principal component flow for linear time-invariant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kalman-Bucy filter is widely used in various applications. However, the filter becomes computationally complex under large-scale systems. To address this problem, a low-rank approximated Kalman-Bucy filter consisting of Oja's principal component flow and a low-dimensional Riccati differential equation was proposed. However, the estimation error was established only for linear time-invariant systems with a symmetric system matrix. This study removes restrictions on the symmetricity of the system matrix and reveals the equilibrium points of the Oja flow and their stability for general real square matrices. In addition, the attraction domain for a set of stable equilibrium points is estimated. Based on these results, we demonstrate that the low-rank approximated Kalman-Bucy filter has a bounded estimation error covariance matrix when the system is controllable and observable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07143v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Car-following (CF) algorithms are crucial components of traffic simulations and have been integrated into many production vehicles equipped with Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). Insights from the model of car-following behavior help us understand the causes of various macro phenomena that arise from interactions between pairs of vehicles. Car-following models encompass multiple disciplines, including traffic engineering, physics, dynamic system control, cognitive science, machine learning, and reinforcement learning. This paper presents an extensive survey that highlights the differences, complementarities, and overlaps among microscopic traffic flow and control models based on their underlying principles and design logic. It reviews representative algorithms, ranging from theory-based kinematic models, Psycho-Physical Models, and Adaptive cruise control models to data-driven algorithms like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Imitation Learning (IL). The manuscript discusses the strengths and limitations of these models and explores their applications in different contexts. This review synthesizes existing researches across different domains to fill knowledge gaps and offer guidance for future research by identifying the latest trends in car following models and their applications.</description>

      <title>ARRTOC: Adversarially Robust Real-Time Optimization and Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-Time Optimization (RTO) plays a crucial role in the process operation hierarchy by determining optimal set-points for the lower-level controllers. However, at the control layer, these set-points may be difficult to track due to challenges in implementation as a result of disturbances, measurement noise, and actuator performance limitations. To address this, in this paper, we present the Adversarially Robust Real-Time Optimization and Control (ARRTOC) algorithm. ARRTOC addresses this issue by finding set-points which are both optimal and inherently robust to implementation errors at the control layers. ARRTOC draws inspiration from adversarial machine learning, offering a novel constrained Adversarially Robust Optimization (ARO) solution applied to the RTO layer. By integrating controller design with RTO, ARRTOC enhances overall system performance and robustness by ensuring the chosen set-points are tailored to the underlying controller designs. To validate our claims, we present three case studies: an illustrative example, a bioreactor case study, and a multi-loop evaporator process. The proposed approach is found to improve RTO objectives, such as profit, by as much as $50\%$ in some case studies compared to RTO formulations which ignore the performance of the control layers.</description>

      <title>Balanced Truncation of Linear Systems with Quadratic Outputs in Limited Time and Frequency Intervals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model order reduction involves constructing a reduced-order approximation of a high-order model while retaining its essential characteristics. This reduced-order model serves as a substitute for the original one in various applications such as simulation, analysis, and design. Often, there's a need to maintain high accuracy within a specific time or frequency interval, while errors beyond this limit can be tolerated. This paper addresses time-limited and frequency-limited model order reduction scenarios for linear systems with quadratic outputs, by generalizing the recently introduced structure-preserving balanced truncation algorithm. To that end, limited interval system Gramians are defined, and the corresponding generalized Lyapunov equations governing their computation are derived. Additionally, low-rank solutions for these equations are investigated. Next, balanced truncation algorithms are proposed for time-limited and frequency-limited scenarios, each utilizing its corresponding limited-interval system Gramians. The proposed algorithms ensure accurate results within specified time and frequency intervals while preserving the quadratic-output structure. Two benchmark numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms, showcasing their ability to achieve superior accuracy within the desired time or frequency interval.</description>

      <title>Closure Certificates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A barrier certificate, defined over the states of a dynamical system, is a real-valued function whose zero level set characterizes an inductively verifiable state invariant separating reachable states from unsafe ones. When combined with powerful decision procedures such as sum-of-squares programming (SOS) or satisfiability-modulo-theory solvers (SMT) barrier certificates enable an automated deductive verification approach to safety. The barrier certificate approach has been extended to refute omega-regular specifications by separating consecutive transitions of omega-automata in the hope of denying all accepting runs. Unsurprisingly, such tactics are bound to be conservative as refutation of recurrence properties requires reasoning about the well-foundedness of the transitive closure of the transition relation. This paper introduces the notion of closure certificates as a natural extension of barrier certificates from state invariants to transition invariants. We provide SOS and SMT based characterization for automating the search of closure certificates and demonstrate their effectiveness via a paradigmatic case study.</description>

Abstract: Precise glucose level monitoring is critical for people with diabetes to avoid serious complications. While there are several methods for continuous glucose level monitoring, research on maintenance devices is limited. To mitigate the gap, we provide a novel neural control system for continuous glucose monitoring and management that uses differential predictive control. Our approach, led by a sophisticated neural policy and differentiable modeling, constantly adjusts insulin supply in real-time, thereby improving glucose level optimization in the body. This end-to-end method maximizes efficiency, providing personalized care and improved health outcomes, as confirmed by empirical evidence.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Adaptive Safety-Critical Control with Gaussian Processes in High-Order Uncertain Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive online learning framework for systems with uncertain parameters to ensure safety-critical control in non-stationary environments. Our approach consists of two phases. The initial phase is centered on a novel sparse Gaussian process (GP) framework. We first integrate a forgetting factor to refine a variational sparse GP algorithm, thus enhancing its adaptability. Subsequently, the hyperparameters of the Gaussian model are trained with a specially compound kernel, and the Gaussian model's online inferential capability and computational efficiency are strengthened by updating a solitary inducing point derived from new samples, in conjunction with the learned hyperparameters. In the second phase, we propose a safety filter based on high-order control barrier functions (HOCBFs), synergized with the previously trained learning model. By leveraging the compound kernel from the first phase, we effectively address the inherent limitations of GPs in handling high-dimensional problems for real-time applications. The derived controller ensures a rigorous lower bound on the probability of satisfying the safety specification. Finally, the efficacy of our proposed algorithm is demonstrated through real-time obstacle avoidance experiments executed using both a simulation platform and a real-world 7-DOF robot.</description>
