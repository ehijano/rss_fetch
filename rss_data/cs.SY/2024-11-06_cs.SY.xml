      <title>Efficient assembly of bolted joints using numerical FEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several factors can cause leakages in a bolted flange connection, external loads being the most important one. External loads such as those produced by misalignment introduce an external axial load combined with a bending moment which could lead to either an excessive compression of the gasket and its subsequent crushing, and/or a separation of the flanges causing leakage failure. Several studies have been carried out to study these prejudicial effects, but no practical solutions are proposed to compensate for them. In this sense, this work presents a numerical methodology that iteratively calculates the non-uniform bolt tightening load distribution to achieve a uniform gasket stress distribution that improves the leakage performance of bolted joints subjected to external loads.</description>

      <title>Load distribution and friction torque in four-point contact slewing bearings considering manufacturing errors and ring flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a methodology for the calculation of the load distribution in four-point contact slewing bearings considering ball preload, manufacturing errors and ring flexibility. The model is built by the formulation and minimization of the potential energy of the bearing. Comparing with the rigid rings assumption, the results show that ring deformations involve lower interferences in idling conditions, and have a great effect in the load distribution, but not under external loads. Additionally, a new approach has been proposed for the calculation of the friction torque, which has lower computational cost in comparison to a previous approach by the authors, so more accurate results can be obtained due to refined calculations with no significant cost increase.</description>

      <title>Structural modeling of crossed roller wire race bearings: analytical submodel for the roller-wire-ring set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since wire bearings were patented in 1936, they have been used in applications where weight saving is a key aspect. Nevertheless, little work can be found in literature regarding their structural behaviour. In order to predict how a wire bearing reacts under load, the most feasible way is to model and analyse it via Finite Elements (FE). However, the great amount of elements needed to properly model the complex contact configuration among rollers, wires and raceways, make this approach unaffordable. In this sense, this manuscript develops an analytical submodel that represents the structural behaviour of the roller-wire-ring set, in order to include it later in a global FE model to account for ring flexibility and boundary conditions. This way, the computationally intensive FE modelling of these complex zones can be substituted by the analytical model developed in this work, and a much manageable global FE model can be used to predict the structural response of the bearing. This analytical model has demonstrated a good agreement with local FE models of the roller-wire-ring set.</description>

      <title>Synergizing Hyper-accelerated Power Optimization and Wavelength-Dependent QoT-Aware Cross-Layer Design in Next-Generation Multi-Band EONs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extension of elastic optical networks (EON) to multi-band transmission (MB-EON) shows promise in enhancing spectral efficiency, throughput, and long-term cost-effectiveness for telecom operators. However, designing MB-EON networks introduces complex challenges, notably the optimization of physical parameters like optical power and quality of transmission (QoT). Frequency-dependent characteristics of fiber, such as loss, dispersion, and nonlinear effects, alongside inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering, pose significant hurdles when extending beyond the L+C (LC) band to a continuous spectrum over 100 nm.
  In this study, we propose a span-by-span methodology for optimal power allocation, introducing two hyper-accelerated power optimization (HPO) strategies: flat launch power (FLP) and flat received power (FRP). These approaches significantly expedite network power optimization while preserving the stability of running services. Our comparative analysis of FLP and FRP models reveals that while FRP has a minimal effect on capacity (increasing less than 10 Tbps for an L+C+S (LCS) system over 100 km), it improves flatness and GSNR/OSNR metrics in the S-band by approximately 2/0 dB and 2.5/6 dB, respectively.
  A network-wide analysis across various topologies shows that the FRP technique enhances minimum GSNR, contributing to a throughput increase of 12% to 75%, depending on network scale, at a 1% bandwidth blocking rate. Lastly, our application of HPO in MB-EON for both local and global power optimization demonstrates that while both approaches offer comparable performance, global optimization is simpler and more cost-effective for large-scale networks.</description>

      <title>Optimized Cryo-CMOS Technology with VTH&lt;0.2V and Ion&gt;1.2mA/um for High-Peformance Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) scheme to develop a 28-nm cryogenic CMOS (Cryo-CMOS) technology for high-performance computing (HPC). The precise adjustment of halo implants manages to compensate the threshold voltage (VTH) shift at low temperatures. The optimized NMOS and PMOS transistors, featured by VTH&lt;0.2V, sub-threshold swing (SS)&lt;30 mV/dec, and on-state current (Ion)&gt;1.2mA/um at 77K, warrant a reliable sub-0.6V operation. Moreover, the enhanced driving strength of Cryo-CMOS inherited from a higher transconductance leads to marked improvements in elevating the ring oscillator frequency by 20%, while reducing the power consumption of the compute-intensive cryogenic IC system by 37% at 77K.</description>

      <title>Minimum Radiative Heat and Propellant Aerocapture Guidance with Attitude Kinematics Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To maximize the payload mass, an aerocapture trajectory should be flown in such a way that both the final {\Delta}V and the total heat load are minimized. For some aerocapture missions, the heating due to radiation of high temperature gases in the shock-layer is so much larger than the heat due to convection, that the latter is negligible. This paper provides analytical proof and numerical validation that radiative heat is minimized by the same trajectory that minimizes the final {\Delta}V: a single switch bang-bang trajectory, starting with full lift-up, full lift-down commands. Further, a novel guidance that plans a bang-bang trajectory with constraints in the attitude kinematics is introduced. While achieving similar performance as the current state-of-the-art, the inclusion of constraints in attitude kinematics allows for much less tuning. Finally, a lateral guidance that makes use of information on the final inclination of the predicted trajectory is introduced. Such guidance allows for very high accuracy in the inclination requirements with only two reversals, by requiring a single parameter to be tuned.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Predictive Motion Planning for Autonomous Vehicles Using a Hybrid Zonotope Constraint Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncrewed aerial systems have tightly coupled energy and motion dynamics which must be accounted for by onboard planning algorithms. This work proposes a strategy for coupled motion and energy planning using model predictive control (MPC). A reduced-order linear time-invariant model of coupled energy and motion dynamics is presented. Constrained zonotopes are used to represent state and input constraints, and hybrid zonotopes are used to represent non-convex constraints tied to a map of the environment. The structures of these constraint representations are exploited within a mixed-integer quadratic program solver tailored to MPC motion planning problems. Results apply the proposed methodology to coupled motion and energy utilization planning problems for 1) a hybrid-electric vehicle that must restrict engine usage when flying over regions with noise restrictions, and 2) an electric package delivery drone that must track waysets with both position and battery state of charge requirements. By leveraging the structure-exploiting solver, the proposed mixed-integer MPC formulations can be implemented in real time.</description>

      <title>A Unified Fault Ride Through Technique for Virtual Oscillator based Grid Forming Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid-forming technology has a crucial role in achieving the future all renewable power grid. Among different types of grid-forming controllers, Virtual Oscillator (VO) based Controllers (VOCs) are the most advanced. VOCs outperform the conventional droop-based grid-forming controllers in terms of dynamic performance and synchronization stability by adapting time-domain-based implementation. However, because of the time-domain-based implementation, the same Fault Ride-through (FRT) techniques for droop-based controllers are incompatible with VOCs. Existing literature has successfully incorporated current limiting techniques in VOCs to protect the converters during severe transient conditions. Nevertheless, some very important aspects of FRT requirements are not attended to by the existing literature on VOCs, such as maintaining synchronization with the network during a fault, minimizing power oscillation during a fault, and at the fault clearance. First, this article introduces a unique analytical approach for quantifying the underlying dynamics of VOCs during faults. Next, using the mentioned analysis and in-depth reasoning, the systematic development of a unique FRT control architecture for VOCs is presented. The proposed FRT technique has unified both current and voltage synchronization in the same architecture to work successfully under three-phase and unbalanced faults. The performance of the proposed FRT technique is thoroughly validated using simulation studies.</description>

      <title>A Traffic Prediction-Based Individualized Driver Warning System to Reduce Red Light Violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red light violation is a major cause of traffic collisions and resulting injuries and fatalities. Despite extensive prior work to reduce red light violations, they continue to be a major problem in practice, partly because existing systems suffer from the flaw of providing the same guidance to all drivers. As a result, some violations are avoided, but other drivers ignore or respond inappropriately to red light running systems, resulting in safety issues overall. We show a method of providing accurate warnings to individual drivers to avoid the broad guidance approach of most existing systems. Recognizing if a driver will run red lights is highly dependent on signal phase and timing, traffic conditions along the road, and individual driver behaviour, the proposed warning system contains three parts: a traffic prediction algorithm, an individual warning signal optimizer, and a driver warning display. The traffic prediction algorithm predicts future traffic states along the road towards the signalized intersections using the latest traffic conditions obtained through vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to compute the optimal warning signal based on predicted traffic states and driver reaction model. Finally, the optimal warning signal is shown on the display screen to advise driver on how much braking is needed to avoid running the red light. The system continuously updates the latest warning signal as the vehicle is approaching the intersection. Both numerical simulated driving scenarios and real-world road tests are used to demonstrate the proposed algorithm's performance under different conditions by comparing with previous work on red light running warning system. The results show that the system provides more effective and accurate warning signals to drivers, helping them avoid running red lights.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control of Collinear Coulomb Spacecraft Formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model predictive control scheme to stabilize desired configurations of collinear Coulomb spacecraft formations is derived in this paper. The nonlinearities of the dynamics with respect to the input make this problem difficult to solve, computationally. It is shown that the nonlinearities in the input lead to a finite horizon optimization problem which is a nonconvex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP). A convex relaxation of the nonconvex QCQP is therefore derived which can be solved quickly using a convex optimization solver. A simulation of a four spacecraft formation is provided which demonstrates why optimizing over a prediction horizon is a prudent approach to Coulomb spacecraft formation control.</description>

      <title>qGDP: Quantum Legalization and Detailed Placement for Superconducting Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are currently limited by their qubit numbers, which hampers progress towards fault-tolerant quantum computing. A major challenge in scaling these systems is crosstalk, which arises from unwanted interactions among neighboring components such as qubits and resonators. An innovative placement strategy tailored for superconducting quantum computers can systematically address crosstalk within the constraints of limited substrate areas.
  Legalization is a crucial stage in placement process, refining post-global-placement configurations to satisfy design constraints and enhance layout quality. However, existing legalizers are not supported to legalize quantum placements. We aim to address this gap with qGDP, developed to meticulously legalize quantum components by adhering to quantum spatial constraints and reducing resonator crossing to alleviate various crosstalk effects.
  Our results indicate that qGDP effectively legalizes and fine-tunes the layout, addressing the quantum-specific spatial constraints inherent in various device topologies. By evaluating diverse NISQ benchmarks. qGDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art legalization engines, delivering substantial improvements in fidelity and reducing spatial violation, with average gains of 34.4x and 16.9x, respectively.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Dynamic Neural Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent applications beyond the network edge, coupled with the need for sustainable operation, are driving the seamless integration of deep learning (DL) algorithms into energy-limited, and even energy-harvesting end-devices. However, the stochastic nature of ambient energy sources often results in insufficient harvesting rates, failing to meet the energy requirements for inference and causing significant performance degradation in energy-agnostic systems. To address this problem, we consider an on-device adaptive inference system equipped with an energy-harvester and finite-capacity energy storage. We then allow the device to reduce the run-time execution cost on-demand, by either switching between differently-sized neural networks, referred to as multi-model selection (MMS), or by enabling earlier predictions at intermediate layers, called early exiting (EE). The model to be employed, or the exit point is then dynamically chosen based on the energy storage and harvesting process states. We also study the efficacy of integrating the prediction confidence into the decision-making process. We derive a principled policy with theoretical guarantees for confidence-aware and -agnostic controllers. Moreover, in multi-exit networks, we study the advantages of taking decisions incrementally, exit-by-exit, by designing a lightweight reinforcement learning-based controller. Experimental results show that, as the rate of the ambient energy increases, energy- and confidence-aware control schemes show approximately 5% improvement in accuracy compared to their energy-aware confidence-agnostic counterparts. Incremental approaches achieve even higher accuracy, particularly when the energy storage capacity is limited relative to the energy consumption of the inference model.</description>

      <title>Tunable Sub-THz and THz lasing effect using FETs at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I report on the first observed self-amplification by stimulated emission of 0.2THz and 1.63THz radiation using InGaAs/GaAs HEMT operating in the deep saturation regime at room temperature. I demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that the Sub-THz and THz FETs response is due to rectification of the nonlinear dependence of the device current-voltage characteristics. FETs do operate as a nonlinear THz mixers and rectifiers and its open-drain responsivity is given by a similar expression to that of zero-bias Schottky diode detector. However, operating FETs deep in the saturation regime does allow the accurate tuning of the device to the resonance condition or the negative resistance mode at room temperature, hence FETs can be tuned in the deep saturation regime to enable sub-THz and THz lasing effect. This observed sub-THz and THz laser phenomena using FETs will revolutionize human technology in all fields of life in the near future.</description>

Abstract: The straintronic magnetic tunnel junction (s-MTJ) is an MTJ whose resistance state can be changed continuously or gradually from high to low with a gate voltage that generates strain the magnetostrictive soft layer. This unusual feature, not usually available in MTJs that are switched abruptly with spin transfer torque, spin-orbit torque or voltage-controlled-magnetic-anisotropy, enables many analog applications where the typically low tunneling magneto-resistance ratio of MTJs (on/off ratio of the switch) and the relatively large switching error rate are not serious impediments unlike in digital logic or memory. More importantly, the transfer characteristic of a s-MTJ (conductance versus gate voltage) always sports a linear region that can be exploited to implement analog arithmetic, vector matrix multiplication and linear synapses in deep learning networks very effectively. In these applications, the s-MTJ is actually superior to the better known memristors and domain wall synapses which do not exhibit the linearity and/or the analog behavior.</description>

      <title>Layer-Adaptive State Pruning for Deep State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the lack of state dimension optimization methods, deep state space models (SSMs) have sacrificed model capacity, training search space, or stability to alleviate computational costs caused by high state dimensions. In this work, we provide a structured pruning method for SSMs, Layer-Adaptive STate pruning (LAST), which reduces the state dimension of each layer in minimizing model-level energy loss by extending modal truncation for a single system. LAST scores are evaluated using $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ norms of subsystems for each state and layer-wise energy normalization. The scores serve as global pruning criteria, enabling cross-layer comparison of states and layer-adaptive pruning. Across various sequence benchmarks, LAST optimizes previous SSMs, revealing the redundancy and compressibility of their state spaces. Notably, we demonstrate that, on average, pruning 33% of states still maintains performance with 0.52% accuracy loss in multi-input multi-output SSMs without retraining.

      <title>Nature's All-in-One: Multitasking Robots Inspired by Dung Beetles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dung beetles impressively coordinate their six legs simultaneously to effectively roll large dung balls. They are also capable of rolling dung balls varying in the weight on different terrains. The mechanisms underlying how their motor commands are adapted to walk and simultaneously roll balls (multitasking behavior) under different conditions remain unknown. Therefore, this study unravels the mechanisms of how dung beetles roll dung balls and adapt their leg movements to stably roll balls over different terrains for multitasking robots. We synthesize a modular neural-based loco-manipulation control inspired by and based on ethological observations of the ball-rolling behavior of dung beetles. The proposed neural-based control contains various neural modules, including a central pattern generator (CPG) module, a pattern formation network (PFN) module, and a robot orientation control (ROC) module. The integrated neural control mechanisms can successfully control a dung beetle-like robot (ALPHA) with biomechanical feet to perform adaptive robust (multitasking) loco-manipulation (walking and ball-rolling) on various terrains (flat and uneven). It can also deal with different ball weights (2.0 and 4.6 kg) and ball types (soft and rigid). The control mechanisms can serve as guiding principles for solving complex sensory-motor coordination for multitasking robots. Furthermore, this study contributes to biological research by enhancing our scientific understanding of sensory-motor coordination for complex adaptive (multitasking) loco-manipulation behavior in animals.</description>

      <title>Embedding Safety into RL: A New Take on Trust Region Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are able to solve a wide variety of tasks but are prone to producing unsafe behaviors. Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) provide a popular framework for incorporating safety constraints. However, common solution methods often compromise reward maximization by being overly conservative or allow unsafe behavior during training. We propose Constrained Trust Region Policy Optimization (C-TRPO), a novel approach that modifies the geometry of the policy space based on the safety constraints and yields trust regions composed exclusively of safe policies, ensuring constraint satisfaction throughout training. We theoretically study the convergence and update properties of C-TRPO and highlight connections to TRPO, Natural Policy Gradient (NPG), and Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO). Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that C-TRPO significantly reduces constraint violations while achieving competitive reward maximization compared to state-of-the-art CMDP algorithms.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Fault-Tolerant Control for Fixed-Wing UAVs Using Knowledge Distillation and In-Context Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a transformer-based approach for fault-tolerant control in fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), designed to adapt in real time to dynamic changes caused by structural damage or actuator failures. Unlike traditional Flight Control Systems (FCSs) that rely on classical control theory and struggle under severe alterations in dynamics, our method directly maps outer-loop reference values -- altitude, heading, and airspeed -- into control commands using the in-context learning and attention mechanisms of transformers, thus bypassing inner-loop controllers and fault-detection layers. Employing a teacher-student knowledge distillation framework, the proposed approach trains a student agent with partial observations by transferring knowledge from a privileged expert agent with full observability, enabling robust performance across diverse failure scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our transformer-based controller outperforms industry-standard FCS and state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods, maintaining high tracking accuracy and stability in nominal conditions and extreme failure cases, highlighting its potential for enhancing UAV operational safety and reliability.</description>

Abstract: The potential use of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare robotics can help address the significant demand put on healthcare systems around the world with respect to an aging demographic and a shortage of healthcare professionals. Even though LLMs have already been integrated into medicine to assist both clinicians and patients, the integration of LLMs within healthcare robots has not yet been explored for clinical settings. In this perspective paper, we investigate the groundbreaking developments in robotics and LLMs to uniquely identify the needed system requirements for designing health specific LLM based robots in terms of multi modal communication through human robot interactions (HRIs), semantic reasoning, and task planning. Furthermore, we discuss the ethical issues, open challenges, and potential future research directions for this emerging innovative field.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Sampling Based Stochastic MPC for Skid-Steer Mobile Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to motion modeling for skid-steer robots struggle with capturing nonlinear tire-terrain dynamics, especially during high-speed maneuvers. In this paper, we tackle such nonlinearities by enhancing a dynamic unicycle model with Gaussian Process (GP) regression outputs. This enables us to develop an adaptive, uncertainty-informed navigation formulation. We solve the resultant stochastic optimal control problem using a chance-constrained Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control method. This approach formulates both obstacle avoidance and path-following as chance constraints, accounting for residual uncertainties from the GP to ensure safety and reliability in control. Leveraging GPU acceleration, we efficiently manage the non-convex nature of the problem, ensuring real-time performance. Our approach unifies path-following and obstacle avoidance across different terrains, unlike prior works which typically focus on one or the other. We compare our GP-MPPI method against unicycle and data-driven kinematic models within the MPPI framework. In simulations, our approach shows superior tracking accuracy and obstacle avoidance. We further validate our approach through hardware experiments on a skid-steer robot platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in high-speed navigation. The GPU implementation of the proposed method and supplementary video footage are available at https: //stochasticmppi.github.io.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.17074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental lemma by Jan C. Willems and co-authors enables the representation of all input-output trajectories of a linear time-invariant system by measured input-output data. This result has proven to be pivotal for data-driven control. Building on a stochastic variant of the fundamental lemma, this paper presents a data-driven output-feedback predictive control scheme for stochastic Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. The considered LTI systems are subject to non-Gaussian disturbances about which only information about their first two moments is known. Leveraging polynomial chaos expansions, the proposed scheme is centered around a data-driven stochastic Optimal Control Problem (OCP). Through tailored online design of initial conditions, we provide sufficient conditions for the recursive feasibility of the proposed output-feedback scheme based on a data-driven design of the terminal ingredients of the OCP. Furthermore, we provide a robustness analysis of the closed-loop performance. A numerical example illustrates the efficacy of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01945v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision-making in multi-player games can be extremely challenging, particularly under uncertainty. In this work, we propose a new sample-based approximation to a class of stochastic, general-sum, pure Nash games, where each player has an expected-value objective and a set of chance constraints. This new approximation scheme inherits the accuracy of objective approximation from the established sample average approximation (SAA) method and enjoys a feasibility guarantee derived from the scenario optimization literature. We characterize the sample complexity of this new game-theoretic approximation scheme, and observe that high accuracy usually requires a large number of samples, which results in a large number of sampled constraints. To accommodate this, we decompose the approximated game into a set of smaller games with few constraints for each sampled scenario, and propose a decentralized, consensus-based ADMM algorithm to efficiently compute a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) of the approximated game. We prove the convergence of our algorithm to a GNE and empirically demonstrate superior performance relative to a recent baseline algorithm based on ADMM and interior point method.</description>

      <title>Wireless Edge Content Broadcast via Integrated Terrestrial and Non-terrestrial Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial networks (NTN) have emerged as a transformative solution to bridge the digital divide and deliver essential services to remote and underserved areas. In this context, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations offer remarkable potential for efficient cache content broadcast in remote regions, thereby extending the reach of digital services. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN. Despite wide coverage, the varying NTN transmission capabilities must be carefully aligned with each content placement to maximize broadcast efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content placement using NTN, positioning NTN as a complement to TN for achieving optimal content broadcasting. Specifically, we dynamically select content for placement via NTN links. This selection is based on popularity and suitability for delivery through NTN, while considering the orbital motion of LEO satellites. Our system-level case studies, based on a practical LEO constellation, demonstrate the significant improvement in placement speed compared to existing methods, which neglect network mobility. We also demonstrate that NTN links significantly outperform standalone wireless TN solutions, particularly in the early stages of content delivery. This advantage is amplified when there is a higher correlation of content popularity across geographical regions.</description>

      <title>Learning Algorithms for Verification of Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general framework for applying learning algorithms and heuristical guidance to the verification of Markov decision processes (MDPs). The primary goal of our techniques is to improve performance by avoiding an exhaustive exploration of the state space, instead focussing on particularly relevant areas of the system, guided by heuristics. Our work builds on the previous results of Br{\'{a}}zdil et al., significantly extending it as well as refining several details and fixing errors.
  The presented framework focuses on probabilistic reachability, which is a core problem in verification, and is instantiated in two distinct scenarios. The first assumes that full knowledge of the MDP is available, in particular precise transition probabilities. It performs a heuristic-driven partial exploration of the model, yielding precise lower and upper bounds on the required probability. The second tackles the case where we may only sample the MDP without knowing the exact transition dynamics. Here, we obtain probabilistic guarantees, again in terms of both the lower and upper bounds, which provides efficient stopping criteria for the approximation. In particular, the latter is an extension of statistical model-checking (SMC) for unbounded properties in MDPs. In contrast to other related approaches, we do not restrict our attention to time-bounded (finite-horizon) or discounted properties, nor assume any particular structural properties of the MDP.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Boundary Control of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky Equation Under Intermittent Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study in this paper boundary stabilization, in the L2 sense, of the perturbed Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation subject to intermittent sensing. We assume that we measure the state on a given spatial subdomain during certain time intervals, while we measure the state on the remaining spatial subdomain during the remaining time intervals. We assign a feedback law at the boundary of the spatial domain and force to zero the value of the state at the junction of the two subdomains. Throughout the study, the equation's destabilizing coefficient is assumed to be unknown and possibly space dependent but bounded. As a result, adaptive boundary controllers are designed under different assumptions on the perturbation. In particular, we guarantee input-to-state stability (ISS) when an upperbound on the perturbation's size is known. Otherwise, only global uniform ultimate boundedness (GUUB) is guaranteed. In contrast, when the state is measured at every spatial point all the time (full state measurement), convergence to an arbitrarily-small neighborhood of the origin is guaranteed, even if the perturbation's maximal size is unknown. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Maximum Likelihood Identification of Linear Models with Integrating Disturbances for Offset-Free Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the identification of models for offset-free model predictive control (MPC), where LTI models are augmented with (fictitious) uncontrollable integrating modes, called integrating disturbances. The states and disturbances are typically estimated with a Kalman filter. The disturbance estimates effectively provide integral control, so the quality of the disturbance model (and resulting filter) directly influences the control performance. We implement eigenvalue constraints to protect against undesirable filter behavior (unstable or marginally stable modes, high-frequency oscillations). Specifically, we consider the class of linear matrix inequality (LMI) regions for eigenvalue constraints. These LMI regions are open sets by default, so we introduce a barrier function method to create tightened, but closed, eigenvalue constraints. To solve the resulting nonlinear semidefinite program, we approximate it as a nonlinear program using a Cholesky factorization method that exploits known sparsity structures of semidefinite optimization variables and matrix inequalities. The algorithm is applied to real-world data taken from two physical systems: first, a low-cost benchmark temperature microcontroller suitable for classroom laboratories, and second, an industrial-scale chemical reactor at Eastman Chemical's plant in Kingsport, TN.</description>

      <title>Rationalising data collection for supporting decision making in building energy systems using Value of Information analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of data collection to support decision making through the reduction of uncertainty is ubiquitous in the management, operation, and design of building energy systems. However, no existing studies in the building energy systems literature have quantified the economic benefits of data collection strategies to determine whether they are worth their cost. This work demonstrates that Value of Information analysis (VoI), a Bayesian Decision Analysis framework, provides a suitable methodology for quantifying the benefits of data collection. Three example decision problems in building energy systems are studied: air-source heat pump maintenance scheduling, ventilation scheduling for indoor air quality, and ground-source heat pump system design. Smart meters, occupancy monitoring systems, and ground thermal tests are shown to be economically beneficial for supporting these decisions respectively. It is proposed that further study of VoI in building energy systems would allow expenditure on data collection to be economised and prioritised, avoiding wastage.</description>

      <title>Quantum optimization for Nonlinear Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a general and flexible control approach, used in many industrial contexts, and is based on the online solution of a nonlinear optimization problem. This operation requires in general a high computational cost, which may compromise the NMPC implementation in ``fast'' applications, especially if a large number variables is involved. To overcome this issue, we propose a quantum computing approach for the solution of the NMPC optimization problem. Assuming the availability of an efficient quantum computer, the approach has the potential to considerably decrease the computational time and/or enhance the solution quality compared to classical algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Multiphysics Analysis and Investigation of Soft Magnetics Effect on IPMSM: Case Study Dynamometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (IPMSMs) are taken into attention in the industry owing to their advantages. Moreover, in many cases, performing static tests is not enough, and investigating electric machines under dynamic conditions is necessary. Accordingly, by employing a dynamometer system, the dynamic behavior of the electric machine under test is investigated. Among the dynamometers, the best is the Alternating (AC) dynamometer because the basic dynamometers cannot take loads with high complexity. So, in the following study, two IPMSM with V-type and Delta-type rotor configurations are designed and suggested to employ in AC dynamometer. Any non-ideality in the electric machines of AC dynamometers, electrically and mechanically, causes errors in the measurement of the motor under test. Electrically and mechanically, the behavior of a system significantly depends on the used soft magnetics besides its physical and magnetic configuration. Accordingly, by performing a Multiphysics analysis and using the FEM tool to change the soft magnetics in the rotor and stator core, comparing the electric motors' behavior in the AC dynamometer is investigated under the same operating conditions electrically and mechanically. Finally, which soft magnetics is more satisfactory for the AC dynamometer can be seen.</description>

      <title>Degradation-Infused Energy Portfolio Allocation Framework: Risk-Averse Fair Storage Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel degradation-infused energy portfolio allocation (DI-EPA) framework for enabling the participation of battery energy storage systems in multi-service electricity markets. The proposed framework attempts to address the challenge of including the rainflow algorithm for cycle counting by directly developing a closed-form of marginal degradation as a function of dispatch decisions. Further, this closed-form degradation profile is embedded into an energy portfolio allocation (EPA) problem designed for making the optimal dispatch decisions for all the batteries together, in a shared economy manner. We term the entity taking these decisions as `facilitator' which works as a link between storage units and market operators. The proposed EPA formulation is quipped with a conditional-value-at-risk (CVaR)-based mechanism to bring risk-averseness against uncertainty in market prices. The proposed DI-EPA problem introduces fairness by dividing the profits into various units using the idea of marginal contribution. Simulation results regarding the accuracy of the closed-form of degradation, effectiveness of CVaR in handling uncertainty within the EPA problem, and fairness in the context of degradation awareness are discussed. Numerical results indicate that the DI-EPA framework improves the net profit of the storage units by considering the effect of degradation in optimal market participation.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Decoupled Information Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information metasurface is a type of metasurface device capable of rapidly altering its EM characteristics to generate specific information. Past research presents various strategies for embedding information into ambient EM waves through the superposition of each unit's quantified properties. Despite their capabilities, these approaches alone are insufficient for independently managing the creation of information and the allocation of spatial energy. Here, we propose a general theory of space-time decoupled metasurface (STD-Metasurface) to obtain the completely independent manipulation of information generating and spatial filtering. As proof-of-concept demonstration, we design a single-diode small-signal-modulation based prototype, capable of generating precise arbitrary waveforms while maintaining unaltered beam patterns. We exhibit how the superiority of the STD-Metasurface enhance its practicality and facilitate its application as a reconfigurable backscatter transmitter and an dynamic Doppler-spoofing reflection tag.</description>

      <title>Learning Lyapunov-Stable Polynomial Dynamical Systems through Imitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20605v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning is a paradigm to address complex motion planning problems by learning a policy to imitate an expert's behavior. However, relying solely on the expert's data might lead to unsafe actions when the robot deviates from the demonstrated trajectories. Stability guarantees have previously been provided utilizing nonlinear dynamical systems, acting as high-level motion planners, in conjunction with the Lyapunov stability theorem. Yet, these methods are prone to inaccurate policies, high computational cost, sample inefficiency, or quasi stability when replicating complex and highly nonlinear trajectories. To mitigate this problem, we present an approach for learning a globally stable nonlinear dynamical system as a motion planning policy. We model the nonlinear dynamical system as a parametric polynomial and learn the polynomial's coefficients jointly with a Lyapunov candidate. To showcase its success, we compare our method against the state of the art in simulation and conduct real-world experiments with the Kinova Gen3 Lite manipulator arm. Our experiments demonstrate the sample efficiency and reproduction accuracy of our method for various expert trajectories, while remaining stable in the face of perturbations.</description>

      <title>Excluding the Irrelevant: Focusing Reinforcement Learning through Continuous Action Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous action spaces in reinforcement learning (RL) are commonly defined as multidimensional intervals. While intervals usually reflect the action boundaries for tasks well, they can be challenging for learning because the typically large global action space leads to frequent exploration of irrelevant actions. Yet, little task knowledge can be sufficient to identify significantly smaller state-specific sets of relevant actions. Focusing learning on these relevant actions can significantly improve training efficiency and effectiveness. In this paper, we propose to focus learning on the set of relevant actions and introduce three continuous action masking methods for exactly mapping the action space to the state-dependent set of relevant actions. Thus, our methods ensure that only relevant actions are executed, enhancing the predictability of the RL agent and enabling its use in safety-critical applications. We further derive the implications of the proposed methods on the policy gradient. Using proximal policy optimization (PPO), we evaluate our methods on four control tasks, where the relevant action set is computed based on the system dynamics and a relevant state set. Our experiments show that the three action masking methods achieve higher final rewards and converge faster than the baseline without action masking.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven approach for sustainable extraction of earth's subsurface renewable energy while minimizing seismic activity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Geothermal Energy, Carbon Capture and Storage, and Hydrogen Storage hold considerable promise for meeting the energy sector's large-scale requirements and reducing CO$_2$ emissions. However, the injection of fluids into the Earth's crust, essential for these activities, can induce or trigger earthquakes. In this paper, we highlight a new approach based on Reinforcement Learning for the control of human-induced seismicity in the highly complex environment of an underground reservoir. This complex system poses significant challenges in the control design due to parameter uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics. We show that the reinforcement learning algorithm can interact efficiently with a robust controller, by choosing the controller parameters in real-time, reducing human-induced seismicity and allowing the consideration of further production objectives, \textit{e.g.}, minimal control power. Simulations are presented for a simplified underground reservoir under various energy demand scenarios, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed control-reinforcement learning approach.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Decentralized Actor-Critic Algorithm in General-sum Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov games provide a powerful framework for modeling strategic multi-agent interactions in dynamic environments. Traditionally, convergence properties of decentralized learning algorithms in these settings have been established only for special cases, such as Markov zero-sum and potential games, which do not fully capture real-world interactions. In this paper, we address this gap by studying the asymptotic properties of learning algorithms in general-sum Markov games. In particular, we focus on a decentralized algorithm where each agent adopts an actor-critic learning dynamic with asynchronous step sizes. This decentralized approach enables agents to operate independently, without requiring knowledge of others' strategies or payoffs. We introduce the concept of a Markov Near-Potential Function (MNPF) and demonstrate that it serves as an approximate Lyapunov function for the policy updates in the decentralized learning dynamics, which allows us to characterize the convergent set of strategies. We further strengthen our result under specific regularity conditions and with finite Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Mobility System with Integrated Motion Planning and Control Utilizing Infrastructure Sensor Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for an indoor autonomous mobility system that can perform patient transfers and materials handling. Unlike traditional systems that rely on onboard perception sensors, the proposed approach leverages a global perception and localization (PL) through Infrastructure Sensor Nodes (ISNs) and cloud computing technology. Using the global PL, an integrated Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based local planning and tracking controller augmented with Artificial Potential Field (APF) is developed, enabling reliable and efficient motion planning and obstacle avoidance ability while tracking predefined reference motions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC controller in smoothly navigating around both static and dynamic obstacles. The proposed system has the potential to extend to intelligent connected autonomous vehicles, such as electric or cargo transport vehicles with four-wheel independent drive/steering (4WID-4WIS) configurations.</description>
