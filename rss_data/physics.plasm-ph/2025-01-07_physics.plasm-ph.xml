      <title>Geometric curvature effect on suppressing the Ion-Temperature-Gradient mode near the magnetic axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global gyrokinetic simulation of the ion temperature gradient mode shows that the radial electric field ($E_r$) well upshifts the critical temperature gradient near the magnetic axis, in the weak but not in the strong magnetic shear configuration. The geometric curvature effect significantly influences the $E \times B$ shear and the wave number near the axis, so that the $E_r$ well suppresses the high-n modes but has little effect on the low-n modes, which are suppressed by the weak magnetic shear effect. This new finding unravels the formation mechanism of the internal transport barrier in the weak central magnetic shear discharges.</description>

      <title>Model expressions for refractive indices of electron waves in cold magnetoactive plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the undoubted importance of having fairly simple analytical expressions for the refractive indices of wave modes in a magnetoactive plasma, such expressions are known only in some particular cases. For electron waves with frequencies much higher than the lower hybrid resonance frequency, such an expression is known only for whistler waves in a dense plasma when the electron plasma frequency significantly exceeds the electron cyclotron frequency. In this Letter, we propose simple operational expressions for the refractive indices of all four electron modes in a magnetoactive plasma, namely, the fast magnetosonic, also called whistler mode, the slow extraordinary mode, the ordinary mode, and the fast extraordinary mode. The form of these expressions does not depend on the value of the ratio of plasma frequency to cyclotron frequency.</description>

      <title>Differentiating the acceleration mechanisms in the slow and Alfv\'enic slow solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the corona, plasma is accelerated to hundreds of kilometers per second, and heated to temperatures hundreds of times hotter than the Sun's surface, before it escapes to form the solar wind. Decades of space-based experiments have shown that the energization process does not stop after it escapes. Instead, the solar wind continues to accelerate and it cools far more slowly than a freely-expanding adiabatic gas. Recent work suggests that fast solar wind requires additional momentum beyond what can be provided by the observed thermal pressure gradients alone whereas it is sufficient for the slowest wind. The additional acceleration for fast wind can be provided through an Alfv\'en wave pressure gradient. Beyond this fast-slow categorization, however, a subset of slow solar wind exhibits high Alfv\'enicity that suggest Alfv\'en waves could play a larger role in its acceleration compared to conventional slow wind outflows. Through a well-timed conjunction between Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe, we trace the energetics of slow wind to compare with a neighboring Alfv\'enic slow solar wind stream. An analysis that integrates remote and heliospheric properties and modeling of the two distinct solar wind streams finds Alfv\'enic slow solar wind behaves like fast wind, where a wave pressure gradient is required to reconcile its full acceleration, while non-Alfv\'enic slow wind can be driven by its non-adiabatic electron and proton thermal pressure gradients. Derived coronal conditions of the source region indicate good model compatibility but extended coronal observations are required to effectively trace solar wind energetics below Parker's orbit.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Single-Shot Supercontinuum-Enhanced Terahertz Spectroscopy (SETS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-shot terahertz (THz) spectroscopy probes sub-picosecond, non-repetitive events by combining the advantages of laser absorption techniques with the phase-sensitive detection of interferometric methods. However, its usage as a quantitative tool is hindered by the chirp penalty of the spectral encoding scheme, where a narrow probe bandwidth distorts the THz signal, limiting the bandwidth and spectral resolution of THz measurements. In this work, we introduce Supercontinuum-Enhanced Terahertz Spectroscopy (SETS), a method that leverages a broadband supercontinuum probe to overcome these challenges. With SETS, we show an increase in usable THz bandwidth from 1.5 THz to 2.3 THz, reducing signal distortion by 50% and offering a scalable pathway to extend bandwidth further. Numerical models of spectral encoding highlight the flexibility of SETS, achieving high spectral resolution (&lt; 4 GHz with a 250 ps supercontinuum pulse) while maintaining a usable bandwidth &gt; 1 THz for amplitude and phase spectra. Experiments on argon plasma and water vapor, complemented by theoretical validation, generalization, and extrapolation, show the capability of SETS to measure electron density, collision frequency, and absorption spectra simultaneously with tailored measurement accuracy and resolution (as low as 5x10^15 m^-3 for electron density). By addressing a critical limitation in single-shot diagnostics, SETS enables high-resolution, non-intrusive, quantitative measurements for complex reactive flows and dynamic refractive media.</description>

      <title>Analyses of features of magnetic cycles at different amounts of dynamo supercriticality: Solar dynamo is about two times critical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of a large-scale magnetic field in the Sun and stars is usually possible when the dynamo number (D) is above a critical value Dc. As the star ages, its rotation rate and thus D decrease. Hence, the question is how far the solar dynamo is from the critical dynamo transition. To answer this question, we have performed a set of simulations using Babcock-Leighton type dynamo models at different values of dynamo supercriticality and analyzed various features of magnetic cycle. By comparing the recovery rates of the dynamo from the Maunder minimum and statistics (numbers and durations) of the grand minima and maxima with that of observations and we show that the solar dynamo is only about two times critical and thus not highly supercritical. The observed correlation between the polar field proxy and the following cycle amplitudes and Gnevyshev-Ohl rule are also compatible with this conclusion.</description>

      <title>Lorentz force mediation of turbulent dynamo transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the strength of the Lorentz force alters stellar convection zone dynamics in a suite of buoyancy-dominated, three-dimensional, spherical shell convective dynamo models. This is done by varying only the magnetic Prandtl number, $Pm$, the non-dimensional form of the fluid's electrical conductivity $\sigma$. Because the strength of the dynamo magnetic field and the Lorentz force scale with $Pm$, it is found that the fluid motions, the pattern of convective heat transfer, and the mode of dynamo generation all differ across the $0.25 \leq Pm \leq 10$ range investigated here. For example, we show that strong magnetohydrodynamic effects cause a fundamental change in the surface zonal flows: differential rotation switches from solar-like (prograde equatorial zonal flow) for larger electrical conductivities to an anti-solar differential rotation (retrograde equatorial zonal flow) at lower electrical conductivities. This study shows that the value of the bulk electrical conductivity is important not only for sustaining dynamo action, but can also drive first-order changes in the characteristics of the magnetic, velocity, and temperature fields. It is also associated with the relative strength of the Lorentz force in the system as measured by the local magnetic Rossby number, $Ro_\ell^M$, which we show is crucial in setting the characteristics of the large-scale convection regime that generates those dynamo fields.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Chapman's Hydrostatic Solar Wind Mechanism in Parker's Hydrodynamic Solar Wind Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global role of Chapman's hydrostatic solar wind mechanism in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model is investigated by using the de Laval nozzle analogy (Clauser, Parker) for the latter model. The action of solar gravity in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model is shown to be geometrically equivalent to a renormalization of the wind channel area, which is described precisely by Chapman's hydrostatic density profile. So, Chapman's hydrostatic solar wind mechanism appears to continue to be operative, on a global level (not just locally near the coronal base), in Parker's hydrodynamic solar wind model, the effects of solar gravity in Parker's hydrodynamic model being essentially encapsulated by Chapman's hydrostatic model. This result is shown to be robust by considering both isothermal gas and polytropic gas models for the solar wind.</description>

      <title>High performance beam transport with multi-stage acceleration system and its application to plasma potential measurement in fusion plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In accelerators, ion beams are often accelerated using electrostatic accelerating tubes. This paper reports on a method to improve the beam transport efficiency without adding new components to the beam transport system. High beam currents often suffer from a beam loss in a transport line. When Au negative ion beams are injected into a tandem accelerator, numerical simulations of low-energy ion beam transport have found that the beam loss increases significantly when the Au or Cu negative ion beam current exceeds 100 ${\mu}$A due to space-charge effects. We found that the transport efficiency is significantly improved by remaining constant beam energy accelerated at the multi-stage accelerator tube and by providing an electrostatic lens effect. In the heavy ion beam probe system (HIBP) system of the Large Helical Device (LHD) for plasma potential measurement, the negative ion beam current injected into the tandem accelerator could be increased by a factor of 3.6. As a result, the output of Au$^+$ beam current at the tandem accelerator used to measure the LHD plasma potential was increased from about 3 ${\mu}$A to 12$ {\mu}$A and it was demonstrated that the average electron density in the plasma could be measured up to $1.75\times10^{19}m^{-3}$. This method is effective and widely applicable to improve the performance of low-energy heavy-ion beam transport systems output from the first stage of tandem accelerators and ion sources by adding a lens effect to the multi-stage accelerator tubes.</description>

      <title>Hyperballistic transport in dense systems of charged particles under ac electric fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Langevin equation is ubiquitously employed to numerically simulate plasmas, colloids and electrolytes. However, the usual assumption of white noise becomes untenable when the system is subject to an external AC electric field. This is because the charged particles in the system, which provide the thermal bath for the particle transport, become themselves responsive to the AC field and the thermal noise is field-dependent and non-Markovian. We theoretically study the particle diffusivity in a Langevin transport model for a tagged charged particle immersed in a dense system of charged particles (plus also, possibly, other neutral particles) that act as the thermal bath, under an external AC electric field. This is done by properly accounting for the effects of the AC field on the thermal bath statistics. We analytically derive the time-dependent generalized diffusivity $D(t)$ for different initial conditions. The generalized diffusivity exhibits damped oscillatory-like behaviour with initial very large peaks, where the generalized diffusion coefficient is enhanced by orders of magnitude with respect to the infinite-time steady-state value. The latter coincides with the Stokes-Einstein diffusivity in the absence of external field. For initial conditions where the external field is already on at $t=0$ and the system is thermalized under DC conditions for $t \leq 0$, the short-time behaviour is hyperballistic, $MSD \sim t^4$ (where MSD is the mean-squared displacement), leading to giant enhancement of the particle transport. Finally, the theory elucidates the role of medium polarization on the local Lorentz field, and allows for estimates of the effective electric charge due to polarization by the surrounding charges.</description>

      <title>Producing entangled photon pairs and quantum squeezed states in plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma is capable of mediating the conversion of two pump photons into two different photons through a relativistic four-wave mixing nonlinearity. Spontaneously created photon pairs are emitted at symmetric angles with respect to the colinear pump direction, and the emission rate is largest if they have identical frequency. Thus, two orthogonally polarized pumps can produce polarization-entangled photon pairs through a mm-long homogeneous plasma. The noise from Raman scattering can be avoided if the pump detuning differs from twice the plasma frequency. On the other hand, pump detuning exactly equal to twice the plasma frequency can significantly enhance the interaction rate, which allows for the production of strong two-mode squeezed states. Remarkably, the amplified noise from Raman scattering are correlated and hence can be suppressed in one of the output quadratures, thereby maintaining the squeezing magnitude.</description>

      <title>Impact of Ion Mobility on Electron Density and Temperature in Hypersonic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of how ion mobility affects electron density and temperature in hypersonic flows. We compare two ion mobility models: one derived from Gupta-Yos cross-sections, and the other from swarm drift velocity experiments. The ion mobility model significantly alters the plasma density around a hypersonic waverider, with increases of more than twofold observed at low dynamic pressures and high Mach numbers. This is partly due to electron loss through surface catalysis, which depends on ambipolar diffusion scaling with ion mobility. We also derive novel scaling laws that highlight the strong dependence of electron cooling on ion mobility both within the quasi-neutral regions and the non-neutral plasma sheaths. Electron cooling influences the electron temperature across the plasma, leading to a previously unrecognized impact of ion mobility on plasma bulk temperature. This in turn affects plasma density via electron-ion recombination rates which are temperature-dependent. Accurately modeling ion mobility is critical for predicting hypersonic plasma behavior, with important implications for optimizing magnetohydrodynamic technologies and mitigating or exploiting plasma-induced interference with electromagnetic waves.</description>

Abstract: Atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) are versatile devices with numerous applications. This work focuses on APPJs generated at the tip of long, flexible tubes using the jet transfer technique. The plasma source consists of a primary discharge and a secondary discharge forming the plasma jet. Discharge power measurements were carried out in a way that it was possible to separate the contribution of the primary discharge from the total power dissipated by the plasma source. Both power and effective current were analyzed under different operating conditions. The results show that the variation of the primary discharge power is much lower than the power dissipated by the plasma jet. Additionally, the electrical characteristics of the plasma device were analyzed. Notable differences were observed between the negative and positive phases of the discharge, with a more resistive load in the negative one, which suggests that the electrical equivalent circuit model changes according to the voltage polarity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear simulations of neutron star mergers are complicated by the need to represent turbulent dynamics. As we cannot (yet) perform simulations that resolve accurately both the gravitational-wave scale and the smallest scales at which magneto/hydrodynamic turbulence plays a role, we need to rely on approximations. Addressing this problem in the context of large-eddy models, we outline a coherent Lagrangian filtering framework that allows us to explore the many issues that arise, linking conceptual problems to practical implementations and the interpretation of the results. We develop understanding crucial for quantifying unavoidable uncertainties in current and future numerical relativity simulations and consider the implications for neutron-star parameter estimation and constraints on the equation of state of matter under extreme conditions.</description>
