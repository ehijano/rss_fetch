      <title>From few to many maps: A fast map-level emulator for extreme augmentation of CMB systematics datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, fast, and efficient generative model built upon scattering covariances, the most recent iteration of the scattering transforms statistics. This model is designed to augment by several orders of magnitude the number of map simulations in datasets of computationally expensive CMB instrumental systematics simulations, including their non-Gaussian and inhomogeneous features. Unlike conventional neural network-based algorithms, this generative model requires only a minimal number of training samples, making it highly compatible with the computational constraints of typical CMB simulation campaigns. We validate the method using realistic simulations of CMB systematics, which are particularly challenging to emulate, and perform extensive statistical tests to confirm its ability to produce new statistically independent approximate realizations. Remarkably, even when trained on as few as 10 simulations, the emulator closely reproduces key summary statistics -- including the angular power spectrum, scattering coefficients, and Minkowski functionals -- and provides pixel-to-pixel covariance estimates with substantially reduced sample noise compared to those obtained without augmentation. The proposed approach has the potential to shift the paradigm in simulation campaign design. Instead of producing large numbers of low- or medium-accuracy simulations, future pipelines can focus on generating a few high-accuracy simulations that are then efficiently augmented using such generative model. This promises significant benefits for current and forthcoming cosmological surveys such as $Planck$, $LiteBIRD$, Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, Euclid and Rubin-LSST. We make both the general framework for scattering transform statistics available at https://github.com/jmdelouis/HealpixML and the emulator available at https://github.com/pcampeti/CMBSCAT.</description>

      <title>Probability-turbulence divergence: A tunable allotaxonometric instrument for comparing heavy-tailed categorical distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.13078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world complex systems often comprise many distinct types of elements as well as many more types of networked interactions between elements. When the relative abundances of types can be measured well, we often observe heavy-tailed categorical distributions for type frequencies. For the comparison of type frequency distributions of two systems or a system with itself at different time points in time -- a facet of allotaxonometry -- a great range of probability divergences are available. Here, we introduce and explore `probability-turbulence divergence', a tunable, straightforward, and interpretable instrument for comparing normalizable categorical frequency distributions. We model probability-turbulence divergence (PTD) after rank-turbulence divergence (RTD). While probability-turbulence divergence is more limited in application than rank-turbulence divergence, it is more sensitive to changes in type frequency. We build allotaxonographs to display probability turbulence, incorporating a way to visually accommodate zero probabilities for `exclusive types' which are types that appear in only one system. We explore comparisons of example distributions taken from literature, social media, and ecology. We show how probability-turbulence divergence either explicitly or functionally generalizes many existing kinds of distances and measures, including, as special cases, $L^{(p)}$ norms, the S{\o}rensen-Dice coefficient (the $F_{1}$ statistic), and the Hellinger distance. We discuss similarities with the generalized entropies of R{\'e}nyi and Tsallis, and the diversity indices (or Hill numbers) from ecology. We close with thoughts on open problems concerning the optimization of the tuning of rank- and probability-turbulence divergence.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Full Event Interpretation: a graph neural network for event reconstruction in Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we present the Graph-based Full Event Interpretation (GraFEI), a machine learning model based on graph neural networks to inclusively reconstruct events in the Belle~II experiment. Belle~II is well suited to perform measurements of $B$ meson decays involving invisible particles (e.g. neutrinos) in the final state. The kinematical properties of such particles can be deduced from the energy-momentum imbalance obtained after reconstructing the companion $B$ meson produced in the event. This task is performed by reconstructing it either from all the particles in an event but the signal tracks, or using the Full Event Interpretation, an algorithm based on Boosted Decision Trees and limited to specific, hard-coded decay processes. A recent example involving the use of the aforementioned techniques is the search for the $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar \nu$ decay, that provided an evidence for this process at about 3 standard deviations. The GraFEI model is trained to predict the structure of the decay chain by exploiting the information from the detected final state particles only, without making use of any prior assumptions about the underlying event. By retaining only signal-like decay topologies, the model considerably reduces the amount of background while keeping a relatively high signal efficiency. The performances of the model when applied to the search for $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar \nu$ are presented.</description>
