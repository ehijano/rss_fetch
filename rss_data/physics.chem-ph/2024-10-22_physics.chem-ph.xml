      <title>Excess Density as a Descriptor for Electrolyte Solvent Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrolytes mediate interactions between the cathode and anode and determine performance characteristics of batteries. Mixtures of multiple solvents are often used in electrolytes to achieve desired properties, such as viscosity, dielectric constant, boiling point, and melting point. Conventionally, multi-component electrolyte properties are approximated with linear mixing, but in practice, significant deviations are observed. Excess quantities can provide insights into the molecular behavior of the mixture and could form the basis for designing high-performance electrolytes. Here we investigate the excess density of commonly used Li-ion battery solvents such as cyclic carbonates, linear carbonates, ethers, and nitriles with molecular dynamics simulations. We additionally investigate electrolytes consisting of these solvents and a salt. The results smoothly vary with mole percent and are fit to permutation-invariant Redlich-Kister polynomials. Mixtures of similar solvents, such as cyclic-cyclic carbonate mixtures, tend to have excess properties that are lower in magnitude compared to mixtures of dissimilar substances, such as carbonate-nitrile mixtures. We perform experimental testing using our robotic test stand, Clio, to provide validation to the observed simulation trends. We quantify the structure similarity using SOAP fingerprints to create a descriptor for excess density, enabling the design of electrolyte properties. To a first approximation, this will allow us to estimate the deviation of a mixture from ideal behavior based solely upon the structural dissimilarity of the components.</description>

      <title>REBIND: Enhancing ground-state molecular conformation via force-based graph rewiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the ground-state 3D molecular conformations from 2D molecular graphs is critical in computational chemistry due to its profound impact on molecular properties. Deep learning (DL) approaches have recently emerged as promising alternatives to computationally-heavy classical methods such as density functional theory (DFT). However, we discover that existing DL methods inadequately model inter-atomic forces, particularly for non-bonded atomic pairs, due to their naive usage of bonds and pairwise distances. Consequently, significant prediction errors occur for atoms with low degree (i.e., low coordination numbers) whose conformations are primarily influenced by non-bonded interactions. To address this, we propose REBIND, a novel framework that rewires molecular graphs by adding edges based on the Lennard-Jones potential to capture non-bonded interactions for low-degree atoms. Experimental results demonstrate that REBIND significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various molecular sizes, achieving up to a 20\% reduction in prediction error.</description>

      <title>Coarse grained modeling of a metal-organic framework/polymer composite and its gas adsorption at the nanoparticle level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations have acted as a cornerstone to understand MOF/polymer interface structure, however, no molecular-level simulation has yet been performed at the nanoparticle scale. In this work, a hybrid MARTINI/Force Matching (FM) force field was developed and successfully implemented to model the ZIF-8/PVDF composite at a coarse grained resolution. Inter-phase interactions were modeled using FM potentials, which strive to reasonably reproduce the forces from an atomistic benchmark model, while intraphase interactions are modeled using the general-purpose MARTINI potentials. Systems made of a ZIF-8 nanoparticle embedded into a PVDF matrix were considered to evaluate the effect of nanoparticle size and morphology in the polymer structure and in the CO2 adsorption. Results show that simulations at the nanoparticle level are crucial for depicting the polymer penetration. Notably, the smallest nanoparticle exhibited the least extent of polymer penetration, while the cubic nanoparticle exhibited the highest amount. Polymer conformation and local density values change similarly in all ZIF-8/PVDF systems depending on whether the polymer lies inside or outside of the nanoparticle domain. All composite models present more significant CO2 adsorption in the nanoparticle domain than in the PVDF phase, in agreement with experiments. More remarkably, the small rhombic dodecahedron ZIF-8/PVDF system presents a larger equilibrium amount of gas adsorbed at ambient condition compared to the other two systems, in alignment with the observed polymer penetration trend. On the other hand, the amount of CO2 adsorbed at equilibrium is lower for the rhombic dodecahedron morphology than for the cubic one, contrary to the intuitive expectation founded in the polymer penetration trend. This result could be a reflection of a difference in the number of surface adsorption sites.</description>

      <title>A Transformer Based Generative Chemical Language AI Model for Structural Elucidation of Organic Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For over half a century, computer-aided structural elucidation systems (CASE) for organic compounds have relied on complex expert systems with explicitly programmed algorithms. These systems are often computationally inefficient for complex compounds due to the vast chemical structural space that must be explored and filtered. In this study, we present a transformer based generative chemical language artificial intelligence (AI) model, an innovative end-to-end architecture designed to replace the logic and workflow of the classic CASE framework for ultra-fast and accurate spectroscopic-based structural elucidation. Our model employs an encoder-decoder architecture and self-attention mechanisms, similar to those in large language models, to directly generate the most probable chemical structures that match the input spectroscopic data. This approach demonstrates the potential of transformer based generative AI to accelerate traditional scientific problem-solving processes. The model's ability to iterate quickly based on new data highlights its potential for rapid advancements in structural elucidation.</description>

      <title>State Selective Preparation and Nondestructive Detection of Trapped ${\rm O}_2^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to prepare molecular ions in selected quantum states enables studies in areas such as chemistry, metrology, spectroscopy, quantum information, and precision measurements. Here, we demonstrate (2+1) resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) of oxygen, both in a molecular beam and in an ion trap. The two-photon transition in the REMPI spectrum is rotationally resolved, allowing ionization from a selected rovibrational state of ${\rm O}_2$. Fits to this spectrum determine spectroscopic parameters of the ${\rm O}_2$ $d\,^1\Pi_g$ state and resolve a discrepancy in the literature regarding its band origin. The trapped molecular ions are cooled by co-trapped atomic ions. Fluorescence mass spectrometry nondestructively demonstrates the presence of the photoionized ${\rm O}_2^+$. We discuss strategies for maximizing the fraction of ions produced in the ground rovibrational state. The combination of state-selective loading and nondestructive detection of trapped molecular ions has applications in optical clocks, tests of fundamental physics, and control of chemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic W-band Electron Spin Resonance Probehead with an Integral Cryogenic Low Noise Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest to enhance the sensitivity of electron spin resonance (ESR) is an ongoing challenge. One potential strategy involves increasing the frequency, for instance, moving from Q-band (approximately 35 GHz) to W-band (approximately 94 GHz). However, this shift typically results in higher transmission and switching losses, as well as increased noise in signal amplifiers. In this work, we address these shortcomings by employing a W-band probehead integrated with a cryogenic low-noise amplifier (LNA) and a microresonator. This configuration allows us to position the LNA close to the resonator, thereby amplifying the acquired ESR signal with minimal losses. Furthermore, when operated at cryogenic temperatures, the LNA exhibits unparalleled noise levels that are significantly lower than those of conventional room temperature LNAs. We detail the novel probehead design and provide some experimental results at room temperature as well as cryogenic temperatures for representative paramagnetic samples. We find, for example, that spin sensitivity of ~3*10^5 spins/sqrt(Hz) is achieved for a sample of phosphorus doped 28Si, even for sub-optimal sample geometry with potential improvement to &lt;10^3 spins/sqrt(Hz) in more optimal scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Association of Zn$^{2+}$-SO$_4^{2-}$ and Mg$^{2+}$-SO$_4^{2-}$ in Aqueous MgSO$_4$/ZnSO$_4$ Hybrid Electrolytes: Insights from All-Atom Molecular Dynamics Simulations Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnesium sulfate (${ \rm MgSO_4 }$) is used as an additive to reduce capacity fading in rechargeable zinc-ion batteries. This study investigates the ion pairing and solvation structure of ${ \rm Zn^{2+}-SO_4^{2-} }$ and ${ \rm Mg^{2+}-SO_4^{2-} }$ in mixtures of ${ \rm [ZnSO_4]{2M} + [MgSO_4]{0M} }$, ${ \rm [ZnSO_4]{1M} + [MgSO_4]{1M} }$, and ${ \rm [ZnSO_4]{0M} + [MgSO_4]{2M} }$. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we evaluated dipole dynamics, spatial distributions, and coordination of ions through radial distribution functions, running coordination numbers, and potentials of mean force. The results reveal that increasing ${ \rm MgSO_4 }$ concentration disrupts ${ \rm Zn^{2+} }$ self-association, while ${ \rm Mg^{2+} }$ shows enhanced association. The analysis indicates different solvation structures, with ${ \rm Zn^{2+} }$ maintaining a more ordered coordination with ${ \rm SO_4^{2-} }$ than ${ \rm Mg^{2+} }$. Preferential binding analysis highlights stronger ${ \rm Zn^{2+} }$ affinity for ${ \rm SO_4^{2-} }$, shedding light on ion interaction dynamics in mixed electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Large Deviation Theory Approach to Fluctuation Theorems and Heat Redefinition in Nonequilibrium Reaction Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze chemical reaction systems by applying large deviation theory (LDT) and demonstrate that the fluctuation theorem (FT) in nonequilibrium reaction systems can be derived based on the symmetry of the cumulant generating function (CGF) defined through the rate function. Furthermore, we redefine heat through this rate function, establishing a direct connection between heat and Shannon entropy. This redefinition allows for the evaluation of Landauer's principle, which concerns the minimum energy cost of information erasure. The results obtained highlight the effectiveness of LDT as a framework for various nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference of single-molecule experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-molecule experiments are a unique tool to characterize the structural dynamics of biomolecules. However, reconstructing molecular details from noisy single-molecule data is challenging. Simulation-based inference (SBI) integrates statistical inference, physics-based simulators, and machine learning and is emerging as a powerful framework for analysing complex experimental data. Recent advances in deep learning have accelerated the development of new SBI methods, enabling the application of Bayesian inference to an ever-increasing number of scientific problems. Here, we review the nascent application of SBI to the analysis of single-molecule experiments. We introduce parametric Bayesian inference and discuss its limitations. We then overview emerging deep-learning-based SBI methods to perform Bayesian inference for complex models encoded in computer simulators. We illustrate the first applications of SBI to single-molecule force-spectroscopy and cryo-electron microscopy experiments. SBI allows us to leverage powerful computer algorithms modeling complex biomolecular phenomena to connect scientific models and experiments in a principled way.</description>

      <title>Protein structure classification based on X-ray laser induced Coulomb explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulated the Coulomb explosion dynamics due to the fast ionization induced by high-intensity X-rays in six proteins that share similar atomic content and shape. We followed and projected the trajectory of the fragments onto a virtual detector, providing a unique explosion footprint. After collecting 500 explosion footprints for each protein, we utilized principal component analysis and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding to classify these. The results show that the classification algorithms were able to separate proteins on the basis of explosion footprints from structurally similar proteins into distinct groups. The explosion footprints, therefore, provide a unique identifier for each of the proteins. We envision that method could be used concurrently with single particle coherent imaging experiments to provide additional information on shape, mass, or conformation.</description>

      <title>Partial Orientation Retrieval of Proteins From Coulomb Explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single Particle Imaging techniques at X-ray lasers have made significant strides, yet the challenge of determining the orientation of freely rotating molecules during delivery remains. In this study, we propose a novel method to partially retrieve the relative orientation of proteins exposed to ultrafast X-ray pulses by analyzing the fragmentation patterns resulting from Coulomb explosions. We simulate these explosions for 45 proteins in the size range 100 -- 4000 atoms using a hybrid Monte Carlo/Molecular Dynamics approach and capture the resulting ion ejection patterns with virtual detectors. Our goal is to exploit information from the explosion to infer orientations of proteins at the time of X-ray exposure. Our results demonstrate that partial orientation information can be extracted, particularly for larger proteins. Our findings can be integrated into existing reconstruction algorithms such as Expand-Maximize-Compress, to improve their efficiency and reduce the need for high-quality diffraction patterns. This method offers a promising avenue for enhancing Single Particle Imaging by leveraging measurable data from the Coulomb explosion to provide valuable insights about orientation.</description>

      <title>Integer linear programming for unsupervised training set selection in molecular machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integer linear programming (ILP) is an elegant approach to solve linear optimization problems, naturally described using integer decision variables. Within the context of physics-inspired machine learning applied to chemistry, we demonstrate the relevance of an ILP formulation to select molecular training sets for predictions of size-extensive properties. We show that our algorithm outperforms existing unsupervised training set selection approaches, especially when predicting properties of molecules larger than those present in the training set. We argue that the reason for the improved performance is due to the selection that is based on the notion of local similarity (i.e., per-atom) and a unique ILP approach that finds optimal solutions efficiently. Altogether, this work provides a practical algorithm to improve the performance of physics-inspired machine learning models and offers insights into the conceptual differences with existing training set selection approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training interatomic potentials for spin-polarized systems continues to be a difficult task for the molecular modeling community. In this note, a proof-of-concept, random initial spin committee approach is proposed for obtaining the ground state of spin-polarized systems with a controllable degree of accuracy. The approach is tested on two toy models of elemental sulfur where the exact optimal spin configuration can be known. Machine-learning potentials are trained on the resulting data, and increasingly accurate fits with respect to the ground state are achieved, marking a step towards machine-learning force fields for general bulk spin-polarized systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating and investigating various dynamic aspects of $\rm{H}_2\rm{O}$-related hydrogen bond model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple $\rm{H}_2\rm{O}$-related hydrogen bond model, modified from the Jaynes-Cummings model, is proposed and its various dynamic aspects are investigated theoretically. In this model, the formation and breaking processes of hydrogen bond are accompanied by the creation and annihilation of the thermal phonon of the medium. A number of simplifying assumptions about the dynamics of the molecules involved are used. Rotating wave approximation is applied under consideration of the strong-coupling condition. Dissipative dynamics under the Markovian approximation is obtained through solving the quantum master equation - Lindbladian. The probabilities of reaction channels involving hydrogen bond depending on the parameters of the external environment, are obtained. Differences between unitary and dissipative evolutions are disciussed. Consideration is given to the effect of all kinds of potential interactions and dissipations on evolution. Consideration is also given to the reverse processes (inflows) of dissipations. The results show that the magnitude changes of the interactions and dissipations have slight effect on the formation of hydrogen bond, but the variation of the reverse processes of dissipations significantly affect the formation of hydrogen bond. According to the findings, the dynamics of $\rm{H}_2\rm{O}$-related hydrogen bond model can be controlled by selectively choosing system parameters. The results will be used as a basis to extend the research to more complex chemical and biological model in the future.</description>

Abstract: Simulating transition dynamics between metastable states is a fundamental challenge in dynamical systems and stochastic processes with wide real-world applications in understanding protein folding, chemical reactions and neural activities. However, the computational challenge often lies on sampling exponentially many paths in which only a small fraction ends in the target metastable state due to existence of high energy barriers. To amortize the cost, we propose a data-driven approach to warm-up the simulation by learning nonlinear interpolations from local dynamics. Specifically, we infer a potential energy function from local dynamics data. To find plausible paths between two metastable states, we formulate a generalized flow matching framework that learns a vector field to sample propable paths between the two marginal densities under the learned energy function. Furthermore, we iteratively refine the model by assigning importance weights to the sampled paths and buffering more likely paths for training. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method to sample probable paths on both synthetic and real-world molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing adaptive sampling via Policy Ranking</title>

Abstract: Efficient sampling in biomolecular simulations is critical for accurately capturing the complex dynamical behaviors of biological systems. Adaptive sampling techniques aim to improve efficiency by focusing computational resources on the most relevant regions of phase space. In this work, we present a framework for identifying the optimal sampling policy through metric driven ranking. Our approach systematically evaluates the policy ensemble and ranks the policies based on their ability to explore the conformational space effectively. Through a series of biomolecular simulation case studies, we demonstrate that choice of a different adaptive sampling policy at each round significantly outperforms single policy sampling, leading to faster convergence and improved sampling performance. This approach takes an ensemble of adaptive sampling policies and identifies the optimal policy for the next round based on current data. Beyond presenting this ensemble view of adaptive sampling, we also propose two sampling algorithms that approximate this ranking framework on the fly. The modularity of this framework allows incorporation of any adaptive sampling policy making it versatile and suitable as a comprehensive adaptive sampling scheme.</description>

      <title>The twisting dynamics of large lattice mismatch van der Waals heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) homo-/hetero-structures are ideal systems for studying interfacial tribological properties such as structural superlubricity. Previous studies concentrated on the mechanism of translational motion in vdW interfaces. However, detailed mechanisms and general properties of the rotational motion are barely explored. Here, we combine experiments and simulations to reveal the twisting dynamics of the MoS$_2$/graphite heterostructure. Unlike the translational friction falling into the superlubricity regime with no twist angle dependence, the dynamic rotational resistances highly depend on twist angles. Our results show that the periodic rotational resistance force originates from structural potential energy changes during the twisting. The structural potential energy of MoS$_2$/graphite heterostructure increases monotonically from0 to 30 degrees twist angles, and the estimated relative energy barrier is (1.43 +/- 0.36) x 10 J/m. The formation of Moir\'e superstructures in the graphene layer is the key to controlling the structural potential energy of the MoS$_2$/graphene heterostructure. Our results suggest that in twisting 2D heterostructures, even if the interface sliding friction is negligible, the evolving potential energy change results in a non-vanishing rotational resistance force. The structural change of the heterostructure can be an additional pathway for energy dissipation in the rotational motion, further enhancing the rotational friction force.</description>

      <title>Characterizing RNA oligomers using Stochastic Titration Constant-pH Metadynamics simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RNA molecules exhibit various biological functions intrinsically dependent on their diverse ecosystem of highly flexible structures. This flexibility arises from complex hydrogen-bonding networks defined by canonical and non-canonical base pairs that require protonation events to stabilize or perturb these interactions. Constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) methods provide a reliable framework to explore the conformational and protonation space of dynamic structures and for robust calculations of pH-dependent properties, such as the pK$_\mathrm{a}$ of titrable sites. Despite growing biological evidence concerning pH regulation of certain motifs and in biotechnological applications, pH-sensitive in silico methods have rarely been applied to nucleic acids. In this work, we extended the stochastic titration CpHMD method to include RNA parameters from the standard $\chi$OL3 AMBER force field and highlighted its capability to depict titration events of nucleotides in single-stranded RNAs. We validated the method using trimers and pentamers with a single central titrable site while integrating a well-tempered metadynamics approach into the st-CpHMD methodology (CpH-MetaD) using PLUMED. This approach enhanced the convergence of the conformational landscape and enabled more efficient sampling of protonation-conformation coupling. Our pK$_\mathrm{a}$ estimates agree with experimental data, validating the method's ability to reproduce electrostatic changes around a titrable nucleobase in single-stranded RNA. These findings provided molecular insight into intramolecular phenomena, such as nucleobase stacking and phosphate interactions, that dictate the experimentally observed pK$_\mathrm{a}$ shifts between different strands. Overall, this work validates both the st-CpHMD and the metadynamics integration as reliable tools for studying biologically relevant RNA systems.</description>

      <title>Neural Quantum Propagators for Driven-Dissipative Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Describing the dynamics of strong-laser driven open quantum systems is a very challenging task that requires the solution of highly involved equations of motion. While machine learning techniques are being applied with some success to simulate the time evolution of individual quantum states, their use to approximate time-dependent operators (that can evolve various states) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we develop driven neural quantum propagators (NQP), a universal neural network framework that solves driven-dissipative quantum dynamics by approximating propagators rather than wavefunctions or density matrices. NQP can handle arbitrary initial quantum states, adapt to various external fields, and simulate long-time dynamics, even when trained on far shorter time windows. Furthermore, by appropriately configuring the external fields, our trained NQP can be transferred to systems governed by different Hamiltonians. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by studying the spin-boson and the three-state transition Gamma models.</description>

      <title>Projective Quantum Eigensolver with Generalized Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determination of molecular energetics and properties is one of the core challenges in the near-term quantum computing. To this end, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are preferred for Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) architectures. The Projective Quantum Eigensolver (PQE) is one such algorithms that optimizes the parameters of the chemistry-inspired unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz using a conventional coupled cluster-like residual minimization. Such a strategy involves the projection of the Schrodinger equation on to linearly independent basis towards the parameter optimization, restricting the ansatz is solely defined in terms of the excitation operators. This warrants the inclusion of high-rank operators for strongly correlated systems, leading to increased utilization of quantum resources. In this manuscript, we develop a methodology for determining the generalized operators in terms of a closed form residual equations in the PQE framework that can be efficiently implemented in a quantum computer with manageable quantum resources. Such a strategy requires the removal of the underlying redundancy in high-rank excited determinants, generated due to the presence of the generalized operators in the ansatz, by projecting them on to an internally contracted lower dimensional manifold. With the application on several molecular systems, we have demonstrated our ansatz achieves similar accuracy to the (disentangled) UCC with singles, doubles and triples (SDT) ansatz, while utilizing an order of magnitude fewer quantum gates. Furthermore, when simulated under stochastic Gaussian noise or depolarizing hardware noise, our method shows significantly improved noise resilience compared to the other members of PQE family and the state-of-the-art variational quantum eigensolver.</description>

      <title>Janus graphene nanoribbons with a single ferromagnetic zigzag edge</title>

Abstract: Topological design of pi-electrons in zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) leads to a wealth of magnetic quantum phenomena and exotic quantum phases. Symmetric ZGNRs typically exhibit antiferromagnetically coupled spin-ordered edge states. Eliminating cross-edge magnetic coupling in ZGNRs not only enables the realization of a new class of ferromagnetic quantum spin chains, enabling the exploration of quantum spin physics and entanglement of multiple qubits in the 1D limit, but also establishes a long-sought carbon-based ferromagnetic transport channel, pivotal for ultimate scaling of GNR-based quantum electronics. However, designing such GNRs entails overcoming daunting challenges, including simultaneous breaking of structural and spin symmetries, and designing elegant precursors for asymmetric fabrication of reactive zigzag edges. Here, we report a general approach for designing and fabricating such ferromagnetic GNRs in the form of Janus GNRs with two distinct edge configurations. Guided by Lieb's theorem and topological classification theory, we devised two JGNRs by asymmetrically introduced a topological defect array of benzene motifs to one zigzag edge, while keeping the opposing zigzag edge unchanged. This breaks structural symmetry and creates a sublattice imbalance within each unit cell, initiating a spin symmetry breaking. Three Z-shape precursors are designed to fabricate one parent ZGNR and two JGNRs with an optimal lattice spacing of the defect array for a complete quench of the magnetic edge states at the defective edge. Characterization via scanning probe microscopy/spectroscopy and first-principles density functional theory confirms the successful fabrication of Janus GNRs with ferromagnetic ground state delocalised along the pristine zigzag edge.</description>

Abstract: A recently developed viewpoint on the fundamentals of density-functional theory for finite interacting spin-lattice systems that centers around the notion of degeneracy regions is presented. It allows for an entirely geometrical description of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and v-representability. The phenomena receive exemplification by an Anderson impurity model and other small-lattice examples. The case of adiabatic change and the time-dependent setting are examined as well.</description>

      <title>A photochemical PHO network for hydrogen-dominated exoplanet atmospheres</title>

Abstract: Due to the detection of phosphine PH3 in the Solar System gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, PH3 has long been suggested to be detectable in exosolar substellar atmospheres too. However, to date, a direct detection of phosphine has proven to be elusive in exoplanet atmosphere surveys. We construct an updated phosphorus-hydrogen-oxygen (PHO) photochemical network suitable for simulation of gas giant hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Using this network, we examine PHO photochemistry in hot Jupiter and warm Neptune exoplanet atmospheres at Solar and enriched metallicities. Our results show for HD 189733b-like hot Jupiters that HOPO, PO and P2 are typically the dominant P carriers at pressures important for transit and emission spectra, rather than PH3. For GJ1214b-like warm Neptune atmospheres our results suggest that at Solar metallicity PH3 is dominant in the absence of photochemistry, but is generally not in high abundance for all other chemical environments. At 10 and 100 times Solar, small oxygenated phosphorus molecules such as HOPO and PO dominate for both thermochemical and photochemical simulations. The network is able to reproduce well the observed PH3 abundances on Jupiter and Saturn. Despite progress in improving the accuracy of the PHO network, large portions of the reaction rate data remain with approximate, uncertain or missing values, which could change the conclusions of the current study significantly. Improving understanding of the kinetics of phosphorus-bearing chemical reactions will be a key undertaking for astronomers aiming to detect phosphine and other phosphorus species in both rocky and gaseous exoplanetary atmospheres in the near future.</description>

Abstract: Precision measurements of polyatomic molecules offer an unparalleled paradigm to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. The rich internal structure within these molecules makes them exquisite sensors for detecting fundamental symmetry violations, local position invariance, and dark matter. While trapping and control of diatomic and a few very simple polyatomic molecules have been experimentally demonstrated, leveraging the complex rovibrational structure of more general polyatomics demands the development of robust and efficient quantum control schemes. In this study, we present a general, reinforcement-learning-designed, quantum logic approach to prepare molecular ions in a single, pure quantum state. The reinforcement learning agent optimizes the pulse sequence, each followed by a projective measurement, and probabilistically manipulates the collapse of the quantum system to a single state. The performance of the control algorithm is numerically demonstrated in the case of a CaH$^+$ ion, with up to 96 thermally populated eigenstates and under the disturbance of environmental thermal radiation. We expect that the method developed, with physics-informed learning, will be directly implemented for quantum control of polyatomic molecular ions with densely populated structures, enabling new experimental tests of fundamental theories.</description>
