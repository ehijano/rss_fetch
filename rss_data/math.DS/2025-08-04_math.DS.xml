      <title>Positivity of Nearly Linearly Recurrent Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we formulate the Positivity Problem for nearly linear
  recurrent sequences. This is a generalisation of the Positivity
  Problem for linear recurrence sequences and is a special case of the
  non-reachability problem for linear time-invariant systems. Our main
  contribution is a decision procedure for the Positivity Problem for
  nearly linear recurrences of order at most 3 whose characteristic
  roots have absolute value at most one. The decision procedure
  relies on a new transcendence result for infinite series that is of
  independent interest.</description>

      <title>Nonautonomous Dynamical Systems I: Topological Pressures and Entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\boldsymbol{X}=\{X_{k}\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of compact metric spaces $X_{k}$ and $\boldsymbol{T}=\{T_{k}\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$ a sequence of continuous mappings $T_{k}:X_{k} \to X_{k+1}$. The pair $(\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{T})$ is called a nonautonomous dynamical system. Our main object is to study the variational principles of topological pressures and entropies on nonautonomous dynamical systems. In this paper, we introduce a variety of topological pressures ($\underline{Q}$,$\overline{Q}$,$\underline{P}$,$\overline{P}$,$P^{\mathrm{B}}$ and $P^{\mathrm{P}}$) for potentials $\boldsymbol{f}=\{f_{k} \in C(X_{k},\mathbb{R})\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$ on subsets $Z \subset X_{0}$ analogous to fractal dimensions, and we provide various key properties which are crucial for the study of the variational principles on nonautonomous dynamical systems. Especially, we obtain the power rules and product rules of these pressures, and we also show they are invariants under equiconjugacies of nonautonomous dynamical systems and equicontinuity on $\boldsymbol{f}$. From a fractal dimension point of view, these pressures are kinds of 'dimensions' describing the nonautonomous dynamical systems, and we obtain various properties of pressures analogous to fractal dimensions.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing of frame flows for three dimensional manifolds of quarter-pinched negative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a compact three-dimensional smooth Riemannian manifold of strictly 1/4-pinched negative sectional curvature, we establish exponential mixing of the frame flow with respect to the normalized volume. More generally this result extends to a class of torus extensions of Anosov flows, subject to assumptions on the Brin transitivity group and the smoothness of the stable subbundle. Our approach is based on a simplified dynamical model for studying the extension flow, constructed via a Young tower of the underlying Anosov flow. Exponential mixing is then obtained through a strengthened Dolgopyat type estimate on the corresponding transfer operators.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Coupling of Infiltration-Soil Moisture Feedback:Emergent Vegetation Patterns in a Water-Vegetation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a modified water-vegetation model to investigate the mechanistic relationship between infiltration-soil moisture feedback and vegetation pattern in arid/semi-arid ecosystems. Employing Turing pattern formation theory, we drive conditions for diffusion-induced instability and analyze spatiotemporal dynamics near Turing-Hopf bifurcation points. Our key findings include: (i) The system exhibits rich dynamics including multiple stable equilibria, supercritical/subcritical Hopf bifurcations, bubble loops of limit cycles and homoclinic bifurcations. (ii) The system admits Turing-Hopf bifurcation. Using normal form theory, we establish the existence of quasiperiodic solutions and mixedmode oscillations near critical thresholds, providing a mathematical framework for predicting nonlinear ecological regime shifts. (iii) Soil moisture feedbacks govern critical transitions between three distinct ecosystem states: uniform vegetation covering, self-organized spatial patterns (labyrinth/gapped vegetation), and bare soil state, which demonstrates that soil moisture thresholds control the final state selection in this system.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Impact of NATO Policy Actions on Taliban Disinformation Campaigns with Lotka-Volterra Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use an adaptation of the Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey framework (via Affili Et. Al.) to model the relationship between Taliban disinformation campaigns and NATO's attempts to counter them. We find that aggression is a significantly preferred strategy over stagnation; this result should prompt decisionmakers to take strong stances against disinformation campaigns while maintaining a healthy defense against retribution. This leads us to propose the NATO Afghan Youth for Change program, which provides scholarships to individuals throughout the Afghan diaspora to become NATO influencers - a role which will both advance their personal goals and mitigate the spread of disinformation in what may otherwise be communities targeted by the Taliban's disinformation campaigns.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation formula of transition paths in stochastic dynamical systems by spectral flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the bifurcation and stability of the most probable transition paths (MPTPs) in stochastic dynamical systems using variational methods and spectral flow. Drawing from Onsager-Machlup theory, we model MPTPs as minimizers of an autonomous Lagrangian functional dependent on both energy level and noise intensity. We establish existence criteria for minimizers using variational techniques and critical values. The spectral flow formula is obtained to detect bifurcation points and characterize stability under perturbations of noise intensity. Two cases of stability are analyzed in detail, revealing how slight changes in noise intensity can lead to loss of minimum property of MPTPs. The results link variational bifurcations to stochastic phase transitions, providing insight into the detection of transitions in noisy systems.</description>

      <title>Bounding the number of limit cycles in piecewise linear differential systems: methodology and worked examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2012, Huan and Yang introduced the first piecewise linear differential system with two zones separated by a straight line having at least three limit cycles, serving as a counterexample to the Han-Zhang conjecture that said that such systems have no more than two limit cycles. Over the past decade, extensive research has been conducted to explore periodic solutions in piecewise linear differential systems. However, the question of whether the Huan-Yang example indeed has exactly three limit cycles has remained unresolved, primarily due to the lack of techniques for bounding the number of limit cycles in these systems. Based on the authors' recent results, this paper presents a methodology for bounding the number of limit cycles in piecewise linear systems. This methodology conclusively establishes that the Huan-Yang example has exactly three limit cycles. Our methodology has a broader applicability and constitutes a powerful tool for analyzing and bounding the number of limit cycles in any explicit example of piecewise linear differential systems. We extend our analysis to several recent examples of significance in the literature and show that they also exhibit exactly three limit cycles. Finally, we present an algebraic criterion for bounding the number of crossing limit cycles in the focus-focus case.</description>

      <title>Superpolynomial convergence in the Riemann Rearrangement Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $x \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary and consider the `greedy' approximation of $x$ by signed harmonic sums: given $a_n = \sum_{k \leq n} \varepsilon_k/k$ with $\varepsilon_k \in \left\{-1,1\right\}$, we set $\varepsilon_{n+1} = 1$ if $a_n \leq x$ and $\varepsilon_{n+1} = -1$ otherwise. Bettin-Molteni-Sanna showed (Adv. Math. 2020) that this procedure has remarkable approximation properties: for almost all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ one has superpolynomial convergence in the sense that for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ there are infinitely many $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $|a_n - x| \leq n^{-k}$. We extend this result from $\pm 1 \pm 1/2 \pm 1/3 \dots \pm 1/n$ to moment sequences, i.e. sequences defined as the moments of a measure $\mu$ supported on $[0,1]$.</description>

      <title>Factorizable embeddings and the period of an irreducible sofic shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing a result of MacDonald we give necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary subshift to embed into an irreducible sofic shift factoring through a given cover by an irreducible subshift of finite type (SFT). We obtain also necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary subshift to embed into an irreducible sofic shift factoring through \emph{some} sliding block code out of an irreducible SFT. We do that when the code is required to be surjective, and hence a factor code, and when it is required to be injective or is allowed to be arbitrary. These results require concepts of the period of an irreducible sofic shift as well as a concept of a $p$-periodic subshift. Several equivalent formulations of the period are developed.</description>

      <title>Novel Non-Prehensile Rolling Problem: Modelling and Balance Control of Pendulum-Driven Reconfigurable Disks Motion with Magnetic Coupling in Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel type of mobile rolling robot designed as a modular platform for non-prehensile manipulation, highlighting the associated control challenges in achieving balancing control of the robotic system. The developed rolling disk modules incorporate an innovative internally actuated magnetic-pendulum coupling mechanism, which introduces a compelling control problem due to the frictional and sliding interactions, as well as the magnetic effects between each module. In this paper, we derive the nonlinear dynamics of the robot using the Euler-Lagrange formulation. Then, through simulation, the motion behavior of the system is studied and analyzed, providing critical insights for future investigations into control methods for complex non-prehensile motion between robotic modules. Also, we study the balancing of this new platform and introduce a new motion pattern of lifting. This research aims to enhance the understanding and implementation of modular self-reconfigurable robots in various scenarios for future applications.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Fish School Fragmentation under Predation Using Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study builds upon our previously proposed stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based model to further investigate fish school fragmentation under predation. Specifically, we explore structural dynamics by incorporating graph-theoretic metrics--namely, the number of connected components--to quantify changes in prey school organization. Two quantitative indicators, first split time and final component count, are introduced to assess the timing and extent of group disintegration. Sensitivity analyses are performed on key parameters to evaluate their influence on group stability under nearest attack and center attack strategies. We independently examine the effect of environmental noise on fish school cohesion. Simulation results show that parameter changes impact fish school fragmentation differently under the two predation strategies. High environmental noise also makes it difficult for the school to stay cohesive. This framework provides a structured and quantitative basis for assessing how fish schools respond to different predation strategies and environmental noise levels.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Probabilistic Learning of Dynamical Systems from Missing or Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning dynamical systems is crucial across many fields, yet applying machine learning techniques remains challenging due to missing variables and noisy data. Classical mathematical models often struggle in these scenarios due to the arose ill-posedness of the physical systems. Stochastic machine learning techniques address this challenge by enabling the modeling of such ill-posed problems. Thus, a single known input to the trained machine learning model may yield multiple plausible outputs, and all of the outputs are correct. In such scenarios, probabilistic forecasting is inherently meaningful. In this study, we introduce a variant of flow matching for probabilistic forecasting which estimates possible future states as a distribution over possible outcomes rather than a single-point prediction. Perturbation of complex dynamical states is not trivial. Community uses typical Gaussian or uniform perturbations to crucial variables to model uncertainty. However, not all variables behave in a Gaussian fashion. So, we also propose a generative machine learning approach to physically and logically perturb the states of complex high-dimensional dynamical systems. Finally, we establish the mathematical foundations of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness on several challenging dynamical systems, including a variant of the high-dimensional WeatherBench dataset, which models the global weather at a 5.625{\deg} meridional resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomena that cause a value of a polynomial function to be a bifurcation one are yet to be described when the fibers have dimension higher than $1$. In this note, the main result is the construction of a polynomial submersion function of $\mathbb{R}^3$ with connected fibers having a bifurcation value such that close enough to it the fibers are mutually diffeomorphic. We also present an example of a polynomial submersion function of $\mathbb{R}^2$ having a bifurcation value such that close enough to it the fibers are mutually diffeomorphic.</description>

      <title>On the contact type conjecture for exact magnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we answer a question posed in 1998 by Contreras, Iturriaga, Paternain, and Paternain, now known as the contact type conjecture. For a broad class of magnetic systems, we explicitly construct, on any closed manifold, an infinite-dimensional space of exact magnetic systems, which we refer to as magnetic systems of strong geodesic type. For each such system, there exists at least one null-homologous embedded periodic orbit on every energy level, with negative action for energies below the strict Ma\~n\'e critical value. As a consequence, the corresponding energy surfaces are not of contact type below this threshold. Thus, for this class of systems, the contact type conjecture holds true. Moreover, for these systems, both the strict and the lowest Ma\~n\'e critical values can be computed explicitly, and they coincide whenever the aforementioned periodic magnetic geodesic is contractible, without requiring any additional assumptions on the manifold. Several remarkable multiplicity results also hold, guaranteeing arbitrarily large numbers of embedded null-homologous periodic magnetic geodesics on every energy level. We illustrate the richness of this class through two types of examples. First, on any non-aspherical manifold, there exists a dense subset of the space of Riemannian metrics such that, for each such metric, one can construct an infinite-dimensional space of exact magnetic fields yielding magnetic systems of strong geodesic type. Second, on any closed contact manifold for which the strong Weinstein conjecture holds, one can construct an infinite-dimensional space of Riemannian metrics such that, for each such metric, the magnetic system induced by the fixed contact form is of strong geodesic type.</description>

      <title>Almost Periodic Solutions of The Cubic Defocusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the Cauchy problem for the cubic defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with almost periodic initial data. We prove that for small analytic quasiperiodic initial data satisfying Diophantine frequency conditions, the Cauchy problem admits a solution that is almost periodic in both space and time, and that this solution is unique among solutions locally bounded in a suitable sense. The analysis combines direct and inverse spectral theory.
  In the inverse spectral theory part, we prove existence, almost periodicity, and uniqueness for solutions with initial data whose associated Dirac operator has purely a.c.\ spectrum that is not too thin. This resolves novel challenges presented by the NLS hierarchy, such as an additional degree of freedom and an additional commuting flow.
  In the direct spectral theory part, for Dirac operators with small analytic quasiperiodic potentials with Diophantine frequency conditions, we prove pure a.c.\ spectrum, exponentially decaying spectral gaps, and spectral thickness conditions (homogeneity and Craig-type conditions).</description>

      <title>Effect of protection zone on the dynamics of a diffusion-advection population-toxicant model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops and analyzes a diffusion-advection model coupling population dynamics with toxicant transport, incorporating a boundary protection zone. For both upstream and downstream protection zone configurations, we investigate the combined influence of protected zones and key ecological factors on population persistence or extinction. Employing monotone dynamical system theory and eigenvalue analysis, we establish the global dynamics of the population-toxicant coexistence equilibrium. Furthermore, we characterize the parameter dependence governing the stability of the toxicant-only steady state, specifically examining the protected zone length, toxicant effect coefficient on population growth, per-unit contaminant discharge rate, toxicant input rate, diffusion/advection rates, and population natural growth rate. Finally, numerical simulations reveal the complex interplay between the protection zone and toxicant advection rate in significantly shaping population persistence domains.</description>

      <title>Hyperparameter-Free Neurochaos Learning Algorithm for Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurochaos Learning (NL) is a brain-inspired classification framework that employs chaotic dynamics to extract features from input data and yields state of the art performance on classification tasks. However, NL requires the tuning of multiple hyperparameters and computing of four chaotic features per input sample. In this paper, we propose AutochaosNet - a novel, hyperparameter-free variant of the NL algorithm that eliminates the need for both training and parameter optimization. AutochaosNet leverages a universal chaotic sequence derived from the Champernowne constant and uses the input stimulus to define firing time bounds for feature extraction. Two simplified variants - TM AutochaosNet and TM-FR AutochaosNet - are evaluated against the existing NL architecture - ChaosNet. Our results demonstrate that AutochaosNet achieves competitive or superior classification performance while significantly reducing training time due to reduced computational effort. In addition to eliminating training and hyperparameter tuning, AutochaosNet exhibits excellent generalisation capabilities, making it a scalable and efficient choice for real-world classification tasks. Future work will focus on identifying universal orbits under various chaotic maps and incorporating them into the NL framework to further enhance performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [Compositio Math. 155 (2019)] Kleinbock and Wadleigh proved a "zero-one law" for uniform inhomogeneous Diophantine approximations. We generalize this statement with arbitrary weight functions and establish a new and simple proof of this statement, based on transference principle. We also give a complete description of the sets of $g$-Dirichlet pairs with a fixed matrix in this setup from Lebesgue measure point of view. As an application, we consider the set of badly approximable matrices and give a characterization of bad approximability in terms of inhomogeneous approximations. All the aforementioned metrical descriptions work (and sometimes can be strengthened) for weighted Diophantine approximations.</description>

      <title>The Cobb-Douglas Production Function and the Old Bowley's Law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02609v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bowley's law, also referred to as the law of the constant wage share, was a noteworthy empirical finding in economics, suggesting that a nation's wage share tended to remain stable over time, as observed through most of the 20th century. The wage share represents the proportion of a country's economic output that is distributed to employees as compensation for their labor, usually in the form of wages. The term ''Bowley's law'' was coined in 1964 by Paul Samuelson, the first American laureate of the Nobel memorial prize in economic sciences. He attributed this principle to Sir Arthur Bowley, an English economist, mathematician, and statistician. In this paper, we introduce a mathematical model derived from data for the American economy, originally employed by Cobb and Douglas in 1928 to validate the renowned Cobb-Douglas production function. We utilize symmetry methods, particularly those developed by Peter Olver, to elucidate the validity of Bowley's law within our model's framework. By employing these advanced mathematical techniques, our objective is to elucidate the factors contributing to the stability of the wage share over time. We demonstrate that the validity of both Bowley's law and the Cobb-Douglas production function arises from the robust growth of an economy, characterized by expansion in capital, labor, and production, which can be approximated by an exponential function. Through our analysis, we aim to offer valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms that support Bowley's law and its implications for comprehending income distribution patterns in economies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of interval translation mappings introduced by Bruin and Troubetzkoy, describing a new renormalization scheme, inspired by the classical Rauzy induction for this class. We construct a measure, invariant under the renormalization, supported on the parameters yielding infinite type interval translation mappings in this class. With respect to this measure, a.e. transformation is uniquely ergodic. We show that this set has Hausdorff dimension between 1.5 and 2, and that the Hausdorff dimension coincides with the affinity dimension. Finally, seeing our renormalization as a multidimensional continued fraction algorithm, we show that it has almost always the Pisot property. We discover an interesting phenomenon: the dynamics of this class of transformations is often (conjecturally: almost always) weak mixing, while the renormalizing algorithm typically has the Pisot property.</description>

      <title>Nonautonomous Dynamical Systems II: Variational Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\boldsymbol{X}=\{X_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ be a sequence of compact metric spaces $X_{k}$ and $\boldsymbol{T}=\{T_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ a sequence of continuous mappings $T_{k}: X_{k} \to X_{k+1}$. The pair $(\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{T})$ is called a nonautonomous dynamical system.
  In this paper, we study measure-theoretic entropies and pressures, Bowen and packing topological entropies and pressures on $(\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{T})$, and we prove that they are invariant under equiconjugacies of nonautonomous dynamical systems. By establishing Billingsley type theorems for Bowen and packing topological pressures, we obtain their variational principles, that is, given a non-empty compact subset $K \subset X_{0}$ and an equicontinuous sequence $\boldsymbol{f}= \{f_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ of functions $f_k : X_k\to \mathbb{R}$, we have that $$ P^{\mathrm{B}}(\boldsymbol{T},\boldsymbol{f},K)=\sup\{\underline{P}_{\mu}(\boldsymbol{T},\boldsymbol{f}): \mu \in M(X_{0}), \mu(K)=1\}, $$ and for $\|\boldsymbol{f}\|&lt;+\infty$ and $P^{\mathrm{P}}(\boldsymbol{T},\boldsymbol{f},K)&gt;\|\boldsymbol{f}\|$, $$ P^{\mathrm{P}}(\boldsymbol{T},\boldsymbol{f},K)=\sup\{\overline{P}_{\mu}(\boldsymbol{T},\boldsymbol{f}): \mu \in M(X_{0}), \mu(K)=1\}, $$ where $\underline{P}_{\mu} $ and $\overline{P}_{\mu} $, $P^{\mathrm{B}}$ and $P^{\mathrm{P}}$ denote measure-theoretic lower and upper pressures, Bowen and packing topological pressure, respectively. The Billingsley type theorems and variational principles for Bowen and packing topological entropies are direct consequences of the ones for Bowen and packing topological pressures.</description>

      <title>Bistability and complex bifurcation diagrams generated by waning and boosting of immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an epidemiological model that incorporates waning of immunity at the individual level and boosting of the immune system upon re-exposure to the pathogen. When immunity is fully restored upon boosting, the system can be expressed as an SIRS-type model with discrete and distributed delays. We conduct a numerical bifurcation analysis varying the boosting force and the maximum period of immunity (in the absence of boosting), while keeping other parameters fixed at values representative of a highly infectious disease like pertussis. The stability switches of the endemic equilibrium, identified numerically, are validated using an established analytical approach, confirming that the equilibrium is unstable in a bounded parameter region, and stable outside this region. Using recently developed continuation methods for models with discrete and distributed delays, we explore periodic solutions and their bifurcations. Our analysis significantly extends previous findings and reveals a rich dynamical landscape, including catastrophic bifurcations of limit cycles, torus bifurcations, and bistability regions where two stable periodic solutions coexist, differing in amplitude and period. These complex bifurcations have critical public health implications: perturbations--such as non-pharmaceutical interventions--can shift the system between attractors, leading to long-term consequences from short-term measures.</description>

      <title>Confabulation dynamics in a reservoir computer: Filling in the gaps with untrained attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has advanced significantly in recent years thanks to innovations in the design and training of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Despite these advancements, we still understand relatively little about how elementary forms of ANNs learn, fail to learn, and generate false information without the intent to deceive, a phenomenon known as `confabulation'. To provide some foundational insight, in this paper we analyse how confabulation occurs in reservoir computers (RCs): a dynamical system in the form of an ANN. RCs are particularly useful to study as they are known to confabulate in a well-defined way: when RCs are trained to reconstruct the dynamics of a given attractor, they sometimes construct an attractor that they were not trained to construct, a so-called `untrained attractor' (UA). This paper sheds light on the role played by UAs when reconstruction fails and their influence when modelling transitions between reconstructed attractors. Based on our results, we conclude that UAs are an intrinsic feature of learning systems whose state spaces are bounded, and that this means of confabulation may be present in systems beyond RCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a dynamical system $(X,f)$ consisting of a compact metrizable space $X$ and a homeomorphism $f \colon X \to X$, an endomorphism of $(X,f)$ is a continuous map of $X$ into itself which commutes with $f$. One says that a dynamical system $(X,f)$ is surjunctive if every injective endomorphism of $(X,f)$ is surjective. An endomorphism of $(X,f)$ is called pre-injective if its restriction to each $f$-homoclinicity class of $X$ is injective. One says that a dynamical system has the Moore property if every surjective endomorphism of the system is pre-injective and that it has the Myhill property if every pre-injective endomorphism is surjective. One says that a dynamical system satisfies the Garden of Eden theorem if it has both the Moore and the Myhill properties. We prove that every irreducible Smale space satisfies the Garden of Eden theorem and that every non-wandering Smale space is surjunctive and has the Moore property.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamical properties of ball expanding maps, a class of continuous self-maps defined on compact metric spaces. For a ball expanding map, we show that: (1) the set of periodic points is dense in the chain recurrent set; (2) if the topological entropy of the map is zero, then the chain recurrent set is finite; (3) the map has only finitely many chain components; (4) if the space is perfect, then the topological entropy of the map is positive; and (5) if the space is connected, then the map is locally eventually onto and hence mixing. Several examples are also provided.</description>

      <title>Most likely retail agglomeration patterns: Potential maximization and stochastic stability of spatial equilibria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.06778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a model of retail agglomeration where consumers are more likely to visit zones with a higher concentration of shops. This agglomerative effect makes zones with many retailers more attractive. The spatial distribution of retailers in equilibrium is endogenously determined in response to the spatial pattern of shopping demand. In such a setting, multiple locally stable equilibria may arise, and the outcome can depend on the initial distribution of shops. To address this issue, we apply an approach from evolutionary game theory, selecting the equilibrium that maximizes a potential function representing the incentives of retailers. We demonstrate the method in a two-dimensional spatial setting. Compared to local stability based on gradual, myopic adjustments, this global maximization leads to a unique and more robust prediction. As expected, the number of retail clusters decreases either when shopping costs for immobile consumers fall or when the attractiveness of larger retail concentrations increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04267v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a category of probability spaces and measure-preserving Markov kernels up to almost sure equality. This category contains, among its isomorphisms, mod-zero isomorphisms of probability spaces. It also gives an isomorphism between the space of values of a random variable and the sigma-algebra that it generates on the outcome space, reflecting the standard mathematical practice of using the two interchangeably, for example when taking conditional expectations.
  We show that a number of constructions and results from classical probability theory, mostly involving notions of equilibrium, can be expressed and proven in terms of this category. In particular: - Given a stochastic dynamical system acting on a standard Borel space, we show that the almost surely invariant sigma-algebra can be obtained as a limit and as a colimit; - In the setting above, the almost surely invariant sigma-algebra gives rise, up to isomorphism of our category, to a standard Borel space; - As a corollary, we give a categorical version of the ergodic decomposition theorem for stochastic actions; - As an example, we show how de Finetti's theorem and the Hewitt-Savage and Kolmogorov zero-one laws fit in this limit-colimit picture.
  This work uses the tools of categorical probability, in particular Markov categories, as well as the theory of dagger categories.</description>

      <title>A Dual Geometric Test for Forward-Flatness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forward-flatness is a generalization of static feedback linearizability and a special case of a more general flatness concept for discrete-time systems. Recently, it has been shown that this practically quite relevant property can be checked by computing a unique sequence of involutive distributions which generalizes the well-known static feedback linearization test. In this paper, a dual test for forward-flatness based on a unique sequence of integrable codistributions is derived. Since the main mathematical operations for determining this sequence are the intersection of codistributions and the calculation of Lie derivatives of 1-forms, it is computationally quite efficient. Furthermore, the formulation with codistributions also facilitates a comparison with the existing discrete-time literature regarding the closely related topic of dynamic feedback linearization, which is mostly formulated in terms of 1-forms rather than vector fields. The presented results are illustrated by two examples.</description>

      <title>A Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem for Bistochastic Ergodic Quantum Processes with Applications to Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a multiplicative ergodic theorem for bistochastic completely positive (bcp) linear cocycles acting on finite-dimensional matrix algebras, giving an invariant splitting described explicitly in terms of the multiplicative domains of the underlying bcp maps. As an application of our theorem, we classify when compositions of random bcp maps are asymptotically entanglement breaking, and use this classification to show that occasionally PPT bcp maps are asymptotically entanglement breaking. We conclude by demonstrating a certain class of bcp linear cocycles are almost surely entanglement breaking in finite time.</description>

      <title>On Ma\~n\'e's critical value for the two-component Hunter-Saxton system and a infnite dimensional magnetic Hopf-Rinow theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a nonlinear system of partial differential equations, the magnetic two-component Hunter-Saxton system (M2HS). This system is formulated as a magnetic geodesic equation on an infinite-dimensional Lie group equipped with a right-invariant metric, the $\dot{H}^1$ -metric, which is closely related to the infinite-dimensional Fisher-Rao metric, and the derivative of an infinite-dimensional contact-type form as the magnetic field. We define Ma\~n\'e's critical value for exact magnetic systems on Hilbert manifolds in full generality and compute it explicitly for the (M2HS). Moreover, we establish an infinite-dimensional Hopf-Rinow theorem for this magnetic system, where Ma\~n\'e's critical value serves as the threshold beyond which the Hopf-Rinow theorem no longer holds. This geometric framework enables us to thoroughly analyze the blow-up behavior of solutions to the (M2HS). Using this insight, we extend solutions beyond blow-up by introducing and proving the existence of global conservative weak solutions. This extension is facilitated by extending the Madelung transform from an isometry into a magnetomorphism, embedding the magnetic system into a magnetic system on an infinite-dimensional sphere equipped with the derivative of the standard contact form as the magnetic field. Crucially, this setup can always be reduced, via a dynamical reduction theorem, to a totally magnetic three-sphere, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics.</description>
