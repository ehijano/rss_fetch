      <title>Comparison of integral equation theories of the liquid state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ornstein-Zernike equation is a powerful tool in liquid state theory for predicting structural and thermodynamic properties of fluids. Combined with a suitable closure, it has been shown to reproduce e.g. the static structure factor, pressure, and compressibility of liquids to a great degree of accuracy. However, out of the multitude of closures that exist for the Ornstein-Zernike equation, it is hard to predict a priori which closure will give the most accurate predictions for the system at hand. To alleviate this problem, we compare the predictive power of many closures on a curated set of representative benchmark systems, including those with hard-sphere, inverse power-law, Gaussian core, and Lennard-Jones particles, in three and two dimensions. For example, we find that the well-known and highly used Percus-Yevick closure gives significantly worse predictions than lesser-known closures of equal complexity in all cases studied. We anticipate that the trends observed in our results will aid in making more informed decisions regarding closure choices. To facilitate the adoption of more modern closure theories, we also have packaged, documented, and distributed the code necessary to numerically solve the equations for a given closure and pair interaction potential.</description>

      <title>Structural Reorganizations and Nanodomain Emergence in Lipid Membrane Driven by Ionic Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exceptional physicochemical properties and versatile biological activities of ionic liquids (ILs) have propelled their potential applications in various industries, including pharmaceuticals and green chemistry. However, their widespread use is limited by concerns over toxicity, particularly due to interactions with cell membranes. This study examines the effects of imidazolium-based ILs on the microscopic structure and phase behavior of a model cell membrane composed of zwitterionic dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipid. Small-angle neutron scattering and dynamic light scattering reveal that the shorter chain IL, 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (HMIM[Br]), induces aggregation of DPPC unilamellar vesicles. In contrast, this aggregation is absent with the longer alkyl chain IL, 1-decyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (DMIM[Br]). Instead, DMIM[Br] incorporation leads to the formation of distinct IL-poor and IL-rich nanodomains within the DPPC membrane, as evidenced by X-ray reflectivity, differential scanning calorimetry, and molecular dynamics simulation. The less evident nanodomain formation with HMIM[Br] underscores the role of hydrophobic interactions between lipid alkyl tails and ILs. Our findings demonstrate that longer alkyl chains in ILs significantly enhance their propensity to form membrane nanodomains and increase membrane permeability, directly correlating with higher cytotoxicity. This crucial link between nanodomains and toxicity provides valuable insights for designing safer, more environmentally friendly ILs, and promoting their use in biomedical applications and sustainable industrial processes.</description>

      <title>Locomotion of Active Polymerlike Worms in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the locomotion of thin, living \textit{T.~Tubifex} worms, which display active polymerlike behavior, within quasi-2D arrays of pillars with different spatial arrangements and densities. These active worms spread in crowded environments, with a dynamics dependent on both the concentration and arrangement of obstacles. In contrast to passive polymers, our results reveal that in disordered configurations, increasing the pillar density enhances the long-time diffusion of our active polymer-like worms, while we observe the opposite trend in ordered pillar arrays. We found that in disordered media, living worms reptate through available curvilinear tubes, whereas they become trapped within pores of ordered media. Intriguingly, we show that reducing the worm's activity significantly boosts its spread, enabling passive sorting of worms by activity level. Our experimental observations are corroborated through simulations of the tangentially-driven polymer model.</description>

      <title>Hybrid particle-phase field model and renormalized surface tension in dilute suspensions of nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a two-phase field model and a hybrid particle-phase field model to simulate dilute colloidal sedimentation and flotation near a liquid-gas interface (or fluid-fluid interface in general). Both models are coupled to the incompressible Stokes equation, which is solved numerically using a combination of sine and regular Fourier transforms to account for the no-slip boundary conditions at the boundaries. The continuum two-phase field model allows us to analytically solve the equilibrium interfacial profile using a perturbative approach, demonstrating excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Notably, we show that strong coupling to particle dynamics can significantly alter the liquid-gas interface, thereby modifying the liquid-gas interfacial tension. In particular, we show that the renormalized surface tension is monotonically decreasing with increasing colloidal particle concentration and decreasing buoyant mass.</description>

      <title>Packing and ejection dynamics of polymers: Role of confinement, polymer stiffness and activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The translocation of biopolymers, such as DNA and proteins, across cellular or nuclear membranes is essential for numerous biological processes. The translocation dynamics are influenced by the properties of the polymers, such as polymer stiffness, and the geometry of the capsid. In our study, we aim to investigate the impact of polymer stiffness, activity, and different capsid geometries on the packing and ejection dynamics of both passive and active polymers. We employ Langevin dynamics simulations for a systematic investigation. We observe that flexible polymers exhibit packing times that are faster than those of their semi-flexible counterparts. Interestingly, for large polymers compared to the capsid size, sphere facilitates faster packing and unpacking compared to ellipsoid, mimicking the cell nucleus and suggesting a geometrical advantage for biopolymer translocation. In summary, we observe that increasing activity accelerates both the packing and ejection processes for both flexible and semi-flexible polymers. However, the effect is significantly more pronounced for semi-flexible polymers, highlighting the crucial role of polymer flexibility in these dynamics. These findings deepen our understanding of the intricate interplay between polymer flexibility, capsid geometry, and activity, providing valuable insight into the dynamics of polymer packing and ejection processes.</description>

      <title>Computational Phase Transitions in Two-Dimensional Antiferromagnetic Melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A computational phase transition in a classical or quantum system is a non-analytic change in behavior of an order parameter which can only be observed with the assistance of a nontrivial classical computation. Such phase transitions, and the computational observables which detect them, play a crucial role in the optimal decoding of quantum error-correcting codes and in the scalable detection of measurement-induced phenomena. In this work we show that computational phase transitions and observables can also provide important physical insight on the phase diagram of a classical statistical physics system, specifically in the context of the dislocation-mediated melting of a two-dimensional antiferromagnetic (AF) crystal. In the solid phase, elementary dislocations disrupt the bipartiteness of the underlying square lattice, and as a result, pairs of dislocations are linearly confined by string-like AF domain walls. It has previously been argued that a novel AF tetratic phase can arise when double dislocations proliferate while elementary dislocations remain bound. However, since elementary dislocations carry AF Ising gauge flux, no local order parameter can distinguish between AF and paramagnetic (PM) tetratic regimes, and consequently there is no thermodynamic phase transition separating the two regimes. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to algorithmically construct a staggered magnetization which distinguishes the AF and PM tetratic regimes by "pairing" dislocations, which requires an increasingly nontrivial classical computation as elementary dislocation pairs increase in density and unbind. We discuss both algorithm-dependent and "intrinsic" algorithm-independent computational phase transitions in this setting, the latter of which includes a transition in one's ability to consistently sort atoms into two sublattices to construct a well-defined staggered magnetization.</description>

      <title>Diffusion in driven periodic systems: from weak to strong damping regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider diffusion of an inertial Brownian particle moving in a symmetric spatially periodic potential and driven by an unbiased time periodic force of a moderate frequency. The study is focused on the dependence of its diffusion coefficient $D$ on the damping $\gamma$ ranging from the weak to strong one. We reveal the mechanisms of counterintutive effects in which diffusion can increase despite the grow of friction and exhibits both minima and maxima. Their origin is explained by analysis of the deterministic dynamics perturbed by thermal fluctuations. In the weak damping regime the maximum of diffusion is induced by a non-monotonic change of population of the running orbits when the friction increases. In the strong dissipation regime the effect is caused by bifurcation of periodic orbits oscillating symmetrically around the potential maximum and their displacement towards the potential minimum when the damping coefficient increases. It induces the change of the effective barrier of the periodic potential and its vanishing at the maximum of $D$.</description>

      <title>Fast and Reliable Probabilistic Reflectometry Inversion with Prior-Amortized Neural Posterior Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the structure of thin films and multilayers from measurements of scattered X-rays or neutrons is key to progress in physics, chemistry, and biology. However, finding all structures compatible with reflectometry data is computationally prohibitive for standard algorithms, which typically results in unreliable analysis with only a single potential solution identified. We address this lack of reliability with a probabilistic deep learning method that identifies all realistic structures in seconds, setting new standards in reflectometry. Our method, Prior-Amortized Neural Posterior Estimation (PANPE), combines simulation-based inference with novel adaptive priors that inform the inference network about known structural properties and controllable experimental conditions. PANPE networks support key scenarios such as high-throughput sample characterization, real-time monitoring of evolving structures, or the co-refinement of several experimental data sets, and can be adapted to provide fast, reliable, and flexible inference across many other inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Chirality, anisotropic viscosity and elastic anisotropy in three-dimensional active nematic turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various active materials exhibit strong spatio-temporal variability of their orientational order known as active turbulence, characterised by irregular and chaotic motion of topological defects, including colloidal suspensions, biofilaments, and bacterial colonies.In particular in three dimensions, it has not yet been explored how active turbulence responds to changes in material parameters and chirality.Here, we present a numerical study of three-dimensional (3D) active nematic turbulence, examining the influence of main material constants: (i) the flow-alignment viscosity, (ii) the magnitude and anisotropy of elastic deformation modes (elastic constants), and (iii) the chirality. Specifically, this main parameter space covers contractile or extensile, flow-aligning or flow tumbling, chiral or achiral elastically anisotropic active nematic fluids. The results are presented using time- and space-averaged fields of defect density and mean square velocity. The results also discuss defect density and mean square velocity as possible effective order parameters in chiral active nematics, distinguishing two chiral nematic states -- active nematic blue phase and chiral active turbulence. This research contributes to the understanding of active turbulence, providing a numerical main phase space parameter sweep to help guide future experimental design and use of active materials.</description>

      <title>A scalable method to model large suspensions of colloidal phoretic particles with arbitrary shapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phoretic colloids self-propel thanks to surface flows generated in response to surface gradients (thermal, electrical, or chemical), that are self-induced and/or generated by other particles. Here we present a scalable and versatile framework to model chemical and hydrodynamic interactions in large suspensions of arbitrarily shaped phoretic particles, accounting for thermal fluctuations at all Damkholer numbers. Our approach, inspired by the Boundary Element Method (BEM), employs second-layer formulations, regularised kernels and a grid optimisation strategy to solve the coupled Laplace-Stokes equations with reasonable accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost associated with BEM. As demonstrated by our large-scale simulations, the capabilities of our method enable the exploration of new physical phenomena that, to our knowledge, have not been previously addressed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the impact of hydrodynamic interactions on the conformational and dynamical properties of wet tangentially-driven active polymers using multiparticle collision dynamics simulations. By analyzing active filaments with varying degrees of flexibility, we find that fluid-mediated interactions significantly influence both their conformation and dynamics. These interactions cause polymer conformations to shrink, especially for semiflexible polymers at high activity levels, where the average size of wet chains becomes nearly three times smaller, due to formation of helix-like structures. This hydrodynamic-induced shrinkage is a hallmark of active polymers, as fluid-mediated interactions have a minimal effect on the mean conformation of passive polymers. Furthermore, for tangentially-driven polymers where activity and conformation are coupled, hydrodynamic interactions significantly enhance the orientational and translational dynamics compared to their dry counterparts.</description>

      <title>MMPolymer: A Multimodal Multitask Pretraining Framework for Polymer Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polymers are high-molecular-weight compounds constructed by the covalent bonding of numerous identical or similar monomers so that their 3D structures are complex yet exhibit unignorable regularity. Typically, the properties of a polymer, such as plasticity, conductivity, bio-compatibility, and so on, are highly correlated with its 3D structure. However, existing polymer property prediction methods heavily rely on the information learned from polymer SMILES sequences (P-SMILES strings) while ignoring crucial 3D structural information, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this work, we propose MMPolymer, a novel multimodal multitask pretraining framework incorporating polymer 1D sequential and 3D structural information to encourage downstream polymer property prediction tasks. Besides, considering the scarcity of polymer 3D data, we further introduce the "Star Substitution" strategy to extract 3D structural information effectively. During pretraining, in addition to predicting masked tokens and recovering clear 3D coordinates, MMPolymer achieves the cross-modal alignment of latent representations. Then we further fine-tune the pretrained MMPolymer for downstream polymer property prediction tasks in the supervised learning paradigm. Experiments show that MMPolymer achieves state-of-the-art performance in downstream property prediction tasks. Moreover, given the pretrained MMPolymer, utilizing merely a single modality in the fine-tuning phase can also outperform existing methods, showcasing the exceptional capability of MMPolymer in polymer feature extraction and utilization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16075v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inflation of an inner radial (or spherical) cavity in an amorphous solids confined in a disk (or a sphere), served as a fruitful case model for studying the effects of plastic deformations on the mechanical response. It was shown that when the field associated with Eshelby quadrupolar charges is non-uniform, the displacement field is riddled with dipole charges that screen elasticity, reminiscent of Debye monopoles screening in electrostatics. In this paper we look deeper into the screening phenomenon, taking into account the consequences of irreversibility that are associated with the breaking of Chiral symmetry. We consider the equations for the displacement field with the presence of ``Odd Dipole Screening", solve them analytically and compare with numerical simulations. Suggestions how to test the theory in experiments are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galvanotaxis is believed to be driven by the redistribution of transmembrane proteins and other molecules, referred to as "sensors", through electrophoresis and electroosmosis. Here, we update our previous model of the limits of galvanotaxis due to stochasticity of sensor movements to account for cell shape and orientation. Computing the Fisher information, we find that cells in principle possess more information about the electric field direction when their long axis is parallel to the field, but that for weak fields maximum-likelihood estimators of the field direction may actually have lower variability when the cell's long axis is perpendicular to the field. In an alternate possibility, we find that if cells instead estimate the field direction by taking the average of all the sensor locations as its directional cue ("vector sum"), this introduces a bias towards the short axis, an effect not present for isotropic cells. We also explore the possibility that cell elongation arises downstream of sensor redistribution. We argue that if sensors migrate to the cell's rear, the cell will expand perpendicular the field - as is more commonly observed - but if sensors migrate to the front, the cell will elongate parallel to the field.</description>
