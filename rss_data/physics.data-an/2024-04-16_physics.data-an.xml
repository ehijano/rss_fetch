      <title>Distinguishing subsampled power laws from other heavy-tailed distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinguishing power-law distributions from other heavy-tailed distributions is challenging, and this task is often further complicated by subsampling effects. In this work, we evaluate the performance of two commonly used methods for detecting power-law distributions - the maximum likelihood method of Clauset et al. and the extreme value method of Voitalov et al. - in distinguishing subsampled power laws from two other heavy-tailed distributions, the lognormal and the stretched exponential distributions. We focus on a random subsampling method commonly applied in network science and biological sciences. In this subsampling scheme, we are ultimately interested in the frequency distribution of elements with a certain number of constituent parts, and each part is selected to the subsample with an equal probability. We investigate how well the results obtained from subsamples generalize to the original distribution. Our results show that the power-law exponent of the original distribution can be estimated fairly accurately from subsamples, but classifying the distribution correctly is more challenging. The maximum likelihood method falsely rejects the power-law hypothesis for a large fraction of subsamples from power-law distributions. While the extreme value method correctly recognizes subsampled power-law distributions with all tested subsampling depths, its capacity to distinguish power laws from the heavy-tailed alternatives is limited. However, these false positives tend to result not from the subsampling itself but from the estimators' inability to classify the original sample correctly. In fact, we show that the extreme value method can sometimes be expected to perform better on subsamples than on the original samples from the lognormal and the stretched exponential distributions, while the contrary is true for the main tests included in the maximum likelihood method.</description>

      <title>Causal analysis of inner and outer motions in near-wall turbulent flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the causality of near-wall inner and outer turbulent motions. Here we define the inner motions as the self-sustained near-wall cycle and the outer motions as those living in the logarithmic layer exhibiting a footprint on the near-wall region. We perform causal analysis using two different methods: one is the transfer entropy, based on the information theory, and the other one is the Liang--Kleeman information-flow theory. The causal-analysis methods are applied to several scenarios, including a linear and a non-linear problem, a low-dimensional model of the near-wall cycle of turbulence, as well as the interaction between inner and outer turbulent motions in a channel at a friction Reynolds number of $Re_{\tau}=1000$. We find that both methods can well predict the causal links in the linear problem, and the information flow can identify more of the nonlinear problem. Despite richer causalities revealed by the transfer entropy for turbulent-flow problems, both methods can successfully identify the streak-vortex regeneration mechanism that majorly sustains the near-wall turbulence. It is also indicated that both bottom-up and top-down influences of inner and outer motions may coexist in addition to the multiscale self-sustaining mechanism. Lastly, we mention that the computation of the information flow is much more efficient than the transfer entropy. The present study suggests that the information flow can have great potential in causal inference for turbulent-flow problems besides the transfer entropy.</description>

      <title>Time-Heterogeneity of the F\"orster Radius from Dipole Orientational Dynamics Explains Observed Dynamic Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a quantum mechanical phenomenon involving the non-radiative transfer of energy between coupled electric dipoles. Due to the strong dependence of FRET on the distance between the dipoles, it is frequently used as a ``molecular ruler" in biology, chemistry, and physics. This is done by placing dipolar molecules called dyes on molecules of interest. In time-resolved confocal single-molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments, the joint distribution of the FRET efficiency and the donor fluorescence lifetime can reveal underlying molecular conformational dynamics via deviation from their theoretical F\"orster relationship. This deviation is referred to as a dynamic shift. Quantifying the dynamic shift caused by the motion of the fluorescent dyes is essential to decoupling the dynamics of the studied molecules and the dyes. We develop novel Langevin models for the dye linker dynamics, including rotational dynamics, based on first physics principles and proper dye linker chemistry to match accessible volumes predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. By simulating the dyes' stochastic translational and rotational dynamics, we show that the observed dynamic shift can largely be attributed to the mutual orientational dynamics of the electric dipole moments associated with the dyes, not their accessible volume.</description>

      <title>Tracking the distance to criticality in systems with unknown noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world systems undergo abrupt changes in dynamics as they move across critical points, often with dramatic consequences. Much existing theory on identifying the time-series signatures of nearby critical points -- such as increased variance and slower timescales -- is derived for the case of fixed, low-amplitude noise. However, real-world systems are often corrupted by unknown levels of noise that can distort these temporal signatures. Here we aimed to develop noise-robust indicators of the distance to criticality (DTC) for systems affected by dynamical noise in two cases: when the noise amplitude is fixed, or is unknown and variable across recordings. To approach this problem, we compare the ability of over 7000 candidate time-series features to track the DTC in the vicinity of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. We recover existing theory in the fixed-noise case, highlighting conventional time-series features that accurately track the DTC. But in the variable-noise setting, where these conventional indicators perform poorly, we highlight new types of high-performing time-series features and show that their success is accomplished by capturing the shape of the invariant density (which depends on both the DTC and the noise amplitude) relative to the spread of fast fluctuations (which depends on the noise amplitude). We introduce a new high-performing time-series statistic, the Rescaled Auto-Density (RAD), that combines these two algorithmic components. We then use RAD to provide new evidence that brain regions higher in the visual hierarchy are positioned closer to criticality, supporting existing hypotheses about patterns of brain organization that are not detected using conventional metrics of the DTC. Our results demonstrate how large-scale algorithmic comparison can yield theoretical insights that can motivate new theory and interpretable algorithms for real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Ensembling of Multiple Software Sensors with Phase Synchronization: A Robust Approach For Electrocardiogram-derived Respiration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.13054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: We aimed to fuse the outputs of different electrocardiogram-derived respiration (EDR) algorithms to create one EDR signal that is of higher quality. Methods: We viewed each EDR algorithm as a software sensor that recorded breathing activity from a different vantage point, identified high-quality software sensors based on the respiratory signal quality index, aligned the highest-quality EDRs with a phase synchronization technique based on the graph connection Laplacian, and finally fused those aligned, high-quality EDRs. We refer to the output as the sync-ensembled EDR signal. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on two large-scale databases of whole-night polysomnograms. We evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm using three respiratory signals recorded from different hardware sensors, and compared it with other existing EDR algorithms. A sensitivity analysis was carried out for a total of five cases: fusion by taking the mean of EDR signals, and the four cases of EDR signal alignment without and with synchronization and without and with signal quality selection. Results: The sync-ensembled EDR algorithm outperforms existing EDR algorithms when evaluated by the synchronized correlation ({\gamma}-score), optimal transport (OT) distance, and estimated average respiratory rate (EARR) score, all with statistical significance. The sensitivity analysis shows that the signal quality selection and EDR signal alignment are both critical for the performance, both with statistical significance. Conclusion: The sync-ensembled EDR provides robust respiratory information from electrocardiogram. Significance: Phase synchronization is not only theoretically rigorous but also practical to design a robust EDR.</description>

      <title>Nanosecond anomaly detection with decision trees and real-time application to exotic Higgs decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an interpretable implementation of the autoencoding algorithm, used as an anomaly detector, built with a forest of deep decision trees on FPGA, field programmable gate arrays. Scenarios at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN are considered, for which the autoencoder is trained using known physical processes of the Standard Model. The design is then deployed in real-time trigger systems for anomaly detection of unknown physical processes, such as the detection of rare exotic decays of the Higgs boson. The inference is made with a latency value of 30 ns at percent-level resource usage using the Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ VU9P FPGA. Our method offers anomaly detection at low latency values for edge AI users with resource constraints.</description>
