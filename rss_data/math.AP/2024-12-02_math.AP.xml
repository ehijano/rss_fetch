      <title>Analysis of a free boundary problem on stratified Lie group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a variational framework for studying the existence of solutions of a class of elliptic free boundary problems on stratified Lie groups. Using the important monotonicity result in a Non-Euclidean setup, we prove that our solution is the limit of mountain pass points of a sequence of C1-functionals approximating the energy</description>

      <title>$W^{1,p}$ estimates for Schr\"odinger equation in the region above a convex graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $W^{1,p}$ estimates of the Neumann problem for the Schr\"odinger equation $-\Delta u+ V u={\rm div}(f)$ in the region above a convex graph. For any $p&gt;2$, we obtain a sufficient condition for the $W^{1,p}$ solvability. As a result, we obtain sharp $W^{1,p}$ estimate $$\|\nabla u\|_{L^p(\Omega)}+\|V^\frac{1}{2}u\|_{L^p(\Omega)}\leq C\|f\|_{L^p(\Omega)}$$
  for $1 &lt;p&lt;\infty$ with $d\geq2$ under the assumption that $V$ is a $B_\infty$ weight.</description>

      <title>Quantitative unique continuation for non-regular perturbations of the Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the quantitative estimates of the unique continuation property for solutions of an elliptic equation $\Delta u = V u + W_1 \cdot \nabla u + \hbox{div} (W_2 u)$ in an open, connected subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d \geq 3$. Here, $V \in L^{q_0}$, $W_1 \in L^{q_1}$, and $W_2 \in L^{q_2}$ with $q_0 &gt; d/2$, $q_1 &gt; d$, and $q_2 &gt; d$. Our aim is to provide an explicit quantification of the unique continuation property with respect to the norms of the potentials. To achieve this, we revisit the Carleman estimates established in  [Dehman-Ervedoza-Thabouti-2023] and prove a refined version of them, and we combine them with an argument due to T. Wolff introduced in [Wolff-1992] for the proof of unique continuation for solutions of equations of the form $\Delta u = V u + W_1 \cdot \nabla u$.</description>

      <title>The stalk formula for multi-microlocal Hom functors and multi-microlocal Sato's triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of ``multi-microlocalization'' was introduced to extend the usual microlocal sheaf theory to a more general scope. This paper aims to further extend this theory by exploring advanced topics. One is a stalk formula for multi-microlocalized Hom functors and we compute some examples in multi-microlocal settings. Secondly we construct the Sato's triangle in the context of multi-microlocal analysis. Ultimately we get the Sato's triangle for the multi-microlocalized Hom functors.</description>

      <title>Mathematical analysis of a Mu\~noz-Delgado model for cigar-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present mathematical analysis of one-dimensional effective models proposed in [\cite{MunozDelgado}] concerning Bose-Einstein condensates in the presence of harmonic confinement. Among the demonstrated properties, we can mention: existence, uniqueness, orbital stability, symmetry and gaussian asymptotic decay of ground-state solutions in the repulsive case. We also report formul\ae\ for the minimal energy $E_{\mn}$ and the associate chemical potential $\mu$ as functions of a parameter $\lambda$, which is related to $N$ (the number of atoms) and/or $a$ (the s-wave scattering length). By considering Taylor's development of the non-quadratic therm of the energy and using appropriate gaussian functions as approximations for the ground state, we present some numerical experiments to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz regularity for manifold-constrained ROF elliptic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the manifold-valued Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (ROF) model, which involves an initial datum $f$ mapping from a curved compact surface with smooth boundary to a complete, connected and smooth $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold. We prove the existence and uniqueness of minimizers under curvature restrictions on the target and topological ones on the range of $f$. We obtain a series of regularity results on the associated PDE system of a relaxed functional with Neumann boundary condition. We apply these results to the ROF model to obtain Lipschitz regularity of minimizers without further requirements on the convexity of the boundary. Additionally, we provide a versions of the regularity statement of independent interest: for 1-dimensional domains (related to signal denoising), local Lipschitz regularity (meaningful for image processing) and Lipschitz regularity for a version of the Mosolov problem coming from fluid mechanics.</description>

      <title>Quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger Equation involving Critical Hardy Potential and Choquard type Exponential nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the following quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation involving Hardy potential and Choquard type exponential nonlinearity with a parameter $\alpha$ \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
  - \Delta_N w - \Delta_N(|w|^{2\alpha}) |w|^{2\alpha - 2} w - \lambda \frac{|w|^{2\alpha N-2}w}{\left( |x| \log\left(\frac{R}{|x|} \right) \right)^N}
  = \left(\int_{\Omega} \frac{H(y,w(y))}{|x-y|^{\mu}}dy\right) h(x,w(x))\; \mbox{in }\; \Omega,
  w &gt; 0 \mbox{ in } \Omega \setminus \{ 0\}, \quad \quad w = 0 \mbox{ on } \partial \Omega, \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $N\geq 2$, $\alpha&gt;\frac12$, $0\leq \lambda&lt; \left(\frac{N-1}{N}\right)^N$, $0 &lt; \mu &lt; N$, $h : \mathbb R^N \times \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R$ is a continuous function with critical exponential growth in the sense of the Trudinger-Moser inequality and $H(x,t)= \int_{0}^{t} h(x,s) ds$ is the primitive of $h$. With the help of Mountain Pass Theorem and critical level which is obtained by the sequence of Moser functions, we establish the existence of a positive solution for a small range of $\lambda$. Moreover, we also investigate the existence of a positive solution for a non-homogeneous problem for every $0\leq \lambda &lt;\left(\frac{N-1}{N}\right)^N.$ To the best of our knowledge, the results obtained here are new even in case of $N$-Laplace equation with Hardy potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classical theory of linear second-order uniformly elliptic equations in divergence form whose solutions have H\"older continuous gradients, and prove versions of the generalized maximum principle, the $C^{1,\alpha}$-estimate, the Hopf-Oleinik lemma, the boundary weak Harnack inequality and the differential Harnack inequality, in which the constant is optimized with respect to the norms of the coefficients of the operator and the size of the domain. Our estimates are complemented by counterexamples which show their optimality. We also give applications to the Landis conjecture and spectral estimates.</description>

      <title>Existence of stationary solutions for some integro-differential equations with the double scale anomalous diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the investigation of the solvability of an integro-differential equation in the case of the double scale anomalous diffusion with a sum of two negative Laplacians in different fractional powers in R^3. The proof of the existence of solutions relies on a fixed point technique. Solvability conditions for the elliptic operators without the Fredholm property in unbounded domains are used.</description>

      <title>Assessment of a Threshold Method for Computing Activation Maps from Reconstructed Transmembrane Voltages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiographic imaging non-invasively reconstructs activation maps of the heart from temporal body surface potential maps by post-processing solutions of an inverse problem. Typically, activation times are detected through the maximal deflection of the temporal or spatial derivative of recovered extracellular or transmembrane potentials. However, this method can introduce artificial lines of block in the map, falsely indicating a pathology. Consequently, several complex algorithms have been developed in an attempt to smooth activation maps while preserving true discontinuities. We propose a straightforward method for computing activation maps from recovered transmembrane voltages, wherein activation time is defined as the first time a predefined threshold is crossed. We evaluate this thresholdbased method against traditional deflection-based methods using simulated data, following the approach of Shuler et al. [1]. Our findings indicate that the threshold method, when combined with classical Tikhonov regularization, produces smooth activation maps even in the presence of true lines of block. Given the variability in performance of deflectionbased methods compared to those reported in [1], we emphasize the difficulty of establishing a universally effective post-processing method for computing activation maps.</description>

      <title>On generalized Dirichlet integrals in the smooth and in the o-minimal setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact manifold $M$ equipped with smooth vector fields $X_1,\ldots, X_r$, we consider the generalized Dirichlet energy \[\mathbf{E}(f)= \sum_{j=1}^r\int_M |X_jf|^2\, dm,\] where $dm$ is a volume form, and ask if the set \[ \mathcal{B}=\{f\in L^2(M)\colon\,\mathbf{E}(f)+\lVert f\rVert_{L^2(M)}^2\leq 1 \} \] is precompact in $L^2(M)$. We find a geometric sufficient condition in terms of "iterated characteristic sets" and use it to show that, if the vector fields are tame (in the sense of o-minimality) and satisfy the H\"ormander condition of some order $s$ on a dense set of points, then the only obstruction to precompactness is the existence of a characteristic submanifold (i.e. a nonempty submanifold of positive codimension to which each $X_j$ is tangent). Implications for global regularity of sum-of-squares operators not necessarily satisfying H\"ormander condition are discussed in an appendix.</description>

      <title>Massless Dirac equation on spinor bundles over real hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a sharp-in-time dispersive estimate of the Dirac equation on spinor bundles over the real hyperbolic space. Compared with the Euclidean counterparts, our result shows that the dispersive estimate differs between short and long times, reflecting the intuitive influence of negative curvature on the dispersion. Moreover, the well-known equivalence between dispersive estimates for Dirac and wave propagators in the Euclidean setting no longer holds in this context. This finding suggests that spinor fields are affected by the geometry at infinity of the manifold. As a key application, we establish an improved global-in-time Strichartz estimate, in the sense that there is no loss of angular derivatives and the admissible set is larger than previously known results in other settings.</description>

      <title>Mixed Local-Nonlocal Operators and Singularity: A Multiple-Solution Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of multiple positive solutions for the following Dirichlet boundary value problem: \begin{equation*} \begin{aligned}
  -\Delta_p u + (-\Delta_p)^s u = \lambda \frac{f(u)}{u^{\beta}}\ \text{in} \ \Omega\newline
  u &gt;0\ \text{in} \ \Omega,\ u =0\ \text{in} \ \mathbb{R}^N \setminus \Omega \end{aligned} \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is an arbitrary bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with smooth boundary, $0\leq \beta&lt;1$ and $f$ is a non-decreasing $C^1$-function which is $p$-sublinear at infinity and satisfies $f(0)&gt;0$. By employing the method of sub- and supersolutions, we establish the existence of a positive solution for every $\lambda&gt;0$ and that of two positive solutions for a certain range of the parameter $\lambda$. In the non-singular case (i.e. when $\beta=0$) and in the linear case with singularity (i.e. when $p=2$ and $0&lt;\beta&lt;1$), we further apply Amann's fixed point theorem to show that the problem admits at least three positive solutions within this range of $\lambda$. The mixed local-nonlocal nature of the operator and the non-linearity pose challenges in constructing sub- and supersolutions, however, these are effectively addressed through the operator's homogeneity.</description>

      <title>Regularity properties of a generalized Oseen evolution operator in exterior domains, with applications to the Navier-Stokes initial value problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a generalized Oseen evolution operator in 3D exterior domains, that is generated by a non-autonomous linearized system arising from time-dependent rigid motions. This was found by Hansel and Rhandi, and then the theory was developed by the second author, however, desired regularity properties such as estimate of the temporal derivative as well as the Hoelder estimate have remained open. The present paper provides us with those properties together with weighted estimates of the evolution operator. The results are then applied to the Navier-Stokes initial value problem, so that a new theorem on existence of a unique strong Lq-solution locally in time is proved.</description>

      <title>Stability of Poiseuille Flow of Navier-Stokes Equations on $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{R}^2$ close to the Poiseuille flow with viscosity $0&lt; \nu &lt; 1$. For the linearized problem, we prove that when the $x$-frequency satisfy $|k| \ge \nu^{-\frac{1}{3}}$, the perturbation decays on a time-scale proportional to $\nu^{-\frac{1}{2}}|k|^{-\frac{1}{2}}$. Since it decays faster than the heat equation, this phenomenon is referred to as enhanced dissipation. Then we concern the non-linear equations. We show that if the initial perturbation $\omega_{in}$ is of size at most $\nu^\frac{7}{12}$ in an anisotropic Sobolev space, then it remains so for all time.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the unknown order of the fractional derivative in differential equations simulating various processes is an important task of modern applied mathematics. In the last decade, this problem has been actively studied by specialists. A number of interesting results with a certain applied significance were obtained. This paper provides a short overview of the most interesting works in this direction. Next, we consider the problem of determining the order of the fractional derivative in the subdiffusion equation, provided that the elliptic operator included in this equation has at least one negative eigenvalue. An asymptotic formula is obtained according to which, knowing the solution at least at one point of the domain under consideration, the required order can be calculated.</description>

      <title>Generic configurations in 2D strongly competing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a problem modelling segregation of an arbitrary number of competing species in planar domains. The solutions give rise to a well known free boundary problem with the domain partitioning itself into subdomains occupied by different species. In principle, several of them can coexist in a neighborhood of any point. However, we show that {\it generically} the domain partitions into subdomains with only triple junctions, meaning that at most three populations meet at the free boundary. Our main tools are the use of the formalism of harmonic maps into singular spaces and the introduction of a complex structure via the Hopf differential.</description>

      <title>Local high-degree polynomial integrals of geodesic flows and the generalized hodograph method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Riemannian metrics on 2-surfaces with integrable geodesic flows such that an additional first integral is high-degree polynomial in momenta. This problem reduces to searching for solutions to certain quasi-linear systems of PDEs which turn out to be semi-Hamiltonian. We construct plenty of local explicit and implicit integrable examples with polynomial first integrals of degrees 3, 4, 5. Our construction is essentially based on applying the generalized hodograph method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the target flow -- a specific curve shortening flow with an ambient forcing term -- that, given an embedded (not necessarily convex) target curve, will attempt to evolve a given source curve to that target. The motivation for this flow is to address a question of Yau. Our main result is that the target flow with uniformly normal graphical data converges smoothly to the target, broadening the class of known sources and targets such that Yau's problem has a solution.</description>

      <title>Kirchhoff's analogy for a planar ferromagnetic rod</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kirchhoff's kinetic analogy relates the equilibrium solutions of an elastic rod or strip to the motion of a spinning top. In this analogy, time is replaced by the arc length parameter in the phase portrait to determine the equilibrium configurations of the rod. Predicted equilibrium solutions from the phase portrait for specific boundary value problems, as well as certain localized solutions, have been experimentally observed. In this study, we employ the kinetic analogy to investigate the equilibrium solutions of planar soft ferromagnetic rods subjected to transverse and longitudinal external magnetic fields. Our analysis reveals a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation in the phase portrait of a ferromagnetic rod subjected to transverse external magnetic field as the axial load is decreased continuously from a large compressive load. Similarly, a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation is observed in the case of longitudinal external magnetic field. We predict equilibrium configurations for a free-standing soft ferromagnetic elastic rod and the same subjected to canonical boundary conditions. Furthermore, we observe novel localized equilibrium solutions arising from homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits, which are absent in the phase portraits of purely elastic rods.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions and reductions of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time, Schr\"odinger equations with cubic and more complex nonlinearities containing the unknown function with constant delay are analyzed. The physical considerations that can lead to the appearance of a delay in such nonlinear equations and mathematical models are expressed. One-dimensional non-symmetry reductions are described, which lead the studied partial differential equations with delay to simpler ordinary differential equations and ordinary differential equations with delay. New exact solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation of the general form with delay, which are expressed in quadratures, are found. To construct exact solutions, a combination of methods of generalized separation of variables and the method of functional constraints are used. Special attention is paid to three equations with cubic nonlinearity, which allow simple solutions in elementary functions, as well as more complex exact solutions with generalized separation of variables. Solutions representing a nonlinear superposition of two traveling waves, the amplitude of which varies periodically in time and space, are constructed. Some more complex nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations of a general form with variable delay are also studied. The results of this work can be useful for the development and improvement of mathematical models described by nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with delay and related functional PDEs, and the obtained exact solutions can be used as test problems intended to assess the accuracy of numerical methods for integrating nonlinear equations of mathematical physics with delay.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the Painlev\'e property to fractional differential equations (FDEs) are extended and the existence and uniqueness theorems for both linear and nonlinear FDEs are established. The results contribute to the research of integrability and solvability in the context of fractional calculus, which has significant implications in various fields such as physics, engineering, and applied sciences. By bridging the gap between pure mathematical theory and practical applications, this work provides a foundational understanding that can be utilized in modeling phenomena exhibiting memory and hereditary properties.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Global Attractor of 2D Incompressible Turbulence in the Palinstrophy-Enstrophy-Energy Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytic bounds on the projection of the global attractor of 2D incompressible turbulence in the palinstrophy--enstrophy plane [Dascaliuc, Foias, and Jolly 2005, 2010] are observed to vastly overestimate the values obtained from numerical simulations. This is due to the lack of a good estimate for the inner product $(\cal{B}(u,u),A^2u)$ of the advection term and the biLaplacian. Sobolev inequalities like Ladyzhenskaya or Agmon's inequalities yield an upper bound that we show is not sharp. In fact, for statistically isotropic turbulence, the expected value of $(\cal{B}(u,u),A^2u)$ is zero. The implications for estimates on the behaviour of the global attractor are discussed.</description>

      <title>Coulomb Gauges and Regularity for Stationary Weak Yang$-$Mills Connections in Supercritical Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that stationary Yang$-$Mills fields in dimensions 5 belonging to the variational class of weak connections are smooth away from a closed singular set $S$ of vanishing 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Our proof is based on an $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem, which generalizes to this class of weak connections the existing previous $\varepsilon$-regularity results by G. Tian for smooth connections, by Y. Meyer and the second author for Sobolev and approximable connections, and by T. Tao and G. Tian for admissible connections (which are weak limits of smooth Yang$-$Mills fields). On the path towards establishing $\varepsilon$-regularity, a pivotal step is the construction of controlled Coulomb gauges for general weak connections under small Morrey norm assumptions.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the numerical investigation by Aoki et al. [1], we study a rarefied gas flow between two parallel infinite plates of the same temperature governed by the Boltzmann equation with diffuse reflection boundaries, where one plate is at rest and the other one oscillates in its normal direction periodically in time. For such boundary-value problem, we establish the existence of a time-periodic solution with the same period, provided that the amplitude of the oscillating boundary is suitably small. The positivity of the solution is also proved basing on the study of its large-time asymptotic stability for the corresponding initial-boundary value problem. For the proof of existence, we develop uniform estimates on the approximate solutions in the time-periodic setting and make a bootstrap argument by reducing the coefficient of the extra penalty term from a large enough constant to zero.</description>

      <title>On the optimal $L^q$-regularity for viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equations with subquadratic growth in the gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.02676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a maximal $L^q$-regularity property for nonlinear elliptic equations of second order with a zero-th order term and gradient nonlinearities having superlinear and sub-quadratic growth, complemented with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The approach is based on the combination of linear elliptic regularity theory and interpolation inequalities, so that the analysis of the maximal regularity estimates boils down to determine lower order integral bounds. The latter are achieved via a $L^p$ duality method, which exploits the regularity properties of solutions to stationary Fokker-Planck equations. For the latter problems, we discuss both global and local estimates. Our main novelties for the regularity properties of this class of nonlinear elliptic boundary-value problems are the treatment of equations with a zero-th order term together with the analysis of the end-point summability threshold $q=d(\gamma-1)/\gamma$, $d$ being the dimension of the ambient space and $\gamma&gt;1$ the growth of the first-order term in the gradient variable.</description>

      <title>Compactness of Green operators with applications to semilinear nonlocal elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of integro-differential operators $\mathbb{L}$ posed on a $C^2$ bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ with appropriate homogeneous Dirichlet conditions where each of which admits an inverse operator commonly known as the Green operator $\mathbb{G}^{\Omega}$. Under mild conditions on $\mathbb{L}$ and its Green operator, we establish various sharp compactness of $\mathbb{G}^{\Omega}$ involving weighted Lebesgue spaces and weighted measure spaces. These results are then employed to prove the solvability for semilinear elliptic equation $\mathbb{L} u + g(u) = \mu$ in $\Omega$ with boundary condition $u=0$ on $\partial \Omega$ or exterior condition $u=0$ in $\mathbb{R}^N \setminus \Omega$ if applicable, where $\mu$ is a Radon measure on $\Omega$ and $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a nondecreasing continuous function satisfying a subcriticality integral condition. When $g(t)=|t|^{p-1}t$ with $p&gt;1$, we provide a sharp sufficient condition expressed in terms of suitable Bessel capacities for the existence of a solution. The contribution of the paper consists of (i) developing novel unified techniques which allow to treat various types of fractional operators and (ii) obtaining sharp compactness and existence results in weighted spaces, which refine and extend several related results in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we prove interior a priori first- and second-order estimates for solutions of fully nonlinear degenerate elliptic inequalities structured over the vector fields of Carnot groups, under the main assumption that $u$ is semiconvex along the fields. These estimates for supersolutions are new even for linear subelliptic inequalities in nondivergence form, whereas in the nonlinear setting they do not require neither convexity nor concavity on the second derivatives. We complement the analysis exhibiting an explicit example showing that horizontal $W^{2,q}$ regularity of Calder\'on-Zygmund type for fully nonlinear subelliptic equations posed on the Heisenberg group cannot be in general expected in the range $q&lt;Q$, $Q$ being the homogeneous dimension of the group.</description>

      <title>Gradient regularity for mixed local-nonlocal quasilinear parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove local H\"older continuity for the spatial gradient of weak solutions to $$u_t - \text{div} (|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u) + \text{P.V.} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \frac{|u(x,t) - u(y,t)|^{p-2}(u(x,t)-u(y,t))}{|x-y|^{n+ps}} \ dy = 0.$$ It is easy to see that parabolic quasilinear equations are not scaling invariant and this led to the development of the method of intrinsic scaling by E.DiBenedetto, E.DiBenedetto-Y.Z.Chen, J.Kinnunen-J.Lewis and A.Friedman-E.DiBenedetto. In a very recent paper, C.de Filippis-G.Mingione proved gradient H\"older continuity for mixed local-nonlocal quasilinear elliptic equations and in this paper, we extend this result to the parabolic case. Since we only expect regularity for $\nabla_x u$ in the parabolic setting, it is not clear how to extend the elliptic proof to the parabolic case. In order to overcome this difficulty, we instead follow the ideas developed by T.Kuusi-G.Mingione combined with the novel tail estimates of C.deFilippis-G.Mingione. An advantage of our approach is that we can obtain both $C^{1,\alpha}_x$ regularity as well as $C^{0,1} _x$ potential estimates in one go. Moreover, we do not need to make use of any form of Caccioppoli inequality and instead, the regularity is obtained only through a suitable difference estimate.</description>

      <title>A strict maximum principle for nonlocal minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the setting of fractional minimal surfaces, we prove that if two nonlocal minimal sets are one included in the other and share a common boundary point, then they must necessarily coincide.
  This strict maximum principle is not obvious, since the surfaces may touch at an irregular point, therefore a suitable blow-up analysis must be combined with a bespoke regularity theory to obtain this result.
  For the classical case, an analogous result was proved by Leon Simon. Our proof also relies on a Harnack Inequality for nonlocal minimal surfaces that has been recently introduced by Xavier Cabr\'e and Matteo Cozzi and which can be seen as a fractional counterpart of a classical result by Enrico Bombieri and Enrico Giusti.
  In our setting, an additional difficulty comes from the analysis of the corresponding nonlocal integral equation on a hypersurface, which presents a remainder whose sign and fine properties need to be carefully addressed.</description>

Using ideias of Killip, Visan, Zhang, Oh, Wang, we prove that the IVP associated to the h-NLS equation is globally well-posed in the modulation spaces $M^{s,p}$ for $s\geq\frac14$ and $p\geq2$.</description>

      <title>Limiting behavior of minimizing $p$-harmonic maps in 3d as $p$ goes to $2$ with finite fundamental group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the limiting behavior of minimizing $p$-harmonic maps from a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{3}$ to a compact connected Riemannian manifold without boundary and with finite fundamental group as $p \nearrow 2$. We prove that there exists a closed set $S_{*}$ of finite length such that minimizing $p$-harmonic maps converge to a locally minimizing harmonic map in $\Omega \setminus S_{*}$. We prove that locally inside $\Omega$ the singular set $S_{*}$ is a finite union of straight line segments, and it minimizes the mass in the appropriate class of admissible chains. Furthermore, we establish local and global estimates for the limiting singular harmonic map. Under additional assumptions, we prove that globally in $\overline{\Omega}$ the set $S_{*}$ is a finite union of straight line segments, and it minimizes the mass in the appropriate class of admissible chains, which is defined by a given boundary datum and $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Stability of equilibria of the spatially inhomogeneous Vicsek-BGK equation across a bifurcation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vicsek-BGK equation is a kinetic model for alignment of particles moving with constant speed between stochastic reorientation events with sampling from a von Mises distribution. The spatially homogeneous model shows a steady state bifurcation with exchange of stability. The main result of this work is an extension of the bifurcation result to the spatially inhomogeneous problem under the additional assumption of a sufficiently large Knudsen number. The mathematical core is the proof of linearized stability, which employs a new hypocoercivity approach based on Laplace-Fourier transformation. The bifurcation result includes global existence of smooth solutions for close-to-equilibrium initial data. For large data smooth solutions might blow up in finite time whereas weak solutions with bounded Boltzmann entropy are shown to exist globally.</description>

      <title>On the orbital stability of solitary waves for the fourth order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present new results regarding the orbital stability of solitary standing waves for the general fourth-order Schr\"odinger equation with mixed dispersion. The existence of solitary waves can be determined both as minimizers of a constrained complex functional and by using a numerical approach. In addition, for specific values of the frequency associated with the standing wave, one obtains explicit solutions with a hyperbolic secant profile. Despite these explicit solutions being minimizers of the constrained functional, they cannot be seen as a smooth curve of solitary waves, and this fact prevents their determination of stability using classical approaches in the current literature. To overcome this difficulty, we employ a numerical approach to construct a smooth curve of solitary waves. The existence of a smooth curve is useful for showing the existence of a threshold power $\alpha_0\approx 4.8$ of the nonlinear term such that if $\alpha\in (0,\alpha_0),$ the explicit solitary wave is stable, and if $\alpha&gt;\alpha_0$, the wave is unstable. An important feature of our work, caused by the presence of the mixed dispersion term, concerns the fact that the threshold value $\alpha_0 \approx 4.8$ is not the same as that established for proving the existence of global solutions in the energy space, as is well known for the classical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

Abstract: We study the stability of spectrally stable, strictly monotone, smooth shear flows in the 2D Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{T} \times \mathbb{R}$ with small viscosity $\nu$. We establish nonlinear stability in $H^s$ for $s \geq 2$ with a threshold of size $\epsilon \nu^{1/3}$ for time smaller than $c_*\nu^{-1}$ with $\epsilon, c_* \ll 1$. Additionally, we demonstrate nonlinear inviscid damping and enhanced dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adapt Stein's method to isoperimetric and geometric inequalities. The main challenge is the treatment of boundary terms. We address this by using an elliptic PDE with an oblique boundary condition. We apply our geometric formulation of Stein's method to obtain stability of the Brock-Weinstock inequality, stability of the isoperimetric inequality under a constraint on Steklov's first non-zero eigenvalue, and stability for the combination of weighted and unweighted perimeters. All stability results are formulated with respect to the $\alpha$-Zolotarev distance, $\alpha$ $\in$ (0, 1], that we introduce to interpolate between the Fraenkel asymmetry and the Kantorovich distance.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the almost sure well-posedness theory and orbital stability for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with potential \begin{equation*}
  \left\{\begin{array}{l} i \partial_t u+\Delta u-V(x)u+|u|^{2}u=0,\ (x, t) \in \mathbb{R}^4 \times \mathbb{R}, \\ \left.u\right|_{t=0}=f \in H ^s(\mathbb{R}^4), \end{array}\right. \end{equation*} where $\frac{1}{3}&lt;s&lt;1$ and $V(x):\mathbb{R}^4\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfies appropriate conditions. The main idea in the proofs is based on Strichartz spaces as well as variants of local smoothing, inhomogeneous local smoothing and maximal function spaces. To our best knowledge, this is the first orbital stability result for this model.</description>

      <title>Physical Meaning of Neumann and Robin Boundary Conditions for the Schr\"odinger Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-relativistic Schr\"odinger equation on a domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with boundary is often considered with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions ($\psi(x)=0$ for $x$ on the boundary), homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions ($\partial_n \psi(x)=0$ for $x$ on the boundary and $\partial_n$ the normal derivative), or Robin boundary conditions ($\partial_n\psi(x)=\alpha\psi(x)$ for $x$ on the boundary and $\alpha$ a real parameter). Physically, the Dirichlet condition applies if the potential is much higher outside than inside the domain (``potential well''). We ask, when does the Neumann or Robin condition apply physically? Our answer is, when the potential is much lower (at the appropriate level) in a thin layer along the surface of a potential well, or when a negative delta potential of the appropriate strength is added at a surface close to the surface of the potential well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12545v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a multilevel Picard approximation algorithm for general semilinear parabolic PDEs with gradient-dependent nonlinearities whose coefficient functions do not need to be constant. We also provide a full convergence and complexity analysis of our algorithm. To obtain our main results, we consider a particular stochastic fixed-point equation (SFPE) motivated by the Feynman-Kac representation and the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula. We show that the PDE under consideration has a unique viscosity solution which coincides with the first component of the unique solution of the stochastic fixed-point equation. Moreover, the gradient of the unique viscosity solution of the PDE exists and coincides with the second component of the unique solution of the stochastic fixed-point equation. Furthermore, we also provide a numerical example in up to $300$ dimensions to demonstrate the practical applicability of our multilevel Picard algorithm.</description>

      <title>Moving-Horizon Estimators for Hyperbolic and Parabolic PDEs in 1-D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observers for PDEs are themselves PDEs. Therefore, producing real time estimates with such observers is computationally burdensome. For both finite-dimensional and ODE systems, moving-horizon estimators (MHE) are operators whose output is the state estimate, while their inputs are the initial state estimate at the beginning of the horizon as well as the measured output and input signals over the moving time horizon. In this paper we introduce MHEs for PDEs which remove the need for a numerical solution of an observer PDE in real time. We accomplish this using the PDE backstepping method which, for certain classes of both hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs, produces moving-horizon state estimates explicitly. Precisely, to explicitly produce the state estimates, we employ a backstepping transformation of a hard-to-solve observer PDE into a target observer PDE, which is explicitly solvable. The MHEs we propose are not new observer designs but simply the explicit MHE realizations, over a moving horizon of arbitrary length, of the existing backstepping observers. Our PDE MHEs lack the optimality of the MHEs that arose as duals of MPC, but they are given explicitly, even for PDEs. In the paper we provide explicit formulae for MHEs for both hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs, as well as simulation results that illustrate theoretically guaranteed convergence of the MHEs.</description>

      <title>Adaptive control of reaction-diffusion PDEs via neural operator-approximated gain kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operator approximations of the gain kernels in PDE backstepping has emerged as a viable method for implementing controllers in real time. With such an approach, one approximates the gain kernel, which maps the plant coefficient into the solution of a PDE, with a neural operator. It is in adaptive control that the benefit of the neural operator is realized, as the kernel PDE solution needs to be computed online, for every updated estimate of the plant coefficient. We extend the neural operator methodology from adaptive control of a hyperbolic PDE to adaptive control of a benchmark parabolic PDE (a reaction-diffusion equation with a spatially-varying and unknown reaction coefficient). We prove global stability and asymptotic regulation of the plant state for a Lyapunov design of parameter adaptation. The key technical challenge of the result is handling the 2D nature of the gain kernels and proving that the target system with two distinct sources of perturbation terms, due to the parameter estimation error and due to the neural approximation error, is Lyapunov stable. To verify our theoretical result, we present simulations achieving calculation speedups up to 45x relative to the traditional finite difference solvers for every timestep in the simulation trajectory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the strict positivity and the compact support property of solutions to the one-dimensional nonlinear stochastic heat equation: $$\partial_t u(t,x) = \frac{1}{2}\partial^2_x u(t,x) + \sigma(u(t,x))\dot{W}(t,x), \quad (t,x)\in \mathbf{R}_+\times\mathbf{R},$$ with nonnegative and compactly supported initial data $u_0$, where $\dot{W}$ is the space-time white noise and $\sigma:\mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R} $ is a continuous function with $\sigma(0)=0$. We prove that (i) if $v/ \sigma(v)$ is sufficiently large near $v=0$, then the solution $u(t,\cdot)$ is strictly positive for all $t&gt;0$, and (ii) if $v/\sigma(v)$ is sufficiently small near $v= 0$, then the solution $u(t,\cdot)$ has compact support for all $t&gt;0$. These findings extend previous results concerning the strict positivity and the compact support property, which were analyzed only for the case $\sigma(u)\approx u^\gamma$ for $\gamma&gt;0$. Additionally, we establish the uniqueness of a solution and the weak comparison principle in case (i).</description>

Abstract: We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for viability of evolution inclusions with locally monotone operators in the sense of Liu and R\"ockner [J. Funct. Anal., 259 (2010), pp. 2902-2922]. This allows us to prove wellposedness of lower semicontinuous solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations associated to the optimal control of evolution inclusions. Thereby, we generalize results in Bayraktar and Keller [J. Funct. Anal., 275 (2018), pp. 2096-2161] on Hamilton-Jacobi equations in infinite dimensions with monotone operators in several ways. First, we permit locally monotone operators. This extends the applicability of our theory to a wider class of equations such as Burgers' equations, reaction-diffusion equations, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations. Second, our results apply to optimal control problems with state constraints. Third, we have uniqueness of viscosity solutions. Our results on viability and lower semicontinuous solutions are new even in the case of monotone operators.</description>

      <title>Large deviations principle for invariant measures of stochastic Burgers equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the small noise asymptotic for stochastic Burgers equations on $(0,1)$ with Dirichlet boundary condition. We consider the case that the noise is more singular than space-time white noise. We let the noise magnitude $\sqrt{\epsilon} \rightarrow 0$ and the covariance operator $Q_\epsilon$ is convergent to $(-\Delta)^{\frac 1 2}$ and prove a large deviations principle for solutions, uniformly with respect to the initial value of equation. Furthermore, we set $Q_\epsilon$ to be a trace class operator and converge to $(-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ with $\alpha&lt;1$ in a suitable way such that the invariant measures exist. Then, we prove the large deviations principle for the invariant measures of stochastic Burgers equations.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness in a Hartree-Fock model for graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphene is a monolayer graphitic film where electrons behave like two-dimensional Dirac fermions without mass. Its study has attracted a wide interest in the domain of condensed matter physics. In particular, it represents an ideal system to test the comprehension of 2D massless relativistic particles in a laboratory, the Fermi velocity being $300$ times smaller than the speed of light. In this work, we present a global well-posedness result for graphene in the Hartree-Fock approximation. The model allows to describe the time evolution of graphene in the presence of external electric fields, such as those induced by local defects in the monolayer of carbon atoms. Our approach is based on a well established non-perturbative framework originating from the study of three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics.</description>
