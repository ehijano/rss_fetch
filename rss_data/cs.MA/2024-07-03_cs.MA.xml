      <title>Impact of the Network Size and Frequency of Information Receipt on Polarization in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01788</link>

Abstract: Opinion Dynamics is an interdisciplinary area of research. Psychology and Sociology have proposed models of how individuals form opinions and how social interactions influence this process. Socio-Physicists have interpreted patterns in opinion formation as arising from non-linearity in the underlying process, shaping the models. Agent-based modeling has offered a platform to study the Opinion Dynamics of large groups. This paper recasts recent models in opinion formation into a proper dynamical system, injecting the idea of clock time into evolving opinions. The time interval between successive receipts of new information (frequency of information receipts) becomes a factor to study. Social media has shrunk time intervals between information receipts, increasing their frequency. The recast models show that shorter intervals and larger networks increase an individual's propensity for polarization, defined as an inability to hold a neutral opinion. A Polarization number based on sociological parameters is proposed, with critical values beyond which individuals are prone to polarization, depending on psychological parameters. Reduced time intervals and larger interacting groups can push the Polarization number to critical values, contributing to polarization. The Extent of Polarization is defined as the width of the region around neutral within which an individual cannot hold an opinion. Results are reported for model parameters found in the literature. The findings offer an opportunity to adjust model parameters to align with empirical evidence, aiding the study of Opinion Dynamics in large social networks using Agent-Based Modeling.</description>

      <title>Distributed Instruments for Planetary Surface Science: Scientific Opportunities and Technology Feasibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we assess the scientific promise and technology feasibility of distributed instruments for planetary science. A distributed instrument is an instrument designed to collect spatially and temporally correlated data from multiple networked, geographically distributed point sensors. Distributed instruments are ubiquitous in Earth science, where they are routinely employed for weather and climate science, seismic studies and resource prospecting, and detection of industrial emissions. However, to date, their adoption in planetary surface science has been minimal. It is natural to ask whether this lack of adoption is driven by low potential to address high-priority questions in planetary science; immature technology; or both. To address this question, we survey high-priority planetary science questions that are uniquely well-suited to distributed instruments. We identify four areas of research where distributed instruments hold promise to unlock answers that are largely inaccessible to monolithic sensors, namely, weather and climate studies of Mars; localization of seismic events on rocky and icy bodies; localization of trace gas emissions, primarily on Mars; and magnetometry studies of internal composition. Next, we survey enabling technologies for distributed sensors and assess their maturity. We identify sensor placement (including descent and landing on planetary surfaces), power, and instrument autonomy as three key areas requiring further investment to enable future distributed instruments. Overall, this work shows that distributed instruments hold great promise for planetary science, and paves the way for follow-on studies of future distributed instruments for Solar System in-situ science.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Age of Information in Vehicular Edge Computing with Federated Graph Neural Network Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02342</link>

Abstract: With the rapid development of intelligent vehicles and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), the sensors such as cameras and LiDAR installed on intelligent vehicles provides higher capacity of executing computation-intensive and delay-sensitive tasks, thereby raising deployment costs. To address this issue, Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has been proposed to process data through Road Side Units (RSUs) to support real-time applications. This paper focuses on the Age of Information (AoI) as a key metric for data freshness and explores task offloading issues for vehicles under RSU communication resource constraints. We adopt a Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) approach, allowing vehicles to autonomously make optimal data offloading decisions. However, MADRL poses risks of vehicle information leakage during communication learning and centralized training. To mitigate this, we employ a Federated Learning (FL) framework that shares model parameters instead of raw data to protect the privacy of vehicle users. Building on this, we propose an innovative distributed federated learning framework combining Graph Neural Networks (GNN), named Federated Graph Neural Network Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (FGNN-MADRL), to optimize AoI across the system. For the first time, road scenarios are constructed as graph data structures, and a GNN-based federated learning framework is proposed, effectively combining distributed and centralized federated aggregation. Furthermore, we propose a new MADRL algorithm that simplifies decision making and enhances offloading efficiency, further reducing the decision complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach to other methods through simulations.</description>

      <title>BMW Agents -- A Framework For Task Automation Through Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>

Abstract: Autonomous agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) offer enormous potential for automation. Early proof of this technology can be found in various demonstrations of agents solving complex tasks, interacting with external systems to augment their knowledge, and triggering actions. In particular, workflows involving multiple agents solving complex tasks in a collaborative fashion exemplify their capacity to operate in less strict and less well-defined environments. Thus, a multi-agent approach has great potential for serving as a backbone in many industrial applications, ranging from complex knowledge retrieval systems to next generation robotic process automation. Given the reasoning abilities within the current generation of LLMs, complex processes require a multi-step approach that includes a plan of well-defined and modular tasks. Depending on the level of complexity, these tasks can be executed either by a single agent or a group of agents. In this work, we focus on designing a flexible agent engineering framework with careful attention to planning and execution, capable of handling complex use case applications across various domains. The proposed framework provides reliability in industrial applications and presents techniques to ensure a scalable, flexible, and collaborative workflow for multiple autonomous agents working together towards solving tasks.</description>

      <title>Shall We Team Up: Exploring Spontaneous Cooperation of Competing LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been utilized in social simulations, where they are often guided by carefully crafted instructions to stably exhibit human-like behaviors during simulations. Nevertheless, we doubt the necessity of shaping agents' behaviors for accurate social simulations. Instead, this paper emphasizes the importance of spontaneous phenomena, wherein agents deeply engage in contexts and make adaptive decisions without explicit directions. We explored spontaneous cooperation across three competitive scenarios and successfully simulated the gradual emergence of cooperation, findings that align closely with human behavioral data. This approach not only aids the computational social science community in bridging the gap between simulations and real-world dynamics but also offers the AI community a novel method to assess LLMs' capability of deliberate reasoning.</description>

      <title>Artificial Leviathan: Exploring Social Evolution of LLM Agents Through the Lens of Hobbesian Social Contract Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer an opportunity for computational social science research at scale. Building upon prior explorations of LLM agent design, our work introduces a simulated agent society where complex social relationships dynamically form and evolve over time. Agents are imbued with psychological drives and placed in a sandbox survival environment. We conduct an evaluation of the agent society through the lens of Thomas Hobbes's seminal Social Contract Theory (SCT). We analyze whether, as the theory postulates, agents seek to escape a brutish "state of nature" by surrendering rights to an absolute sovereign in exchange for order and security. Our experiments unveil an alignment: Initially, agents engage in unrestrained conflict, mirroring Hobbes's depiction of the state of nature. However, as the simulation progresses, social contracts emerge, leading to the authorization of an absolute sovereign and the establishment of a peaceful commonwealth founded on mutual cooperation. This congruence between our LLM agent society's evolutionary trajectory and Hobbes's theoretical account indicates LLMs' capability to model intricate social dynamics and potentially replicate forces that shape human societies. By enabling such insights into group behavior and emergent societal phenomena, LLM-driven multi-agent simulations, while unable to simulate all the nuances of human behavior, may hold potential for advancing our understanding of social structures, group dynamics, and complex human systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring 6G Potential for Industrial Digital Twinning and Swarm Intelligence in Obstacle-Rich Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of 6G technology, the demand for efficient and intelligent systems in industrial applications has surged, driving the need for advanced solutions in target localization. Utilizing swarm robots to locate unknown targets involves navigating increasingly complex environments. Digital Twinning (DT) offers a robust solution by creating a virtual replica of the physical world, which enhances the swarm's navigation capabilities. Our framework leverages DT and integrates Swarm Intelligence to store physical map information in the cloud, enabling robots to efficiently locate unknown targets. The simulation results demonstrate that the DT framework, augmented by Swarm Intelligence, significantly improves target location efficiency in obstacle-rich environments compared to traditional methods. This research underscores the potential of combining DT and Swarm Intelligence to advance the field of robotic navigation and target localization in complex industrial settings.</description>
