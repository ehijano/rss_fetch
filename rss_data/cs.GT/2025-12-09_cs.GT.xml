      <title>Strategic Experimentation with Private Payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a strategic experimentation game with exponential bandits, in which experiment outcomes are private. The equilibrium amount of experimentation is always higher than in the benchmark case where experiment outcomes are publicly observed. In addition, for pure equilibria, the equilibrium amount of experimentation is at least socially optimal, and possibly higher. We provide a tight bound on the degree of over-experimentation. The analysis rests on a new form of encouragement effect, according to which a player may hide the absence of a success to encourage future experimentation by the other player, which incentivizes current experimentation.</description>

      <title>The Communication Complexity of Combinatorial Auctions with Additional Succinct Bidders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the communication complexity of welfare maximization in combinatorial auctions with bidders from either a standard valuation class (which require exponential communication to explicitly state, such as subadditive or XOS), or arbitrary succinct valuations (which can be fully described in polynomial communication, such as single-minded). Although succinct valuations can be efficiently communicated, we show that additional succinct bidders have a nontrivial impact on communication complexity of classical combinatorial auctions. Specifically, let $n$ be the number of subadditive/XOS bidders. We show that for SA $\cup$ SC (the union of subadditive and succinct valuations): (1) There is a polynomial communication $3$-approximation algorithm; (2) As $n \to \infty$, there is a matching $3$-hardness of approximation, which (a) is larger than the optimal approximation ratio of $2$ for SA, and (b) holds even for SA $\cup$ SM (the union of subadditive and single-minded valuations); and (3) For all $n \geq 3$, there is a constant separation between the optimal approximation ratios for SA $\cup$ SM and SA (and therefore between SA $\cup$ SC and SA as well). Similarly, we show that for XOS $\cup$ SC: (1) There is a polynomial communication $2$-approximation algorithm; (2) As $n \to \infty$, there is a matching $2$-hardness of approximation, which (a) is larger than the optimal approximation ratio of $e/(e-1)$ for XOS, and (b) holds even for XOS $\cup$ SM; and (3) For all $n \geq 2$, there is a constant separation between the optimal approximation ratios for XOS $\cup$ SM and XOS (and therefore between XOS $\cup$ SC and XOS as well).</description>

      <title>Learning Paths to Multi-Sector Equilibrium: Belief Dynamics Under Uncertain Returns to Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the dynamics of learning in a multi-sector general equilibrium model where firms operate under incomplete information about their production returns to scale. Firms iteratively update their beliefs using maximum a-posteriori estimation, derived from observed production outcomes, to refine their knowledge of their returns to scale. The implications of these learning dynamics for market equilibrium and the conditions under which firms can effectively learn their true returns to scale are the key objects of this study. Our results shed light on how idiosyncratic shocks influence the learning process and demonstrate that input decisions encode all pertinent information for belief updates. Additionally, we show that a long-memory (path-dependent) learning which keeps track of all past estimations ends up having a worse performance than a short-memory (path-independent) approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the aim of meeting the worlds net-zero objectives, electricity trading through contractual agreements is becoming increasingly relevant in global and local energy markets. We develop contracts enabling efficient energy trading using Vehicle to Everything technology which can be applied to regulate energy markets and reduce costs and carbon emissions by using electric vehicles with bidirectional batteries to store energy during offpeak hours for export during peak hours. We introduce a contract based on the VCG mechanism which enables fleets of electric vehicles to export electricity to the grid efficiently throughout the day, where each electric vehicle has its energy consumption and exporting schedules and costs.</description>

      <title>AI-Generated Compromises for Coalition Formation: Modeling, Simulation, and a Textual Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenge of finding compromises between agent proposals is fundamental to AI sub-fields such as argumentation, mediation, and negotiation. Building on this tradition, Elkind et al. (2021) introduced a process for coalition formation that seeks majority-supported proposals preferable to the status quo, using a metric space where each agent has an ideal point. The crucial step in this iterative process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent coalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals, however, remains an open question. We address this gap by formalizing a holistic model that encompasses agent bounded rationality and uncertainty and developing AI models to generate such compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaboratively writing text documents -- e.g., to enable the democratic creation of a community constitution. We apply NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques and utilize LLMs (Large Language Models) to create a semantic metric space for text and develop algorithms to suggest suitable compromise points. To evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms, we simulate various coalition formation processes and demonstrate the potential of AI to facilitate large-scale democratic text editing, such as collaboratively drafting a constitution, an area where traditional tools are limited.</description>

      <title>Going All-In on LLM Accuracy: Fake Prediction Markets, Real Confidence Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used to evaluate other models, yet these judgments typically lack any representation of confidence. This pilot study tests whether framing an evaluation task as a betting game (a fictional prediction market with its own LLM currency) improves forecasting accuracy and surfaces calibrated confidence signals. We generated 100 math and logic questions with verifiable answers. Six Baseline models (three current-generation, three prior-generation) answered all items. Three Predictor models then forecasted, for each question-baseline pair, if the baseline would answer correctly. Each predictor completed matched runs in two conditions: Control (simple correct/incorrect predictions) and Incentive (predictions plus wagers of 1-100,000 LLMCoin under even odds, starting from a 1,000,000 LLMCoin bankroll). Across 5,400 predictions per condition, Incentive runs showed modestly higher accuracy (81.5% vs. 79.1%, p = .089, d = 0.86) and significantly faster learning across rounds (12.0 vs. 2.9 percentage-point improvement from Round 1 to Round 4, p = .011). Most notably, stake size tracked confidence. "Whale" bets of 40,000+ coins were correct ~99% of the time, while small bets (&lt;1,000 coins) showed only ~74% accuracy. The key finding is not that fictional money makes models smarter; accuracy gains were modest and did not reach statistical significance (p = .089) in this pilot. Rather, the betting mechanic created a legible confidence signal absent from binary yes/no outputs. This suggests that simple financial framing may help transform LLMs into risk-aware forecasters, making their internal beliefs visible and usable. The protocol offers a foundation for future work for meta-evaluation systems and what may become LLM-to-LLM prediction markets.</description>

      <title>Small-Gain Nash: Certified Contraction to Nash Equilibria in Differentiable Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical convergence guarantees for gradient-based learning in games require the pseudo-gradient to be (strongly) monotone in Euclidean geometry as shown by rosen(1965), a condition that often fails even in simple games with strong cross-player couplings. We introduce Small-Gain Nash (SGN), a block small-gain condition in a custom block-weighted geometry. SGN converts local curvature and cross-player Lipschitz coupling bounds into a tractable certificate of contraction. It constructs a weighted block metric in which the pseudo-gradient becomes strongly monotone on any region where these bounds hold, even when it is non-monotone in the Euclidean sense. The continuous flow is exponentially contracting in this designed geometry, and projected Euler and RK4 discretizations converge under explicit step-size bounds derived from the SGN margin and a local Lipschitz constant. Our analysis reveals a certified ``timescale band'', a non-asymptotic, metric-based certificate that plays a TTUR-like role: rather than forcing asymptotic timescale separation via vanishing, unequal step sizes, SGN identifies a finite band of relative metric weights for which a single-step-size dynamics is provably contractive. We validate the framework on quadratic games where Euclidean monotonicity analysis fails to predict convergence, but SGN successfully certifies it, and extend the construction to mirror/Fisher geometries for entropy-regularized policy gradient in Markov games. The result is an offline certification pipeline that estimates curvature, coupling, and Lipschitz parameters on compact regions, optimizes block weights to enlarge the SGN margin, and returns a structural, computable convergence certificate consisting of a metric, contraction rate, and safe step-sizes for non-monotone games.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Lane-Changing Behavior in Mixed Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing and understanding lane-changing behavior in the presence of automated vehicles (AVs) is crucial to ensuring safety and efficiency in mixed traffic. Accordingly, this study aims to characterize the interactions between the lane-changing vehicle (active vehicle) and the vehicle directly impacted by the maneuver in the target lane (passive vehicle). Utilizing real-world trajectory data from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), this study explores patterns in lane-changing behavior and provides insight into how these behaviors evolve under different AV market penetration rates (MPRs). In particular, we propose a game-theoretic framework to analyze cooperative and defective behaviors in mixed traffic, applied to the 7,636 observed lane-changing events in the WOMD. First, we utilize k-means clustering to classify vehicles as cooperative or defective, revealing that the proportions of cooperative AVs are higher than those of HDVs in both active and passive roles. Next, we jointly estimate the utilities of active and passive vehicles to model their behaviors using the quantal response equilibrium framework. Empirical payoff tables are then constructed based on these utilities. Using these payoffs, we analyze the presence of social dilemmas and examine the evolution of cooperative behaviors using evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal the presence of social dilemmas in approximately 4% and 11% of lane-changing events for active and passive vehicles, respectively, with most classified as Stag Hunt or Prisoner's Dilemma (Chicken Game rarely observed). Moreover, the Monte Carlo simulation results show that repeated lane-changing interactions consistently lead to increased cooperative behavior over time, regardless of the AV penetration rate.</description>

      <title>Understanding LLM Agent Behaviours via Game Theory: Strategy Recognition, Biases and Multi-Agent Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly operate as autonomous decision-makers in interactive and multi-agent systems and human societies, understanding their strategic behaviour has profound implications for safety, coordination, and the design of AI-driven social and economic infrastructures. Assessing such behaviour requires methods that capture not only what LLMs output, but the underlying intentions that guide their decisions. In this work, we extend the FAIRGAME framework to systematically evaluate LLM behaviour in repeated social dilemmas through two complementary advances: a payoff-scaled Prisoners Dilemma isolating sensitivity to incentive magnitude, and an integrated multi-agent Public Goods Game with dynamic payoffs and multi-agent histories. These environments reveal consistent behavioural signatures across models and languages, including incentive-sensitive cooperation, cross-linguistic divergence and end-game alignment toward defection. To interpret these patterns, we train traditional supervised classification models on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to FAIRGAME trajectories, showing that LLMs exhibit systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioural intentions, with linguistic framing at times exerting effects as strong as architectural differences. Together, these findings provide a unified methodological foundation for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and reveal systematic cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance, collective decision-making, and the design of safe multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Auction Design under Costly Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study optimal auction design in an independent private values environment where bidders can endogenously -- but at a cost -- improve information about their own valuations. The optimal mechanism is two-stage: at stage-1 bidders register an information acquisition plan and pay a transfer; at stage-2 they bid, and allocation and payments are determined. We show that the revenue-optimal stage-2 rule is the Vickrey--Clarke--Groves (VCG) mechanism, while stage-1 transfers implement the optimal screening of types and absorb information rents consistent with incentive compatibility and participation. By committing to VCG ex post, the pre-auction information game becomes a potential game, so equilibrium information choices maximize expected welfare; the stage-1 fee schedule then transfers an optimal amount of payoff without conditioning on unverifiable cost scales. The design is robust to asymmetric primitives and accommodates a wide range of information technologies, providing a simple implementation that unifies efficiency and optimal revenue in environments with endogenous information acquisition.</description>

Abstract: Combinatorial Game Theory(CGT)is a branch of Game Theory that has developed largely independently of Economic Game Theory (EGT), and is concerned with deep mathematical properties of two-player zero-sum games recursively defined over various combinatorial structures. The aim of this work is to lay the foundations for bridging the conceptual and technical gaps between CGT and EGT, here interpreted as multiplayer Extensive Form Games, so that they can be treated within a unified framework. More specifically, we introduce a class of $n$-player, general-sum games, called {\sc Cumulative Games}, which can be analyzed using tools from both CGT and EGT. We show how two of the most fundamental definitions of CGT, the outcome function and the disjunctive sum operator, naturally extend to the class of {\sc Cumulative Games}. The outcome function allows for efficient equilibrium computation under certain restrictions, while the disjunctive sum operator lets us define a partial order over games according to the advantage that a given player has. Finally, we show that any Extensive Form Game can be written as a {\sc Cumulative Game}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.03179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study contests where the designer's objective is an extension of the widely studied objective of maximizing the total output: The designer gets zero marginal utility from a player's output if the output of the player is very low or very high. We consider two variants of this setting, which correspond to two objective functions: binary threshold, where the designer's utility is a non-decreasing function of the number of players with output above a certain threshold; and linear threshold, where a player's contribution to the designer's utility is linear in her output if the output is between a lower and an upper threshold, and becomes constant below the lower and above the upper threshold. For both of these objectives, we study rank-order allocation contests and general contests. We characterize the contests that maximize the designer's objective and indicate techniques to efficiently compute them.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Meets Mechanism Design: Key Results and Some Novel Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanism design is essentially reverse engineering of games and involves inducing a game among strategic agents in a way that the induced game satisfies a set of desired properties in an equilibrium of the game. Desirable properties for a mechanism include incentive compatibility, individual rationality, welfare maximisation, revenue maximisation (or cost minimisation), fairness of allocation, etc. It is known from mechanism design theory that only certain strict subsets of these properties can be simultaneously satisfied exactly by any given mechanism. Often, the mechanisms required by real-world applications may need a subset of these properties that are theoretically impossible to be simultaneously satisfied. In such cases, a prominent recent approach is to use a deep learning based approach to learn a mechanism that approximately satisfies the required properties by minimizing a suitably defined loss function. In this paper, we present, from relevant literature, technical details of using a deep learning approach for mechanism design and provide an overview of key results in this topic. We demonstrate the power of this approach for three illustrative case studies: (a) efficient energy management in a vehicular network (b) resource allocation in a mobile network (c) designing a volume discount procurement auction for agricultural inputs. Section 6 concludes the paper.</description>

Abstract: Stories are records of our experiences and their analysis reveals insights into the nature of being human. Successful analyses are often interdisciplinary, leveraging mathematical tools to extract structure from stories and insights from structure. Historically, these tools have been restricted to one dimensional charts and dynamic social networks; however, modern AI offers the possibility of identifying more fully the plot structure, character incentives, and, importantly, counterfactual plot lines that the story could have taken but did not take. In this work, we use AI to model the structure of stories as game-theoretic objects, amenable to quantitative analysis. This allows us to not only interrogate each character's decision making, but also possibly peer into the original author's conception of the characters' world. We demonstrate our proposed technique on Shakespeare's famous Romeo and Juliet. We conclude with a discussion of how our analysis could be replicated in broader contexts, including real-life scenarios.</description>

      <title>Autodeleveraging: Impossibilities and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autodeleveraging (ADL) is a last-resort loss socialization mechanism for perpetual futures venues. It is triggered when solvency-preserving liquidations fail. Despite the dominance of perpetual futures in the crypto derivatives market, with over \$60 trillion of volume in 2024, there has been no formal study of ADL. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous model of ADL. We prove that ADL mechanisms face a fundamental \emph{trilemma}: no policy can simultaneously satisfy exchange \emph{solvency}, \emph{revenue}, and \emph{fairness} to traders. This impossibility theorem implies that as participation scales, a novel form of \emph{moral hazard} grows asymptotically, rendering `zero-loss' socialization impossible. Constructively, we show that three classes of ADL mechanisms can optimally navigate this trilemma to provide fairness, robustness to price shocks, and maximal exchange revenue. We analyze these mechanisms on the Hyperliquid dataset from October 10, 2025, when ADL was used repeatedly to close \$2.1 billion of positions in 12 minutes. By comparing our ADL mechanisms to the standard approaches used in practice, we demonstrate empirically that Hyperliquid's production queue overutilized ADL by $\approx 28\times$ relative to our optimal policy, imposing roughly \$653 million of unnecessary haircuts on winning traders. This comparison also suggests that Binance overutilized ADL far more than Hyperliquid. Our results both theoretically and empirically demonstrate that optimized ADL mechanisms can dramatically reduce the loss of trader profits while maintaining exchange solvency.</description>

      <title>Static Pricing Guarantees for Queueing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09168v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a general queueing system with price-sensitive customers in which the service provider seeks to balance two objectives, maximizing the average revenue rate and minimizing the average queue length. Customers arrive according to a Poisson process, observe an offered price, and decide to join the queue if their valuation exceeds the price. The queue is operated first-in first-out, can have multiple servers, and the service times are exponential. Our model represents applications in areas like make-to-order manufacturing, cloud computing, and food delivery.
  The optimal solution for our model is dynamic; the price changes as the state of the system changes. However, such dynamic pricing policies may be undesirable for a variety of reasons. In this work, we provide non-asymptotic performance guarantees for a simple and natural class of static pricing policies which charge a fixed price up to a certain occupancy threshold and then allow no more customers into the system. Despite the mixed-sign objective, we are able to show our policy can guarantee a constant fraction of the optimal dynamic pricing policy in the worst-case. We also show that our policy yields a family of bi-criteria approximations that simultaneously guarantee a constant fraction of the optimal revenue with at most a constant factor increase in expected queue length. For instance, our policy for the M/M/1 setting can be set so that its worst-case guarantees is at least 50, 66, 75, or 80% of the optimal revenue and at most a 0, 16, 54, or 100% increase in the optimal queue length, respectively. We also provide guarantees for settings with multiple servers as well as the expected sojourn time objective. In a large simulation, we show that our class of policies is at most 4% sub-optimal on average.</description>

      <title>Game of arrivals at a two queue network with heterogeneous customer routes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a queuing network that opens at a specified time, where customers are non-atomic and belong to different classes. Each class has its own route, and as is typical in the literature, the costs are a linear function of waiting and service completion time. We restrict ourselves to a two class, two queue network: this simplification is well motivated as the diversity in solution structure as a function of problem parameters is substantial even in this simple setting (e.g., a specific routing structure involves eight different regimes), suggesting a combinatorial blow up as the number of queues, routes and customer classes increase. We identify the unique Nash equilibrium customer arrival profile when the customer linear cost preferences are different. This profile is a function of problem parameters including the size of each class, service rates at each queue, and customer cost preferences. When customer cost preferences match, under certain parametric settings, the equilibrium arrival profiles may not be unique and may lie in a convex set. We further make a surprising observation that in some parametric settings, customers in one class may arrive in disjoint intervals. Further, the two classes may arrive in contiguous intervals or in overlapping intervals, and at varying rates within an interval, depending upon the problem parameters.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Priority-Neutral Matching Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of the set of priority-neutral matchings. These matchings, introduced by Reny (AER, 2022), generalize stable matchings by allowing for priority violations in a principled way that enables Pareto-improvements to stable matchings. Known results show that the set of priority-neutral matchings is a lattice, suggesting that these matchings may enjoy the same tractable theoretical structure as stable matchings.
  In this paper, we characterize priority-neutral matching lattices, and show that their structure is considerably more intricate than that of stable matching lattices. To begin, we show priority-neutral lattices are not distributive, an important property that characterizes stable lattices and is satisfied by many other lattice structures considered in matching theory and algorithm design. Then, in our main result, we show that priority-neutral lattices are in fact characterized by a more-involved property which we term being a "movement lattice," which allows for significant departures from the order theoretic properties of distributive (and hence stable) lattices. While our results show that priority-neutrality is more intricate than stability, they also establish tractable properties. Indeed, as a corollary of our main result, we obtain the first known polynomial-time algorithm for checking whether a given matching is priority-neutral.</description>

      <title>Seven kinds of equivalent models for generalized coalition logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coalition Logic is an important logic in logical research on strategic reasoning. In two recent papers, Li and Ju argued that generally, concurrent game models, models of Coalition Logic, have three too strong assumptions: seriality, independence of agents, and determinism. They presented eight coalition logics based on eight classes of general concurrent game models, determined by which of the three assumptions are met. In this paper, we show that each of the eight sets of valid formulas of the eight logics is determined by six other kinds of models, that is, single-coalition-first action models, single-coalition-first actual neighborhood models, clear grand-coalition-first action models, clear single-coalition-first actual neighborhood models, tree-like grand-coalition-first action models, and tree-like single-coalition-first actual neighborhood models.</description>

      <title>Matching Markets Meet LLMs: Algorithmic Reasoning with Ranked Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.</description>
