      <title>Effect of Helical Plasma Turbulence on the Diffusive $\beta$ Effect with Increasing Reynolds Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculated $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for plasma systems with increasing Reynolds numbers while maintaining a unit magnetic Prandtl number. For $\alpha$semi and $\beta$semi, we used large-scale magnetic data. Additionally, we calculated $\beta$theo using turbulent kinetic data. We reproduced large-scale magnetic fields, B, for each case and compared them with the simulation data. The results show that the $\alpha$, $\beta$, and B in each case are consistent with other approaches, particularly simulation results, as long as the nonlinear effects are not too strong. This indicates that magnetic effects need to be incorporated when nonlinearity becomes significant. Nonetheless, the consistent results between B and turbulent plasma motion suggest a theoretically sound approach. On the other hand, to explain the physical meanings of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, we introduced a field structure model. Although simple, this model effectively clarifies the roles of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, representing the electrodynamic induction effect and the fluid-like diffusion effect, respectively. The agreement between our method and direct numerical simulations, along with the physical interpretations, indicates that the complex interaction processes between turbulent plasma and magnetic fields can be analyzed using fundamental and conservative physical quantities. Furthermore, $\alpha$semi and $\beta$semi, which successfully reproduce the numerically calculated magnetic field, can serve as benchmarks for more rigorous theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Efficient calculation of the moments of runaway electron distribution functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma current instabilities can destabilize the plasma discharge and cool the plasma rapidly. In such $\textit{disruptions}$ or in the start-up phase of the reactor, inductive electric fields are generated which accelerate electrons to relativistic velocities, resulting in a beam of $\textit{runaway electrons}$. This can potentially damage the reactor vessel and must be avoided in future reactors such as ITER. Thus, the efficient simulation of the evolution of the runaway electron current is motivated for prediction, avoidance and attenuation of disruptions. In order to improve simulations based on a self-consistent calculation of the runaway electron current, the efficient computation of the moments of analytical runaway electron distribution functions is of interest. In this respect, the general procedure is carried out through the example of the distribution function of the $\textit{avalanche}$ generation of runaway electrons according to $\textit{F\"ul\"op et. al.}$. At this the runaway electron number density, the current density and the mean mass-related kinetic energy density, which result from the zeroth, first and second moment are considered. Their analysis is carried out analytically and numerically. By means of a ${\rm M{\small ATLAB}}$ implementation, suitable calculation rules are derived and analyzed with regard to runtime efficiency. Finally, a physical evaluation of the components and the magnitude of the current density vector as well as the kinetic energy density for the plasma parameter space constructed from electric field, electron density and electron temperature is carried out, applying the derived efficient calculation rules. In addition, the applicability of the selected distribution function is discussed on the basis of graphical depictions of the results.</description>

      <title>Particle Acceleration in Collisionless Magnetically Arrested Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first collisionless realization of black hole accretion consistent with a persistent magnetically arrested disk state. The accretion flow, consisting of an ion-electron disk plasma combined with magnetospheric pair creation effects, is simulated using first-principles general-relativistic particle-in-cell methods. The axisymmetric simulation is evolved over significant dynamical timescales during which a quasi-steady accretion state is reached with several magnetic flux eruption cycles. We include a realistic treatment of inverse Compton scattering and pair production, which allows for studying the interaction between the collisionless accretion flow and the pair-loaded jet. Our findings indicate that magnetic flux eruptions associated with equatorial magnetic reconnection within the black hole magnetosphere and the formation of spark gaps are locations of maximal particle acceleration. Flux eruptions, starting near the central black hole, can trigger Kelvin-Helmholtz-like vortices at the jet-disk interface that facilitate efficient mixing between disk and jet plasma. Transient periods of increased pair production following the magnetic flux eruptions and reconnection events are responsible for most of the highly accelerated particles.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional inference of divertor plasma characteristics: advancements to a multi-instrument Bayesian analysis system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An integrated data analysis system based on Bayesian inference has been developed for application to data from multiple diagnostics over the two-dimensional cross-section of tokamak divertors. Tests of the divertor multi-instrument Bayesian analysis system (D-MIBAS) on a synthetic data set (including realistic experimental uncertainties) generated from SOLPS-ITER predictions of the MAST-U divertor have been performed. The resulting inference was within 6\%, 5\% and 30\% median absolute percentage error of the SOLPS-predicted electron temperature, electron density and neutral atomic hydrogen density, respectively, across a two-dimensional poloidal cross-section of the MAST-U Super-X outer divertor.
  To accommodate molecular contributions to Balmer emission, an advanced emission model has been developed which is shown to be crucial for inference accuracy. Our D-MIBAS system utilises a mesh aligned to poloidal magnetic flux-surfaces, throughout the divertor, with plasma parameters assigned to each mesh vertex and collectively considered in the inference. This allowed comprehensive forward models to multiple diagnostics and the inclusion of expected physics. This is shown to be important for inference precision when including molecular contributions to Balmer emission. These developments pave the way for accurate two-dimensional electron temperature, electron density and neutral atomic hydrogen density inferences for MAST-U divertor experimental data for the first time.</description>

      <title>Bremsstrahlung Radiation Power in Fusion Plasmas Revisited: Towards Accurate Analytical Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In fusion plasmas, where electron temperatures $T_e$ range from keV to hundreds of keV, Bremsstrahlung radiation constitutes a significant energy loss mechanism. While various thermal average fitting formulas exist in the literature, their accuracy is limited, particularly for $T_e \leq 20$ keV with error $&gt;10\%$. Additionally, non-relativistic fitting formulas become invalid for $T_e \geq 50$ keV. The accurate calculation of Bremsstrahlung radiation is important for fusion gain study, especially of advanced fuels fusion. In this work, we develop new but still simple fitting formulas that are valid for electron temperatures ranging from small ($\lesssim0.1$ keV) to extreme relativistic range, with errors of less than 1\% even for high atomic number ions (e.g., $Z=30$), which could be sufficient for fusion plasma applications. Both electron-ion (e-i) and electron-electron (e-e) Bremsstrahlung radiations are considered. Both polynomial fitting with truncated ($t=k_BT_e/m_ec^2\leq10$) and one-fit-all formulas are provided. Additionally, we offer fitting formulas for e-i and e-e specifically for electron energies, which could prove useful in non-Maxwellian Bremsstrahlung radiation studies.</description>

      <title>Impact of pressure anisotropy on the cascade rate of Hall-MHD turbulence with biadiabatic ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of ion pressure anisotropy on the energy cascade rate of Hall-MHD turbulence with biadiabatic ions and isothermal electrons is evaluated in three-dimensional direct numerical simulations, using the exact (or third-order) law derived in \citet{simon_exact_2022}. It is shown that pressure anisotropy can enhance or reduce the cascade rate, depending on the scales, in comparison with the prediction of the exact law with isotropic pressure, by an amount that correlates well with pressure anisotropy $a_p=\frac{p_\perp}{p_\parallel}\neq1$ that develops in simulations initialized with an isotropic pressure (${a_p}_0=1$). A simulation with initial pressure anisotropy, ${a_p}_0=4$, confirms this trend, exhibiting a stronger impact on the cascade rate, both in the inertial range and at larger scales, close to the forcing scales. Furthermore, a Fourier-based numerical method, to compute exact laws in numerical simulations in the full $(\ell_\perp,\ell_\parallel)$ increment plane, is presented.</description>
