      <title>Self-trapping of active particles induced by non-reciprocal interactions in disordered media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered media is known to modify the transport properties of active matter depending on interactions between particles and with the substrate. Here we study systems of active particles with visual-like perception that co-align with the positions of perceived conspecifics, and anti-align with positions of static obstacles. We report a novel self-trapping mechanism of particles forming closed loops that progressively shrink, surrounding one or multiple obstacles.This mechanism corresponds to a pinning behavior preventing particle diffusion. Increased co-alignment strength is found to reduce loop shrinking time, although this effect reaches a plateau at higher strengths. Loops are found to initially exhibit local polar order, but eventually they transition to nematic states as they absorb more particles. We show a phase diagram demonstrating self-trapping occurs within a specific range of aperture angles of the vision cone.</description>

      <title>A Minkowski space embedding to understand Markov models dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To describe the behavior of Markov models as parameters are varied, I show how to embed the space of Markov models within a Minkowski space. This embedding maintains the inherent distance between different instances of the model. The coordinates of this embedding emerge from the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence and are expressed in terms of thermodynamic quantities, organizing the Minkowski space into equilibrium and nonequilibrium components. With this approach, we can visualize models dynamics and gain a thermodynamic interpretation of information geometric concepts, even in far-from-equilibrium scenarios. I illustrate this approach using an analytically solvable molecular motor model.</description>

      <title>Effective one-dimension reduction of multi-compartment complex systems dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A broad class of systems, including ecological, epidemiological, and sociological ones, are characterized by populations of individuals assigned to specific categories, e.g., a chemical species, an opinion or an epidemic state, that are modeled as compartments. Due to interactions and intrinsic dynamics, individuals are allowed to change category, leading to concentrations varying over time with complex behavior, typical of reaction-diffusion systems. While compartmental modeling provides a powerful framework for studying the dynamics of such populations and describe the spatiotemporal evolution of a system, it mostly relies on deterministic mean-field descriptions to deal with systems with many degrees of freedom. Here, we propose a method to alleviate some of the limitations of compartmental models by capitalizing on tools originating from quantum physics to systematically reduce multi-dimensional systems to an effective one-dimensional representation. Using this reduced system, we are able to not only investigate the mean-field dynamics and their critical behavior, but we can additionally study stochastic representations that capture fundamental features of the system. We demonstrate the validity of our formalism by studying the critical behavior of models widely adopted to study epidemic, ecological and economic systems.</description>

      <title>Extensive Long-Range Entanglement at Finite Temperatures from a Nonequilibrium Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal equilibrium states of local quantum many-body systems are notorious for their spatially decaying correlations, which place severe restrictions on the types of many-body entanglement structures that may be observed at finite temperatures. These restrictions may however be defied when an out-of-equilibrium steady state is considered instead. In this paper, we study the entanglement properties of free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice that contains a generic charge- and energy-conserving noninteracting impurity, and that is connected at its edges to two reservoirs with different equilibrium energy distributions. These distributions may differ in either temperature, chemical potential, or both, thereby inducing an external bias. We analytically derive exact asymptotic expressions for several quantum information measures -- the mutual information, its R\'enyi generalizations, and the fermionic negativity -- that quantify the correlation and entanglement between two subsystems located on opposite sides of the impurity. We show that all these measures scale (to a leading order) linearly with the overlap between one subsystem and the mirror image of the other (upon reflection of the latter about the impurity), independently of the distance between the subsystems. While a simple proportionality relation between the negativity and R\'enyi versions of the mutual information is observed to hold at zero temperature, it breaks down at finite temperatures, suggesting that these quantities represent strong long-range correlations of different origins. Our results generalize previous findings that were limited to the case of a chemical-potential bias at zero temperature, rigorously demonstrating that the effect of long-range volume-law entanglement is robust at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Local Symmetry Fluctuations of Electron Density in Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites have emerged as an exciting class of materials for applications in solar energy harvesting, optical devices, catalysis, and other photophysical applications. Many of the exciting properties of halide perovskites are tied to their soft, dynamic, and anharmonic lattice. In particular, the precise coupling between anharmonic lattice dynamics and electronic fluctuations is not completely understood. To build an understanding of this coupling, we use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations supplemented by the calculation of maximally localized Wannier functions to carry out a dynamic group theory analysis of local electron density fluctuations and how these fluctuations are coupled to lattice fluctuations in the model inorganic halide perovskite CsSnBr3. We detail symmetry-dependent couplings between vibrational modes, including octahedral tilting. Importantly, we suggest that the large anharmonicity of some of the vibrational modes in CsSnBr3 result from electron rotation--nuclear translation coupling, in analogy to rotation--translation coupling effects in molecular plastic crystals. We also identify electronic fluctuations in the Cs cation that couple to distortions in the surrounding Sn-Br cubic coordination environment. We anticipate that our approach and resulting insights into electronic fluctuations will aid in further understanding the role of the fluctuating lattice in determining important physical properties of halide perovskites and beyond.</description>

      <title>Global topological synchronization of weighted simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order networks are able to capture the many-body interactions present in complex systems and to unveil new fundamental phenomena revealing the rich interplay between topology, geometry, and dynamics. Simplicial complexes are higher-order networks that encode higher-order topology and dynamics of complex systems. Specifically, simplicial complexes can sustain topological signals, i.e., dynamical variables not only defined on nodes of the network but also on their edges, triangles, and so on. Topological signals can undergo collective phenomena such as synchronization, however, only some higher-order network topologies can sustain global synchronization of topological signals. Here we consider global topological synchronization of topological signals on weighted simplicial complexes. We demonstrate that topological signals can globally synchronize on weighted simplicial complexes, even if they are odd-dimensional, e.g., edge signals, overcoming thus a limitation of the unweighted case. These results thus demonstrate that weighted simplicial complexes are more advantageous for observing these collective phenomena than their unweighted counterpart. In particular, we present two weighted simplicial complexes the Weighted Triangulated Torus and the Weighted Waffle. We completely characterize their higher-order spectral properties and we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions on their weights, they can sustain global synchronization of edge signals. Our results are interpreted geometrically by showing, among the other results, that in some cases edge weights can be associated with the lengths of the sides of curved simplices.</description>

      <title>Solving the Yang-Baxter, tetrahedron and higher simplex equations using Clifford algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bethe Ansatz was discoverd in 1932. Half a century later its algebraic structure was unearthed: Yang-Baxter equation was discovered, as well as its multidimensional generalizations [tetrahedron equation and $d$-simplex equations]. Here we describe a universal method to solve these equations using Clifford algebras. The Yang-Baxter equation ($d=2$), Zamalodchikov's tetrahedron equation ($d=3$) and the Bazhanov-Stroganov equation ($d=4$) are special cases. Our solutions form a linear space. This helps us to include spectral parameters. Potential applications are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07182v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a statistical physical derivation of thermodynamically consistent fluid mechanical equations is presented for non-isothermal viscous molecular fluids. The coarse-graining process is based on (i) the adiabatic expansion of the one-particle probability density function around Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, (ii) the assumption of decoupled particle positions and momenta, and (iii) the variational principle. It is shown that there exists a class of free energy functionals for which the conventional thermodynamic formalism can be naturally adopted for non-equilibrium scenarios, and describes entropy monotonic fluid flow in isolated systems. Furthermore, the analysis of the general continuum equations revealed the possibility of a non-local transport mode of energy in highly compressible dense fluids.</description>

      <title>Large deviations in statistics of the convex hull of passive and active particles: A theoretical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate analytically the distribution tails of the area A and perimeter L of a convex hull for different types of planar random walks. For N noninteracting Brownian motions of duration T we find that the large-L and A tails behave as $\mathcal{P}\left(L\right)\sim e^{-b_{N}L^{2}/DT}$ and $\mathcal{P}\left(A\right)\sim e^{-c_{N}A/DT}$, while the small-$L$ and $A$ tails behave as $\mathcal{P}\left(L\right)\sim e^{-d_{N}DT/L^{2}}$ and $\mathcal{P}\left(A\right)\sim e^{-e_{N}DT/A}$, where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. We calculated all of the coefficients ($b_N, c_N, d_N, e_N$) exactly. Strikingly, we find that $b_N$ and $c_N$ are independent of N, for $N\geq 3$ and $N \geq 4$, respectively. We find that the large-L (A) tails are dominated by a single, most probable realization that attains the desired L (A). The left tails are dominated by the survival probability of the particles inside a circle of appropriate size. For active particles and at long times, we find that large-L and A tails are given by $\mathcal{P}\left(L\right)\sim e^{-T\Psi_{N}^{\text{per}}\left(L/T\right)}$ and $\mathcal{P}\left(A\right)\sim e^{-T\Psi_{N}^{\text{area}}\left(\sqrt{A}/T\right)}$ respectively. We calculate the large deviation functions $\Psi_N$ exactly and find that they exhibit multiple singularities. We interpret these as dynamical phase transitions of first order. We extended several of these results to dimensions $d&gt;2$. Our analytic predictions display excellent agreement with existing results that were obtained from extensive numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: Model reduction is the construction of simple yet predictive descriptions of the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of a few relevant variables. A prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these relevant variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop a systematic approach based on the information bottleneck to identify the relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future. We elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. Further, we show that in the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our information-based approach indicates when to optimally stop increasing the complexity of the reduced model. Furthermore, it provides a firm foundation to construct interpretable deep learning tools that perform model reduction. We illustrate how these tools work in practice by considering uncurated videos of atmospheric flows from which our algorithms automatically extract the dominant slow collective variables, as well as experimental videos of cyanobacteria colonies in which we discover an emergent synchronization order parameter.</description>

      <title>Relating absorbing and hard wall boundary conditions for a one-dimensional run-and-tumble particle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The connection between absorbing boundary conditions and hard walls is well established in the mathematical literature for a variety of stochastic models, including for instance the Brownian motion. In this paper we explore this duality for a different type of process which is of particular interest in physics and biology, namely the run-tumble-particle, a toy model of active particle. For a one-dimensional run-and-tumble particle subjected to an arbitrary external force, we provide a duality relation between the exit probability, i.e. the probability that the particle exits an interval from a given boundary before a certain time $t$, and the cumulative distribution of its position in the presence of hard walls at the same time $t$. We show this relation for a run-and-tumble particle in the stationary state by explicitly computing both quantities. At finite time, we provide a derivation using the Fokker-Planck equation. All the results are confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium tricritical behaviour in anisotropic XY ferromagnet driven by elliptically polarised propagating magnetic field wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three dimensional anisotropic XY ferromagnet driven by elliptically polarized propagating magnetic field wave has been extensively investigated by Monte Carlo simulation with Metropolis single spin flip algorithm. Both the effects of the bilinear exchange type and the single site anisotropies are thoroughly investigated. The time average magnetisation (over the complete cycle of the elliptically polarized propagating magnetic field wave) components play the role of dynamic order parameter. For fixed set of values of the strength of anisotropy and the field amplitudes, the system has been found to get dynamically ordered at a pseudocritical temperature. The pseudocritical temperature of such dynamic nonequilibrium phase transition has been found to depend on both the strength of anisotropy and the amplitudes of the elliptically polarized propagating magnetic field wave. A comprehensive phase diagram is represented here in the form of image plot of the pseudocritical temperature in the plane formed by the strength of anisotropy and field amplitudes. Interestingly, this nonequilibrium phase transition has been found discontinuous (first order) for higher values of the field amplitude and lower values of the anisotropy. On the other hand, the continuous (second order) transition has been noticed for lower values of the field amplitude and higher values of the anisotropy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09395v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the SmoQyDQMC.jl package, a Julia implementation of the determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. SmoQyDQMC.jl supports generalized tight-binding Hamiltonians with on-site Hubbard and generalized electron-phonon interactions, including non-linear $e$-ph coupling and anharmonic lattice potentials. Our implementations use hybrid Monte Carlo methods with exact forces for sampling the phonon fields, enabling efficient simulation of low-energy phonon branches, including acoustic phonons. The SmoQyDQMC.jl package also uses a flexible scripting interface, allowing users to adapt it to different workflows and interface with other software packages in the Julia ecosystem. The code for this package can be downloaded from our GitHub repository at https://github.com/SmoQySuite/SmoQyDQMC.jl or installed using the Julia package manager. The online documentation, including examples, can be obtained from our document page at https://smoqysuite.github.io/SmoQyDQMC.jl/stable/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupling a system to two different baths can lead to novel phenomena escaping the constraints of thermal equilibrium. In quantum materials inside optical cavities, this feature can be exploited as electrons and cavity-photons are easily pulled away from their mutual equilibrium, even in the steady state. This offers new routes for a non-invasive control of material properties and functionalities. We show that the absence of thermal equilibrium between electrons and photons leads to reduced symmetries of the steady-state electronic distribution function. Moreover, by defining an effective temperature from the on-shell distribution function, we find a non-monotonic behaviour as a function of cavity frequency, consistent with recent experimental findings. Finally, we show that, the non-thermal behaviour leads to qualitative modifications of the material's properties, as the standard Sommerfeld expansion for observables is modified by a leading-order correction linearly proportional to the temperature difference between the two baths and to the frequency-derivative of the electron damping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically study two-dimensional athermal chiral active particles at high densities. The particles in this system perform the circular motion with frequency $\Omega$. We show that the system in the fluid phase crystallizes at high densities even in two dimensions. The true long-range translational order arises due to the suppression of displacement fluctuations associated with hyperuniformity. We also find that $\Omega=0$ is singular, where the system never crystallizes because the system is similar to a quenched random system for which the lower critical dimension is $4$. Our numerical results are quantitatively explained by a linear elastic theory.</description>

Abstract: Isomorphism of the two-state system is heuristic in understanding the dynamical or statistical behavior of the simplest yet most quantum system that has no classical counterpart. We use the constraint phase space developed in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 204105; 2019, 151, 024105 and J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 2496-2501, non-covariant phase space functions, time-dependent weight functions, and time-dependent normalization factors to construct a novel class of phase space representations of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system. The equations of motion of the trajectory on constraint phase space are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression for the population dynamics is always positive semi-definite. We also prove that the triangle window function approach, albeit proposed as a heuristic empirical model in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 144108, is related to a special case of the novel class and leads to an isomorphic representation of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system.</description>
