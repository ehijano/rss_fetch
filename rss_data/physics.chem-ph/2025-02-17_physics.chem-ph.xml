      <title>Pump-intensity-scaling of Two-Photon-Absorption and Photon Statistics of Entangled-Photon Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a non-perturbative theoretical approach to the parametric down-conversion (PDC) process, which generates entangled-photon field for an arbitrarily strong pump-pulse. This approach can be used to evaluate multi-point field correlation functions to compute nonlinear spectroscopic signals induced by a strong pump. The entangled-photon statistics is studied using Glauber's $g^{(2)}$ function, which helps understand the significance of the photon entanglement-time and the pump-pulse intensity on spectroscopic signals. Under the non-perturbative treatment of the entangled field, the two-photon absorption (TPA) signal shows linear to strongly non-linear growth with the pump intensity, rather than linear to quadratic scaling reported previously. An increase in the range of pump intensity for the linear scaling is observed as the pump band-width is increased. We propose an experimental scheme that can select contributions to the TPA signal that arise solely from interactions with the entangled photons, and filter out unentangled photon contributions, which are dominant at higher pump intensities, paving a way to explore the entanglement effects at higher intensities.</description>

      <title>Exchange-Correlation Potentials and Energy Densities through Orbital Averaging and Aufbau Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exchange-correlation potentials vxc and energy densities exc are derived for integer and fractional electron counts using an orbital-averaged Kohn-Sham inversion procedure. The reference densities for inversion come from full configuration interaction in a Slater orbital basis. The orbital-averaged potentials accurately capture key features of vxc, including the asymptotic negative one over r decay and the step discontinuity associated with integer electron transitions for the series of atoms He through Ne. Exchange-correlation energy densities exc are produced through an aufbau path integral. The energy densities reach good agreement with total Exc values. By providing full configuration interaction-derived Kohn-Sham quantities, including vxc, exc, and step contributions, this workflow can be instrumental in the development of improved XC functionals that bridge wavefunction-level accuracy with the computational efficiency of density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Many-body theory calculations of positron binding to parabenzoquinone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positron binding in parabenzoquinone is studied using \textit{ab initio} many-body theory. The effects of electron-positron correlations including polarization, virtual positronium formation and positron-hole repulsion, as well as those of $\pi$ bonds, aromaticity, and lone electron pairs, are considered. The binding energy is calculated as 60$\pm$16 meV, considerably larger than the 0.0925 meV value inferred from recent scattering calculations of [G. Moreira and M. Bettega, {\emph{Eur.~Phys.~J.~D}} {\bf 78} (2024)], but substantially smaller than we find in benzene (148$\pm$26 meV). The positron contact density (lifetime) is calculated as 8.0$\times10^{-3}$ a.u. (2.48 ns), vs.~1.61$\times 10^{-2}$ a.u. (0.81 ns) in benzene. The decrease (increase) in binding (annihilation rate) in parabenzoquinone compared to benzene is ascribed to the loss of aromaticity: the electron density on the positive oxygen nuclei being relatively harder for the positron to probe compared to the aromatic rings in benzene.</description>

      <title>Exploring the mechanism of phase transitions between the hexagonal close-packed and the cuboidal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By introducing appropriate lattice parameters for a bi-lattice smoothly connecting the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) with the cuboidal structures, namely the body-centered (bcc) and the face centered cubic (fcc) lattices, we were able to map out the minimum energy path for a Burgers-Bain type of phase transition. We demonstrate that for three different models applied, i.e. the kissing hard-sphere model, the Lennard-Jones potential, and density functional theory for metallic lithium, the direct transition path is always from hcp to fcc with a separate path leading from fcc to bcc. This solves, at least for the models considered here, a long-standing controversy of whether or not fcc acts as an intermediate phase in martensitic type of phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Structural and Dielectric Changes in Liquid Water at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the pressure-dependent dielectric properties of water is crucial for a wide range of scientific and practical applications. In this study, we employ a deep neural network trained on density functional theory data to investigate the dielectric properties of liquid water at room temperature across a pressure range of 0.1 MPa to 1000 MPa. We observe a nonlinear increase in the static dielectric constant $\epsilon_0$ with increasing pressure, a trend that is qualitatively consistent with experimental observations. This increase in $\epsilon_0$ is primarily attributed to the increase in water density under compression, which enhances collective dipole fluctuations within the hydrogen-bonding network as well as the dielectric response. Despite the increase in $\epsilon_0$, our results reveal a decrease in the Kirkwood correlation factor $G_K$ with increasing pressure. This decrease in $G_K$ is attributed to pressure-induced structural distortions in the hydrogen-bonding network, which weaken dipolar correlations by disrupting the ideal tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules.</description>

      <title>Efficient cavity-mediated energy transfer between photosynthetic light harvesting complexes from strong to weak coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitation energy transfer between photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes is vital for highly efficient primary photosynthesis. Controlling this process is the key for advancing the emerging artificial photosynthetic systems. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the enhanced excitation energy transfer between photosynthetic light-harvesting 2 complexes (LH2) mediated through the Fabry-Perot optical microcavity. Using intensity-dependent pump-probe spectroscopy, we analyse the exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) due to inter-LH2 energy transfer. Comparing EEA in LH2 within cavity samples and the bare LH2 films, we observe enhanced EEA in cavities indicating improved excitation energy transfer via coupling to a common cavity mode. Surprisingly, the effect remains even in the weak coupling regime. The enhancement is attributed to the additional connectivity between LH2s introduced by the resonant optical microcavity. Our results suggest that optical microcavities can be a strategic tool for modifying excitation energy transfer between molecular complexes, offering a promising approach towards efficient artificial light harvesting.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) motivated mixed basis sets for small molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08493v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success behind many pseudopotential methods, such as Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) and Phillips-Kleinman pseudopotential method, is that these methods are all electron methods in disguise. For the Phillips Kleinman and PAW pseudopotential methods we show that there is an explicit all electron reformulation. In the all electron reformulation, in the basis set, there are regular low wavevector basis wave functions and several, specially chosen, high wavevector basis wave functions that are specialized to the atomic environment relevant to nuclei of the substances studied. Using this as motivation, here we propose a new, PAW method motivated, basis set for small molecules, where we use the LO or lo (Localized Orbitals) basis wave functions, and pair them with a Gaussian basis, e.g. Gaussian type orbitals (GTO), for a hybrid basis for small molecules. Contracted Gaussian functions are also possible (CGFs). Several different, but related, LO (lo) basis wave functions are considered. We also show how to extend this idea to Slater basis set, Slater type orbitals (STO), instead of GTO orbitals, combined with LO or lo orbitals. This is done using shape functions.</description>

      <title>A Neural-Network-Based Selective Configuration Interaction Approach to Molecular Electronic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By combining Hartree-Fock with a neural-network-supported quantum-cluster solver proposed recently in the context of solid-state lattice models, we formulate a scheme for selective neural-network configuration interaction (NNCI) calculations and implement it with various options for the type of basis set and boundary conditions. The method's performance is evaluated in studies of several small molecules as a step toward calculations of larger systems. In particular, the correlation energy in the N$_2$ molecule is compared with published full CI calculations that included nearly $10^{10}$ Slater determinants, and the results are reproduced with only $4\cdot10^{5}$ determinants using NNCI. A clear advantage is seen from increasing the set of orbitals included rather than approaching full CI for a smaller set. The method's high efficiency and implementation in a condensed matter simulation software expands the applicability of CI calculations to a wider range of problems, even extended systems through an embedding approach.</description>

      <title>Understanding Dynamics in Coarse-Grained Models: V. Extension of Coarse-Grained Dynamics Theory to Non-Hard Sphere Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) modeling has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide applicability in enhancing the spatiotemporal scales of molecular simulations. While CG simulations, often performed with Hamiltonian mechanics, faithfully recapitulate structural correlations at equilibrium, they lead to ambiguously accelerated dynamics. In the first paper of this series [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034103 (2023)], we proposed the excess entropy scaling relationship to understand the CG dynamics. Then, in the following companion paper [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034104 (2023)], we developed a theory to map the CG system into a dynamically-consistent hard sphere system to analytically derive an expression for fast CG dynamics. However, many chemical and physical systems do not exhibit hard sphere-like behavior, limiting the extensibility of the developed theory. In this paper, we aim to generalize the theory to the non-hard sphere system based on the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen perturbation theory. Since non-hard sphere-like CG interactions affect the excess entropy term as it deviates from the hard sphere description, we explicitly account for the extra entropy to correct the non-hard sphere nature of the system. This approach is demonstrated for two different types of interactions seen in liquids, and we further provide a generalized description for any CG models using the generalized Gaussian CG models using Gaussian basis sets. Altogether, this work allows for extending the range and applicability of the hard sphere CG dynamics theory to a myriad of CG liquids.</description>

      <title>Leveraging the Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Quantum Chemistry for Accurate Negative Singlet-Triplet Gap Predictions: A Case for Double-Hybrid DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecules that violate Hund's rule -- having first excited singlet state (S$_1$) below the triplet state (T$_1$) -- are rare yet promising as efficient light emitters. Their high-throughput identification demands exceptionally accurate excited-state modeling to minimize false positives and negatives. Benchmarking twelve S$_1$-T$_1$ energy gaps, we find that local variants of ADC(2) and CC2 deliver excellent accuracy and speed for screening medium-sized molecules. Notably, while double-hybrid DFT approximations (e.g., B2GP-PLYP and PBE-QIDH) exhibit high mean errors ($&gt;100$ meV) despite very low standard deviations ($\approx10$ meV), exploring their parameter space reveals that a configuration with 75% exchange and 55% correlation reduces the mean error to below $5$ meV -- albeit with increased variance. Using this low-bias parameterization as an internal reference, we correct the systematic error while maintaining low variance, effectively combining the strengths of both low-bias and low-variance DFT parameterizations to enhance overall accuracy. Our findings suggest that low-variance DFT methods -- often overlooked due to high bias -- can serve as reliable tools for predictive modeling in first-principles molecular design.</description>

      <title>The allosteric lever: towards a principle of specific allosteric response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Allostery, the phenomenon by which the perturbation of a molecule at one site alters its behavior at a remote functional site, enables control over biomolecular function. Allosteric modulation is a promising avenue for drug discovery and is employed in the design of mechanical metamaterials. However, a general principle of allostery, i.e. a set of quantitative and transferable "ground rules", remains elusive. It is neither a set of structural motifs nor intrinsic motions. Focusing on elastic network models, we here show that an allosteric lever -- a mode-coupling pattern induced by the perturbation -- governs the directional, source-to-target, allosteric communication: a structural perturbation of an allosteric site couples the excitation of localized hard elastic modes with concerted long range soft-mode relaxation. Perturbations of non-allosteric sites instead couple hard and soft modes uniformly. The allosteric response is shown to be generally non-linear and non-reciprocal, and allows for minimal structural distortions to be efficiently transmitted to specific changes at distant sites. Allosteric levers exist in proteins and "pseudoproteins" -- networks designed to display an allosteric response. Interestingly, protein sequences that constitute allosteric transmission channels are shown to be evolutionarily conserved. To illustrate how the results may be applied in drug design, we use them to successfully predict known allosteric sites in proteins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Quantum-selected configuration interaction with time-evolved state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) utilizes an input quantum state on a quantum device to select important bases (electron configurations in quantum chemistry) which define a subspace in which to diagonalize a target Hamiltonian, i.e., perform selected configuration interaction, on classical computers. Previous proposals for preparing a good input state, which is crucial for the quality of QSCI, based on optimization of quantum circuits may suffer from optimization difficulty and require many runs of the quantum device. Here we propose using a time-evolved state by the target Hamiltonian (for some initial state) as an input of QSCI. Our proposal is based on the intuition that the time evolution by the Hamiltonian creates electron excitations of various orders when applied to the initial state. We numerically investigate the accuracy of the energy obtained by the proposed method for quantum chemistry Hamiltonians describing electronic states of small molecules. Numerical results reveal that our method can yield sufficiently accurate ground-state energies for the investigated molecules. Systematic analysis when increasing the number of qubits in a Hydrogen chain shows that the subspace size required for sufficiently accurate results is reasonable at system sizes that cannot be solved by naive classical diagonalization. Our proposal provides a systematic and optimization-free method to prepare the input state of QSCI and could contribute to practical applications of quantum computers in quantum chemistry calculations.</description>

      <title>Analytical solution for the polydisperse random close packing problem in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An analytical theory for the random close packing density, $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$, of polydisperse hard disks is provided using an equilibrium model of crowding [A. Zaccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 028002 (2022)] which has been justified on the basis of extensive numerical analysis of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) line in the phase diagram of hard spheres [Anzivino et al., J. Chem. Phys. 158, 044901 (2023)]. The solution relies on the equations of state for the hard disk fluid and provides predictions for $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$ as a function of the ratio, $s$, of the standard deviation of the distribution of disk diameters to its mean. For a power-law size distribution with $s=0.246$, the theory yields $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.892$, which compares well with the most recent numerical estimate $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.905$ based on the Monte-Carlo swap algorithms [Ghimenti, Berthier, van Wijland, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 028202 (2024)].</description>
