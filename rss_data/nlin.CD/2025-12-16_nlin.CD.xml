      <title>Delay factors in the genesis of limit sets of the non-ideal system "tank with liquid-electric motor"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-ideal deterministic system "tank with liquid-electric motor" is studied. Two delay-approximation models are considered. Impact of the delay on the emergence, evolution and disappearance of regular and chaotic limit sets (attractors) of the system is investigated. The main dynamic characteristics of the system's steady-state regimes are computed and analyzed. Transition to chaos scenarios are studied. Realization of generalized intermittency scenario driven by delay factors is established.</description>

      <title>Redundant and synergistic interactions in a complex network of single-transistor electronic chaotic oscillators and in neurophysiological recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex networks often exhibit emergent behaviors, where simple dyadic interactions yield collective dynamics that cannot be explained by examining the system's units individually or in pairs. Understanding how redundant and synergistic interaction emerges from elementary connectivity patterns is important in characterizing the behavior of physical, biological, and engineering systems. In this study, the information-theoretic framework of Partial Information Decomposition (PID) is employed to investigate how pairs of signals measured at the nodes of large network systems contribute individually and in cooperation with each other to determine the overall state of the network. The analyzed systems are networks of numerically simulated Roessler oscillators and physical single-transistor electronic chaotic oscillators, reproducing purely pairwise and symmetric links in biological neuronal cultures, and cortical electroencephalographic networks assessed in humans. In the two settings, PID was extensively applied to decompose the information brought by pairs of signals to the overall state of the system, assessed respectively as the dynamic regime (from asynchronous chaos to synchronization) and the subject condition (open vs. closed eyes). Our approach highlights the coexistence of redundant and synergistic interplay in determining the effect of the pairwise dynamics on the system's state. Specifically, we demonstrate how, in a highly synchronized system, where units act following overlapped redundant behaviors, their joint consideration helps determine the system's state though their synergistic interactions. Our findings reveal the emergence of non-trivial behaviors in networked system based on pairwise connections and straightforward neural states, highlighting the need for using appropriate analytical tools to capture complex phenomena.</description>

      <title>Time-Crystalline Phase in a Single-Band Holographic Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a time-crystalline phase in a single-band holographic superconductor, extending the AdS/CFT framework. By incorporating a nonlinear gauge-scalar coupling and external driving, we derive coupled equations of motion for the plasma and Higgs modes, analogous to those in high-Tc superconductors. Multi-scale analysis reveals a sum resonance with subharmonic growth indicating broken time-translation symmetry. We perform numerical computation of quasinormal mode and demonstrate the transition to the time-crystalline phase. The holographic model may serve as a robust tool for studying strongly coupled time crystals.</description>

      <title>Testing the consistency of the resonant wave interaction approximation with simulated dynamics of idealized 2D internal wave fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02758v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear interaction and breaking of internal ocean waves are responsible for much of the interior ocean mixing, affecting ocean carbon storage and the global overturning circulation. These interactions may affect the observed Garrett-Munk wave energy spectrum, in addition to the recently explored interaction of waves with ocean eddies. According to the resonant wave interaction approximation, that is commonly used to derive the kinetic equation for the energy spectrum, the dominant interactions are between wave triads whose wavevectors satisfy $\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{p}+\mathbf{q}$, and whose frequencies satisfy $\omega_{\mathbf{k}}=|\omega_{\mathbf{p}}\pm\omega_{\mathbf{q}}|$. In order to test the validity of the resonant wave interaction approximation, we examine several analytical derivations of the theory. The assumptions underlying each derivation are tested using idealized direct 2D numerical simulations, representing near-observed energy levels of the oceanic internal wave field. We show that the slow-amplitude assumptions underlying the derivations are inconsistent with the simulated dynamics in this particular set of simulations. In addition, most of the triads satisfying the resonant conditions do not contribute significantly to nonlinear wave energy transfer in our simulations, while some interactions that are dominant in nonlinear energy transfers do not satisfy the resonance conditions. We also point to possible self-consistency issues with some derivations found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Dissipative spectral form factor for elliptic Ginibre unitary ensemble and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dissipative spectral form factor (DSFF)--a widely used probe of non-Hermitian quantum chaos--in the elliptic Ginibre unitary ensemble (eGinUE), which interpolates between the non-Hermitian Ginibre unitary ensemble (GinUE) and the Hermitian Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) via a symmetry breaking parameter. We derive exact finite-dimensional results and large-dimensional approximations for the DSFF, revealing a scaling relationship that connects the DSFF of eGinUE to that of GinUE and the spectral form factor of GUE. This relation explains the distinct time scales underlying the characteristic \emph{dip-ramp-plateau} structure across GinUE, GUE, and crossover regimes. Additionally, we refine estimates of dip-ramp and ramp-plateau transition times for different symmetry regimes. We validate our results with Monte Carlo simulations and demonstrate applications to paradigmatic quantum-chaotic systems: the crossover Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the crossover Power-law Banded random matrices. We highlight an analogy between eGinUE eigenvalues and the positions of a rotating fermionic gas in a two-dimensional anisotropic trap.</description>

      <title>Instability in Ostwald ripening processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a dimensionless parameter which enters into the equation for the evolution of supersaturation in Ostwald ripening processes. This parameter is typically a large number. Here it is argued that the consequent stiffness of the equation results in the evolution of the supersaturation being unstable. The instability is evident in numerical simulations of Ostwald ripening.</description>
