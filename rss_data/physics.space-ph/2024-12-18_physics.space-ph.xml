      <title>Spontaneously generated flux ropes in 3-D magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is the key to explosive phenomena in the universe. The flux rope is crucial in three-dimensional magnetic reconnection theory and are commonly considered to be generated by secondary tearing mode instability. Here we show that the parallel electron flow moving toward the reconnection diffusion region can spontaneously form flux ropes. The electron flows form parallel current tubes in the separatrix region where the observational parameters suggest the tearing and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are suppressed. The spontaneously formed flux ropes could indicate the importance of electron dynamics in a three-dimensional reconnection region.</description>

      <title>Catastrophic cooling instability in optically thin plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solar corona is the prototypical example of a low density environment heated to high temperatures by external sources. The plasma cools radiatively, and because it is optically thin to this radiation, it becomes possible to model the density, velocity, and temperature structure of the system by modifying the MHD equations to include energy source terms that approximate the local heating and cooling rates. The solutions can be highly inhomogeneous and even multiphase because the well known linear instability associated with these source terms, thermal instability, leads to a catastrophic heating and cooling of the plasma in the nonlinear regime. Here we show that there is a separate, much simpler instance of catastrophic heating and cooling accompanying these source terms that can rival thermal instability in dynamical importance. The linear stability criterion is the isochoric one identified by Parker (1953), and we demonstrate that cooling functions derived from collisional ionization equilibrium are highly prone to violating this criterion. If catastrophic cooling instability can act locally in global simulations, then it is an alternative mechanism for forming condensations, and due to its nonequilibrium character, it may be relevant to explaining a host of phenomena associated with the production of cooler gas in hot, low density plasmas.</description>

      <title>An instrument to link global positioning to the Universe -- Observing GNSS satellites with the Australian VLBI array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new instrument enabling a novel combination of Earth measuring techniques: direct observations with the radio astronomical instruments to satellites of the global navigation satellite systems. Inter-technique biases are a major error source in the terrestrial reference frame. Combining two major space-geodetic techniques, GNSS and VLBI, through observations to identical sensors has been considered infeasible due to their seemingly incompatible operating frequencies. The newly accessible L-band capability of the Australian VGOS telescopes is shown here, invalidating this prevailing opinion. A series of test observations demonstrates geodetic VLBI observations to GPS satellites for a continental-wide IVS telescope array, with the potential for observations at a critical scale. We anticipate immediate impact for the geodetic community, through first-ever inter-technique ties between VLBI and GNSS in the Australian region and via the opportunity for critical test observations towards the Genesis mission, geodesy's flagship project in the area of space ties set for launch in 2028.</description>
