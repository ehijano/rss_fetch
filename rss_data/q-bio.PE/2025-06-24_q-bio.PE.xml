      <title>phylo2vec: a library for vector-based phylogenetic tree manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetics is a fundamental component of many analysis frameworks in biology as well as linguistics to study the evolutionary relationships of different entities. Recently, the advent of large-scale genomics and the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has underscored the necessity for phylogenetic software to handle large datasets of genomes or phylogenetic trees. While significant efforts have focused on scaling optimisation algorithms, visualization, and lineage identification, an emerging body of research has been dedicated to efficient representations of data for genomes and phylogenetic trees such as phylo2vec. Compared to traditional tree representations such as the Newick format, which represents trees using strings of nested parentheses, modern representations of phylogenetic trees utilize integer vectors to define the tree topology traversal. This approach offers several advantages, including easier manipulability, increased memory efficiency, and applicability to downstream tasks such as machine learning. Here, we present the latest release of phylo2vec (or Phylo2Vec), a high-performance software package for encoding, manipulating, and analysing binary phylogenetic trees. At its core, the package is based on the phylo2vec representation of binary trees, which defines a bijection from any tree topology with $n$ leaves into an integer vector of size $n-1$. Compared to the traditional Newick format, phylo2vec is designed to enable fast sampling and comparison of binary trees. This release features a core implementation in Rust, providing significant performance improvements and memory efficiency, while remaining available in Python (superseding the release described in the original paper) and R via dedicated wrappers, making it accessible to a broad audience in the bioinformatics community.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Theory for Adaptive Systems in Varying Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological organisms thrive by adapting to their environments, which are often unpredictably changeable. We apply recent results from nonequilibrium physics to show that organisms' fitness parses into a static generalist component and a nonequilibrium tracking component. Our findings: (1) Environmental changes that are too fast or too small are not worth tracking. (2) Well-timed anticipatory tracking enhances fitness in coherent environments. (3) We compute and explain the optimal adaptive strategy for a system in a given environment, such as bet hedging or phenotypic memory. Conversely, (4) We compute and explain the optimal way for an environment to control a given system, for example for designing drug regimens to limit the growth of pathogens. By connecting fitness, adaptive strategy, and environmental variability, this work provides the foundations for a generic physical theory of adaptivity.</description>

      <title>Training Flexible Models of Genetic Variant Effects from Functional Annotations using Accelerated Linear Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand how genetic variants in human genomes manifest in phenotypes -- traits like height or diseases like asthma -- geneticists have sequenced and measured hundreds of thousands of individuals. Geneticists use this data to build models that predict how a genetic variant impacts phenotype given genomic features of the variant, like DNA accessibility or the presence of nearby DNA-bound proteins. As more data and features become available, one might expect predictive models to improve. Unfortunately, training these models is bottlenecked by the need to solve expensive linear algebra problems because variants in the genome are correlated with nearby variants, requiring inversion of large matrices. Previous methods have therefore been restricted to fitting small models, and fitting simplified summary statistics, rather than the full likelihood of the statistical model. In this paper, we leverage modern fast linear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS (Deep genome Wide Association Studies), a method to train large and flexible neural network predictive models to optimize likelihood. Notably, we find that larger models only improve performance when using our full likelihood approach; when trained by fitting traditional summary statistics, larger models perform no better than small ones. We find larger models trained on more features make better predictions, potentially improving disease predictions and therapeutic target identification.</description>

      <title>Higher-order evolutionary dynamics with game transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions are prevalent in real-world complex systems and exert unique influences on system evolution that cannot be captured by pairwise interactions. We incorporate game transitions into the higher-order prisoner's dilemma game model, where these transitions consistently promote cooperation. Moreover, in systems with game transitions, the proportion of higher-order interactions has a dual impact, either enhancing the emergence and persistence of cooperation or facilitating invasions that promote defection within an otherwise cooperative system. Correspondingly, bistable states, consisting of mutual defection and either mutual cooperation or coexistence, are consistently identified in both theoretical analyses and simulation results.</description>
