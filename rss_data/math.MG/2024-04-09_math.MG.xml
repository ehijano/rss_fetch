      <title>Lipschitz images and dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the question which compact metric spaces can be obtained as a Lipschitz image of the middle third Cantor set, or more generally, as a Lipschitz image of a subset of a given compact metric space.
  In the general case we prove that if $A$ and $B$ are compact metric spaces and the Hausdorff dimension of $A$ is bigger than the upper box dimension of $B$, then there exist a compact set $A'\subset A$ and a Lipschitz onto map $f\colon A'\to B$.
  As a corollary we prove that any `natural' dimension in $\mathbb{R}^n$ must be between the Hausdorff and upper box dimensions.
  We show that if $A$ and $B$ are self-similar sets with the strong separation condition with equal Hausdorff dimension and $A$ is homogeneous, then $A$ can be mapped onto $B$ by a Lipschitz map if and only if $A$ and $B$ are bilipschitz equivalent.
  For given $\alpha&gt;0$ we also give a characterization of those compact metric spaces that can be obtained as an $\alpha$-H\"older image of a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$. The quantity we introduce for this turns out to be closely related to the upper box dimension.</description>

      <title>Variational structures for the Fokker--Planck equation with general Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the convergence of a modified Jordan--Kinderlehrer--Otto scheme to a solution to the Fokker--Planck equation in $\Omega \Subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with general, positive and temporally constant, Dirichlet boundary conditions. We work under mild assumptions on the domain, the drift, and the initial datum.
  In the special case where $\Omega$ is an interval in $\mathbb{R}^1$, we prove that such a solution is a gradient flow -- curve of maximal slope -- within a suitable space of measures, endowed with a modified Wasserstein distance.
  Our discrete scheme and modified distance draw inspiration from contributions by A. Figalli and N. Gigli [J. Math. Pures Appl. 94, (2010), pp. 107--130], and J. Morales [J. Math. Pures Appl. 112, (2018), pp. 41--88] on an optimal-transport approach to evolution equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Similarly to these works, we allow the mass to flow from/to the boundary $\partial \Omega$ throughout the evolution. However, our leading idea is to also keep track of the mass at the boundary by working with measures defined on the whole closure $\overline \Omega$.
  The driving functional is a modification of the classical relative entropy that also makes use of the information at the boundary. As an intermediate result, when $\Omega$ is an interval in $\mathbb{R}^1$, we find a formula for the descending slope of this geodesically nonconvex functional.</description>

      <title>Super Guarding and Dark Rays in Art Galleries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore an Art Gallery variant where each point of a polygon must be seen by k guards, and guards cannot see through other guards. Surprisingly, even covering convex polygons under this variant is not straightforward. For example, covering every point in a triangle k=4 times (a 4-cover) requires 5 guards, and achieving a 10-cover requires 12 guards. Our main result is tight bounds on k-covering a convex polygon of n vertices, for all k and n. The proofs of both upper and lower bounds are nontrivial. We also obtain bounds for simple polygons, leaving tight bounds an open problem.</description>
