      <title>Slope zero tensors, uniformizing variations of Hodge structure and quotients of tube domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an equivalence between two approaches to characterizing complex-projective varieties $X$ with klt singularities and ample canonical divisor that are uniformized by bounded symmetric domains. In order to do so, we show how to construct a uniformizing variation of Hodge structure from a slope zero tensor and vice versa. As a consequence, we generalize various uniformization results of Catanese and Di Scala to the singular setting. For example, we prove that $X$ is a quotient of a bounded symmetric domain of tube type by a group acting properly discontinuously and freely in codimension one if and only if $X$ admits a slope zero tensor. As a key step in the proof, we establish the compactness of the holonomy group of the singular K\"{a}hler--Einstein metric on $X_{\mathrm{reg}}$.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous spaces over an abelian variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a question of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Iyer concerning the existence of rational sections in families of homogeneous spaces over an abelian variety, after base change by a suitable \'etale isogeny of the abelian variety. Assuming characteristic zero and that the homogeneous spaces arise from connected reductive groups, the problem is reformulated in terms of torsors under reductive groups over an abelian variety $A$.
  Building on work of Moonen and Polishchuk, we construct a filtration on the motive of a Jacobian variety to analyze the action of isogenies on unramified cohomology and Witt groups. This approach allows for a positive response to the question for reductive groups whose root data do not contain a factor of type~$E_8$ when $\dim A &gt; 2$ and $\mathrm{cd}(k) \leqslant 1$, and for all reductive groups when $\dim A = 2$ and $k$ is algebraically closed.</description>

      <title>Nakajima quiver varieties in dimension four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we classify all four-dimensional Nakajima quiver varieties via a combinatorial approach. For each quiver variety, we describe the symplectic leaves and minimal degenerations between them. Using the resulting Hasse diagrams and secondary hyperplane arrangements, we fully classify the quiver varieties up to isomorphism, a step in the problem of classifying all four-dimensional conical symplectic singularities. As an application, we answer in the negative a question posed by Bellamy, Craw, Rayan, Schedler, and Weiss regarding whether the $G_4$ quotient singularity (or its projective crepant resolutions) can be realised as a quiver variety.</description>

      <title>Analytic de Rham stacks of Fargues-Fontaine curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and initiate the study of analytic de Rham stacks of relative Fargues-Fontaine curves. To this end, we develop a theory of analytic de Rham stacks with sufficiently strong descent and approximation properties. Specializing to the de Rham stack of the Fargues-Fontaine curve attached to $\mathbb{C}_p$, we apply the general theory to obtain a new geometric proof of the $p$-adic monodromy theorem, avoiding any reliance on earlier results on $p$-adic differential equations. Building on the foundations established here, we plan in a sequel to investigate the cohomology of de Rham stacks of relative Fargues-Fontaine curves in geometric situations and, in particular, provide a stack-theoretic definition of Hyodo-Kato cohomology.</description>

      <title>Blocking sets from a union of plane curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a question of Erd\H{o}s on blocking sets in a projective plane that intersect every line only a few times, several authors have used unions of algebraic curves to construct such sets in $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{F}_q)$. In this paper, we provide new constructions of blocking sets in $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ from a union of geometrically irreducible curves of a fixed degree $d$. We also establish lower bounds on the number of such curves required to form a blocking set. Our proofs combine tools from arithmetic geometry and combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Braid Group Action on $D^b(\mathfrak{M}_{\eta})$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an action of the braid group on the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on hypertoric varieties arising from hyperplane arrangements. Using wall-crossing equivalences associated to paths in the complexified complement of the hyperplane arrangement, we show that these equivalences yield a functor from the Deligne groupoid to the category of triangulated equivalences. This gives rise to a canonical representation of the fundamental group, which under suitable assumptions recovers the braid group, acting on $D^b(\mathfrak{M}_{\eta})$.</description>

      <title>On derived D-modules and their several definitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The so called theory of derived D-modules is an extension of classical D-modules to derived algebraic geometry, which uses the derived information of the base scheme. We prove that the three different definitions of derived D-modules, given by Beraldo, Nuiten and To\"en-Vezzosi, on a (nice) derived scheme yield equivalent symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories. We deduce this as a corollary of more general statements about Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of dg-Lie algebroids, proving a conjecture by E. Pavia, and about the relation between representations of a dg-Lie algebroid and some class of ind-coherent sheaves on the associated formal moduli problem, which can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Compactifying the Parameter Space for the Quantum Multiplication for Hypertoric Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will be studying the parameter space for the quantum multiplication for hypertoric varieties. The operation of quantum multiplication for hypertoric varieties has an explicit formulation which is given by McBreen and Shenfeld. In particular, this multiplication depends on a parameter which lives in the complement of a toric arrangement. Following a paper of deConcini and Gaiffi, I will define a compactification of this parameter space and show how the quantum multiplication can be extended to this compactification.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic differentials of alternating four covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $k$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic two, let $A_4$ be an alternating group on four letters, and let $H$ be the unique Sylow two-subgroup of $A_4$. Let $X$ be a smooth projective irreducible curve over $k$ with a faithful $A_4$-action such that the quotient curve $X/H$ is a projective line and the $H$-cover $X\to X/H$ is totally ramified, in the sense that it is ramified and every branch point is totally ramified. Under these assumptions, we determine the precise $kA_4$-module structure of the space of holomorphic differentials of $X$ over $k$. We show that there are infinitely many different isomorphism classes of indecomposable $kA_4$-modules that can occur as direct summands, and we give precise formulas for the multiplicities with which they occur.</description>

      <title>On the topology of complex map-germs and a general L\^e-Greuel formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a singular holomorphic map-germ $f: (X,\underline{0}) \to (\mathbb C,0)$ where $X$ is a singular complex analytic variety in $\mathbb C^N$, and another holomorphic map-germ $g: (X,\underline{0}) \to (\mathbb C,0)$ which is "sufficiently good" relatively to $f$. We use stratified Morse theory to determine up to homeomorphism, the topology of the Milnor fiber $F_f$ out from the slice $F_{g,f}$ and the Morse data of a Morsification of the restriction of $g$ to $F_f$. This generalizes classical results for the case where $X$ is non-singular, and it provides a general formula comparing the Euler characteristics of $F_f$ and $F_{g,f}$. Restricting to the case where the singularity of $X$ at $\underline{0}$ is isolated, the formula for the difference of the Euler characteristics becomes algebraic and easily computable, generalizing in two directions the classical L\^e-Greuel formula for the Milnor number of isolated complete intersection germs (ICIS): Firstly, $X$ can have an isolated singularity, and secondly $f$ can have arbitrary critical set. This unifies several known formulae in this vein: i) L\^e-Greuel for ICIS of arbitrary codimension; ii) the formula relating the Milnor number of a curve with that of a function on it, and an extension of it for surfaces; iii) the formula for determinantal singularities; iv) and the one for the image Milnor number. All of these are special cases of our general formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01450v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper we compute Alexander polynomials for certain classes of conic-line arrangements in the complex projective plane which are related to pencils. We prove two general results for curve arrangements coming from Halphen pencils of index $k\geq 2$. Then we apply them to the Hesse arrangement of conics and to some of its degenerations. The results are completed by computations using computer algebra. In particular, we construct conic-line arrangements which are non-reduced pencil-type arrangements and have as roots of their Alexander polynomials roots of unity of order 7. Such roots are not known and are conjectured not to exist in the class of line arrangements.</description>

We show that this first integral homology group is torsion-free under certain condition similar to the one used by Cohen-Dimca-Orlik.

      <description>arXiv:2506.03745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present article, we investigate the topology of real toric varieties, especially those whose torus is not split over the field of real numbers. We describe some canonical fibrations associated to their real loci. Then, we establish various properties of their cohomology provided that their real loci are compact and smooth. For instance, we compute their Betti numbers, show that their cohomology is totally algebraic, and extend a criterion of orientability. In addition, we provide the topological classification of equivariant embeddings of non-split tridimensional tori.</description>

      <title>Complexity of the Zero Set of a Matrix Schubert Ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $T$-varieties are normal varieties equipped with an action of an algebraic torus $T$. When the action is effective, the complexity of a $T$-variety $X$ is $\dim(X)-\dim(T)$. Matrix Schubert varieties, introduced by Fulton in 1992, are $T$-varieties consisting of $n \times n$ matrices satisfying certain constraints on the ranks of their submatrices. In this paper, we focus on the complexity of certain torus-fixed affine subvarieties of matrix Schubert varieties. Concretely, given a matrix Schubert variety $\overline{X_{w}}$ where $w\in S_n$, we study the complexity of $Y_w$ obtained by the decomposition $\overline{X_{w}} = Y_{w} \times \mathbb{C}^{k}$ with $k$ as large as possible. Building up from results by Escobar and M\'{e}sz\'{a}ros and Donten-Bury, Escobar, and Portakal, we show that for a fixed $n$, the complexity of $Y_{w}$ with respect to this action can be any integer between $0$ and $(n-1)(n-3)$, except $1$.</description>

      <title>From amoebas to pluripotential theory on hybrid analytic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These lecture notes are an introduction to the use of non-Archimedean geometry in the study of meromorphic degenerations of complex algebraic varieties. They provide a self-contained discussion of hybrid spaces, which fill in one-parameter degenerations with the associated non-Archimedean Berkovich space as a central fiber. The main focus is on the interplay between complex and non-Archimedean pluripotential theory, and on the relation between convergence of psh metrics and the associated Monge-Ampere measures in the hybrid space, following work of the author with M.Jonsson, and recent breakthrough work by Y.Li.</description>

      <title>Park City lecture notes: around the inverse Galois problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13719v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inverse Galois problem asks whether any finite group can be realised as the Galois group of a Galois extension of the rationals. This problem and its refinements have stimulated a large amount of research in number theory and algebraic geometry in the past century, ranging from Noether's problem (letting X denote the quotient of the affine space by a finite group acting linearly, when is X rational?) to the rigidity method (if X is not rational, does it at least contain interesting rational curves?) and to the arithmetic of unirational varieties (if all else fails, does X at least contain interesting rational points?). The goal of the present notes, which formed the basis for three lectures given at the Park City Mathematics Institute in August 2022, is to provide an introduction to these topics.</description>

      <title>Constructing Highly Symmetric Compact Manifolds and Algebraic Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every algebraically closed field $k$ and natural number $r$, we construct several algebraic varieties (over $k$) whose birational automorphism group contains every finite nilpotent group of class at most $2$, rank at most $r$ whose order is coprime to the characteristic of $k$. This construction is sharp in characteristic $0$, i.e. up to bounded extension, the set of groups from the statement cannot be replaced by a larger one. Using similar main ideas (with different technical details), for every $r$, we construct several compact manifolds whose diffeomorphism groups contain every finite nilpotent group of class at most $2$, rank at most $r$. This result answers a question of Mundet~i~Riera affirmatively and is conjecturally sharp up to bounded extension.</description>

      <title>Newton numbers, vanishing polytopes and algebraic degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a polynomial $f$ with a convenient Newton polytope $P$ and generic complex coefficients. By the global version of the Kouchnirenko formula, the hypersurface $\{f = 0\} \subset \mathbb{C}^n$ has the homotopy type of a bouquet of $(n-1)$-spheres, and the number of spheres is given by a certain alternating sum of volumes, called the Newton number $\nu(P)$. Using the Furukawa-Ito classification of dual defective sets, we classify convenient Newton polytopes with vanishing Newton numbers as certain Cayley sums called $B_k$-polytopes. These $B_k$-polytopes generalize the $B_1$- and $B_2$-facets appearing in the local monodromy conjecture in the Newton non-degenerate case. Our classification provides a partial solution to Arnold's monotonicity problem.
  The local $h^*$-polynomial (or $\ell^*$-polynomial) is a natural invariant of lattice polytopes that refines the $h^*$-polynomial coming from Ehrhart theory. We obtain decomposition formulas for the Newton number, for instance, prove the inequality $\nu(P) \ge \ell^*(P;1)$. The $B_k$-polytopes are non-trivial examples of thin polytopes.
  We generalize the Newton number in two independent ways: the $\ell$-Newton number and the $e$-Newton number. The $\ell$-Newton number comes from Ehrhart theory, namely, from certain generalizations of Katz-Stapledon decomposition formulas, and its properties are central to our proof that the $B_k$-polytopes are thin. The $e$-Newton number is the number of points of zero-dimensional critical complete intersections. Vanishing of the $e$-Newton number characterizes dual defective sets. Furthermore, the $e$-Newton number calculates algebraic degrees (such as Maximum Likelihood, Euclidean Distance and Polar degrees). For instance, we show that all known formulas for these algebraic degrees in the Newton non-degenerate case are implied by basic properties of the $e$-Newton number.</description>
