      <title>A classification of coadjoint orbits carrying Gibbs ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coadjoint orbit $O_\lambda \subseteq {\mathfrak g}^*$ of a Lie group $G$ is said to carry a Gibbs ensemble if the set of all $x \in {\mathfrak g}$, for which the function
  $\alpha \mapsto e^{-\alpha(x)}$ on the orbit is integrable with respect to the
  Liouville measure, has non-empty interior $\Omega_\lambda$.
  We describe a classification of all coadjoint orbits of finite-dimensional
  Lie algebras with this property. In the context of Souriau's
  Lie group thermodynamics, the subset $\Omega_\lambda$
  is the geometric temperature, a parameter space for a family
  of Gibbs measures on the coadjoint orbit. The
  corresponding Fenchel--Legendre transform maps
  $\Omega_\lambda/{\mathfrak z}({\mathfrak g})$ diffeomorphically
  onto the interior of the convex hull of the coadjoint orbit
  $O_\lambda$. This provides an interesting perspective on the
  underlying information geometry.
  We also show that already
  the integrability of $e^{-\alpha(x)}$ for one $x \in {\mathfrak g}$ implies
  that $\Omega_\lambda \not=\emptyset$ and that, for general Hamiltonian
  actions, the existence of Gibbs measures implies that the range
  of the momentum maps consists of coadjoint orbits $O_\lambda$ as above.</description>

      <title>Construction of $\mathbb{S}^1$-Gerbes over the Stack $[G/G]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an explicit construction of $\mathbb{S}^1$-gerbes over the differentiable stack $[G/G]$, where $G$ is a compact and connected Lie group. Our construction provides a complete and detailed realization of results previously announced by Behrend--Xu--Zhang, using the description of gerbes over stacks as $\mathbb{S}^1$-central extensions of Lie groupoids. Moreover, we prove that the Dixmier--Douady class of the resulting gerbe coincides with the Alekseev--Malkin--Meinrenken equivariant $3$-class; under the additional assumption that $G$ is compact, simple, and simply connected, this class represents the generator of ${\rm H}^3_G(G,\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

      <title>Background fields in the presymplectic BV-AKSZ approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09885v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of a general local gauge theory can be encoded in the structure of a so-called presymplectic gauge PDE -- an almost-$Q$ bundle over the spacetime exterior algebra, equipped with a compatible presymplectic structure. In the case of a trivial bundle and an invertible presymplectic structure, this reduces to the well-known AKSZ sigma model construction. We develop an extension of the presympletic BV-AKSZ approach to describe local gauge theories with background fields. It turns out that such theories correspond to presymplectic gauge PDEs whose base spaces are again gauge PDEs describing background fields. As such, the geometric structure is that of a bundle over a bundle over a given spacetime. Gauge PDEs over backgrounds arise naturally when studying linearisation, coupling (gauge) fields to background geometry, gauging global symmetries, etc. Less obvious examples involve parametrised systems, Fedosov equations, and the so-called homogeneous (presymplectic) gauge PDEs. The latter are the gauge-invariant generalisations of the familiar homogeneous PDEs and they provide a very concise description of gauge fields on homogeneous spaces such as higher spin gauge fields on Minkowski, (A)dS, and conformal spaces. Finally, we briefly discuss how the higher-form symmetries and their gauging fit into the framework using the simplest example of the Maxwell field.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Definition of the Integral and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard definition of integration of differential forms is based on local coordinates and partitions of unity. This definition is mostly a formality and not used used in explicit computations or approximation schemes. We present a definition of the integral that uses triangulations instead. Our definition is a coordinate-free version of the standard definition of the Riemann integral on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and we argue that it is the natural definition in the contexts of Lie algebroids, stochastic integration and quantum field theory, where path integrals are defined using lattices. In particular, our definition naturally incorporates the different stochastic integrals, which involve integration over H\"{o}lder continuous paths. Furthermore, our definition is well-adapted to establishing integral identities from their combinatorial counterparts. Our construction is based on the observation that, in great generality, the things that are integrated are determined by cochains on the pair groupoid. Abstractly, our definition uses the van Est map to lift a differential form to the pair groupoid. Our construction suggests a generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus which we prove: the singular cohomology and de Rham cohomology cap products of a cocycle with the fundamental class are equal.</description>

      <title>On SYZ mirrors of Hirzebruch surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Strominger-Yau-Zaslow (SYZ) approach to mirror symmetry constructs a mirror space and a superpotential from the data of a Lagrangian torus fibration on a K\"ahler manifold with effective first Chern class. For K\"ahler manifolds whose first Chern class is not nef, the SYZ construction is further complicated by the presence of additional holomorphic discs with non-positive Maslov index.
  In this paper, we study SYZ mirror symmetry for two of the simplest non-Fano toric examples: the Hirzebruch surfaces F_3 and F_4. Our approach is to regularize moduli spaces of stable holomorphic discs using obstruction sections arising from infinitesimal deformations of the complex structure. For F_3, we determine the SYZ mirror associated to generic regularizing perturbations of the complex structure, and demonstrate that the mirror depends on the choice of perturbation. For F_4, we determine the SYZ mirror for a specific regularizing perturbation, where the mirror superpotential is an explicit infinite Laurent series. Finally, we relate this superpotential to those arising from other perturbations of F_4, as determined in the literature \cite{CPS24, BGL25}, via a scattering diagram.</description>

      <title>Open-closed maps and spectral local systems</title>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a graded Liouville domain. Fix a pair of infinite loop spaces $\Psi = (\Theta \to \Phi)$ living over $(BO \to BU)$. This determines a spectral Fukaya category $\mathcal{F}(X;\Psi)$ whenever $TX$ lifts to $\Phi$, containing closed exact Lagrangians $L$ for which $TL$ lifts compatibly to $\Theta$; and by Bott periodicity and index theory, a Thom spectrum $R$ with bordism theory $R_*$.
  This paper has two main goals: we incorporate rank one spectral local systems $\xi: L \to BGL_1(R)$ into the spectral category; and we prove that the bordism class $[(L,\xi)]$ defined by the open-closed map differs from the class $[L]$ by a multiplicative two-torsion element in $R^0(L)^{\times}$ determined by an action of the stable homotopy class of the Hopf map $\eta \in \pi_1^{st}$ on $\xi$. Methods include a twisting construction associating flow categories to spectral local systems, and a model for the open-closed map incorporating Schlichtkrull's construction of the trace map $BGL_1(R) \subseteq K(R) \to R$.
  The companion paper \cite{PS4} shows that (for Lagrangians which themselves admit spectral lifts) one can lift quasi-isomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\Psi$ at the cost of introducing rank one local systems. Together with the open-closed computation given here, this gives an essentially complete picture of the bordism-theoretic consequences of quasi-isomorphism in the classical exact Fukaya category.</description>

      <title>Bordism from quasi-isomorphism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a graded Liouville domain. Fix a pair of infinite loop spaces $\Psi = (\Theta \to \Phi)$ living over $(BO \to BU)$. This determines a spectral Fukaya category $\mathcal{F}(X;\Psi)$ whenever $TX$ lifts to $\Phi$, containing closed exact Lagrangians $L$ for which $TL$ lifts compatibly to $\Theta$; and by Bott periodicity and index theory, a Thom spectrum $R$ with bordism theory $R_*$.
  Suppose that $L$ and $K$ are quasi-isomorphic in the Fukaya category over $\mathbb{Z}$. We prove that:
  (a) if both lift to $\mathcal{F}(X;\Psi)$, then there is a rank one $R$-local system $\xi: L \to BGL_1(R)$ over $L$ so that $(L,\xi)$ and $K$ are quasi-isomorphic in the spectral Fukaya category;
  (b) when $X$ is polarised and $\Psi = (BO \times F \to BO)$, if only $K$ lifts to $\mathcal{F}(X;\Psi)$, then the composition $L \to B^2GL_1(R)$ of the stable Gauss map of $L$ and the delooped $J$-homomorphism is nullhomotopic.
  Combined with the computation of the open-closed fundamental class associated to $(L,\xi)$ in \cite{PS3}, these results have applications to bordism and stable homotopy types of quasi-isomorphic Lagrangians, to Hamiltonian monodromy groups, and to smooth structures on nearby Lagrangians.
  A key ingredient in the proofs is a new form of obstruction theory for flow categories `lying over' a manifold $L$, closely related to a `spectral Viterbo restriction functor' also introduced here.</description>

      <title>A New Gauge-Theoretic Construction of 4-Dimensional Hyperk\"ahler ALE Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-compact hyperk\"ahler spaces arise frequently in gauge theory. The 4-dimensional hyperk\"ahler ALE spaces are a special class of non-compact hyperk\"ahler spaces. They are in one-to-one correspondence with the finite subgroups of SU(2) and have interesting connections with representation theory and singularity theory, captured by the McKay Correspondence.
  The 4-dimensional hyperk\"ahler ALE spaces are first classified by Peter Kronheimer via a finite-dimensional hyperk\"ahler reduction. In this paper, we give a new gauge-theoretic construction of these spaces. More specifically, we realize each 4-dimensional hyperk\"ahler ALE space as a moduli space of solutions to a system of equations for a pair consisting of a connection and a section of a vector bundle over an orbifold Riemann surface, modulo a gauge group action. The construction given in this paper parallels Kronheimer's original construction and hence can also be thought of as a gauge-theoretic interpretation of Kronheimer's construction of these spaces.</description>

      <title>The point insertion technique and open $r$-spin theories I: moduli and orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13185v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The papers [3,1,4,10] constructed an intersection theory on the moduli space of $r$-spin disks, and proved it satisfies mirror symmetry and relations with integrable hierarchies. That theory considered only disks with a single boundary state. In this work, we initiate the study of more general $r$-spin surfaces. We define graded $r$-spin surfaces with multiple internal and boundary states, together with their moduli spaces.
  In genus zero, the disk case, we define the associated open Witten bundle and prove that it is canonically oriented relative to the moduli space. We also describe a gluing construction for moduli spaces along boundaries, show that it lifts to the Witten bundle and relative cotangent line bundles, and that the result remains canonically relatively oriented.
  We then study the genus-one cylinder case. Here foundational difficulties arise because the Witten "bundle" is no longer an orbifold vector bundle. We resolve this by removing strata with incorrect fibre dimension, obtaining an orbibundle on the complement. The gluing method extends to genus one, and we prove that the Witten bundle again admits a canonical relative orientation.
  In the sequel [20], we construct a family of $\lfloor r/2\rfloor$ intersection theories in genus-zero indexed by $\mathfrak h\in\{0,\ldots,\lfloor r/2\rfloor-1\}$, where the $\mathfrak h$-th theory has $\mathfrak h+1$ boundary states, and compute their intersection numbers. The case $\mathfrak h=0$ recovers the theory of [3,1].
  In the sequel [21], restricting to the $\mathfrak h=0$ case, we construct an intersection theory on the moduli space of $r$-spin cylinders and show that its potential yields, after a change of variables, the genus-one part of the $r$th Gelfand-Dikii wave function, proving the genus-one case of the main conjecture of [4].</description>
