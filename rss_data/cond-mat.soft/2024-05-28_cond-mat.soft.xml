      <title>Physical phenomena during nanoindentation deformation of amorphous glassy polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine material phenomena in glassy polymers during Berkovich nanoindentation, a form of locally imposed deformation. We consider both, thermoplastics (PC and PMMA) and thermosets (partially and maximally crosslinked SU-8 epoxy). Visco-elasto-plastic (VEP) effects occur simultaneously, from the onset of glassy polymer nanoindentation. Visual observation via in-situ nanoindentation indicates mainly sink-in during loading, with pile-up after unloading. Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) indicates significant volume conserving upflow (below the tip) for these compliant materials, with high geometric fractional contact depth at maximum displacement (including blunt height, h_b), (h_c+h_b)/(h_m+h_b)~0.9. Considering the Berkovich tip as a family of cones, with cone angles ranging over the included angles of the tip, enables contact area calculation and a visual depiction of the upflow and the displacement paths below the tip. The combination of SPM and P-h data, indicates a mixed comparison with uniaxial deformation, with conventionally defined hardness, H&lt;3*sig_y and nanoindentation modulus E_N&gt;E. By rationally removing viscoelastic (VE) effects during loading, we find instant, zero-time hardness H_L0&gt;3*sig_y. Constraint-induced VE recovery of the highly yielded tip-apex region is consistent with the significant constraint effects on the conventionally defined H_L0 and E_N for compliant materials such as glassy polymers.</description>

      <title>Phantom Networks of Finite Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular chains of elastomer networks are modeled as ideal, finite, Freely Jointed Chains (FJC). We first develop a compact, closed-form, mathematically accurate representation of this model. We begin with the closed form of the Pade approximations for the Inverse Langevin Function, modified by the Slater (2003) method to map to the ideal FJC model. We fit the generalized form of this expression to exact the series expression by Treloar (1975) for the probability density function. The resulting fit yields the exact expression with respect to the Treloar expression. We verify this exact fit from the precise correlation of the moments from the fitted probability distribution with the analytical FJC distribution moments. These expressions are incorporated into the 8-chain geometry, to yield the affine network elasticity expression. We extend the exact and compact expression of an ideal FJC to determine the fluctuation distribution (about its mean position), of the junction between two ideal FJCs. The fluctuation is the conditional probability of the junction, given the separation of the distal points of the connected FJCs. The fluctuation distribution corresponds to an ideal FJC, whose effective number of segments, decreases linearly with the distal end separation. Finally, we develop the elasticity relationship for such an ideal network whose junctions can fluctuate to reduce the strain energy density. However, this reduction itself decreases with deformation, which is incorporated in developing resulting in the elasticity expression for a phantom network of finite chains.</description>

      <title>Shape of a droplet on a surface in the presence of an external field and its critical disruption condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the potential application of regulating droplet shape by external fields in microfluidic technology and micro devices, it becomes increasingly important to understand the shape formation of a droplet in the presence of an electric field. How to understand and determine such a deformable boundary shape at equilibrium has been a long-term physical and mathematical challenge. Here, based on the theoretical model we propose, and combining the finite element method and the gradient descent algorithm, we successfully obtain the droplet shape by considering the contributions made by electrostatic energy, surface tension energy, and gravitational potential energy. We also carry out scaling analyses and obtain an empirical critical disruption condition with a universal scaling exponent 1/2 for the contact angle in terms of normalized volume. The master curve fits both the experimental and the numerical results very well.</description>

      <title>Delayed Gravitational Collapse of Attractive Colloidal Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal gels have strong industrial relevance as they can behave liquid- and solid-like. The latter allows them to support the buoyant weight against gravity. However, the system is intrinsically out-of-equilibrium, which means that the colloids must eventually settle out of the suspension. The process of settling has been captured theoretically, but the presence of a delay time during which the gel appears relatively unaffected by gravity has not. Here, we modify existing frameworks to capture this delay, by treating the gel as a continuum with viscoelastic response that is based on the local bond density. We can solve our model numerically to obtain the evolution of the colloid density profile and recover qualitatively the accumulation of a dense layer on top of the settling gel, as is experimentally observed in depletion gels. This numerical study is complemented by a theoretical analysis that allows us to identify an emergent time and length scale that set the dynamics of the gel. Our model provides a solid foundation for future studies that incorporate hydrodynamic erosion and tackle industrially relevant geometries.</description>

      <title>Dynamic response of a ferromagnetic nanofilament under rotating fields: effects of flexibility, thermal fluctuations and hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using nonequilibrium computer simulations, we study the response of ferromagnetic nanofilaments, consisting of stabilized onedimensional chains of ferromagnetic nanoparticles, under external rotating magnetic fields. In difference with their analogous microscale and stiff counterparts, which have been actively studied in recent years, nonequilibrium properties of rather flexible nanoparticle filaments remain mostly unexplored. By progressively increasing the modeling details, we are able to evidence the qualitative impact of main interactions that can not be neglected at the nanoscale, showing that filament flexibility, thermal fluctuations and hydrodynamic interactions contribute independently to broaden the range of synchronous frequency response in this system. Furthermore, we also show the existence of a limited set of characteristic dynamic filament configurations and discuss in detail the asynchronous response, which at finite temperature becomes probabilistic.</description>

      <title>Anti-plane segregation and diffusion in dense, bidisperse granular shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many dense granular systems are non-monodisperse, consisting of particles of different sizes, and will segregate based on size during flow. This phenomenon is an important aspect of many industrial and geophysical processes, necessitating predictive continuum models. This paper systematically studies a key aspect of the three-dimensional nature of segregation and diffusion in flowing, dense, bidisperse granular mixtures -- namely, segregation and diffusion acting along the direction perpendicular to the plane of shearing, which we refer to as the anti-plane modes of segregation and diffusion. To this end, we consider discrete-element method (DEM) simulations of flows of dense, bidisperse mixtures of frictional spheres in an idealized configuration that isolates anti-plane segregation and diffusion. We find that previously-developed constitutive equations, calibrated to DEM simulation results from flows in which both the segregation and diffusion processes occur within the plane of shearing, do not capture aspects of the anti-plane segregation dynamics. Accordingly, we utilize DEM simulation results to inform and calibrate constitutive equations for the segregation and diffusion fluxes in their anti-plane modes. Predictions of the resulting continuum model for the anti-plane segregation dynamics are tested against additional DEM simulation results across different cases, while parameters such as the shear strain rate and mixture composition are varied, and we find that the calibrated model predictions match well with the DEM simulation results. Finally, we suggest a strategy for generalizing the constitutive forms for the segregation and diffusion fluxes to obtain three-dimensional constitutive equations that account for both the in-plane and anti-plane modes of the segregation and diffusion processes.</description>

      <title>Emergent asymmetry in confined bioconvection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bioconvection is the prototypical active matter system for hydrodynamic instabilities and pattern formation in suspensions of biased swimming microorganisms, particularly at the dilute end of the concentration spectrum where cell-cell interactions typically are neglected. Confinement is an inherent characteristic of such systems, including those that are naturally-occurring or industrially-exploited, so it is important to understand the impact of boundaries on the hydrodynamic instabilities. Despite recent interest in this area we note that commonly-adopted symmetry assumptions in the literature, such as for a vertical channel or pipe, are uncorroborated and potentially unjustified. Therefore, by employing a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we investigate whether confinement itself can drive asymmetric plume formation in a suspension of bottom-heavy swimming microorganisms (gyrotactic cells). For a class of solutions in a vertical channel we establish the existence of a first integral of motion, and reveal that asymptotic asymmetry is plausible. Furthermore, numerical simulations from both Lagrangian and Eulerian perspectives demonstrate with remarkable agreement that asymmetric solutions can indeed be more stable than symmetric; asymmetric solutions are in fact dominant for a large, practically-important region of parameter space. In addition, we verify the presence of blip and varicose instabilities for an experimentally accessible parameter range. Finally, we extend our study to a vertical Hele-Shaw geometry to explore whether a simple linear drag approximation can be justified. We find that although two-dimensional bioconvective structures and associated bulk properties have some similarities with experimental observations, approximating near wall physics in even the simplest confined systems remains challenging.</description>

      <title>Computational Investigation of Reactivity Parameters, UV-Vis and IR Spectra, NLO Properties, and Temperature-Dependent Thermodynamic Characteristics of Schiff-Based Interdigitated 5O.m (m=14,16) Liquid Crystalline Compounds: A DFT Analysis</title>

Abstract: The article studies the different physical, vibrational, nonlinear optical, and thermodynamical properties of higher homologs 5O.m (m = 14,16) liquid crystalline compounds using density functional theory. The optimized structure of 5O.m (m= 14,16) liquid crystals was obtained by using density functional theory (DFT) with B3LYP functional and standard basis set 6-31G (d, p). The Infrared spectra (IR), various physical properties such as HOMO-LUMO, nonlinear optical properties (NLO), reactivity parameters, relative energy gaps, and electrostatic potential function are computed and analyzed using the optimized structure of 5O liquid crystal. The time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) has been used to analyze and obtain UV-Vis spectra for both LC compounds. It is observed that the 5O.m (m=14,16) liquid crystals are showing the lower value of HOMO-LUMO energy gaps as 4.17ev which resulted in some highly fascinating optical and physical properties. Using DFT excellent agreement is observed between all spectrum patterns and the simulated UV-Vis and IR spectra. This article, however, also discussed temperature-dependent thermodynamical properties such as zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE), total thermal energy, total specific heat capacity, rotational constants, and total entropy which enable us to understand the phase transition behavior and specific transition temperatures of different phases</description>

      <title>Active gel model for one-dimensional cell migration coupling actin flow and adhesion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Migration of animal cells is based on the interplay between actin polymerization at the front, adhesion along the cell-substrate interface, and actomyosin contractility at the back. Active gel theory has been used before to demonstrate that actomyosin contractility is sufficient for polarization and self-sustained cell migration in the absence of external cues, but did not consider the dynamics of adhesion. Likewise, migration models based on the mechanosensitive dynamics of adhesion receptors usually do not include the global dynamics of intracellular flow. Here we show that both aspects can be combined in a minimal active gel model for one-dimensional cell migration with dynamic adhesion. This model demonstrates that load sharing between the adhesion receptors leads to symmetry breaking, with stronger adhesion at the front, and that bistability of migration arises for intermediate adhesiveness. Local variations in adhesiveness are sufficient to switch between sessile and motile states, in qualitative agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Second Law of Thermodynamics without Einstein Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials that are constantly driven out of thermodynamic equilibrium, such as active and living systems, typically violate the Einstein relation. This may arise from active contributions to particle fluctuations which are unrelated to the dissipative resistance of the surrounding medium. We show that in these cases the widely used relation between informatic entropy production and heat dissipation does not hold. Consequently, fluctuation relations for the mechanical work, such as the Jarzynski and Crooks theorems, are invalid. We relate the breaking of the correspondence between entropy production and heat dissipation to the breaking of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We propose a temperature-like variable which restores this correspondence and gives rise to a generalized second law of thermodynamics, whereby the dissipated heat is necessarily nonnegative and vanishes at equilibrium. The Clausius inequality, Carnot maximum efficiency theorem, and relation between the maximum extractable work and the change of free energy are recovered as well.</description>

Abstract: Odd viscosity (OV) is a transport coefficient in, for example, fluids of self-spinning (active) particles or electrons in an external magnetic field. The key feature of OV is that it does not contribute to dissipation in two spatial dimensions. In contrast, we explicitly show that in the three-dimensional case, OV can contribute indirectly to dissipation by modifying the fluid flow. We quantify the dissipation rate of a single spherical particle moving through a fluid with OV via an exact analytical solution of the generalised stationary creeping flow equations. Our results provide a novel way to quantify the effects of OV by measuring the solid-body motion of a single spherical particle. Moreover, we explicitly demonstrate how complex fluids can be designed in terms of their rheological properties by mixing passive particles with self-spinning active particles.</description>

Abstract: Direct viscous mechano-electric response is demonstrated for a room-temperature ferroelectric nematic liquid, which combines large spontaneous electric polarization with 3D fluidity. The mechano-electric transduction is observed in the frequency range 1-200 Hz via a simple demonstrator device. The liquid is placed into a deformable container with electrodes and the electric current induced by both periodic and irregular actuation of the container is examined. The experiments reveal a rich interplay of several distinct viscous mechano-electric phenomena, where both shape deformations and material flow cause changes in the electric polarization structure of a ferroelectric nematic liquid. The results show that the mechano-electric features of the material promise a considerable applicative perspective spanning from sensitive tactile sensors to energy harvesting devices.</description>

      <title>Evolution of static to dynamic mechanical behavior in topological nonreciprocal robotic metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the Maxwell-Beatty reciprocity theorem, static non-reciprocity has been realized by using nonlinearity, but this non-reciprocity has strict restrictions on input amplitude and structure size (number of units). Here, we propose a robotic metamaterial with two components of displacement and rotation, which uses active control to add external forces on the units to break reciprocity at the level of the interactions between the units. We show analytically and simulatively that breaking reciprocity at the level of the interactions directly leads to a strong asymmetric response of displacement in a static system, this displacement-specific characteristic not only has no restrictions on size, input amplitude, and suitable geometric asymmetry, but also can be transmitted to rotation by coupling under large deformation. After the evolution from statics to dynamics, asymmetric transmission and unidirectional amplification of vector solitons are both implemented in this system. Our research uncovers the evolution of static non-reciprocity to dynamic non-reciprocity while building a bridge between non-reciprocity physics and soliton science.</description>

      <title>The Role of a Diluent in Deformation-Induced Bonding of Glassy Polymer Bidisperse Blends</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bonding between polymers below the glass transition temperature through molecular-scale dilatation (or densification)-based interdiffusion of macromolecules has recently been introduced. In this mechanism, short timeframe plastic deformation enables polymer chains to interdiffuse and form entanglements at the interface, facilitating rapid bonding below the glass transition temperature ($T_g$). Here, we are addressing the role of a lower molecular weight diluent in bonding polymer interfaces of bidisperse blends through deformation-induced bonding (DIB) at temperatures well below both the surface and bulk glass transition temperatures, $T_g^s$ and $T_g^b$, respectively, by using molecular simulations. These simulations reveal that addition of the diluent ($\phi\le$20\%) drastically enhances the number of chain-ends at the interfacial region compared to a pure glass sample ($\phi=0\%$) during deformation below $T_g^s$, which improves the possibility of opposite side entanglement formation. The changes in stress-strain response of debonded samples correlate with the normalized entanglement density. Likewise, the maximum interfacial fracture energy $G_{I,max}$ of debonded samples is correlated with the diluent concentration ($\phi$), below $T_g^s$. Furthermore, the optimization of material and process conditions for DIB has yielded a notable advancement for the conditions tested here: achieving a higher bonding strength, approximately one-third of the bulk, all while remaining below $T_g$.</description>

Abstract: The emergence of statistical complexity in frictional systems, manifested in broad distributions of various observables, is not yet understood. We study this problem in velocity-driven, homogeneous (no quenched disorder) unstable frictional systems of height $H$. The latter are described at the continuum scale within a realistic rate-and-state friction interfacial constitutive framework, where elasto-frictional instabilities emerge from rate-weakening friction. For large $H$, such frictional systems were recently shown to undergo continuous coarsening until settling into a spatially periodic traveling solution. We show that when the system's height-to-length ratio becomes small, coarsening is less effective and the periodic solution is dynamically avoided. Instead, and consistently with previous reports, the system settles into a stochastic, statistically stationary state. The latter features slip bursts, classified into predominantly non-propagating small bursts and propagating large bursts, which are non-trivially distributed. The statistical distributions emerge from dynamically self-generated heterogeneity, where both the non-equilibrium history of the interface and wave reflections from finite boundaries, mediated by material inertia, play central roles. Specifically, the dynamics and statistics of large bursts reveal a timescale $\sim\!H/c_{\rm s}$, where $c_{\rm s}$ is the shear wave-speed. We discuss the robustness of our findings against variations of the frictional parameters, most notably affecting the magnitude of frictional rate-weakening, as well as against different interfacial state evolution laws. Finally, we demonstrate a reverse transition in which statistical complexity disappears in favor of the spatially periodic traveling solution. Overall, our results elucidate how relatively simple physical ingredients can give rise to the emergence of slip complexity.</description>
