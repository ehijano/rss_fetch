      <title>Enhancing Exploratory Learning through Exploratory Search with the Emergence of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the information era, how learners find, evaluate, and effectively use information has become a challenging issue, especially with the added complexity of large language models (LLMs) that have further confused learners in their information retrieval and search activities. This study attempts to unpack this complexity by combining exploratory search strategies with the theories of exploratory learning to form a new theoretical model of exploratory learning from the perspective of students' learning. Our work adapts Kolb's learning model by incorporating high-frequency exploration and feedback loops, aiming to promote deep cognitive and higher-order cognitive skill development in students. Additionally, this paper discusses and suggests how advanced LLMs integrated into information retrieval and information theory can support students in their exploratory searches, contributing theoretically to promoting student-computer interaction and supporting their learning journeys in the new era with LLMs.</description>

      <title>LLMJudge: LLMs for Relevance Judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LLMJudge challenge is organized as part of the LLM4Eval workshop at SIGIR 2024. Test collections are essential for evaluating information retrieval (IR) systems. The evaluation and tuning of a search system is largely based on relevance labels, which indicate whether a document is useful for a specific search and user. However, collecting relevance judgments on a large scale is costly and resource-intensive. Consequently, typical experiments rely on third-party labelers who may not always produce accurate annotations. The LLMJudge challenge aims to explore an alternative approach by using LLMs to generate relevance judgments. Recent studies have shown that LLMs can generate reliable relevance judgments for search systems. However, it remains unclear which LLMs can match the accuracy of human labelers, which prompts are most effective, how fine-tuned open-source LLMs compare to closed-source LLMs like GPT-4, whether there are biases in synthetically generated data, and if data leakage affects the quality of generated labels. This challenge will investigate these questions, and the collected data will be released as a package to support automatic relevance judgment research in information retrieval and search.</description>

      <title>Towards Effective Authorship Attribution: Integrating Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AA is the process of attributing an unidentified document to its true author from a predefined group of known candidates, each possessing multiple samples. The nature of AA necessitates accommodating emerging new authors, as each individual must be considered unique. This uniqueness can be attributed to various factors, including their stylistic preferences, areas of expertise, gender, cultural background, and other personal characteristics that influence their writing. These diverse attributes contribute to the distinctiveness of each author, making it essential for AA systems to recognize and account for these variations. However, current AA benchmarks commonly overlook this uniqueness and frame the problem as a closed-world classification, assuming a fixed number of authors throughout the system's lifespan and neglecting the inclusion of emerging new authors. This oversight renders the majority of existing approaches ineffective for real-world applications of AA, where continuous learning is essential. These inefficiencies manifest as current models either resist learning new authors or experience catastrophic forgetting, where the introduction of new data causes the models to lose previously acquired knowledge. To address these inefficiencies, we propose redefining AA as CIL, where new authors are introduced incrementally after the initial training phase, allowing the system to adapt and learn continuously. To achieve this, we briefly examine subsequent CIL approaches introduced in other domains. Moreover, we have adopted several well-known CIL methods, along with an examination of their strengths and weaknesses in the context of AA. Additionally, we outline potential future directions for advancing CIL AA systems. As a result, our paper can serve as a starting point for evolving AA systems from closed-world models to continual learning through CIL paradigms.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference to improve quality of Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation or RAG is the most popular pattern for modern Large Language Model or LLM applications. RAG involves taking a user query and finding relevant paragraphs of context in a large corpus typically captured in a vector database. Once the first level of search happens over a vector database, the top n chunks of relevant text are included directly in the context and sent as prompt to the LLM. Problem with this approach is that quality of text chunks depends on effectiveness of search. There is no strong post processing after search to determine if the chunk does hold enough information to include in prompt. Also many times there may be chunks that have conflicting information on the same subject and the model has no prior experience which chunk to prioritize to make a decision. Often times, this leads to the model providing a statement that there are conflicting statements, and it cannot produce an answer. In this research we propose a Bayesian approach to verify the quality of text chunks from the search results. Bayes theorem tries to relate conditional probabilities of the hypothesis with evidence and prior probabilities. We propose that, finding likelihood of text chunks to give a quality answer and using prior probability of quality of text chunks can help us improve overall quality of the responses from RAG systems. We can use the LLM itself to get a likelihood of relevance of a context paragraph. For prior probability of the text chunk, we use the page number in the documents parsed. Assumption is that that paragraphs in earlier pages have a better probability of being findings and more relevant to generalizing an answer.</description>

      <title>Bundle Recommendation with Item-level Causation-enhanced Multi-view Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bundle recommendation aims to enhance business profitability and user convenience by suggesting a set of interconnected items. In real-world scenarios, leveraging the impact of asymmetric item affiliations is crucial for effective bundle modeling and understanding user preferences. To address this, we present BunCa, a novel bundle recommendation approach employing item-level causation-enhanced multi-view learning. BunCa provides comprehensive representations of users and bundles through two views: the Coherent View, leveraging the Multi-Prospect Causation Network for causation-sensitive relations among items, and the Cohesive View, employing LightGCN for information propagation among users and bundles. Modeling user preferences and bundle construction combined from both views ensures rigorous cohesion in direct user-bundle interactions through the Cohesive View and captures explicit intents through the Coherent View. Simultaneously, the integration of concrete and discrete contrastive learning optimizes the consistency and self-discrimination of multi-view representations. Extensive experiments with BunCa on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel research and validate our hypothesis.</description>

      <title>What should I wear to a party in a Greek taverna? Evaluation for Conversational Agents in the Fashion Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are poised to revolutionize the domain of online fashion retail, enhancing customer experience and discovery of fashion online. LLM-powered conversational agents introduce a new way of discovery by directly interacting with customers, enabling them to express in their own ways, refine their needs, obtain fashion and shopping advice that is relevant to their taste and intent. For many tasks in e-commerce, such as finding a specific product, conversational agents need to convert their interactions with a customer to a specific call to different backend systems, e.g., a search system to showcase a relevant set of products. Therefore, evaluating the capabilities of LLMs to perform those tasks related to calling other services is vital. However, those evaluations are generally complex, due to the lack of relevant and high quality datasets, and do not align seamlessly with business needs, amongst others. To this end, we created a multilingual evaluation dataset of 4k conversations between customers and a fashion assistant in a large e-commerce fashion platform to measure the capabilities of LLMs to serve as an assistant between customers and a backend engine. We evaluate a range of models, showcasing how our dataset scales to business needs and facilitates iterative development of tools.</description>

      <title>MLoRA: Multi-Domain Low-Rank Adaptive Network for CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is one of the fundamental tasks in the industry, especially in e-commerce, social media, and streaming media. It directly impacts website revenues, user satisfaction, and user retention. However, real-world production platforms often encompass various domains to cater for diverse customer needs. Traditional CTR prediction models struggle in multi-domain recommendation scenarios, facing challenges of data sparsity and disparate data distributions across domains. Existing multi-domain recommendation approaches introduce specific-domain modules for each domain, which partially address these issues but often significantly increase model parameters and lead to insufficient training. In this paper, we propose a Multi-domain Low-Rank Adaptive network (MLoRA) for CTR prediction, where we introduce a specialized LoRA module for each domain. This approach enhances the model's performance in multi-domain CTR prediction tasks and is able to be applied to various deep-learning models. We evaluate the proposed method on several multi-domain datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our MLoRA approach achieves a significant improvement compared with state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we deploy it in the production environment of the Alibaba.COM. The online A/B testing results indicate the superiority and flexibility in real-world production environments. The code of our MLoRA is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Personalized Federated Collaborative Filtering: A Variational AutoEncoder Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Collaborative Filtering (FedCF) is an emerging field focused on developing a new recommendation framework with preserving privacy in a federated setting. Existing FedCF methods typically combine distributed Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms with privacy-preserving mechanisms, and then preserve personalized information into a user embedding vector. However, the user embedding is usually insufficient to preserve the rich information of the fine-grained personalization across heterogeneous clients. This paper proposes a novel personalized FedCF method by preserving users' personalized information into a latent variable and a neural model simultaneously. Specifically, we decompose the modeling of user knowledge into two encoders, each designed to capture shared knowledge and personalized knowledge separately. A personalized gating network is then applied to balance personalization and generalization between the global and local encoders. Moreover, to effectively train the proposed framework, we model the CF problem as a specialized Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) task by integrating user interaction vector reconstruction with missing value prediction. The decoder is trained to reconstruct the implicit feedback from items the user has interacted with, while also predicting items the user might be interested in but has not yet interacted with. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other baseline methods, showcasing superior performance.</description>

      <title>RoarGraph: A Projected Bipartite Graph for Efficient Cross-Modal Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a fundamental and critical component in many applications, including recommendation systems and large language model-based applications. With the advancement of multimodal neural models, which transform data from different modalities into a shared high-dimensional space as feature vectors, cross-modal ANNS aims to use the data vector from one modality (e.g., texts) as the query to retrieve the most similar items from another (e.g., images or videos). However, there is an inherent distribution gap between embeddings from different modalities, and cross-modal queries become Out-of-Distribution (OOD) to the base data. Consequently, state-of-the-art ANNS approaches suffer poor performance for OOD workloads. In this paper, we quantitatively analyze the properties of the OOD workloads to gain an understanding of their ANNS efficiency. Unlike single-modal workloads, we reveal OOD queries spatially deviate from base data, and the k-nearest neighbors of an OOD query are distant from each other in the embedding space. The property breaks the assumptions of existing ANNS approaches and mismatches their design for efficient search. With insights from the OOD workloads, we propose pRojected bipartite Graph (RoarGraph), an efficient ANNS graph index built under the guidance of query distribution. Extensive experiments show that RoarGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on modern cross-modal datasets, achieving up to 3.56x faster search speed at a 90% recall rate for OOD queries.</description>

      <title>From Lazy to Prolific: Tackling Missing Labels in Open Vocabulary Extreme Classification by Positive-Unlabeled Sequence Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary Extreme Multi-label Classification (OXMC) extends traditional XMC by allowing prediction beyond an extremely large, predefined label set (typically $10^3$ to $10^{12}$ labels), addressing the dynamic nature of real-world labeling tasks. However, self-selection bias in data annotation leads to significant missing labels in both training and test data, particularly for less popular inputs. This creates two critical challenges: generation models learn to be "lazy'" by under-generating labels, and evaluation becomes unreliable due to insufficient annotation in the test set. In this work, we introduce Positive-Unlabeled Sequence Learning (PUSL), which reframes OXMC as an infinite keyphrase generation task, addressing the generation model's laziness. Additionally, we propose to adopt a suite of evaluation metrics, F1@$\mathcal{O}$ and newly proposed B@$k$, to reliably assess OXMC models with incomplete ground truths. In a highly imbalanced e-commerce dataset with substantial missing labels, PUSL generates 30% more unique labels, and 72% of its predictions align with actual user queries. On the less skewed EURLex-4.3k dataset, PUSL demonstrates superior F1 scores, especially as label counts increase from 15 to 30. Our approach effectively tackles both the modeling and evaluation challenges in OXMC with missing labels.</description>

      <title>Meta Knowledge for Retrieval Augmented Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique used to augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with contextually relevant, time-critical, or domain-specific information without altering the underlying model parameters. However, constructing RAG systems that can effectively synthesize information from large and diverse set of documents remains a significant challenge. We introduce a novel data-centric RAG workflow for LLMs, transforming the traditional retrieve-then-read system into a more advanced prepare-then-rewrite-then-retrieve-then-read framework, to achieve higher domain expert-level understanding of the knowledge base. Our methodology relies on generating metadata and synthetic Questions and Answers (QA) for each document, as well as introducing the new concept of Meta Knowledge Summary (MK Summary) for metadata-based clusters of documents. The proposed innovations enable personalized user-query augmentation and in-depth information retrieval across the knowledge base. Our research makes two significant contributions: using LLMs as evaluators and employing new comparative performance metrics, we demonstrate that (1) using augmented queries with synthetic question matching significantly outperforms traditional RAG pipelines that rely on document chunking (p &lt; 0.01), and (2) meta knowledge-augmented queries additionally significantly improve retrieval precision and recall, as well as the final answers breadth, depth, relevancy, and specificity. Our methodology is cost-effective, costing less than $20 per 2000 research papers using Claude 3 Haiku, and can be adapted with any fine-tuning of either the language or embedding models to further enhance the performance of end-to-end RAG pipelines.</description>

      <title>Ranking Across Different Content Types: The Robust Beauty of Multinomial Blending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing number of media streaming services have expanded their offerings to include entities of multiple content types. For instance, audio streaming services that started by offering music only, now also offer podcasts, merchandise items, and videos. Ranking items across different content types into a single slate poses a significant challenge for traditional learning-to-rank (LTR) algorithms due to differing user engagement patterns for different content types. We explore a simple method for cross-content-type ranking, called multinomial blending (MB), which can be used in conjunction with most existing LTR algorithms. We compare MB to existing baselines not only in terms of ranking quality but also from other industry-relevant perspectives such as interpretability, ease-of-use, and stability in dynamic environments with changing user behavior and ranking model retraining. Finally, we report the results of an A/B test from an Amazon Music ranking use-case.</description>

      <title>TC-RAG:Turing-Complete RAG's Case study on Medical LLM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of enhancing domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) emerges as a promising solution to mitigate issues such as hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and limited expertise in highly specialized queries. However, existing approaches to RAG fall short by neglecting system state variables, which are crucial for ensuring adaptive control, retrieval halting, and system convergence. In this paper, we introduce the TC-RAG through rigorous proof, a novel framework that addresses these challenges by incorporating a Turing Complete System to manage state variables, thereby enabling more efficient and accurate knowledge retrieval. By leveraging a memory stack system with adaptive retrieval, reasoning, and planning capabilities, TC-RAG not only ensures the controlled halting of retrieval processes but also mitigates the accumulation of erroneous knowledge via Push and Pop actions. In the case study of the medical domain, our extensive experiments on real-world healthcare datasets demonstrate the superiority of TC-RAG over existing methods in accuracy by over 7.20\%. Our dataset and code have been available at https://https://github.com/Artessay/SAMA.git.</description>

      <title>FabricQA-Extractor: A Question Answering System to Extract Information from Documents using Natural Language Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reading comprehension models answer questions posed in natural language when provided with a short passage of text. They present an opportunity to address a long-standing challenge in data management: the extraction of structured data from unstructured text. Consequently, several approaches are using these models to perform information extraction. However, these modern approaches leave an opportunity behind because they do not exploit the relational structure of the target extraction table. In this paper, we introduce a new model, Relation Coherence, that exploits knowledge of the relational structure to improve the extraction quality. We incorporate the Relation Coherence model as part of FabricQA-Extractor, an end-to-end system we built from scratch to conduct large scale extraction tasks over millions of documents. We demonstrate on two datasets with millions of passages that Relation Coherence boosts extraction performance and evaluate FabricQA-Extractor on large scale datasets.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Semantic Search: Unveiling User Intent Beyond Keywords</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of traditional keyword-based search in understanding user intent and introduces a novel hybrid search approach that leverages the strengths of non-semantic search engines, Large Language Models (LLMs), and embedding models. The proposed system integrates keyword matching, semantic vector embeddings, and LLM-generated structured queries to deliver highly relevant and contextually appropriate search results. By combining these complementary methods, the hybrid approach effectively captures both explicit and implicit user intent.The paper further explores techniques to optimize query execution for faster response times and demonstrates the effectiveness of this hybrid search model in producing comprehensive and accurate search outcomes.</description>

      <title>Towards Effective Top-N Hamming Search via Bipartite Graph Contrastive Hashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching on bipartite graphs serves as a fundamental task for various real-world applications, such as recommendation systems, database retrieval, and document querying. Conventional approaches rely on similarity matching in continuous Euclidean space of vectorized node embeddings. To handle intensive similarity computation efficiently, hashing techniques for graph-structured data have emerged as a prominent research direction. However, despite the retrieval efficiency in Hamming space, previous studies have encountered catastrophic performance decay. To address this challenge, we investigate the problem of hashing with Graph Convolutional Network for effective Top-N search. Our findings indicate the learning effectiveness of incorporating hashing techniques within the exploration of bipartite graph reception fields, as opposed to simply treating hashing as post-processing to output embeddings. To further enhance the model performance, we advance upon these findings and propose Bipartite Graph Contrastive Hashing (BGCH+). BGCH+ introduces a novel dual augmentation approach to both intermediate information and hash code outputs in the latent feature spaces, thereby producing more expressive and robust hash codes within a dual self-supervised learning paradigm. Comprehensive empirical analyses on six real-world benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our dual feature contrastive learning in boosting the performance of BGCH+ compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>A Study of PHOC Spatial Region Configurations for Math Formula Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Pyramidal Histogram Of Characters (PHOC) represents the spatial location of symbols as binary vectors. The vectors are composed of levels that split a formula into equal-sized regions of one or more types (e.g., rectangles or ellipses). For each region type, this produces a pyramid of overlapping regions, where the first level contains the entire formula, and the final level the finest-grained regions. In this work, we introduce concentric rectangles for regions, and analyze whether subsequent PHOC levels encode redundant information by omitting levels from PHOC configurations. As a baseline, we include a bag of words PHOC containing only the first whole-formula level. Finally, using the ARQMath-3 formula retrieval benchmark, we demonstrate that some levels encoded in the original PHOC configurations are redundant, that PHOC models with rectangular regions outperform earlier PHOC models, and that despite their simplicity, PHOC models are surprisingly competitive with the state-of-the-art. PHOC is not math-specific, and might be used for chemical diagrams, charts, or other graphics.</description>

      <title>Deep Code Search with Naming-Agnostic Contrastive Multi-View Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software development is a repetitive task, as developers usually reuse or get inspiration from existing implementations. Code search, which refers to the retrieval of relevant code snippets from a codebase according to the developer's intent that has been expressed as a query, has become increasingly important in the software development process. Due to the success of deep learning in various applications, a great number of deep learning based code search approaches have sprung up and achieved promising results. However, developers may not follow the same naming conventions and the same variable may have different variable names in different implementations, bringing a challenge to deep learning based code search methods that rely on explicit variable correspondences to understand source code. To overcome this challenge, we propose a naming-agnostic code search method (NACS) based on contrastive multi-view code representation learning. NACS strips information bound to variable names from Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), the representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code, and focuses on capturing intrinsic properties solely from AST structures. We use semantic-level and syntax-level augmentation techniques to prepare realistically rational data and adopt contrastive learning to design a graph-view modeling component in NACS to enhance the understanding of code snippets. We further model ASTs in a path view to strengthen the graph-view modeling component through multi-view learning. Extensive experiments show that NACS provides superior code search performance compared to baselines and NACS can be adapted to help existing code search methods overcome the impact of different naming conventions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the large number of Hindi speakers worldwide, there is a pressing need for robust and efficient information retrieval systems for Hindi. Despite ongoing research, there is a lack of comprehensive benchmark for evaluating retrieval models in Hindi. To address this gap, we introduce the Hindi version of the BEIR benchmark, which includes a subset of English BEIR datasets translated to Hindi, existing Hindi retrieval datasets, and synthetically created datasets for retrieval. The benchmark is comprised of $15$ datasets spanning across $8$ distinct tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art multilingual retrieval models on this benchmark to identify task and domain-specific challenges and their impact on retrieval performance. By releasing this benchmark and a set of relevant baselines, we enable researchers to understand the limitations and capabilities of current Hindi retrieval models, promoting advancements in this critical area. The datasets from Hindi-BEIR are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Towards Boosting LLMs-driven Relevance Modeling with Progressive Retrieved Behavior-augmented Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relevance modeling is a critical component for enhancing user experience in search engines, with the primary objective of identifying items that align with users' queries. Traditional models only rely on the semantic congruence between queries and items to ascertain relevance. However, this approach represents merely one aspect of the relevance judgement, and is insufficient in isolation. Even powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) still cannot accurately judge the relevance of a query and an item from a semantic perspective. To augment LLMs-driven relevance modeling, this study proposes leveraging user interactions recorded in search logs to yield insights into users' implicit search intentions. The challenge lies in the effective prompting of LLMs to capture dynamic search intentions, which poses several obstacles in real-world relevance scenarios, i.e., the absence of domain-specific knowledge, the inadequacy of an isolated prompt, and the prohibitive costs associated with deploying LLMs. In response, we propose ProRBP, a novel Progressive Retrieved Behavior-augmented Prompting framework for integrating search scenario-oriented knowledge with LLMs effectively. Specifically, we perform the user-driven behavior neighbors retrieval from the daily search logs to obtain domain-specific knowledge in time, retrieving candidates that users consider to meet their expectations. Then, we guide LLMs for relevance modeling by employing advanced prompting techniques that progressively improve the outputs of the LLMs, followed by a progressive aggregation with comprehensive consideration of diverse aspects. For online serving, we have developed an industrial application framework tailored for the deployment of LLMs in relevance modeling. Experiments on real-world industry data and online A/B testing demonstrate our proposal achieves promising performance.</description>

      <title>Debiased Contrastive Representation Learning for Mitigating Dual Biases in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recommender systems, popularity and conformity biases undermine recommender effectiveness by disproportionately favouring popular items, leading to their over-representation in recommendation lists and causing an unbalanced distribution of user-item historical data. We construct a causal graph to address both biases and describe the abstract data generation mechanism. Then, we use it as a guide to develop a novel Debiased Contrastive Learning framework for Mitigating Dual Biases, called DCLMDB. In DCLMDB, both popularity bias and conformity bias are handled in the model training process by contrastive learning to ensure that user choices and recommended items are not unduly influenced by conformity and popularity. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, Movielens-10M and Netflix, show that DCLMDB can effectively reduce the dual biases, as well as significantly enhance the accuracy and diversity of recommendations.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Conditional Instrumental Variables for Debiasing Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recommender systems, latent variables can cause user-item interaction data to deviate from true user preferences. This biased data is then used to train recommendation models, further amplifying the bias and ultimately compromising both recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction. Instrumental Variable (IV) methods are effective tools for addressing the confounding bias introduced by latent variables; however, identifying a valid IV is often challenging. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel data-driven conditional IV (CIV) debiasing method for recommender systems, called CIV4Rec. CIV4Rec automatically generates valid CIVs and their corresponding conditioning sets directly from interaction data, significantly reducing the complexity of IV selection while effectively mitigating the confounding bias caused by latent variables in recommender systems. Specifically, CIV4Rec leverages a variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate the representations of the CIV and its conditional set from interaction data, followed by the application of least squares to derive causal representations for click prediction. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, Movielens-10M and Douban-Movie, demonstrate that our CIV4Rec successfully identifies valid CIVs, effectively reduces bias, and consequently improves recommendation accuracy.</description>

      <title>GANPrompt: Enhancing Robustness in LLM-Based Recommendations with GAN-Enhanced Diversity Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, LLM has demonstrated remarkable proficiency in comprehending and generating natural language, with a growing prevalence in the domain of recommender systems. However, LLM continues to face a significant challenge in that it is highly susceptible to the influence of prompt words. This inconsistency in response to minor alterations in prompt input may compromise the accuracy and resilience of recommendation models. To address this issue, this paper proposes GANPrompt, a multi-dimensional large language model prompt diversity framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The framework enhances the model's adaptability and stability to diverse prompts by integrating GAN generation techniques with the deep semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs. GANPrompt first trains a generator capable of producing diverse prompts by analysing multidimensional user behavioural data. These diverse prompts are then used to train the LLM to improve its performance in the face of unseen prompts. Furthermore, to ensure a high degree of diversity and relevance of the prompts, this study introduces a mathematical theory-based diversity constraint mechanism that optimises the generated prompts to ensure that they are not only superficially distinct, but also semantically cover a wide range of user intentions. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, especially in improving the adaptability and robustness of recommender systems in complex and dynamic environments. The experimental results demonstrate that GANPrompt yields substantial enhancements in accuracy and robustness relative to existing state-of-the-art methodologies.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Multimodal Large Language Models for Multimodal Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the field of Recommendation Systems (RSs). Most existing studies have focused on converting user behavior logs into textual prompts and leveraging techniques such as prompt tuning to enable LLMs for recommendation tasks. Meanwhile, research interest has recently grown in multimodal recommendation systems that integrate data from images, text, and other sources using modality fusion techniques. This introduces new challenges to the existing LLM-based recommendation paradigm which relies solely on text modality information. Moreover, although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capable of processing multi-modal inputs have emerged, how to equip MLLMs with multi-modal recommendation capabilities remains largely unexplored. To this end, in this paper, we propose the Multimodal Large Language Model-enhanced Sequential Multimodal Recommendation (MLLM-MSR) model. To capture the dynamic user preference, we design a two-stage user preference summarization method. Specifically, we first utilize an MLLM-based item-summarizer to extract image feature given an item and convert the image into text. Then, we employ a recurrent user preference summarization generation paradigm to capture the dynamic changes in user preferences based on an LLM-based user-summarizer. Finally, to enable the MLLM for multi-modal recommendation task, we propose to fine-tune a MLLM-based recommender using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) techniques. Extensive evaluations across various datasets validate the effectiveness of MLLM-MSR, showcasing its superior ability to capture and adapt to the evolving dynamics of user preferences.</description>

      <title>Carbon Footprint Accounting Driven by Large Language Models and Retrieval-augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon footprint accounting is crucial for quantifying greenhouse gas emissions and achieving carbon neutrality.The dynamic nature of processes, accounting rules, carbon-related policies, and energy supply structures necessitates real-time updates of CFA. Traditional life cycle assessment methods rely heavily on human expertise, making near-real-time updates challenging. This paper introduces a novel approach integrating large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation technology to enhance the real-time, professional, and economical aspects of carbon footprint information retrieval and analysis. By leveraging LLMs' logical and language understanding abilities and RAG's efficient retrieval capabilities, the proposed method LLMs-RAG-CFA can retrieve more relevant professional information to assist LLMs, enhancing the model's generative abilities. This method offers broad professional coverage, efficient real-time carbon footprint information acquisition and accounting, and cost-effective automation without frequent LLMs' parameter updates. Experimental results across five industries(primary aluminum, lithium battery, photovoltaic, new energy vehicles, and transformers)demonstrate that the LLMs-RAG-CFA method outperforms traditional methods and other LLMs, achieving higher information retrieval rates and significantly lower information deviations and carbon footprint accounting deviations. The economically viable design utilizes RAG technology to balance real-time updates with cost-effectiveness, providing an efficient, reliable, and cost-saving solution for real-time carbon emission management, thereby enhancing environmental sustainability practices.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Reciprocal Recommender Systems: Metrics, Formulation, and Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reciprocal recommender systems~(RRS), conducting bilateral recommendations between two involved parties, have gained increasing attention for enhancing matching efficiency. However, the majority of existing methods in the literature still reuse conventional ranking metrics to separately assess the performance on each side of the recommendation process. These methods overlook the fact that the ranking outcomes of both sides collectively influence the effectiveness of the RRS, neglecting the necessity of a more holistic evaluation and a capable systemic solution.
  In this paper, we systemically revisit the task of reciprocal recommendation, by introducing the new metrics, formulation, and method. Firstly, we propose five new evaluation metrics that comprehensively and accurately assess the performance of RRS from three distinct perspectives: overall coverage, bilateral stability, and balanced ranking. These metrics provide a more holistic understanding of the system's effectiveness and enable a comprehensive evaluation. Furthermore, we formulate the RRS from a causal perspective, formulating recommendations as bilateral interventions, which can better model the decoupled effects of potential influencing factors. By utilizing the potential outcome framework, we further develop a model-agnostic causal reciprocal recommendation method that considers the causal effects of recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a reranking strategy to maximize matching outcomes, as measured by the proposed metrics. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets from recruitment and dating scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed metrics and approach. The code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/RUCAIBox/CRRS.</description>

      <title>Contextual Dual Learning Algorithm with Listwise Distillation for Unbiased Learning to Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unbiased Learning to Rank (ULTR) aims to leverage biased implicit user feedback (e.g., click) to optimize an unbiased ranking model. The effectiveness of the existing ULTR methods has primarily been validated on synthetic datasets. However, their performance on real-world click data remains unclear. Recently, Baidu released a large publicly available dataset of their web search logs. Subsequently, the NTCIR-17 ULTRE-2 task released a subset dataset extracted from it. We conduct experiments on commonly used or effective ULTR methods on this subset to determine whether they maintain their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a Contextual Dual Learning Algorithm with Listwise Distillation (CDLA-LD) to simultaneously address both position bias and contextual bias. We utilize a listwise-input ranking model to obtain reconstructed feature vectors incorporating local contextual information and employ the Dual Learning Algorithm (DLA) method to jointly train this ranking model and a propensity model to address position bias. As this ranking model learns the interaction information within the documents list of the training set, to enhance the ranking model's generalization ability, we additionally train a pointwise-input ranking model to learn the listwise-input ranking model's capability for relevance judgment in a listwise manner. Extensive experiments and analysis confirm the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Ranking Generated Answers: On the Agreement of Retrieval Models with Humans on Consumer Health Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating the output of generative large language models (LLMs) is challenging and difficult to scale. Most evaluations of LLMs focus on tasks such as single-choice question-answering or text classification. These tasks are not suitable for assessing open-ended question-answering capabilities, which are critical in domains where expertise is required, such as health, and where misleading or incorrect answers can have a significant impact on a user's health. Using human experts to evaluate the quality of LLM answers is generally considered the gold standard, but expert annotation is costly and slow. We present a method for evaluating LLM answers that uses ranking signals as a substitute for explicit relevance judgements. Our scoring method correlates with the preferences of human experts. We validate it by investigating the well-known fact that the quality of generated answers improves with the size of the model as well as with more sophisticated prompting strategies.</description>

Abstract: The increasing demand for online fashion retail has boosted research in fashion compatibility modeling and item retrieval, focusing on matching user queries (textual descriptions or reference images) with compatible fashion items. A key challenge is top-bottom retrieval, where precise compatibility modeling is essential. Traditional methods, often based on Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), have shown limited performance. Recent efforts have explored using generative models in compatibility modeling and item retrieval, where generated images serve as additional inputs. However, these approaches often overlook the quality of generated images, which could be crucial for model performance. Additionally, generative models typically require large datasets, posing challenges when such data is scarce.
  To address these issues, we introduce the Generative Compatibility Model (GeCo), a two-stage approach that improves fashion image retrieval through paired image-to-image translation. First, the Complementary Item Generation Model (CIGM), built on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), generates target item images (e.g., bottoms) from seed items (e.g., tops), offering conditioning signals for retrieval. These generated samples are then integrated into GeCo, enhancing compatibility modeling and retrieval accuracy. Evaluations on three datasets show that GeCo outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Key contributions include: (i) the GeCo model utilizing paired image-to-image translation within the Composed Image Retrieval framework, (ii) comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, and (iii) the release of a new Fashion Taobao dataset designed for top-bottom retrieval, promoting further research.</description>

      <title>Efficient Inference of Sub-Item Id-based Sequential Recommendation Models with Millions of Items</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based recommender systems, such as BERT4Rec or SASRec, achieve state-of-the-art results in sequential recommendation. However, it is challenging to use these models in production environments with catalogues of millions of items: scaling Transformers beyond a few thousand items is problematic for several reasons, including high model memory consumption and slow inference. In this respect, RecJPQ is a state-of-the-art method of reducing the models' memory consumption; RecJPQ compresses item catalogues by decomposing item IDs into a small number of shared sub-item IDs. Despite reporting the reduction of memory consumption by a factor of up to 50x, the original RecJPQ paper did not report inference efficiency improvements over the baseline Transformer-based models. Upon analysing RecJPQ's scoring algorithm, we find that its efficiency is limited by its use of score accumulators for each item, which prevents parallelisation. In contrast, LightRec (a non-sequential method that uses a similar idea of sub-ids) reported large inference efficiency improvements using an algorithm we call PQTopK. We show that it is also possible to improve RecJPQ-based models' inference efficiency using the PQTopK algorithm. In particular, we speed up RecJPQ-enhanced SASRec by a factor of 4.5 x compared to the original SASRec's inference method and by a factor of 1.56 x compared to the method implemented in RecJPQ code on a large-scale Gowalla dataset with more than a million items. Further, using simulated data, we show that PQTopK remains efficient with catalogues of up to tens of millions of items, removing one of the last obstacles to using Transformer-based models in production environments with large catalogues.</description>

      <title>Customizing Language Models with Instance-wise LoRA for Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems predict a user's next item of interest by analyzing past interactions, aligning recommendations with individual preferences. Leveraging the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge comprehension and reasoning, recent approaches have applied LLMs to sequential recommendation through language generation paradigms. These methods convert user behavior sequences into prompts for LLM fine-tuning, utilizing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules to refine recommendations. However, the uniform application of LoRA across diverse user behaviors sometimes fails to capture individual variability, leading to suboptimal performance and negative transfer between disparate sequences. To address these challenges, we propose Instance-wise LoRA (iLoRA), integrating LoRA with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. iLoRA creates a diverse array of experts, each capturing specific aspects of user preferences, and introduces a sequence representation guided gate function. This gate function processes historical interaction sequences to generate enriched representations, guiding the gating network to output customized expert participation weights. This tailored approach mitigates negative transfer and dynamically adjusts to diverse behavior patterns. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of iLoRA, highlighting its superior performance compared to existing methods in capturing user-specific preferences and improving recommendation accuracy.</description>

      <title>PATopics: An automatic framework to extract useful information from pharmaceutical patents documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pharmaceutical patents play an important role by protecting the innovation from copies but also drive researchers to innovate, create new products, and promote disruptive innovations focusing on collective health. The study of patent management usually refers to an exhaustive manual search. This happens, because patent documents are complex with a lot of details regarding the claims and methodology/results explanation of the invention. To mitigate the manual search, we proposed PATopics, a framework specially designed to extract relevant information for Pharmaceutical patents. PATopics is composed of four building blocks that extract textual information from the patents, build relevant topics that are capable of summarizing the patents, correlate these topics with useful patent characteristics and then, summarize the information in a friendly web interface to final users. The general contributions of PATopics are its ability to centralize patents and to manage patents into groups based on their similarities. We extensively analyzed the framework using 4,832 pharmaceutical patents concerning 809 molecules patented by 478 companies. In our analysis, we evaluate the use of the framework considering the demands of three user profiles -- researchers, chemists, and companies. We also designed four real-world use cases to evaluate the framework's applicability. Our analysis showed how practical and helpful PATopics are in the pharmaceutical scenario.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has achieved remarkable success in addressing the challenges of Large Language Models (LLMs) without necessitating retraining. By referencing an external knowledge base, RAG refines LLM outputs, effectively mitigating issues such as ``hallucination'', lack of domain-specific knowledge, and outdated information. However, the complex structure of relationships among different entities in databases presents challenges for RAG systems. In response, GraphRAG leverages structural information across entities to enable more precise and comprehensive retrieval, capturing relational knowledge and facilitating more accurate, context-aware responses. Given the novelty and potential of GraphRAG, a systematic review of current technologies is imperative. This paper provides the first comprehensive overview of GraphRAG methodologies. We formalize the GraphRAG workflow, encompassing Graph-Based Indexing, Graph-Guided Retrieval, and Graph-Enhanced Generation. We then outline the core technologies and training methods at each stage. Additionally, we examine downstream tasks, application domains, evaluation methodologies, and industrial use cases of GraphRAG. Finally, we explore future research directions to inspire further inquiries and advance progress in the field.</description>

      <title>ASGM-KG: Unveiling Alluvial Gold Mining Through Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining (ASGM) is a low-cost yet highly destructive mining practice, leading to environmental disasters across the world's tropical watersheds. The topic of ASGM spans multiple domains of research and information, including natural and social systems, and knowledge is often atomized across a diversity of media and documents. We therefore introduce a knowledge graph (ASGM-KG) that consolidates and provides crucial information about ASGM practices and their environmental effects. The current version of ASGM-KG consists of 1,899 triples extracted using a large language model (LLM) from documents and reports published by both non-governmental and governmental organizations. These documents were carefully selected by a group of tropical ecologists with expertise in ASGM. This knowledge graph was validated using two methods. First, a small team of ASGM experts reviewed and labeled triples as factual or non-factual. Second, we devised and applied an automated factual reduction framework that relies on a search engine and an LLM for labeling triples. Our framework performs as well as five baselines on a publicly available knowledge graph and achieves over 90 accuracy on our ASGM-KG validated by domain experts. ASGM-KG demonstrates an advancement in knowledge aggregation and representation for complex, interdisciplinary environmental crises such as ASGM.</description>

      <title>CodeTaxo: Enhancing Taxonomy Expansion with Limited Examples via Code Language Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taxonomies play a crucial role in various applications by providing a structural representation of knowledge. The task of taxonomy expansion involves integrating emerging concepts into existing taxonomies by identifying appropriate parent concepts for these new query concepts. Previous approaches typically relied on self-supervised methods that generate annotation data from existing taxonomies. However, these methods are less effective when the existing taxonomy is small (fewer than 100 entities). In this work, we introduce \textsc{CodeTaxo}, a novel approach that leverages large language models through code language prompts to capture the taxonomic structure. Extensive experiments on five real-world benchmarks from different domains demonstrate that \textsc{CodeTaxo} consistently achieves superior performance across all evaluation metrics, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. The code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/QingkaiZeng/CodeTaxo-Pub}.</description>

      <title>ELASTIC: Efficient Linear Attention for Sequential Interest Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art sequential recommendation models heavily rely on transformer's attention mechanism. However, the quadratic computational and memory complexities of self attention have limited its scalability for modeling users' long range behaviour sequences. To address this problem, we propose ELASTIC, an Efficient Linear Attention for SequenTial Interest Compression, requiring only linear time complexity and decoupling model capacity from computational cost. Specifically, ELASTIC introduces a fixed length interest experts with linear dispatcher attention mechanism which compresses the long-term behaviour sequences to a significantly more compact representation which reduces up to 90% GPU memory usage with x2.7 inference speed up. The proposed linear dispatcher attention mechanism significantly reduces the quadratic complexity and makes the model feasible for adequately modeling extremely long sequences. Moreover, in order to retain the capacity for modeling various user interests, ELASTIC initializes a vast learnable interest memory bank and sparsely retrieves compressed user's interests from the memory with a negligible computational overhead. The proposed interest memory retrieval technique significantly expands the cardinality of available interest space while keeping the same computational cost, thereby striking a trade-off between recommendation accuracy and efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed ELASTIC, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets and compare it with several strong sequential recommenders. Experimental results demonstrate that ELASTIC consistently outperforms baselines by a significant margin and also highlight the computational efficiency of ELASTIC when modeling long sequences. We will make our implementation code publicly available.</description>

      <title>WPN: An Unlearning Method Based on N-pair Contrastive Learning in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative language models (LMs) offer numerous advantages but may produce inappropriate or harmful outputs due to the harmful knowledge acquired during pre-training. This knowledge often manifests as undesirable correspondences, such as "harmful prompts" leading to "harmful outputs," which our research aims to mitigate through unlearning techniques.However, existing unlearning methods based on gradient ascent can significantly impair the performance of LMs. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Weighted Positional N-pair (WPN) Learning, which leverages position-weighted mean pooling within an n-pair contrastive learning framework. WPN is designed to modify the output distribution of LMs by eliminating specific harmful outputs (e.g., replacing toxic responses with neutral ones), thereby transforming the model's behavior from "harmful prompt-harmful output" to "harmful prompt-harmless response".Experiments on OPT and GPT-NEO LMs show that WPN effectively reduces the proportion of harmful responses, achieving a harmless rate of up to 95.8\% while maintaining stable performance on nine common benchmarks (with less than 2\% degradation on average). Moreover, we provide empirical evidence to demonstrate WPN's ability to weaken the harmful correspondences in terms of generalizability and robustness, as evaluated on out-of-distribution test sets and under adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>On the Necessity of World Knowledge for Mitigating Missing Labels in Extreme Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme Classification (XC) aims to map a query to the most relevant documents from a very large document set. XC algorithms used in real-world applications learn this mapping from datasets curated from implicit feedback, such as user clicks. However, these datasets inevitably suffer from missing labels. In this work, we observe that systematic missing labels lead to missing knowledge, which is critical for accurately modelling relevance between queries and documents. We formally show that this absence of knowledge cannot be recovered using existing methods such as propensity weighting and data imputation strategies that solely rely on the training dataset. While LLMs provide an attractive solution to augment the missing knowledge, leveraging them in applications with low latency requirements and large document sets is challenging. To incorporate missing knowledge at scale, we propose SKIM (Scalable Knowledge Infusion for Missing Labels), an algorithm that leverages a combination of small LM and abundant unstructured meta-data to effectively mitigate the missing label problem. We show the efficacy of our method on large-scale public datasets through exhaustive unbiased evaluation ranging from human annotations to simulations inspired from industrial settings. SKIM outperforms existing methods on Recall@100 by more than 10 absolute points. Additionally, SKIM scales to proprietary query-ad retrieval datasets containing 10 million documents, outperforming contemporary methods by 12% in offline evaluation and increased ad click-yield by 1.23% in an online A/B test conducted on a popular search engine. We release our code, prompts, trained XC models and finetuned SLMs at: https://github.com/bicycleman15/skim</description>

      <title>MAPLE: Enhancing Review Generation with Multi-Aspect Prompt LEarning in Explainable Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable Recommendation task is designed to receive a pair of user and item and output explanations to justify why an item is recommended to a user. Many models treat review-generation as a proxy of explainable recommendation. Although they are able to generate fluent and grammatical sentences, they suffer from generality and hallucination issues. We propose a personalized, aspect-controlled model called Multi-Aspect Prompt LEarner (MAPLE), in which it integrates aspect category as another input dimension to facilitate the memorization of fine-grained aspect terms. Experiments on two real-world review datasets in restaurant domain show that MAPLE outperforms the baseline review-generation models in terms of text and feature diversity while maintaining excellent coherence and factual relevance. We further treat MAPLE as a retriever component in the retriever-reader framework and employ a Large-Language Model (LLM) as the reader, showing that MAPLE's explanation along with the LLM's comprehension ability leads to enriched and personalized explanation as a result. We will release the code and data in this http upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Molecular Graph Representation Learning Integrating Large Language Models with Domain-specific Small Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a crucial foundation for drug discovery. In recent years, pre-trained deep learning models have been widely applied to this task. Some approaches that incorporate prior biological domain knowledge into the pre-training framework have achieved impressive results. However, these methods heavily rely on biochemical experts, and retrieving and summarizing vast amounts of domain knowledge literature is both time-consuming and expensive. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in understanding and efficiently providing general knowledge. Nevertheless, they occasionally exhibit hallucinations and lack precision in generating domain-specific knowledge. Conversely, Domain-specific Small Models (DSMs) possess rich domain knowledge and can accurately calculate molecular domain-related metrics. However, due to their limited model size and singular functionality, they lack the breadth of knowledge necessary for comprehensive representation learning. To leverage the advantages of both approaches in molecular property prediction, we propose a novel Molecular Graph representation learning framework that integrates Large language models and Domain-specific small models (MolGraph-LarDo). Technically, we design a two-stage prompt strategy where DSMs are introduced to calibrate the knowledge provided by LLMs, enhancing the accuracy of domain-specific information and thus enabling LLMs to generate more precise textual descriptions for molecular samples. Subsequently, we employ a multi-modal alignment method to coordinate various modalities, including molecular graphs and their corresponding descriptive texts, to guide the pre-training of molecular representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Prompt Tuning on Graph-augmented Low-resource Text Classification</title>

Abstract: Text classification is a fundamental problem in information retrieval with many real-world applications, such as predicting the topics of online articles and the categories of e-commerce product descriptions. However, low-resource text classification, with no or few labeled samples, presents a serious concern for supervised learning. Meanwhile, many text data are inherently grounded on a network structure, such as a hyperlink/citation network for online articles, and a user-item purchase network for e-commerce products. These graph structures capture rich semantic relationships, which can potentially augment low-resource text classification. In this paper, we propose a novel model called Graph-Grounded Pre-training and Prompting (G2P2) to address low-resource text classification in a two-pronged approach. During pre-training, we propose three graph interaction-based contrastive strategies to jointly pre-train a graph-text model; during downstream classification, we explore handcrafted discrete prompts and continuous prompt tuning for the jointly pre-trained model to achieve zero- and few-shot classification, respectively. Moreover, we explore the possibility of employing continuous prompt tuning for zero-shot inference. Specifically, we aim to generalize continuous prompts to unseen classes while leveraging a set of base classes. To this end, we extend G2P2 into G2P2$^*$, hinging on a new architecture of conditional prompt tuning. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the strength of G2P2 in zero- and few-shot low-resource text classification tasks, and illustrate the advantage of G2P2$^*$ in dealing with unseen classes.</description>

Abstract: Differentiable Search Index is a recently proposed paradigm for document retrieval, that encodes information about a corpus of documents within the parameters of a neural network and directly maps queries to corresponding documents. These models have achieved state-of-the-art performances for document retrieval across many benchmarks. These kinds of models have a significant limitation: it is not easy to add new documents after a model is trained. We propose IncDSI, a method to add documents in real time (about 20-50ms per document), without retraining the model on the entire dataset (or even parts thereof). Instead we formulate the addition of documents as a constrained optimization problem that makes minimal changes to the network parameters. Although orders of magnitude faster, our approach is competitive with re-training the model on the whole dataset and enables the development of document retrieval systems that can be updated with new information in real-time. Our code for IncDSI is available at https://github.com/varshakishore/IncDSI.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Pooling Bias in E-commerce Search via False Negative Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate product relevance assessment is critical for user experiences and business success. Training a proficient relevance assessment model requires high-quality query-product pairs, often obtained through negative sampling strategies. Unfortunately, current methods introduce pooling bias by mistakenly sampling false negatives, diminishing performance and business impact. To address this, we present Bias-mitigating Hard Negative Sampling (BHNS), a novel negative sampling strategy tailored to identify and adjust for false negatives, building upon our original False Negative Estimation algorithm. Our experiments in the Instacart search setting confirm BHNS as effective for practical e-commerce use. Furthermore, comparative analyses on public dataset showcase its domain-agnostic potential for diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Pattern-wise Transparent Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11480v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A transparent decision-making process is essential for developing reliable and trustworthy recommender systems. For sequential recommendation, it means that the model can identify critical items asthe justifications for its recommendation results. However, achieving both model transparency and recommendation performance simultaneously is challenging, especially for models that take the entire sequence of items as input without screening. In this paper,we propose an interpretable framework (named PTSR) that enables a pattern-wise transparent decision-making process. It breaks the sequence of items into multi-level patterns that serve as atomic units for the entire recommendation process. The contribution of each pattern to the outcome is quantified in the probability space. With a carefully designed pattern weighting correction, the pattern contribution can be learned in the absence of ground-truth critical patterns. The final recommended items are those items that most critical patterns strongly endorse. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate remarkable recommendation performance, while case studies validate the model transparency. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PTSR-2237.</description>

      <title>Learnable Item Tokenization for Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) for generative recommendation has attracted much attention. Nevertheless, a crucial challenge is transforming recommendation data into the language space of LLMs through effective item tokenization. Current approaches, such as ID, textual, and codebook-based identifiers, exhibit shortcomings in encoding semantic information, incorporating collaborative signals, or handling code assignment bias. To address these limitations, we propose LETTER (a LEarnable Tokenizer for generaTivE Recommendation), which integrates hierarchical semantics, collaborative signals, and code assignment diversity to satisfy the essential requirements of identifiers. LETTER incorporates Residual Quantized VAE for semantic regularization, a contrastive alignment loss for collaborative regularization, and a diversity loss to mitigate code assignment bias. We instantiate LETTER on two models and propose a ranking-guided generation loss to augment their ranking ability theoretically. Experiments on three datasets validate the superiority of LETTER, advancing the state-of-the-art in the field of LLM-based generative recommendation.</description>

      <title>EmbSum: Leveraging the Summarization Capabilities of Large Language Models for Content-Based Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Content-based recommendation systems play a crucial role in delivering personalized content to users in the digital world. In this work, we introduce EmbSum, a novel framework that enables offline pre-computations of users and candidate items while capturing the interactions within the user engagement history. By utilizing the pretrained encoder-decoder model and poly-attention layers, EmbSum derives User Poly-Embedding (UPE) and Content Poly-Embedding (CPE) to calculate relevance scores between users and candidate items. EmbSum actively learns the long user engagement histories by generating user-interest summary with supervision from large language model (LLM). The effectiveness of EmbSum is validated on two datasets from different domains, surpassing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods with higher accuracy and fewer parameters. Additionally, the model's ability to generate summaries of user interests serves as a valuable by-product, enhancing its usefulness for personalized content recommendations.</description>

      <title>TokenRec: Learning to Tokenize ID for LLM-based Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in utilizing large-scale language models (LLMs) to advance next-generation Recommender Systems (RecSys), driven by their outstanding language understanding and in-context learning capabilities. In this scenario, tokenizing (i.e., indexing) users and items becomes essential for ensuring a seamless alignment of LLMs with recommendations. While several studies have made progress in representing users and items through textual contents or latent representations, challenges remain in efficiently capturing high-order collaborative knowledge into discrete tokens that are compatible with LLMs. Additionally, the majority of existing tokenization approaches often face difficulties in generalizing effectively to new/unseen users or items that were not in the training corpus. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called TokenRec, which introduces not only an effective ID tokenization strategy but also an efficient retrieval paradigm for LLM-based recommendations. Specifically, our tokenization strategy, Masked Vector-Quantized (MQ) Tokenizer, involves quantizing the masked user/item representations learned from collaborative filtering into discrete tokens, thus achieving a smooth incorporation of high-order collaborative knowledge and a generalizable tokenization of users and items for LLM-based RecSys. Meanwhile, our generative retrieval paradigm is designed to efficiently recommend top-$K$ items for users to eliminate the need for the time-consuming auto-regressive decoding and beam search processes used by LLMs, thus significantly reducing inference time. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating that TokenRec outperforms competitive benchmarks, including both traditional recommender systems and emerging LLM-based recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Evidence-Based Temporal Fact Verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated fact verification plays an essential role in fostering trust in the digital space. Despite the growing interest, the verification of temporal facts has not received much attention in the community. Temporal fact verification brings new challenges where cues of the temporal information need to be extracted and temporal reasoning involving various temporal aspects of the text must be applied. In this work, we propose an end-to-end solution for temporal fact verification that considers the temporal information in claims to obtain relevant evidence sentences and harness the power of large language model for temporal reasoning. Recognizing that temporal facts often involve events, we model these events in the claim and evidence sentences. We curate two temporal fact datasets to learn time-sensitive representations that encapsulate not only the semantic relationships among the events, but also their chronological proximity. This allows us to retrieve the top-k relevant evidence sentences and provide the context for a large language model to perform temporal reasoning and outputs whether a claim is supported or refuted by the retrieved evidence sentences. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances the accuracy of temporal claim verification, thereby advancing current state-of-the-art in automated fact verification.</description>

      <title>Scene-wise Adaptive Network for Dynamic Cold-start Scenes Optimization in CTR Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07278v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of modern mobile E-commerce, providing users with nearby commercial service recommendations through location-based online services has become increasingly vital. While machine learning approaches have shown promise in multi-scene recommendation, existing methodologies often struggle to address cold-start problems in unprecedented scenes: the increasing diversity of commercial choices, along with the short online lifespan of scenes, give rise to the complexity of effective recommendations in online and dynamic scenes. In this work, we propose Scene-wise Adaptive Network (SwAN), a novel approach that emphasizes high-performance cold-start online recommendations for new scenes. Our approach introduces several crucial capabilities, including scene similarity learning, user-specific scene transition cognition, scene-specific information construction for the new scene, and enhancing the diverged logical information between scenes. We demonstrate SwAN's potential to optimize dynamic multi-scene recommendation problems by effectively online handling cold-start recommendations for any newly arrived scenes. More encouragingly, SwAN has been successfully deployed in Meituan's online catering recommendation service, which serves millions of customers per day, and SwAN has achieved a 5.64% CTR index improvement relative to the baselines and a 5.19% increase in daily order volume proportion.</description>

      <title>SC-Rec: Enhancing Generative Retrieval with Self-Consistent Reranking for Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly employed in recommendation systems due to their advanced language understanding and generation capabilities. Recent recommender systems based on generative retrieval have leveraged the inferential abilities of LMs to directly generate the index tokens of the next item, based on item sequences within the user's interaction history. Previous studies have mostly focused on item indices based solely on textual semantic or collaborative information. However, although the standalone effectiveness of these aspects has been demonstrated, the integration of this information has remained unexplored. Our in-depth analysis finds that there is a significant difference in the knowledge captured by the model from heterogeneous item indices and diverse input prompts, which can have a high potential for complementarity. In this paper, we propose SC-Rec, a unified recommender system that learns diverse preference knowledge from two distinct item indices and multiple prompt templates. Furthermore, SC-Rec adopts a novel reranking strategy that aggregates a set of ranking results, inferred based on different indices and prompts, to achieve the self-consistency of the model. Our empirical evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates that SC-Rec considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for sequential recommendation, effectively incorporating complementary knowledge from varied outputs of the model.</description>

      <title>LLMs for Knowledge Graph Construction and Reasoning: Recent Capabilities and Future Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an exhaustive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Knowledge Graph (KG) construction and reasoning. We engage in experiments across eight diverse datasets, focusing on four representative tasks encompassing entity and relation extraction, event extraction, link prediction, and question-answering, thereby thoroughly exploring LLMs' performance in the domain of construction and inference. Empirically, our findings suggest that LLMs, represented by GPT-4, are more suited as inference assistants rather than few-shot information extractors. Specifically, while GPT-4 exhibits good performance in tasks related to KG construction, it excels further in reasoning tasks, surpassing fine-tuned models in certain cases. Moreover, our investigation extends to the potential generalization ability of LLMs for information extraction, leading to the proposition of a Virtual Knowledge Extraction task and the development of the corresponding VINE dataset. Based on these empirical findings, we further propose AutoKG, a multi-agent-based approach employing LLMs and external sources for KG construction and reasoning. We anticipate that this research can provide invaluable insights for future undertakings in the field of knowledge graphs. The code and datasets are in https://github.com/zjunlp/AutoKG.</description>

      <title>Towards A Unified View of Answer Calibration for Multi-Step Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) employing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have broadened the scope for improving multi-step reasoning capabilities. We generally divide multi-step reasoning into two phases: path generation to generate the reasoning path(s); and answer calibration post-processing the reasoning path(s) to obtain a final answer. However, the existing literature lacks systematic analysis on different answer calibration approaches. In this paper, we summarize the taxonomy of recent answer calibration techniques and break them down into step-level and path-level strategies. We then conduct a thorough evaluation on these strategies from a unified view, systematically scrutinizing step-level and path-level answer calibration across multiple paths. Experimental results reveal that integrating the dominance of both strategies tends to derive optimal outcomes. Our study holds the potential to illuminate key insights for optimizing multi-step reasoning with answer calibration.</description>

      <title>Linguistic and Structural Basis of Engineering Design Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural language artefact descriptions are primary carriers of engineering design knowledge, whose retrieval, representation, and reuse are fundamental to supporting knowledge-intensive tasks in the design process. In this paper, we explicate design knowledge from patented artefact descriptions as knowledge graphs and examine these to understand the linguistic and structural basis. The purpose of our work is to advance the traditional and ontological perspectives of design knowledge and to guide Large-Language Models (LLMs) on how to articulate natural language responses that reflect knowledge that is valuable in a design environment. We populate 33,881 knowledge graphs from a sample of patents stratified according to technology classes. For linguistic basis, we conduct Zipf distribution analyses on the frequencies of unique entities and relationships to identify 64 and 37 generalisable linguistic syntaxes respectively. The relationships largely represent attributes ('of'), structure ('in', 'with'), purpose ('to', 'for'), hierarchy ('include'), exemplification ('such as'), and behaviour ('to', 'from'). For structural basis, we draw inspiration from various studies on biological/ecological networks and discover motifs from patent knowledge graphs. We identify four 3-node and four 4-node subgraph patterns that could be converged and simplified into sequence [-&gt;...-&gt;], aggregation [-&gt;...&lt;-], and hierarchy [&lt;-...-&gt;]. Based on these results, we suggest concretisation strategies for entities and relationships and explicating hierarchical structures, potentially aiding the construction and modularisation of design knowledge.</description>

      <title>iRAG: Advancing RAG for Videos with an Incremental Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems combine the strengths of language generation and information retrieval to power many real-world applications like chatbots. Use of RAG for understanding of videos is appealing but there are two critical limitations. One-time, upfront conversion of all content in large corpus of videos into text descriptions entails high processing times. Also, not all information in the rich video data is typically captured in the text descriptions. Since user queries are not known apriori, developing a system for video to text conversion and interactive querying of video data is challenging.
  To address these limitations, we propose an incremental RAG system called iRAG, which augments RAG with a novel incremental workflow to enable interactive querying of a large corpus of videos. Unlike traditional RAG, iRAG quickly indexes large repositories of videos, and in the incremental workflow, it uses the index to opportunistically extract more details from select portions of the videos to retrieve context relevant to an interactive user query. Such an incremental workflow avoids long video to text conversion times, and overcomes information loss issues due to conversion of video to text, by doing on-demand query-specific extraction of details in video data. This ensures high quality of responses to interactive user queries that are often not known apriori. To the best of our knowledge, iRAG is the first system to augment RAG with an incremental workflow to support efficient interactive querying of a large corpus of videos. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate 23x to 25x faster video to text ingestion, while ensuring that latency and quality of responses to interactive user queries is comparable to responses from a traditional RAG where all video data is converted to text upfront before any user querying.</description>

      <title>BLAZE: Cross-Language and Cross-Project Bug Localization via Dynamic Chunking and Hard Example Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software bugs require developers to exert significant effort to identify and resolve them, often consuming about one-third of their time. Bug localization, the process of pinpointing the exact source code files that need modification, is crucial in reducing this effort. Existing bug localization tools, typically reliant on deep learning techniques, face limitations in cross-project applicability and effectiveness in multi-language environments. Recent advancements with Large Language Models (LLMs) offer detailed representations for bug localization. However, they encounter challenges with limited context windows and mapping accuracy. To address these issues, we propose BLAZE, an approach that employs dynamic chunking and hard example learning. First, BLAZE dynamically segments source code to minimize continuity loss. Then, BLAZE fine-tunes a GPT-based model using challenging bug cases, in order to enhance cross-project and cross-language bug localization. To support the capability of BLAZE, we create the BEETLEBOX dataset, which comprises 26,321 bugs from 29 large and thriving open-source projects across five different programming languages (Java, C++, Python, Go, and JavaScript). Our evaluations of BLAZE on three benchmark datasets BEETLEBOX, SWE-Bench, and Ye et al. demonstrate substantial improvements compared to six state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, BLAZE achieves up to an increase of 120% in Top 1 accuracy, 144% in Mean Average Precision (MAP), and 100% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). An extensive ablation study confirms the contributions of our pipeline components to the overall performance enhancement.</description>

      <title>RAGEval: Scenario Specific RAG Evaluation Dataset Generation Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have demonstrated their advantages in alleviating the hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing RAG benchmarks mainly focus on evaluating whether LLMs can correctly answer the general knowledge. However, they are unable to evaluate the effectiveness of the RAG system in dealing with the data from different vertical domains. This paper introduces RAGEval, a framework for automatically generating evaluation datasets to evaluate the knowledge usage ability of different LLMs in different scenarios. Specifically, RAGEval summarizes a schema from seed documents, applies the configurations to generate diverse documents, and constructs question-answering pairs according to both articles and configurations. We propose three novel metrics, Completeness, Hallucination, and Irrelevance, to carefully evaluate the responses generated by LLMs. By benchmarking RAG models in vertical domains, RAGEval has the ability to better evaluate the knowledge usage ability of LLMs, which avoids the confusion regarding the source of knowledge in answering question in existing QA datasets--whether it comes from parameterized memory or retrieval. The code and dataset will be released.</description>
