      <title>Large deviations of the giant in supercritical kernel-based spatial random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cluster sizes in supercritical $d$-dimensional inhomogeneous percolation models with long-range edges -- such as long-range percolation -- and/or heavy-tailed degree distributions -- such as geometric inhomogeneous random graphs and the age-dependent random connection model. Our focus is on large deviations of the size of the largest cluster in the graph restricted to a finite box as its volume tends to infinity. Compared to nearest-neighbor Bernoulli bond percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, we show that long edges can increase the exponent of the polynomial speed of the lower tail from $(d-1)/d$ to any $\zeta_\star\in\big((d-1)/d,1\big)$. We prove that this exponent $\zeta_\star$ also governs the size of the second-largest cluster, and the distribution of the size of the cluster containing the origin $\mathcal{C}(0)$.
  For the upper tail of large deviations, we prove that its speed is logarithmic for models with power-law degree distributions. We express the rate function via the generating function of $|\mathcal{C}(0)|$. The upper tail in degree-homogeneous models decays much faster: the speed in long-range percolation is linear.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence and uniqueness of   solutions of a semilinear PDE driven by a Bessel type generator$L^\delta$  with low dimension $0 &lt; \delta &lt; 1$. $L^\delta$ is a local operator, whose drift is thederivative of $x \mapsto \log (\vert x\vert)$:in particular it is a Schwartz distribution, whichis not the derivative of a continuous function.The solutions  are intended in a duality (''weak'') sensewith respect to state space$L^2(\mathbb{R}_+, d\mu),$ $\mu$ being an invariant measure for the Bessel semigroup.</description>

      <title>$q$-deformed Gaussian unitary ensemble: spectral moments and genus-type expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eigenvalue probability density function of the Gaussian unitary ensemble permits a $q$-extension related to the discrete $q$-Hermite weight and corresponding $q$-orthogonal polynomials. A combinatorial counting method is used to specify a positive sum formula for the spectral moments of this model. The leading two terms of the scaled $1/N^2$ genus-type expansion of the moments are evaluated explicitly in terms of the incomplete beta function. Knowledge of these functional forms allows for the smoothed leading eigenvalue density and its first correction to be determined analytically.</description>

      <title>Conditioning of Banach Space Valued Gaussian Random Variables: An Approximation Approach Based on Martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the conditional distributions of two Banach space valued, jointly Gaussian random variables. These conditional distributions are again Gaussian and their means and covariances are determined by a general approximation scheme based upon a martingale idea. We then apply our general results to the case of Gaussian processes with continuous paths conditioned to partial observations of their paths.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on the Gram-Schmidt walk algorithm and consequences for Komlos conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we improve the best known constant for the discrepancy formulated in the Komlos Conjecture. The result is based on the improvement of the subgaussian bound for the random vector constructed in the Gram-Schmidt Random Walk algorithm. Moreover, we present detailed argument for the smoothed analysis of this random vector. The analysis concerns a modification of a given matrix in the conjecture by a Gaussian type perturbation. Our result improves the recent paper in this direction.</description>

      <title>Injective norm of real and complex random tensors I: From spin glasses to geometric entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The injective norm is a natural generalization to tensors of the operator norm of a matrix. In quantum information, the injective norm is one important measure of genuine multipartite entanglement of quantum states, where it is known as the geometric entanglement. In this paper, we give a high-probability upper bound on the injective norm of real and complex Gaussian random tensors, corresponding to a lower bound on the geometric entanglement of random quantum states, and to a bound on the ground-state energy of a particular multispecies spherical spin glass model. For some cases of our model, previous work used $\epsilon$-net techniques to identify the correct order of magnitude; in the present work, we use the Kac--Rice formula to give a one-sided bound on the constant which we believe to be tight.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Asymptotic Limit Problems of Probabilistic Nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A convenient framework for dealing with asymptotic limit problems of probabilistic nature is provided. These problems include questions such as finding the asymptotic proportion of terms of a sequence falling inside a given interval, or the limit of the arithmetic mean of its partial sums; but several classes of problems are examined in a much more general setting. The proposed framework, which aims to unify those questions and their solution, is based on the idea that to any finite multiset $E_n$, one can associate a finitely distributed atomic probability $\mu_n$; assuming $\mu_n$ tends in distribution to a probability $\mu$, it provides the tools needed to establish the desired asymptotic limit. Few examples are worked out in order to illustrate how using the framework.</description>

Abstract: In R\'enyi's representation for exponential order statistics, we change the iid exponential sequence to any iid sequence, and call the resulting order statistic \emph{generalized R\'enyi statistic}. We prove that randomly reordering the variables in the generalized R\'enyi statistic, in the limit we obtain a sequence of iid exponentials. This result allows us to propose a new model for heavy-tailed data. We investigate the problem of estimation of the tail index in the new model.</description>

      <title>Exponential decay for Constrained-degree percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.05233v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Constrained-degree percolation model in random environment (CDPRE) on the square lattice. In this model, each vertex $v$ has an independent random constraint $\kappa_v$ which takes the value $j\in \{0,1,2,3\}$ with probability $\rho_j$. The dynamics is as follows: at time $t=0$ all edges are closed; each edge $e$ attempts to open at a random time $U_e\sim \mathrm{U}(0,1]$, independently of all other edges. It succeeds if at time $U_e$ both its end-vertices have degrees strictly smaller than their respective constraints. We obtain exponential decay of the radius of the open cluster of the origin at all times when its expected size is finite. Since CDPRE is dominated by Bernoulli percolation, such result is meaningful only if the supremum of all values of $t$ for which the expected size of the open cluster of the origin is finite is larger than 1/2. We prove this last fact by showing a sharp phase transition for an intermediate model.</description>

      <title>A class of count time series models uniting compound Poisson INAR and INGARCH models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: INAR (integer-valued autoregressive) and INGARCH (integer-valued GARCH) models are among the most commonly employed approaches for count time series modelling, but have been studied in largely distinct strands of literature. In this paper, a new class of generalized integer-valued ARMA (GINARMA) models is introduced which unifies a large number of compound Poisson INAR and INGARCH processes. Its stochastic properties, including stationarity and geometric ergodicity, are studied. Particular attention is given to a generalization of the INAR($p$) model which parallels the extension of the INARCH(p) to the INGARCH(p, q) model. For inference, we consider moment-based estimation and a maximum likelihood inference scheme inspired by the forward algorithm. Models from the proposed class have a natural interpretation as stochastic epidemic processes, which throughout the article is used to illustrate our arguments. In a case study, different instances of the class, including both established and newly introduced models, are applied to weekly case numbers of measles and mumps in Bavaria, Germany.</description>

      <title>A Ray-Knight theorem for $\nabla\phi$ interface models and scaling limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.14805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a natural measure on bi-infinite random walk trajectories evolving in a time-dependent environment driven by the Langevin dynamics associated to a gradient Gibbs measure with convex potential. We derive an identity relating the occupation times of the Poissonian cloud induced by this measure to the square of the corresponding gradient field, which - generically - is not Gaussian. In the quadratic case, we recover a well-known generalization of the second Ray-Knight theorem. We further determine the scaling limits of the various objects involved in dimension 3, which are seen to exhibit homogenization. In particular, we prove that the renormalized square of the gradient field converges under appropriate rescaling to the Wick-ordered square of a Gaussian free field on $\mathbb{R}^3$ with suitable diffusion matrix, thus extending a celebrated result of Naddaf and Spencer regarding the scaling limit of the field itself.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional scaling limits and fluctuations of online least-squares SGD with smooth covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive high-dimensional scaling limits and fluctuations for the online least-squares Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm by taking the properties of the data generating model explicitly into consideration. Our approach treats the SGD iterates as an interacting particle system, where the expected interaction is characterized by the covariance structure of the input. Assuming smoothness conditions on moments of order up to eight orders, and without explicitly assuming Gaussianity, we establish the high-dimensional scaling limits and fluctuations in the form of infinite-dimensional Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) or Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). Our results reveal a precise three-step phase transition of the iterates; it goes from being ballistic, to diffusive, and finally to purely random behavior, as the noise variance goes from low, to moderate and finally to very-high noise setting. In the low-noise setting, we further characterize the precise fluctuations of the (scaled) iterates as infinite-dimensional SDEs. We also show the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the derived limiting ODEs and SDEs. Our results have several applications, including characterization of the limiting mean-square estimation or prediction errors and their fluctuations, which can be obtained by analytically or numerically solving the limiting equations.</description>

      <title>Free probability via entropic optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ and $\nu$ be probability measures on $\mathbb{R}$ with compact support, and let $\mu \boxplus \nu$ denote their additive free convolution. We show that for $z \in \mathbb{R}$ greater than the sum of essential suprema of $\mu$ and $\nu$, we have \begin{equation*} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \log(z - x) \mu \boxplus \nu (\mathrm{d}x) = \sup_{\Pi} \left\{ \mathbf{E}_\Pi[\log(z - (X+Y)] - H(\Pi|\mu \otimes \nu) \right\}, \end{equation*} where the supremum is taken over all couplings $\Pi$ of the probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$, and $H(\Pi|\mu \otimes \nu)$ denotes the relative entropy of a coupling $\Pi$ against product measure. We prove similar formulas for the multiplicative free convolution $\mu \boxtimes \nu$ and the free compression $[\mu]_\tau$ of probability measures, as well as for multivariate free operations. Thus the integrals of a log-potential against the fundamental measure operations of free probability may be formulated in terms of entropic optimal transport problems. The optimal couplings in these variational descriptions of the free probability operations can be computed explicitly, and from these we can then deduce the standard $R$- and $S$-transform descriptions of additive and multiplicative free convolution. We use our optimal transport formulations to derive new inequalities relating free and classical operations on probability measures, such as the inequality \begin{equation*} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \log(z - x) \mu \boxplus \nu (\mathrm{d}x) \geq \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \log(z-x) \mu \ast \nu( \mathrm{d}x) \end{equation*} relating free and classical convolution. Our approach is based on applying a large deviation principle on the symmetric group to the quadrature formulas of Marcus, Spielman and Srivastava.</description>

Abstract: In this note we prove equicontinuity for the family of one-point densities with respect to a two-dimensional Coulomb gas at an inverse temperature $\beta\ge 1/2$ confined by an external potential of Hele-Shaw (or quasi-harmonic) type. As a consequence, subsequential limiting Lipschitz continuous densities are defined on the microscopic scale. There are several additional results, for example comparing the one-point density with the thermal equilibrium density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous time financial market models are often motivated as scaling limits of discrete time models. The objective of this paper is to establish such a connection for a robust framework. More specifically, we consider discrete time models that are parameterized by Markovian transition kernels, and a continuous time setting with drift and volatility uncertainty, again parameterized in a Markovian way. Our main result shows convergence of the uncertainty sets in the Hausdorff metric topology and weak convergence of the associated worst-case expectations. Furthermore, we discuss a structure preservation property of the approximation. Namely, we establish the convergence of discrete to continuous time robust superhedging prices for certain complete robust market models. As an application of our main convergence result, we derive a simple algorithm to compute continuous time robust superhedging prices via approximation and dynamic programming.</description>

Abstract: We obtain essentially matching upper and lower bounds for the expected max-sliced 1-Wasserstein distance between a probability measure on a separable Hilbert space and its empirical distribution from $n$ samples. By proving a Banach space version of this result, we also obtain an upper bound, that is sharp up to a log factor, for the expected max-sliced 2-Wasserstein distance between a symmetric probability measure $\mu$ on a Euclidean space and its symmetrized empirical distribution in terms of the operator norm of the covariance matrix of $\mu$ and the diameter of the support of $\mu$.</description>

Abstract: We present an asymptotic expansion formula of an estimator for the drift coefficient of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. As the machinery, we apply the general expansion scheme for Wiener functionals recently developed by the authors [26]. The central limit theorem in the principal part of the expansion has the classical scaling T^{1/2}. However, the asymptotic expansion formula is a complex in that the order of the correction term becomes the classical T^{-1/2} for H in (1/2,5/8), but T^{4H-3} for H in [5/8, 3/4).</description>

Abstract: In this note we investigate geometric properties of invariant spatio-temporal random fields $X:\mathbb M^d\times \mathbb R\to \mathbb R$ defined on a compact two-point homogeneous space $\mathbb M^d$ in any dimension $d\ge 2$, and evolving over time. In particular, we focus on chi-squared distributed random fields, and study the large time behavior (as $T\to +\infty$) of the average on $[0,T]$ of the volume of the excursion set on the manifold, i.e., of $\lbrace X(\cdot, t)\ge u\rbrace$ (for any $u &gt;0$). The Fourier components of $X$ may have short or long memory in time, i.e., integrable or non-integrable temporal covariance functions. Our argument follows the approach developed in (Marinucci, Rossi, Vidotto (2021) Ann. Appl. Probab.) and allow to extend their results for invariant spatio-temporal Gaussian fields on the two-dimensional unit sphere to the case of chi-squared distributed fields on two-point homogeneous spaces in any dimension. We find that both the asymptotic variance and limiting distribution, as $T\to +\infty$, of the average empirical volume turn out to be non-universal, depending on the memory parameters of the field $X$.</description>

      <title>Stability theory of game-theoretic group feature explanations for machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.10878v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study feature attributions of Machine Learning (ML) models originating from linear game values and coalitional values defined as operators on appropriate functional spaces. The main focus is on random games based on the conditional and marginal expectations. The first part of our work formulates a stability theory for these explanation operators by establishing certain bounds for both marginal and conditional explanations. The differences between the two games are then elucidated, such as showing that the marginal explanations can become discontinuous on some naturally-designed domains, while the conditional explanations remain stable. In the second part of our work, group explanation methodologies are devised based on game values with coalition structure, where the features are grouped based on dependencies. We show analytically that grouping features this way has a stabilizing effect on the marginal operator on both group and individual levels, and allows for the unification of marginal and conditional explanations. Our results are verified in a number of numerical experiments where an information-theoretic measure of dependence is used for grouping.</description>

      <title>A unifying view on the irreversible investment exercise boundary in a stochastic, time-inhomogeneous capacity expansion problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aiming at studying the investment exercise boundary, this paper devises a way to apply the Bank and El Karoui Representation Theorem to a quite general stochastic, continuous time capacity expansion problem with irreversible investment on the finite time interval and including a state dependent scrap value associated with the production facility at the terminal time T. The capacity process is a time-inhomogeneous diffusion in which a monotone non-decreasing, possibly singular, control process representing the cumulative investment enters additively. The functional to be maximized admits a supergradient, hence the optimal control satisfies some first order conditions which are solved by means of the Bank and El Karoui Representation Theorem. Its application in the case of non-zero scrap value at time T is not obvious and, as far as we know, it is new in the literature on singular stochastic control. In fact, due to the scrap value, in the supergradient appears also a non integral term. This challenge is overcome by suitably extending the horizon. The optimal investment process is shown to become active at the so-called base capacity level, given in terms of the optional solution of the Representation Theorem. Contrary to what happens in the no scrap value case, here the base capacity depends on the initial capacity y. Hence, a priori, it is not clear if and how it is related to the investment exercise boundary associated to the capacity expansion problem. Under the assumption of deterministic coefficients, discount factor, conversion factor, wage rate and interest rate, the investment boundary is shown to coincide with the base capacity. Therefore, unifying views, the base capacity is deterministic and independent of y, and its integral equation may be used to characterize the investment boundary, without any a priori regularity of it.</description>

      <title>The Quantization Monte Carlo method for solving radiative transport equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Quantization Monte Carlo method to solve thermal radiative transport equations with possibly several collision regimes, ranging from few collisions to massive number of collisions per time unit. For each particle in a given simulation cell, the proposed method advances the time by replacing many collisions with sampling directly from the escape distribution of the particle. In order to perform the sampling, for each triplet of parameters (opacity, remaining time, initial position in the cell) on a parameter grid, the escape distribution is precomputed offline and only the quantiles are retained. The online computation samples only from this quantized (i.e., discrete) version by choosing a parameter triplet on the grid (close to actual particle's parameters) and returning at random one quantile from the precomputed set of quantiles for that parameter. We first check numerically that the escape laws depend smoothly on the parameters and then implement the procedure on a benchmark with good results.</description>

      <title>A Sampling Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma for Large Domain Sizes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present polynomial-time algorithms for approximate counting and sampling solutions to constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) with atomic constraints within the local lemma regime: $$ pD^{2+o_q(1)}\lesssim 1. $$ When the domain size $q$ of each variable becomes sufficiently large, this almost matches the known lower bound $pD^2\gtrsim 1$ for approximate counting and sampling solutions to atomic CSPs [Bez\'akov\'a et al, SICOMP '19; Galanis, Guo, Wang, TOCT '22], thus establishing an almost tight sampling Lov\'{a}sz local lemma for large domain sizes.</description>

      <title>Spectral Moments of the real Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The moments of the real eigenvalues of real Ginibre matrices are investigated from the viewpoint of explicit formulas, differential and difference equations, and large $N$ expansions. These topics are inter-related. For example, a third order differential equation can be derived for the density of the real eigenvalues, and this can be used to deduce a second order difference equation for the general complex moments $M_{2p}^{\rm r}$. The latter are expressed in terms of the ${}_3 F_2$ hypergeometric functions, with a simplification to the ${}_2 F_1$ hypergeometric function possible for $p=0$ and $p=1$, allowing for the large $N$ expansion of these moments to be obtained. The large $N$ expansion involves both integer and half integer powers of $1/N$. The three term recurrence then provides the large $N$ expansion of the full sequence $\{ M_{2p}^{\rm r} \}_{p=0}^\infty$. Fourth and third order linear differential equations are obtained for the moment generating function and for the Stieltjes transform of the real density, respectively, and properties of the large $N$ expansion of these quantities are determined.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Approximation of Slow and Fast Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work on approximation of diffusion equations by deterministic interacting particle systems, we develop a nonlocal approximation for a range of linear and nonlinear diffusion equations and prove convergence of the method in the slow, linear, and fast diffusion regimes. A key ingredient of our approach is a novel technique for using the 2-Wasserstein and dual Sobolev gradient flow structures of the diffusion equations to recover the duality relation characterizing the pressure in the nonlocal-to-local limit. Due to the general class of internal energy densities that our method is able to handle, a byproduct of our result is a novel particle method for sampling a wide range of probability measures, which extends classical approaches based on the Fokker-Planck equation beyond the log-concave setting.</description>
