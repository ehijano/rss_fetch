      <title>Inference of Causal Networks using a Topological Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a constraint-based algorithm, which automatically determines causal relevance thresholds, to infer causal networks from data. We call these topological thresholds. We present two methods for determining the threshold: the first seeks a set of edges that leaves no disconnected nodes in the network; the second seeks a causal large connected component in the data.
  We tested these methods both for discrete synthetic and real data, and compared the results with those obtained for the PC algorithm, which we took as the benchmark. We show that this novel algorithm is generally faster and more accurate than the PC algorithm.
  The algorithm for determining the thresholds requires choosing a measure of causality. We tested our methods for Fisher Correlations, commonly used in PC algorithm (for instance in \cite{kalisch2005}), and further proposed a discrete and asymmetric measure of causality, that we called Net Influence, which provided very good results when inferring causal networks from discrete data. This metric allows for inferring directionality of the edges in the process of applying the thresholds, speeding up the inference of causal DAGs.</description>

      <title>Gradient Guidance for Diffusion Models: An Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated empirical successes in various applications and can be adapted to task-specific needs via guidance. This paper introduces a form of gradient guidance for adapting or fine-tuning diffusion models towards user-specified optimization objectives. We study the theoretic aspects of a guided score-based sampling process, linking the gradient-guided diffusion model to first-order optimization. We show that adding gradient guidance to the sampling process of a pre-trained diffusion model is essentially equivalent to solving a regularized optimization problem, where the regularization term acts as a prior determined by the pre-training data. Diffusion models are able to learn data's latent subspace, however, explicitly adding the gradient of an external objective function to the sample process would jeopardize the structure in generated samples. To remedy this issue, we consider a modified form of gradient guidance based on a forward prediction loss, which leverages the pre-trained score function to preserve the latent structure in generated samples. We further consider an iteratively fine-tuned version of gradient-guided diffusion where one can query gradients at newly generated data points and update the score network using new samples. This process mimics a first-order optimization iteration in expectation, for which we proved O(1/K) convergence rate to the global optimum when the objective function is concave.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Distribution of Parameters in Differential Equations with Repeated Cross-Sectional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential equations are pivotal in modeling and understanding the dynamics of various systems, offering insights into their future states through parameter estimation fitted to time series data. In fields such as economy, politics, and biology, the observation data points in the time series are often independently obtained (i.e., Repeated Cross-Sectional (RCS) data). With RCS data, we found that traditional methods for parameter estimation in differential equations, such as using mean values of time trajectories or Gaussian Process-based trajectory generation, have limitations in estimating the shape of parameter distributions, often leading to a significant loss of data information. To address this issue, we introduce a novel method, Estimation of Parameter Distribution (EPD), providing accurate distribution of parameters without loss of data information. EPD operates in three main steps: generating synthetic time trajectories by randomly selecting observed values at each time point, estimating parameters of a differential equation that minimize the discrepancy between these trajectories and the true solution of the equation, and selecting the parameters depending on the scale of discrepancy. We then evaluated the performance of EPD across several models, including exponential growth, logistic population models, and target cell-limited models with delayed virus production, demonstrating its superiority in capturing the shape of parameter distributions. Furthermore, we applied EPD to real-world datasets, capturing various shapes of parameter distributions rather than a normal distribution. These results effectively address the heterogeneity within systems, marking a substantial progression in accurately modeling systems using RCS data.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Prediction and Feature Selection for Survival Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survival analysis is widely used as a technique to model time-to-event data when some data is censored, particularly in healthcare for predicting future patient risk. In such settings, survival models must be both accurate and interpretable so that users (such as doctors) can trust the model and understand model predictions. While most literature focuses on discrimination, interpretability is equally as important. A successful interpretable model should be able to describe how changing each feature impacts the outcome, and should only use a small number of features. In this paper, we present DyS (pronounced ``dice''), a new survival analysis model that achieves both strong discrimination and interpretability. DyS is a feature-sparse Generalized Additive Model, combining feature selection and interpretable prediction into one model. While DyS works well for all survival analysis problems, it is particularly useful for large (in $n$ and $p$) survival datasets such as those commonly found in observational healthcare studies. Empirical studies show that DyS competes with other state-of-the-art machine learning models for survival analysis, while being highly interpretable.</description>

      <title>Second-order Information Promotes Mini-Batch Robustness in Variance-Reduced Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, for finite-sum minimization problems, incorporating partial second-order information of the objective function can dramatically improve the robustness to mini-batch size of variance-reduced stochastic gradient methods, making them more scalable while retaining their benefits over traditional Newton-type approaches. We demonstrate this phenomenon on a prototypical stochastic second-order algorithm, called Mini-Batch Stochastic Variance-Reduced Newton ($\texttt{Mb-SVRN}$), which combines variance-reduced gradient estimates with access to an approximate Hessian oracle. In particular, we show that when the data size $n$ is sufficiently large, i.e., $n\gg \alpha^2\kappa$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number and $\alpha$ is the Hessian approximation factor, then $\texttt{Mb-SVRN}$ achieves a fast linear convergence rate that is independent of the gradient mini-batch size $b$, as long $b$ is in the range between $1$ and $b_{\max}=O(n/(\alpha \log n))$. Only after increasing the mini-batch size past this critical point $b_{\max}$, the method begins to transition into a standard Newton-type algorithm which is much more sensitive to the Hessian approximation quality. We demonstrate this phenomenon empirically on benchmark optimization tasks showing that, after tuning the step size, the convergence rate of $\texttt{Mb-SVRN}$ remains fast for a wide range of mini-batch sizes, and the dependence of the phase transition point $b_{\max}$ on the Hessian approximation factor $\alpha$ aligns with our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayesian surrogate modelling with application to robust design optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surrogate models provide a quick-to-evaluate approximation to complex computational models and are essential for multi-query problems like design optimisation. The inputs of current computational models are usually high-dimensional and uncertain. We consider Bayesian inference for constructing statistical surrogates with input uncertainties and intrinsic dimensionality reduction. The surrogates are trained by fitting to data from prevalent deterministic computational models. The assumed prior probability density of the surrogate is a Gaussian process. We determine the respective posterior probability density and parameters of the posited statistical model using variational Bayes. The non-Gaussian posterior is approximated by a simpler trial density with free variational parameters and the discrepancy between them is measured using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We employ the stochastic gradient method to compute the variational parameters and other statistical model parameters by minimising the KL divergence. We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of the proposed reduced dimension variational Gaussian process (RDVGP) surrogate on illustrative and robust structural optimisation problems with cost functions depending on a weighted sum of the mean and standard deviation of model outputs.</description>

      <title>Conformal Predictive Systems Under Covariate Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal Predictive Systems (CPS) offer a versatile framework for constructing predictive distributions, allowing for calibrated inference and informative decision-making. However, their applicability has been limited to scenarios adhering to the Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) model assumption. This paper extends CPS to accommodate scenarios characterized by covariate shifts. We therefore propose Weighted CPS (WCPS), akin to Weighted Conformal Prediction (WCP), leveraging likelihood ratios between training and testing covariate distributions. This extension enables the construction of nonparametric predictive distributions capable of handling covariate shifts. We present theoretical underpinnings and conjectures regarding the validity and efficacy of WCPS and demonstrate its utility through empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our simulation experiments indicate that WCPS are probabilistically calibrated under covariate shift.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In data-driven decision-making in marketing, healthcare, and education, it is desirable to utilize a large amount of data from existing ventures to navigate high-dimensional feature spaces and address data scarcity in new ventures. We explore knowledge transfer in dynamic decision-making by concentrating on batch stationary environments and formally defining task discrepancies through the lens of Markov decision processes (MDPs). We propose a framework of Transferred Fitted $Q$-Iteration algorithm with general function approximation, enabling the direct estimation of the optimal action-state function $Q^*$ using both target and source data. We establish the relationship between statistical performance and MDP task discrepancy under sieve approximation, shedding light on the impact of source and target sample sizes and task discrepancy on the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. We show that the final learning error of the $Q^*$ function is significantly improved from the single task rate both theoretically and empirically.</description>

      <title>PHLP: Sole Persistent Homology for Link Prediction -- Interpretable Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Link prediction (LP), inferring the connectivity between nodes, is a significant research area in graph data, where a link represents essential information on relationships between nodes. Although graph neural network (GNN)-based models have achieved high performance in LP, understanding why they perform well is challenging because most comprise complex neural networks. We employ persistent homology (PH), a topological data analysis method that helps analyze the topological information of graphs, to explain the reasons for the high performance. We propose a novel method that employs PH for LP (PHLP) focusing on how the presence or absence of target links influences the overall topology. The PHLP utilizes the angle hop subgraph and new node labeling called degree double radius node labeling (Degree DRNL), distinguishing the information of graphs better than DRNL. Using only a classifier, PHLP performs similarly to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on most benchmark datasets. Incorporating the outputs calculated using PHLP into the existing GNN-based SOTA models improves performance across all benchmark datasets. To the best of our knowledge, PHLP is the first method of applying PH to LP without GNNs. The proposed approach, employing PH while not relying on neural networks, enables the identification of crucial factors for improving performance.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel and flexible framework for localized tuning of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers by sampling the algorithm's tuning parameters conditionally based on the position and momentum at each step. For adaptively sampling path lengths, we show that randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, the No-U-Turn Sampler, and the Apogee-to-Apogee Path Sampler all fit within this unified framework as special cases. The framework is illustrated with a simple alternative to the No-U-Turn Sampler for locally adapting path lengths.</description>

      <title>Score matching for sub-Riemannian bridge sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation of conditioned diffusion processes is an essential tool in inference for stochastic processes, data imputation, generative modelling, and geometric statistics. Whilst simulating diffusion bridge processes is already difficult on Euclidean spaces, when considering diffusion processes on Riemannian manifolds the geometry brings in further complications. In even higher generality, advancing from Riemannian to sub-Riemannian geometries introduces hypoellipticity, and the possibility of finding appropriate explicit approximations for the score of the diffusion process is removed. We handle these challenges and construct a method for bridge simulation on sub-Riemannian manifolds by demonstrating how recent progress in machine learning can be modified to allow for training of score approximators on sub-Riemannian manifolds. Since gradients dependent on the horizontal distribution, we generalise the usual notion of denoising loss to work with non-holonomic frames using a stochastic Taylor expansion, and we demonstrate the resulting scheme both explicitly on the Heisenberg group and more generally using adapted coordinates. We perform numerical experiments exemplifying samples from the bridge process on the Heisenberg group and the concentration of this process for small time.</description>

      <title>A Majorization-Minimization Gauss-Newton Method for 1-Bit Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1-bit matrix completion, the aim is to estimate an underlying low-rank matrix from a partial set of binary observations. We propose a novel method for 1-bit matrix completion called MMGN. Our method is based on the majorization-minimization (MM) principle, which converts the original optimization problem into a sequence of standard low-rank matrix completion problems. We solve each of these sub-problems by a factorization approach that explicitly enforces the assumed low-rank structure and then apply a Gauss-Newton method. Using simulations and a real data example, we illustrate that in comparison to existing 1-bit matrix completion methods, MMGN outputs comparable if not more accurate estimates. In addition, it is often significantly faster, and less sensitive to the spikiness of the underlying matrix. In comparison with three standard generic optimization approaches that directly minimize the original objective, MMGN also exhibits a clear computational advantage, especially when the fraction of observed entries is small.</description>

      <title>Linear Convergence of Black-Box Variational Inference: Should We Stick the Landing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14642v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that black-box variational inference (BBVI) with control variates, particularly the sticking-the-landing (STL) estimator, converges at a geometric (traditionally called "linear") rate under perfect variational family specification. In particular, we prove a quadratic bound on the gradient variance of the STL estimator, one which encompasses misspecified variational families. Combined with previous works on the quadratic variance condition, this directly implies convergence of BBVI with the use of projected stochastic gradient descent. For the projection operator, we consider a domain with triangular scale matrices, which the projection onto is computable in $\Theta(d)$ time, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the target posterior. We also improve existing analysis on the regular closed-form entropy gradient estimators, which enables comparison against the STL estimator, providing explicit non-asymptotic complexity guarantees for both.</description>

      <title>Mixtures of Gaussians are Privately Learnable with a Polynomial Number of Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating mixtures of Gaussians under the constraint of differential privacy (DP). Our main result is that $\text{poly}(k,d,1/\alpha,1/\varepsilon,\log(1/\delta))$ samples are sufficient to estimate a mixture of $k$ Gaussians in $\mathbb{R}^d$ up to total variation distance $\alpha$ while satisfying $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP. This is the first finite sample complexity upper bound for the problem that does not make any structural assumptions on the GMMs.
  To solve the problem, we devise a new framework which may be useful for other tasks. On a high level, we show that if a class of distributions (such as Gaussians) is (1) list decodable and (2) admits a "locally small'' cover (Bun et al., 2021) with respect to total variation distance, then the class of its mixtures is privately learnable. The proof circumvents a known barrier indicating that, unlike Gaussians, GMMs do not admit a locally small cover (Aden-Ali et al., 2021b).</description>

      <title>Training of Neural Networks with Uncertain Data -- A Mixture of Experts Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the "Uncertainty-aware Mixture of Experts" (uMoE), a novel solution aimed at addressing aleatoric uncertainty within Neural Network (NN) based predictive models. While existing methodologies primarily concentrate on managing uncertainty during inference, uMoE uniquely embeds uncertainty into the training phase. Employing a "Divide and Conquer" strategy, uMoE strategically partitions the uncertain input space into more manageable subspaces. It comprises Expert components, individually trained on their respective subspace uncertainties. Overarching the Experts, a Gating Unit, leveraging additional information regarding the distribution of uncertain in-puts across these subspaces, dynamically adjusts the weighting to minimize deviations from ground truth. Our findings demonstrate the superior performance of uMoE over baseline methods in effectively managing data uncertainty. Furthermore, through a comprehensive robustness analysis, we showcase its adaptability to varying uncertainty levels and propose optimal threshold parameters. This innovative approach boasts broad applicability across diverse da-ta-driven domains, including but not limited to biomedical signal processing, autonomous driving, and production quality control.</description>

Abstract: We develop a novel method to construct uniformly valid confidence bands for a nonparametric component $f_1$ in the sparse additive model $Y=f_1(X_1)+\ldots + f_p(X_p) + \varepsilon$ in a high-dimensional setting. Our method integrates sieve estimation into a high-dimensional Z-estimation framework, facilitating the construction of uniformly valid confidence bands for the target component $f_1$. To form these confidence bands, we employ a multiplier bootstrap procedure. Additionally, we provide rates for the uniform lasso estimation in high dimensions, which may be of independent interest. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our proposed method delivers reliable results in terms of estimation and coverage, even in small samples.</description>

      <title>Are Bias Mitigation Techniques for Deep Learning Effective?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.00170v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A critical problem in deep learning is that systems learn inappropriate biases, resulting in their inability to perform well on minority groups. This has led to the creation of multiple algorithms that endeavor to mitigate bias. However, it is not clear how effective these methods are. This is because study protocols differ among papers, systems are tested on datasets that fail to test many forms of bias, and systems have access to hidden knowledge or are tuned specifically to the test set. To address this, we introduce an improved evaluation protocol, sensible metrics, and a new dataset, which enables us to ask and answer critical questions about bias mitigation algorithms. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art algorithms using the same network architecture and hyperparameter selection policy across three benchmark datasets. We introduce a new dataset called Biased MNIST that enables assessment of robustness to multiple bias sources. We use Biased MNIST and a visual question answering (VQA) benchmark to assess robustness to hidden biases. Rather than only tuning to the test set distribution, we study robustness across different tuning distributions, which is critical because for many applications the test distribution may not be known during development. We find that algorithms exploit hidden biases, are unable to scale to multiple forms of bias, and are highly sensitive to the choice of tuning set. Based on our findings, we implore the community to adopt more rigorous assessment of future bias mitigation methods. All data, code, and results are publicly available at: https://github.com/erobic/bias-mitigators.</description>

      <title>Imputation using training labels and classification via label imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Missing data is a common problem in practical settings. Various imputation methods have been developed to deal with missing data. However, even though the label is usually available in the training data, the common practice of imputation usually only relies on the input and ignores the label. In this work, we illustrate how stacking the label into the input can significantly improve the imputation of the input. In addition, we propose a classification strategy that initializes the predicted test label with missing values and stacks the label with the input for imputation. This allows imputing the label and the input at the same time. Also, the technique is capable of handling data training with missing labels without any prior imputation and is applicable to continuous, categorical, or mixed-type data. Experiments show promising results in terms of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Estimation Sample Complexity of a Class of Nonlinear Continuous-time Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method of parameter estimation for large class of nonlinear systems, namely those in which the state consists of output derivatives and the flow is linear in the parameter. The method, which solves for the unknown parameter by directly inverting the dynamics using regularized linear regression, is based on new design and analysis ideas for differentiation filtering and regularized least squares. Combined in series, they yield a novel finite-sample bound on mean absolute error of estimation.</description>

      <title>Non-negative Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep representations have shown promising performance when transferred to downstream tasks in a black-box manner. Yet, their inherent lack of interpretability remains a significant challenge, as these features are often opaque to human understanding. In this paper, we propose Non-negative Contrastive Learning (NCL), a renaissance of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) aimed at deriving interpretable features. The power of NCL lies in its enforcement of non-negativity constraints on features, reminiscent of NMF's capability to extract features that align closely with sample clusters. NCL not only aligns mathematically well with an NMF objective but also preserves NMF's interpretability attributes, resulting in a more sparse and disentangled representation compared to standard contrastive learning (CL). Theoretically, we establish guarantees on the identifiability and downstream generalization of NCL. Empirically, we show that these advantages enable NCL to outperform CL significantly on feature disentanglement, feature selection, as well as downstream classification tasks. At last, we show that NCL can be easily extended to other learning scenarios and benefit supervised learning as well. Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/non_neg.</description>
