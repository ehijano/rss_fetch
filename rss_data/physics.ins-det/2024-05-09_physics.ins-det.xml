      <title>Performance evaluation of electron multiplier tubes as a high-intensity muon beam monitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upgrade work towards increasing the beam intensity of the neutrino production beamline at J-PARC is underway. Tertiary muon beam monitoring is essential for stable operation of the beamline. Accordingly, we are planning to replace the present muon monitor detectors with electron multiplier tubes (EMTs). We investigated the linearity and radiation tolerance of EMTs using a 90 MeV electron beam at the Research Center for Electron Photon Science. EMTs show higher radiation tolerance than the Si sensors which are presently used as one of the muon monitor detectors for the T2K long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment at J-PARC. The signal yield decrease is found to be less than 10% after a beam irradiation equivalent to 132-days of operation at the future J-PARC beam power of 1.3 MW. The observed yield decrease is likely due to dynode deterioration, based on the results of a detailed investigation. The studies described here confirm that EMTs can be used as a high-intensity muon beam monitor.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear vibrational spectrometer for bioapplications featuring narrowband 1-$\mu$m pulses and a recycled OPA pump beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moving the detection wavelength in vibrational sum-frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy to the near-infrared (&gt; 700 nm) can potentially enable the study of molecular interfaces absorbing in the visible and give access to buried bio-interfaces at minimal absorption, reduced scattering, and negligible autofluorescence. Here, we employ an ultra-narrow bandpass thin-film optical interference filter on 180-fs, 1.03-$\mu$m laser pulses to generate an upconversion beam yielding a spectral resolution of 5 cm$^{-1}$ and VSFG wavelengths between 890 and 980 nm for molecular vibrations in the fingerprint region. We demonstrate that the beam rejected by the filter can be utilized for driving a supercontinuum-seeded near-infrared optical parametric amplifier serving as the front-end of a broadband LiGaS$_{2}$-based mid-infrared amplifier. Benchmark data on a phospholipid monolayer at the air-water interface acquired using the resulting VSFG spectrometer show the possibility of achieving high resolution and signal-to-noise ratio at short acquisition times. The scheme can also be utilized in other types of vibrational spectroscopy that derive their spectral resolution from bandpass-filtering of femtosecond near-infrared laser pulses, such as stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Illumination and Quantum Radar: A Brief Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum illumination (QI) and quantum radar have emerged as potentially groundbreaking technologies, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to revolutionise the field of remote sensing and target detection. The protocol, particularly in the context of quantum radar, has been subject to a great deal of aspirational conjecture as well as criticism with respect to its realistic potential. In this review, we present a broad overview of the field of quantum target detection focusing on QI and its potential as an underlying scheme for a quantum radar operating at microwave frequencies. We provide context for the field by considering its historical development and fundamental principles. Our aim is to provide a balanced discussion on the state of theoretical and experimental progress towards realising a working QI-based quantum radar, and draw conclusions about its current outlook and future directions.</description>

      <title>RFSoC Gen3-Based Software-Defined Radio Characterization for the Readout System of Low-Temperature Bolometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work reports the performance evaluation of an SDR readout system based on the latest generation (Gen3) of the AMD's Radio Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) processing platform, which integrates a full-stack processing system and a powerful FPGA with up to 32 high-speed and high-resolution 14-bit Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) and Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). The proposed readout system uses a previously developed multi-band, double-conversion IQ RF-mixing board targeting a multiplexing factor of approximately 1,000 bolometers in a bandwidth between 4 and 8 GHz, in line with state-of-the-art microwave SQUID multiplexers ($\mu$MUX). The characterization of the system was performed in two stages, under the conditions typically imposed by the multiplexer and the cold readout circuit. First, in transmission, showing that noise and spurious levels of the generated tones are close to the values imposed by the cold readout. Second, in RF loopback, presenting noise values better than -100 dBc/Hz totally in agreement with the state-of-the-art readout systems. It was demonstrated that the RFSoC Gen3 device is a suitable enabling technology for the next generation of superconducting detector readout systems, reducing system complexity, increasing system integration, and achieving these goals without performance degradation.</description>
