      <title>Regularized Fingerprinting with Linearly Optimal Weight Matrix in Detection and Attribution of Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change detection and attribution plays a central role in establishing the causal influence of human activities on global warming. The most widely used framework, optimal fingerprinting, is a linear regression model with errors-in-variables (EIV), in which each covariate is subject to measurement error whose covariance matrix is the same as that of the regression error up to a known scale. The reliability of such detection and attribution analyses critically depends on accurate inference of the regression coefficients. The optimal weight matrix in estimating the regression coefficient is the precision matrix of the regression error, which is typically unknown and has to be estimated from climate model simulations with appropriate regularization. However, the estimators from the prevailing method, regularized optimal fingerprinting, are not optimal as believed, owing to the unreliable estimation of the optimal weight matrix, and their uncertainties are underestimated, leading to too narrow confidence intervals to match the nominal confidence levels. In this paper, we propose consistent estimates of the variances of regression coefficients for weight matrices within the class of linear shrinkage estimators. Building on this result, we derive a linearly optimal weight matrix that directly minimizes the asymptotic variances of the estimated scaling factors within the fingerprinting framework. Numerical studies confirm that the proposed method yields confidence intervals with empirical coverage rates close to the nominal level, while also achieving shorter average interval lengths. In applications to the detection and attribution analyses of annual mean near-surface air temperature at the global, continental, and subcontinental scales during 1951--2020, the proposed method produced shorter confidence intervals than the existing approaches in most of the analyses.</description>

      <title>Random walks with resetting on hypergraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergraph has been selected as a powerful candidate for characterizing higher-order networks and has received
  increasing attention in recent years. In this article, we study random walks with resetting on hypergraph by utilizing
  spectral theory. Specifically, we derive exact expressions for some fundamental yet key parameters, including occupation
  probability, stationary distribution, and mean first passage time, all of which are expressed in terms of the eigenvalues
  and eigenvectors of the transition matrix. Furthermore, we provide a general condition for determining the optimal
  reset probability and a sufficient condition for its existence. In addition, we build up a close relationship between
  random walks with resetting on hypergraph and simple random walks. Concretely, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
  of the former can be precisely represented by those of the latter. More importantly, when considering random walks,
  we abandon the traditional approach of converting hypergraph into a graph and propose a research framework that
  preserves the intrinsic structure of hypergraph itself, which is based on assigning proper weights to neighboring nodes.
  Through extensive experiments, we show that the new framework produces distinct and more reliable results than
  the traditional approach in node ranking. Finally, we explore the impact of the resetting mechanism on cover time,
  providing a potential solution for optimizing search efficiency.</description>

      <title>Is the end of Insight in Sight ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the weight matrices of a Physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based deep learning application to a rarefied gas dynamics problem described by the Boltzmann equation bear no evident link to the mathematical structure of the physical problem. Instead, the weights appear close to Gaussian distributed random matrices. Although significantly more work is needed to support a robust assessment in this direction, these results suggest that deep-learning and the numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation represent two equivalent, but largely distinct paths to the same physical knowledge. If so, Explainable AI might be an unrealistic target and possibly even an ill-posed one.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Literature Review of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network Models for Time Series Forecasting and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable interest in the field of time series analysis, due to their ability to capture dependencies among variables and across time points. The objective of the presented systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and over 150 journal papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive collection of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in future studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of the results of current spatio-temporal GNN models in different domains. In addition, in its final part this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Subspace via Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis for Characterizing Model Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a probabilistic model of subspaces based on the probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA). Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</description>
