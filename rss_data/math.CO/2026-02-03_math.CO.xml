      <title>Thresholds vs. expectation thresholds for non-spanning graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The threshold $p_c(H)$ for the event that the binomial random graph $G_{n,p}$ contains a copy of a graph $H$ is the unique $p$ for which $\mathbb{P}(H \subseteq G_{n,p}) = 1/2$, and the fractional expectation threshold $q_f(H)$ is roughly the best lower bound on $p_c(H)$ using simple expectation considerations. All previously known $H$'s with $p_c(H)$ substantially larger than $q_f(H)$ have the property that $v_H &gt; n/2$ (where $v_H$ is the number of vertices of $H$). We construct small graphs whose threshold for containment in $G_{n,p}$ is of different order than their corresponding fractional expectation threshold: there is a constant $c &gt; 0$ such that for any $m \; (\leq n)$, there is a graph $H$ with $v_H = m$ and $p_c(H) &gt; q_f(H) c \log^{1/2}(v_H).$</description>

      <title>Games on deBruijn Graphs and Cycle Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: deBruijn graphs are widely used in genomics and computer science. In this paper we present a novel approach to finding weights on edges of doubly weighted deBruijn graphs. Given any fixed set of weights on vertices, we use a repeated two-person zero-sum game to find weights on edges so that every cycle on the deBruijn graph has the same average weight, providing explicit formulas. This approach uses minimax optimal strategies of the players. Once the weights on the edges are determined, we observe that they correspond to solving a set of linear equations with as many equations as there are cycles. This is very surprising, because there are many more cycles than unknowns. Moreover we analyze other, related games on graphs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a combinatorial and order-theoretic framework for shuffles, understood as ordered concatenations of indexed families of sequences that induce total orders on the natural numbers. Motivated by the classical \v{S}arkovski\u{i} order, we introduce elementary building blocks that encode finite and infinite order patterns and focus on decomposable shuffles constructed from finite ordinals together with $\omega$ and its dual $\omega^*$. We define representations that allow individual elements to be located within a shuffle and show how suitable structural conditions yield total orders on $\mathbb{N}$</description>

      <title>On the Hamiltonicity, traceability and toughness of complements of line graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coline graph $\text{co}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the graph with vertex set $E(G)$ for which two vertices $e$ and $e'$ of $\text{co}(G)$ are adjacent if and only if they are not adjacent as edges in $G$. A graph $G$ is tough if the number of connected components of $G-S$ is at most $|S|$ for all cut sets $S$. Wu and Meng, and Liu independently gave similar characterisations of coline graphs that are Hamiltonian. In this paper we give an alternate proof of Wu and Meng's and Liu's results using the longest cycle method. We in fact prove the following reformation of their results. A tough coline graph $\text{co}(G)$ is Hamiltonian unless $G$ is one of four examples, one of which is $K_5$, since $\text{co}(K_5)$ is the Petersen graph. Characterisations of tough coline graphs and coline graphs which contain a Hamiltonian path are also given.</description>

      <title>Exact minimum co-degree conditions for $\ell$-Hamiltonicity in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $1\le \ell &lt;k$ such that $(k-\ell)\nmid k$. Given an $n$-vertex $k$-uniform hypergraph $\mathcal H$, for all $k/2&lt;\ell&lt; 3k/4$ and sufficiently large $n\in (k-\ell)\mathbb N$, we prove that if $\mathcal H$ has minimum co-degree at least $\frac{n}{\lceil \frac{k}{k-\ell}\rceil (k-\ell)}$, then $\mathcal H$ contains a Hamilton $\ell$-cycle, which partially verifies a conjecture of Han and Zhao and (partially) resolves a problem of R\"odl and Ruci\'nski. Moreover, we show that assuming minimum co-degree $\frac{n}{\lceil \frac{k}{k-\ell}\rceil (k-\ell)}+\frac{k^2}2$ is enough for all $\ell$.</description>

      <title>Boolean lattice without small rainbow subposets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Boolean lattice $\mathcal{B}_n=(2^X, \leq)$ is the power set of an $n$-element ground set $X$ equipped with inclusion relation. For two posets $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$, we say that $\mathcal{Q}$ contains an \emph{induced copy} of $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists an injection $f : \mathcal{P} \to \mathcal{Q}$ such that $f(X) \le f(Y)$ if and only if $X \le Y$ in $\mathcal{P}$. A $k$-coloring is exact if all colors are used at least once. For posets $\mathcal{Q}$ and $\mathcal{P}$, the \emph{Boolean Gallai-Ramsey number} $\operatorname{GR}_{k}(\mathcal{Q}:\mathcal{P})$ is defined as the smallest $n$ such that any exact $k$-coloring of the sets in $\mathcal{B}_n$ contains either a rainbow induced copy of $\mathcal{Q}$ or a monochromatic induced copy of $\mathcal{P}$ and the \emph{Boolean rainbow Ramsey number} $\operatorname{RR}(\mathcal{Q}:\mathcal{P})$ is defined as the smallest $n$ such that any coloring of the sets in $\mathcal{B}_n$ contains either a rainbow induced copy of $\mathcal{Q}$ or a monochromatic induced copy of $\mathcal{P}$.
  In this paper, we first study the structural properties of exact $k$-colorings of the sets in Boolean lattice without rainbow induced copy of small posets. As the application of these results, we give exact values and some bounds of Boolean Gallai-Ramsey numbers and Boolean rainbow Ramsey numbers, which improve a result of Chen, Cheng, Li, and Liu in 2020 and give an answer of a question proposed by Chang, Gerbner, Li, Methuku, Nagy, Patk\'{o}s, and Vizer in 2022.</description>

      <title>Graphs defined on algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a great deal of attention recently to graphs whose vertex set is a group, defined using the group structure. (The commuting graph, where two elements are joined if they commute, is the oldest and most famous example.)
  The purpose of this paper is to investigate extending the definitions of such graphs to general algebras (in the sense of universal algebra). It seems unlikely that such a definition can be made for the commuting graph, or for various others such as the nilpotency and Engel graphs. However, for graphs whose definition depends on the notion of subgroup or subalgebra generated by a subset, the existing definitions work without change. These graphs include several well-studied examples: the power graph, enhanced power graph, generating graph, independence graph, and rank graph. In these cases, some results about groups extend to arbitrary algebras unchanged, but others require specific properties of groups, and pose a challenge to researchers.
  In the next two sections, I will describe some extensions to directed graphs (the directed power graph and the endomorphism digraph) and to simplicial complexes (the independence and strong independence complexes). The final section gives explicit descriptions of all of these objects for independence algebras.</description>

      <title>Natural graph spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2003, van Dam and Haemers posed a fundamental question in spectral graph theory: does there exist a ``sensible'' matrix whose spectrum determines a random graph up to isomorphism? This paper introduces the class of {\em natural graph matrices}, which are matrices defined by applying a fixed sequence of elementary operations to the adjacency matrix. This class includes many standard matrices such as the adjacency matrix, the Seidel matrix, the Laplacian matrix, and the distance matrix. We give an affirmative answer to the question of van Dam and Haemers by proving the existence of a natural graph matrix whose spectrum determines random graphs up to isomorphism. The proof introduces a new algebraic framework called {\em double algebras}, which provides a simple sufficient condition for spectral determination. This sufficient condition is then shown to hold for random graphs.</description>

      <title>Some sufficient conditions for a graph with minimum degree to be $k$-critical with respect to $[1,b]$-odd factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $k$-factor-critical if $G-S$ has a perfect matching for every subset $S \subseteq V(G)$ with $|S|=k$. A spanning subgraph $H$ of $G$ is called a $[1,b]$-odd factor if $b \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$ and $d_{H}(v) \in\left\lbrace 1, 3, \ldots, b\right\rbrace$ for every $v\in V(G),$ where $d_{H}(v)$ denotes the degree of vertex $v$ in $H$. Moreover, $G$ is said to be $k$-critical with respect to $[1,b]$-odd factors if $G-X$ contains a $[1,b]$-odd factor for every subset $X \subseteq V(G)$ with $|X|=k$. In this paper, we provide some sufficient conditions based on the distance spectral radius and the distance signless Laplacian spectral radius for a graph with minimum degree to be $k$-critical with respect to $[1,b]$-odd factors.</description>

      <title>Skirting the $n$-tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n\ge 2$ and $q\ge 2$ be given. The set $X = \mathbb Z_q^n$ is a metric space of diameter $n$ under the Hamming metric $d(\cdot,\cdot)$. We seek a smallest set $S\subseteq X$ that ``skirts'' every $q$-ary $n$-tuple in the sense that every $x\in X$ is at distance $n$ from at least one element of $S$. Thus we aim to compute the total domination number $f(n,q)$ of the graph $G(n,q)$ with vertex set $X$ and edge set $\{ xy \, \| \, d(x,y)=n\}$. We provide constructions and bounds for this number, establishing $f(n,q) = C_q^{(1+o(1))n}$ for some constants $2=C_2&gt;C_3 \geq \cdots$ which we are only able to estimate at the present time.</description>

      <title>Lines and opposition in Lie incidence geometries of exceptional type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise sets of points of exceptional Lie incidence geometries, that is, the natural geometries arising from spherical buildings of exceptional types $\mathsf{F_4}$, $\mathsf{E_6}$, $\mathsf{E_7}$, $\mathsf{E_8}$ and $\mathsf{G_2}$, that form a line using the opposition relation. With that, we obtain a classification of so-called ``geometric lines'' in many of these geometries. Furthermore, our results lead to a characterisation of geometric lines in finite exceptional Lie incidence geometries as minimal blocking sets, that is, point sets of the size of a line admitting no object opposite to all of their members, in most cases, and we classify all exceptions. As a further consequence, we obtain a characterisation of automorphisms of exceptional spherical buildings as certain opposition preserving maps.</description>

      <title>Well-order a flame</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $r$-rooted (possibly infinite) digraph $ D=(V,E) $ is a flame if for every $ v\in V\setminus \{ r \} $ there exists a set of edge-disjoint paths from $r$ to $v$ in $D$ that covers all ingoing edges of $ v $. Flames were first studied by Lov\'asz in his investigation of edge-minimal subgraphs of a rooted digraph that preserve all the local edge-connectivities from the root. He showed that these subgraphs are always flames. Szeszl\'er later proved a common generalisation of Lov\'asz' result and Edmonds' disjoint arborescence theorem. In this paper we focus on infinite flames and prove the following constructive characterisation. Every (possibly infinite) flame can be constructed transfinitely, starting from the empty edge set and adding a single edge at each step in such a way that every intermediate digraph is again a flame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a plane set $A$ is {\it graph-null,} if there is a function $g\colon [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $\lambda_2 (A+{\rm graph}\, g)=0$. A plane set $A$ has the {\it translational Kakeya property} if, for every translated copy $A'$ of $A$ and for every $\epsilon &gt;0$, there is a finite sequence of vertical and horizontal translations bringing $A$ to $A'$ such that the area touched during the horizontal translations is less than $\epsilon$. These properties are equivalent if $A$ is compact. We show that the graph of every absolutely continuous function is graph-null. Also, the graph of a typical continuous function is graph-null. Therefore, there are nowhere differentiable continuous functions whose graphs are graph-null. Still, we show that there exists a continuous function whose graph is not graph-null.</description>

      <title>Trees with maximum $\sigma$-irregularity under a prescribed maximum degree 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sigma-irregularity index $\sigma(G) = \sum_{uv \in E(G)} (d_G(u) - d_G(v))^2$ measures the total degree imbalance along the edges of a graph. We study extremal problems for $\sigma(T)$ within the class of trees of fixed order $n$ and bounded maximum degree $\Delta = 6$. Using a penalty-function framework combined with handshake identities and congruence arguments, we determine the exact maximum value of $\sigma(T)$ for every residue class of $n$ modulo $6$, showing that the possible minimum values of the penalty function are $0, 10, 20, 22, 30,$ and $40$. For each case, we provide a complete characterization of all maximizing trees in terms of degree counts and edge multiplicities. In five of the six residue classes, all extremal trees contain only vertices of degrees $1, 2,$ and $6$, while for $n \equiv 3 \pmod{6}$ an additional exceptional family arises involving vertices of degree $3$. These results extend earlier work on sigma-irregularity for smaller degree bounds and illustrate the rapidly growing combinatorial complexity of the problem as the maximum degree increases.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Characterization of Maximal Unrefinable Partitions via the Keith-Nath Transformation and Young Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the combinatorial structure of unrefinable partitions through their correspondence with numerical sets and Young diagrams. Building on the bijection introduced by Keith and Nath, we apply a general geometric criterion that links the unrefinability of a partition directly to the hook lengths of its associated Young diagram. This criterion provides a structural method for the characterization of any unrefinable partition. Using this general framework, we revisit the correspondence results between maximal unrefinable partitions and partitions into distinct parts, previously established using enumerative methods. We provide alternative and purely combinatorial proofs of these bijections, focusing on the rigid symmetry structures of the Young diagrams. In the triangular weight case, we show that the corresponding diagrams are quasi-symmetric, i.e. symmetric up to a single extra column. We extend this analysis to the nontriangular case, showing that the diagrams either exhibit this same quasi-symmetric structure or are perfectly self-conjugate, depending on the maximal part.</description>

      <title>5-cycles in the complement of minimal prime graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal prime graphs (MPGs) are a special class of prime graphs (also known as Gruenberg-Kegel graphs) associated with finite solvable groups. A graph is an MPG if it has at least two vertices, is connected, its complement is triangle-free and 3-colorable, and the addition of an edge to the complement will violate triangle-freeness or 3-colorability. In this paper, we continue the study of the complements of MPGs focusing on their cycle structure. Our main result establishes that every edge in the complement of an MPG is contained in a 5-cycle. This finding is a much stronger form of an older result stating that every minimal prime graph complement contains at least one induced 5-cycle.</description>

      <title>Erd\H{o}s Matching (Conjecture) Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of $k$-sized subsets of $[n]$ that does not contain $s$ pairwise disjoint subsets.
  The Erd\H{o}s Matching Conjecture, a celebrated and long-standing open problem in extremal combinatorics, asserts the maximum cardinality of $\mathcal{F}$ is upper bounded by
  $\max\left\{\binom{sk-1}{k}, \binom{n}{k}-\allowbreak \binom{n-s+1}{k}\right\}$.
  These two bounds correspond to the sizes of two canonical extremal families: one in which all subsets are contained within a ground set of $sk-1$ elements, and one in which every subset intersects a fixed set of $s-1$ elements.
  In this paper, we prove the conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the tree-decomposition-based parameter totally $\Delta$-modular treewidth (TDM-treewidth) for matrices with two nonzero entries per row. We show how to solve integer programs whose matrices have bounded TDM-treewidth when variables are bounded. This extends previous graph-based decomposition parameters for matrices with at most two nonzero entries per row to include matrices with entries outside of $\{-1,0,1\}$. We also give an analogue of the Grid Theorem of Robertson and Seymour for matrices of bounded TDM-treewidth in the language of rooted signed graphs.</description>

      <title>Size conditions and spectral conditions for generalized factor-critical (bicritical) graphs and $k$-$d$-critical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mbox{odd}(G)$ and $i(G)$ denote the number of nontrivial odd components and the number of isolated vertices of a graph $G$, respectively. The $k$-Berge-Tutte-formula of a graph $G$ is defined as: $\mbox{def}_k(G)=\mathop{\text{max}}\limits_{S\subseteq V(G)}\{k\cdot i(G-S)-k|S|\} $ for even $k$; $\mbox{def}_k(G)=\mathop{\mbox{max}}\limits_{S\subseteq V(G)}\{\mbox{odd}(G-S)+k\cdot i(G-S)-k|S|\} $ for odd $k$. A $k$-barrier of a graph $G$ is the subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ that reaches the maximum value in the $k$-Berge-Tutte-formula of $G$. A graph $G$ of odd order (resp. even order) is generalized factor-critical (resp. generalized bicritical) if $\emptyset$ is its only $k$-barrier. Denote by $E_G(v)$ the set of all edges incident to a vertex $v$ in $G$. 
  A $k$-matching of a graph $G$ is a function $f:E(G) \rightarrow \{0,1,...,k\}$ such that $\sum_{e\in E_G(v)} f(e)$ $\leq k$ for every vertex $v\in V(G)$. For $1\leq d\leq k$ and $d \equiv |V(G)|$(mod 2), if for any $ v \in V(G)$, there exists a $k$-matching $f$ such that $\sum_{e\in E_G(v)}f(e)=k-d$ and $\sum_{e\in E_G(u)}f(e)=k \text{ for any } u\in V(G)-\{v\}$. Then $G$ is $k$-$d$-critical.
  In this paper, we establish tight sufficient conditions in terms of size or spectral radius respectively for a graph $G$ to be generalized factor-critical, generalized bicritical, and $k$-$d$-critical.
  Furthermore, we prove the equivalence of the existence of four factors (namely, $\{K_2,\{C_t: t\geq 3\}\}$-factor, $\{K_2,\{C_{2t+1}:t\geq 1 \}\}$-factor, fractional perfect matching, perfect $k$-matching with even $k$) in a graph. Thus we also give size conditions and spectral radius conditions for a graph $G-v$ to have one of the four factors for any $v\in V(G)$.</description>

      <title>The local antimagic (total) chromatic numbers of firecracker graphs and edge-corona product graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G=(V(G),E(G)) be a connected simple graph with n vertices and m edges. A bijection f from the edge set of G to [m] is called a local antimagic labeling of G, if for any two adjacent vertices u and v in G, the sums of the weights of the edges associated with u and v ,respectively, are different. Similarly, A bijection g from the union of edge set and vertex set of G to [n+m] is called a local antimagic total labeling of G, if for any two adjacent vertices u and v in G, The sum of the weight of u and the weights of its incident edges differs from that of v. Obviously, any local antimagic (total) labeling induces a proper vertex-coloring of G when every vertex v is assigned the color w(v)(w_t(v)). The local antimagic (total) chromatic number of G, denoted by X_la(G)(X_lat(G)) , is defined as the minimum number of colors taken over all colorings induced by local antimagic (total) labelings of G. In this paper, we present the local antimagic (total) chromatic number of firecracker graph F_n,k, obtained by the concatenation of n k-stars by linking one leaf from each. Then we give the local antimagic chromatic number of the edge-corona product of two graphs G and H, where the graph is constructed by taking one copy of G and |E(G)| disjoint copies of H one-to-one assigned to each edge of G, and for every edge uv of G, joining u and v to every vertex of the copy of H associated to uv. For the graph studied here, G is a star S_k or a double star S_k1,k2, and H is an empty graph with r vertices or a complete graph K_2.</description>

      <title>On the $\ell$-th largest degree of an intersecting family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}\subset\binom{[n]}{k}$ be an intersecting family. For an element $i\in[n]$, the degree of $i$ is the number of sets in $\mathcal{F}$ that contain $i$. Assume that the degrees are ordered as $d_{1}\ge d_{2}\ge\cdots\ge d_{n}$. Huang and Zhao showed that if $n&gt;2k$, then the minimum degree satisfies $d_{n}\le\binom{n-2}{k-2}$, with the maximum attained by the $1$-star. We strengthen this result by proving that for $n\ge 2k+1$, the $(2k+1)$-th largest degree satisfies $d_{2k+1}\le\binom{n-2}{k-2}$, thereby confirming a conjecture of Frankl and Wang. Furthermore, we prove that for $k&gt;50$ and $n&gt;\frac{11}{2}k$, the $(k+2)$-th largest degree $d_{k+2}$ is already at most $\binom{n-2}{k-2}$. The techniques we developed also yield an tight upper bound for the $(\ell+1)$-th largest degree $d_{\ell+1}$ for $\ell \le k$ and sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the investigation of energy distribution in finite settings, which is related to the results established in [H]. We analyze the distribution of multiplicative energies using Fourier analytical methods and random structures. Our results provide new structural insights into energy phenomena in finite fields, complementing the earlier discrete analysis. Additionally, we provide an estimate for the smallest $k$ such that the $k$-fold product set $A^k$ covers the entire field $\mathbb{F}$, given that $A$ has small doubling.</description>

      <title>The price of homogeneity is polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide explicit and polynomial bounds for the Homogeneous Wall Lemma which occurred for the first time implicitly in the $13$th entry of Robertson and Seymour's Graph Minors Series [JCTB 1990] and has since become a cornerstone in the algorithmic theory of graph minors.
  A wall where each brick is assigned a set of colours is said to be homogeneous if each brick is assigned the same set of colours. The Homogeneous Wall Lemma says that there exists a function $h$ that, given non-negative integers $q$ and $k$ and an $h(q,k)$-wall $W$ where each brick is assigned a, possibly empty, subset of $\{ 1, \ldots , q \}$ contains a $k$-wall $W'$ as a subgraph such that, if one assigns to each brick $B$ of $W'$ the union of the sets assigned to the bricks of $W$ in its interior, then $W'$ is homogeneous. It is well-known that $h(q,k) \in k^{\mathcal{O}(q)}$. The Homogeneous Wall Lemma plays a key role in most applications of the Irrelevant Vertex Technique where an exponential dependency of $h$ on $q$ usually causes non-uniform dependencies on meta-parameters at best and additional exponential blow-ups at worst. By proving that $h(q,k) \in \mathcal{O}(q^4 \cdot k^6)$, we provide a positive answer to a problem raised by Sau, Stamoulis, and Thilikos [ICALP 2020].</description>

      <title>On the maximum twist width of delta-matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a ribbon graph $G$, let $\gamma(G)$ denote its Euler genus. Recently, Chen, Gross and Tucker [J. Algebraic Combin. 63 (2026) 13] derived a formula for the maximum partial-dual Euler-genus $\partial\gamma_M(G)$ of a ribbon graph $G$. Their key finding is that $\partial\gamma_M(G)$ can be achieved by a partial dual with respect to the edge set of a spanning quasi-tree. Moreover, they proposed the following problem: Given a ribbon graph $G$, is there a sequence of edges $e_1,e_2,\dots, e_k$ such that $\gamma(G^{\{e_1, e_2,\dots, e_k\}})=\partial\gamma_M(G)$ and such that the sequence $$\gamma(G), \gamma(G^{\{e_1\}}), \dots, \gamma(G^ {\{e_1, e_2,\dots, e_k\}})$$ rises monotonically (i.e., never decreasing) to $\partial\gamma_M(G)$?
  Delta-matroids are set systems that satisfy the symmetric exchange axiom and serve as a matroidal abstraction of ribbon graphs. In this paper, we first show that the maximum twist width of a set system can be attained by twisting one of its feasible sets, which extends the result of Chen, Gross and Tucker to set systems. Then we solve the delta-matroid version of their problem, thereby providing an affirmative answer to the original problem for ribbon graphs.</description>

      <title>Spectral radius and parity $[a,b]$-factors in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $a$, $b$, and $n$ be three integers such that $1\leq a \leq b &lt; n$, $a \equiv b$ (mod $2$), and $na$ is even. A parity $[a,b]$-factor of $G$ is a spanning subgraph $H$ such that for each vertex $v \in V(G)$, $a \leq d_H(v) \leq b$ and $d_H(v) \equiv a \equiv b$ (mod $2$). Recently, O [J. Graph Theory 100 (2022) 458-469] proved eigenvalue conditions for a regular graph to have a parity $[a,b]$-factor.
  In this paper, we prove a sharp lower bound on the spectral radius for an $n$-vertex graph $G$ to have a parity $[a,b]$-factor as follows: If $G$ is an $n$-vertex connected graph with $\delta(G)\geq a$ and $\rho(G)\geq\rho(G_{n}^{a})$, then $G$ contains a parity $[a,b]$-factor unless $G \cong G_{n}^{a}$, where $2\leq a&lt;b$ and $G_{n}^{a}$ is the graph obtained from $K_{a-1}\vee(K_{n-2a-1}\cup(a+1)K_1)$ by adding a new vertex and adding all possible edges between the added vertex and each vertex in $(a+1)K_1$.</description>

      <title>On the Graphical $r$-Stirling Numbers of the First Kind for Specific Graph Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the \textbf{graphical $r$-Stirling numbers of the first kind}, denoted by $\str{G}{k}$, which enumerate partitions of a vertex set $V(G)$ into $k$ disjoint cycles such that $r$ specified vertices occupy distinct blocks. We establish closed-form expressions and recursive identities for fundamental graph families, including \textbf{Path} ($P_n$), \textbf{Cycle} ($C_n$), \textbf{Star} ($S_n$), \textbf{Wheel} ($W_n$), and \textbf{Fan} ($F_n$) graphs.
  A primary focus of this study is the \textbf{statistical characterization} of the cycle distribution. We derive explicit formulas for the \textbf{mean} and \textbf{variance} of these numbers, extracted from the structural properties of the $r$-cycle polynomials. These results provide a rigorous measure of the average cycle density and variability across different graph topologies, bridging the gap between algebraic combinatorics and the structural analysis of restricted permutations.</description>

      <title>A note on multicolour Ramsey numbers and random sphere graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ramsey number $r(t;\ell)$ is the smallest $n$ such that every $\ell$-coloring of the edges of $K_n$ gives a monochromatic $K_{t}$. In recent years, there have been several improvements on asymptotic lower bounds for these numbers when $\ell\geq 3$. This started with a breakthrough result of Conlon and Ferber, followed by further improvements of Wigderson and then Sawin. Building on the previous approaches, Sawin used blowups of an unbalanced binomial random graph to show that there is some explicit constant $\delta_*\approx 0.383796$ such that $r(t;\ell)\geq 2^{\delta_*(\ell-2)t+t/2+o(t)}$. In this short note, we show that one can get an exponential improvement in this bound by replacing the use of a binomial random graph with a random sphere graph, a model which which has recently been applied by Ma, Shen and Xie in a breakthrough on lower bounds for (2-colour) Ramsey numbers in the (slightly) off-diagonal setting.</description>

      <title>On the strength of connectedness of unions of random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G_1,\dots, G_m$ be independent identically distributed random subgraphs of the complete graph ${\cal K}_n$. We analyse the threshold behaviour of the strength of connectedness of the union $\cup_{i=1}^mG_i$ defined on the vertex set of ${\cal K}_n$. Let $a=\min\{t\ge 1:\, \PP\{\delta(G_1)=t&gt;0\}\}$ be the minimal non zero vertex degree attained with positive probability. Given $k\ge 0$ let $\lambda(k)=\ln n+k\ln\frac{m}{n}-\frac{m}{n} \E X$, where $X$ stands for the number of non isolated vertices of $G_1$. Letting $n,m\to+\infty$ we show that $\PP\{\cup_{i=1}^mG_i$ is $a(k+1)$-connected$\} \to 1 $ for $\lambda(k)\to -\infty$, and $\PP\{\cup_{i=1}^mG_i$ is $ak+1$-connected$\} \to 0 $ for $\lambda(k)\to +\infty$. In particular, the connectivity strength of the union graph $\cup_{i=1}^mG_i$ increases in steps of size $a$. Our results are obtained in a more general setting where the contributing random subgraphs do not need to be identically distributed.</description>

Abstract: The Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon identities generalize the classical partition identities discovered independently by L. J. Rogers and S. Ramanujan. Recently, Afsharijoo gave a commutative algebra proof of the Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon identities. In this article, we present a commutative algebra proof of a broader family of identities introduced by Coulson \textit{et al.}, which includes the Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon identities as a special case. In the proof, we relate the generating functions associated with these identities to the Hilbert-Poincar\'e series of suitably constructed graded algebras.</description>

Abstract: The G\"ollnitz-Gordon-Andrews identities generalize the partition identities discovered independently by H. G\"ollnitz and B. Gordon. In this article, we present a commutative algebra proof of the G\"ollnitz-Gordon-Andrews identities. More generally, we establish a family of identities, the special cases of which are the G\"ollnitz-Gordon-Andrews identities. In the proof, we relate the generating functions associated with these identities to the Hilbert-Poincar\'e series of suitably constructed graded algebras.</description>

      <title>Supports of Castelnuovo-Mumford polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Castelnuovo-Mumford polynomials are the maximal degree components of Grothendieck polynomials. The support of each Castelnuovo-Mumford polynomial is conjectured to be M-convex, i.e. the set of integer points of a generalized permutahedron (M\'esz\'aros and St. Dizier, 2020). This conjecture is known to hold in certain special cases but remains open in general. We define new families of permutations whose Castelnuovo-Mumford polynomials we show to have M-convex support. Specifically, we investigate which permutations have Castelnuovo-Mumford polynomials whose supports are the set of integer points in a schubitope.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for multivariate independence polynomials and their generalisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In statistical physics, the multivariate hard-core model describes a system of particles, each of which receives its own fugacity. In graph-theoretic language, the partition function of the model translates to the multivariate independence polynomial, i.e., the multiaffine generalisation of the independence polynomial, defined by $Z_G(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n) := \sum_{I\in\mathcal{I}(G)} \prod_{v\in I}\lambda_v$, where $\mathcal{I}(G)$ denotes the set of all independent sets in a graph $G$ on $[n]:=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$. We prove that for every simple graph $G$ on $[n]$ and $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n\geq 0$, \[
  Z_G(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n) \geq \prod_{i=1}^n (1+(d_i+1)\lambda_i)^{1/(d_i+1)}, \] where $d_1,\dots,d_n$ is the degree sequence of $G$. This generalises a result of Sah, Sawhney, Stoner, and Zhao, who proved the univariate case $\lambda_1=\dots=\lambda_n=\lambda$.
  We further conjecture that our inequality should generalise to other antiferromagnetic models and give some evidence in support of it. In particular, for $\lambda_i,\mu_i\geq 0$, $1\leq i\leq n$, we obtain a stronger inequality \[
  \sum_{\substack{I,J\in \mathcal{I}(G) \\ I\cap J=\emptyset}} \prod_{v\in I}\lambda_v\prod_{u\in J}\mu_u
  \geq \prod_{i=1}^n \left(1+(d_i+1)(\lambda_i+\mu_i)+d_i(d_i+1)\lambda_i\mu_i\right)^{1/(d_i+1)}, \] which proves our conjecture for a multiaffine generalisation of the semiproper colouring partition function with two proper colours.
  Our key technical steps for both theorems are obtained by using a custom mathematical research agent built on top of Gemini Deep Think, which can be seen as a benchmark demonstrating that the current state-of-the-art language models can, in part, assist with mathematical research.</description>

      <title>Zeros of Random Sections on Line Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sections of line bundles on 2 dimensional surfaces in 3 dimensional space can have many distinct shapes. For practical purposes we prefer smooth sections that are visibly easy to follow. This is why smoothing operators have been developed on discrete surfaces as in the inspirational paper "Globally Optimal Direction Fields" [Knoeppel et al. 2013] that can be applied to any section to return another smoother section. We are interested to make predictions on one aspect of the resulting smoothed section's structure, namely position of its signed zeros. The zeros are the most noticeable feature of a section where the section values circles around a specific point.
  The purpose of this thesis is to predict the distribution of the smoothed section's signed zeros with multiplicity that are given by applying the smoothing operator to randomly generated sections of hermitian line bundles on closed simplicial complexes. This will be done in a discrete setting consequently meaning that we will compute the expected sum of indices on each face. Why and how we do this is this thesis' purpose to explain.</description>

      <title>Mass formula for topological boundary conditions from TQFT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass formulas evaluate the total weighted count of a given class of algebraic structures, such as lattices or codes. We show that 3d TQFTs provide a generalization of this concept: the total weighted count of topological boundary conditions is given by the TQFT partition function averaged over all closed 3d manifolds. This weighted count, which we call the mass, can be interpreted as the renormalized partition function of TQFT gravity. For Abelian TQFTs, the mass formula for topological boundary conditions reduces to the mass formula for particular families of codes. Focusing on the Abelian case, we show how to evaluate the mass for any bosonic theory and consider many explicit examples. We then discuss the non-Abelian generalization and compute the mass for $n + \bar n$ copies of the Ising modular tensor category. Finally, we generalize the construction to five dimensions and compute the mass for Abelian 2-form Chern-Simons theories.</description>

      <title>Exact cospectrality probabilities for uniform random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the conjugation action of orthogonal matrices on symmetric random matrices. Given a fixed orthogonal matrix over an algebraic number field and a random matrix with entries sufficiently uniform in the ring of integers, we wonder what the probability is that the conjugate is again integral. Our main result establishes an exact formula for this probability in terms of the Smith ideals associated to the orthogonal matrix.
  As an illustrative application, we establish exact formulas for the expected number of rational orthogonal matrices that preserve the integrality of a random matrix for every fixed denominator in dimensions two and three. Notably, the dependence on the denominator turns out to be non-monotone due to number-theoretic fluctuations. We also prove bounds on the probability of rational cospectrality with bounded but arbitrarily large denominator.</description>

      <title>Non-Clashing Teaching in Graphs: Algorithms, Complexity, and Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kirkpatrick et al. [ALT 2019] and Fallat et al. [JMLR 2023] introduced non-clashing teaching and proved that it is the most efficient batch machine teaching model satisfying the collusion-avoidance benchmark established in the seminal work of Goldman and Mathias [COLT 1993]. Recently, (positive) non-clashing teaching was thoroughly studied for balls in graphs, yielding numerous algorithmic and combinatorial results. In particular, Chalopin et al. [COLT 2024] and Ganian et al. [ICLR 2025] gave an almost complete picture of the complexity landscape of the positive variant, showing that it is tractable only for restricted graph classes due to the non-trivial nature of the problem and concept class.
  In this work, we consider (positive) non-clashing teaching for closed neighborhoods in graphs. This concept class is not only extensively studied in various related contexts, but it also exhibits broad generality, as any finite binary concept class can be equivalently represented by a set of closed neighborhoods in a graph. In comparison to the works on balls in graphs, we provide improved algorithmic results, notably including FPT algorithms for more general classes of parameters, and we complement these results by deriving stronger lower bounds. Lastly, we obtain combinatorial upper bounds for wider classes of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relative homology group of an affine hyperplane arrangement and its Poincar\'e dual, the cohomology at finite distance of the complement. We give an Orlik--Solomon-type description of the latter, and identify it with the vector space of logarithmic forms having vanishing residues at infinity. To this end, we introduce a partial version of wonderful compactifications, which could be relevant in other contexts where blow-ups only occur at infinity. Finally, we show that the cohomology at finite distance coincides with the vector space of canonical forms in the sense of positive geometry.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this note is to explain the structure, general strategy, and main ideas of the proof in the work of Huang, McKenzie, and Yau (2024) on the Ramanujan property and edge universality of random regular graphs. The core of the argument is the derivation of self-consistent equations and a microscopic version of the loop equations for random $d$-regular graphs. We first recall the local law for random $d$-regular graphs, and then illustrate the main ideas behind the derivation of the self-consistent equations and the first loop equation.</description>

Abstract: Set partitions are arrangements of distinct objects into groups. The problem of listing all set partitions arises in a variety of settings, in particular in combinatorial optimization tasks. After a brief review, we give practical approximate formulas for determining the number of set partitions, both for small and large set sizes. Several algorithms for enumerating all set partitions are reviewed, and benchmarking tests were conducted. The algorithm of Djokic et al. is recommended for practical use.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for any $\mathbb{N}$-graded Gorenstein tiled order $A$, the stable category $\underline{\mathrm{CM}}^{\mathbb{Z}}A$ is triangle equivalent to the perfect derived category of the incidence algebra of a finite poset $\mathbb{V}_A^{op}$. Moreover, for a finite poset $P$, we prove that the incidence algebra of $P$ can be realized as the endomorphism algebra of a standard tilting object if and only if $P$ is either empty or has the maximum. We also study the behaviors of the corresponding poset under graded Morita equivalences and coverings of a Gorenstein tiled order. Finally, we classify Gorenstein tiled orders $A$ satisfying $|\mathbb{V}_A^{op}|\leq 3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In algebraic geometry, trigonal curves can always be embedded into Hirzebruch surfaces. In tropical geometry, the notion of trigonality does not have a unique translation. We focus on the characterization in terms of the existence of a degree 3 morphism to a line, and discuss relations to possible embeddings into $\mathbb R^2$ reflecting an embedding into a Hirzebruch surface. Our results can be divided into three parts: for tropical curves of low genus 3 and 4, we discuss the relation between a trigonal morphism and an embedding dual to the polygon of a Hirzebruch surface, building on works on embeddings of hyperelliptic tropical curves and curves of low genus. We compare obstructions for embeddings with obstructions for the existence of a degree 3 morphism to a line. Finally, we showcase examples where a non-smooth embedding can be unfolded to reflect certain features of a degree 3 morphism to a line.</description>

Abstract: Starting from a single solution of QYBE (or CYBE) we produce an infinite family of solutions of QYBE (or CYBE) parametrized by transitive arrays and, in particular, by signed permutations. We are especially interested in cases when such solutions yield quasi-triangular structures on direct powers of Lie bialgebras and tensor powers of Hopf algebras. We obtain infinite families of such structures as well and study the corresponding Poisson-Lie structures and co-quasi-triangular algebras.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we give explicit expressions about $q$-harmonic sums on $1-\cdots-1,A,1-\cdots-1$ indices. When $A=1$, many previous authors have studied and showed the identities, expressions, and properties. There are many results for explicit expressions about $q$-multiple zeta values or $q$-harmonic sums on $A-\cdots-A$ indices. Though there is the way to treat $q$-multiple zeta values unless the indices are the same, it has been successful to get the explicit expression of $q$-harmonic sums on $1-\cdots-1,A,1-\cdots-1$ indices when $A=2$. In this paper, we shall consider more general results when $A\ge 3$.</description>

Abstract: We say that a subset $M$ of $\mathbb R^n$ is exponentially Ramsey if there are $\epsilon&gt;0$ and $n_0$ such that $\chi(\mathbb R^n,M)\ge(1+\epsilon)^n$ for any $n&gt;n_0$, where $\chi(\mathbb R^n,M)$ stands for the minimum number of colors in a coloring of $\mathbb R^n$ such that no copy of $M$ is monochromatic. One important result in Euclidean Ramsey theory is due to Frankl and R\"odl, and states the following (under some mild extra conditions): if both $N_1$ and $N_2$ are exponentially Ramsey then so is $N_1\times N_2$. Applied several times to two-point sets, this result implies that any subset of a `hyperrectangle' is exponentially Ramsey.
  However, generally, such `embeddings' result in very inefficient bounds on the aforementioned $\epsilon$. In this paper, we present another way of combining exponentially Ramsey sets, which gives much better estimates in some important cases. In particular, we show that the chromatic number of $\mathbb R^n$ with a forbidden equilateral triangle satisfies $\chi(\mathbb R^n,\triangle)\ge\big(1.0742...+o(1)\big)^n$, greatly improving upon the previous constant $1.0144$. We also obtain similar strong results for regular simplices of larger dimensions, as well as for related geometric Ramsey-type questions in Manhattan norm.
  We then show that the same technique implies several interesting corollaries in other combinatorial problems. In particular, we give an explicit upper bound on the size of a family $\mathcal F\subset2^{[n]}$ that contains no weak $k$-sunflowers, i.e. no collection of $k$ sets with pairwise intersections of the same size. This bound improves upon previously known results for all $k\ge4$. Finally, we also present a simple deduction of the (other) celebrated Frankl--R\"odl theorem from an earlier result of Frankl and Wilson. It gives probably the shortest known proof of Frankl and R\"odl result with the most efficient bounds.</description>

Abstract: Fixed point theorems are ubiquitous in economic research. Many studies cite Smithson (1971) ``Fixed points of order preserving multifunctions,'' yet the original proof contains errors. This note presents a new, concise proof and explains why Smithson's argument is invalid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give new characterizations for the class of uniformly dense matroids and study applications of these characterizations to graphic and real representable matroids. We show that a matroid is uniformly dense if and only if its base polytope contains a point with constant coordinates. As a main application, we derive new spectral, structural and classification results for uniformly dense graphs. In particular, we show that connected regular uniformly dense graphs are $1$-tough and thus contain a (near-)perfect matching. As a second application, we show that strictly uniformly dense real represented matroids can be represented by projection matrices with a constant diagonal and that they are parametrized by a subvariety of the Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal projections and incidence bounds in planes over prime order fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime and let $E\subset \mathbb{F}_p^2$ with $|E|=p^a$, where $0&lt;a\le 1$. For a direction $V$ (a $1$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{F}_p^2$), let $\pi^V:\mathbb{F}_p^2\to \mathbb{F}_p^2/V$ denote the quotient map. We bound the size of the exceptional set of directions for which the projection $\pi^V(E)$ is small. More precisely, for $a/2\le s\le a$, define $$ T_s^{1,2}(E):=\{V\in G(1,\mathbb{F}_p^2):\ |\pi^V(E)|&lt;p^s\}. $$ We prove $$ |T_s^{1,2}(E)|\ll \min\{\,p^{\frac52 s-a},\ p^{6s-3a},\ p^s\,\}, $$ which improves the best previously known estimates over prime fields in the range $a/2\le s&lt;2a/3$, and yields the first substantial progress toward Chen's 2018 conjecture. The key new ingredient is a novel point-line incidence bound, of independent interest, that yields a power saving when the line set spans only moderately many distinct directions.
  In the reverse direction, we also obtain an incidence estimate for Cartesian products $A\times B$ with line families $\{y=ax+b:\ a,b\in C\}$ with explicit dependence on the additive energy $E^+(C)$. We also discuss connections to the sum-set problem and the distinct dot-product values conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01510v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a quasisymmetric analogue of the combinatorial theory of Schubert polynomials and the associated divided difference operators. Our counterparts are "forest polynomials", and a new family of linear operators, whose theory of compositions is governed by forests and the "Thompson monoid". Our approach extends naturally to $m$-colored quasisymmetric functions.
  We then give several applications of our theory to fundamental quasisymmetric functions, the study of quasisymmetric coinvariant rings and their associated harmonics, and positivity results for various expansions. In particular we resolve a conjecture of Aval-Bergeron-Li regarding quasisymmetric harmonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15555v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The independent set sequence of trees has been well studied, with much effort devoted to the (still open) question of Alavi, Malde, Schwenk and Erd\H{o}s on whether the independent set sequence of a tree is always unimodal.
  Much less attention has been given to the independent set sequence of hypertrees. Here we study some natural first questions in this realm. We show that the strong independent set sequences of linear hyperpaths and of linear hyperstars are unimodal (actually, log-concave). For uniform linear hyperpaths we obtain explicit expressions for the number of strong independent sets of each possible size, both via generating functions and via combinatorial arguments. We also consider the uniform linear hypercomb with $n$ edges on the spine, and show that its strong independent set sequence is unimodal except possibly for a portion of length $o(n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circular nim $CN(m, k)$ is a variant of nim, in which there are $m$ piles of tokens arranged in a circle and each player, in their turn, chooses at most $k$ consecutive piles in the circle and removes an arbitrary number of tokens from each pile. The player must remove at least one token in total. For some cases of $m$ and $k$, closed formulas to determine which player has a winning strategy have been found. Almost all cases are still open problems. In this paper, we consider a variant of circular nim, extended circular nim. In extended circular nim $ECN(m_S, k)$, there are $m$ piles of tokes arranged in a circle. $S$ is a set of positive integers less than or equal to half of $m$. In each turn, a player chooses an integer $s \in S$. Then the player selects at most $k$ piles among those located every $s$-th position on the circle, and removes an arbitrary number of tokens from each selected pile. We show some closed formulas to determine which player has a winning strategy for the cases where the number of piles is no more than eight, and for a few generalized cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new family of permutation group polynomials over finite fields of arbitrary characteristic, which are special types of bivariate local permutation polynomials. For this family, we explicitly construct their companion. We also determine the total number of permutation group polynomials of this form. Moreover, we resolve the problem of enumerating $e$-Klenian polynomials over finite fields for $e\geq 1$, a problem previously noted as nontrivial by Gutierrez and Urroz (2023). In addition, we provide the exact number of permutation group polynomials equivalent to our proposed permutation group polynomials, as well as the exact number of those permutation group polynomials equivalent to $e$-Klenian polynomials.</description>

      <title>Ideal Decomposition of Hyperplane Arrangements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an affine hyperplane arrangement, $L(\mathcal{A})$ its intersection poset, and $\chi_{\mathcal{A}}(t)$ its characteristic polynomial. This paper aims to propose combinatorial structures for the factorization of $\chi_{\mathcal{A}}(t)$. To this end, we introduce the notion of an ideal decomposition of $L(\mathcal{A})$ and use the M\"{o}bius algebra as a key tool to derive such a factorization. This concept provides a unified and substantial generalization of both the modular elements proposed by Stanley (1971) and the nice partitions proposed by Terao (1992). We also define modular ideals of $L(\mathcal{A})$, which yield a tensor decomposition of the Orlik-Solomon algebra of $\mathcal{A}$. We further show that every modular ideal can be realized as the intersection poset of some hyperplane arrangement.</description>

      <title>Packing subgraphs in regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An \emph{$H$-packing} in a graph $G$ is a collection of pairwise vertex-disjoint copies of $H$ in $G$. We prove that for every $c &gt; 0$ and every bipartite graph $H$, any $\lfloor cn \rfloor$-regular graph $G$ admits an $H$-packing that covers all but a constant number of vertices. This resolves a problem posed by K\"uhn and Osthus in 2005. Moreover, our result is essentially tight: the conclusion fails if $G$ is not both regular and sufficiently dense, it is in general not possible to guarantee covering all vertices of $G$ by an $H$-packing, and if $H$ is non-bipartite then $G$ need not contain any copies of $H$.
  We also prove that for all $c &gt; 0$, integers $t \geq 2$, and sufficiently large $n$, all the vertices of every $\lfloor cn \rfloor$-regular graph can be covered by vertex-disjoint subdivisions of $K_t$. This resolves another problem of K\"uhn and Osthus from 2005, which goes back to a conjecture of Verstra\"ete from 2002.
  Our proofs combine novel methods for balancing expanders and super-regular subgraphs with a number of powerful techniques including properties of robust expanders, regularity lemma, and blow-up lemma.</description>

      <title>A functional Loomis-Whitney type inequality in the Heisenberg group and projection theorems over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish functional Loomis--Whitney type inequalities in the finite Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n(\mathbb{F}_q)$. For $n=1$, we determine the sharp region of exponents $(u_1,u_2)$ for which the Heisenberg Loomis--Whitney inequality \[ \frac{1}{q^3}\sum_{(x,t)\in \mathbb{H}^1(\mathbb{F}_q)} f_1(\pi_1(x,t))\,f_2(\pi_2(x,t)) \;\lesssim\; \|f_1\|_{L^{u_1}(\mathbb{F}_q^2,dx)}\|f_2\|_{L^{u_2}(\mathbb{F}_q^2,dx)} \] holds uniformly in $q$, namely \[ \frac{1}{u_1}+\frac{2}{u_2}\le 2 \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{2}{u_1}+\frac{1}{u_2}\le 2, \] which includes the endpoint estimate $L^{\frac{3}{2}}\times L^{\frac{3}{2}}\to L^1$. For general $n$, we prove the symmetric multilinear estimate at the endpoint exponent $
u=\frac{n(2n+1)}{n+1}, $
using an induction on $n$ that exploits the Heisenberg fiber structure together with a multilinear interpolation scheme. Specializing to indicator functions yields a sharp Loomis--Whitney type set inequality bounding $|K|$ for every finite $K\subset \mathbb{H}^n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ in terms of the sizes of its $2n$ Heisenberg projections $\{\pi_j(K)\}_{j=1}^{2n}$, and in particular, \[ \max_{1\le j\le 2n} |\pi_j(K)| \;\gtrsim_n\; |K|^{\frac{2n+1}{2(n+1)}}\,q^{-\frac{1}{2(n+1)}}. \] This result is optimal up to absolute constants. Moreover, when $n=1$ and $|K|&gt;q$, we obtain a stronger statement via Vinh's point--line incidence theorem. We also discuss connections to a boundedness problem for multilinear forms/operators over finite fields studied by Bhowmik, Iosevich, Koh, and Pham (2025), and to orthogonal projection/covering questions in $\mathbb{F}_q^{2n+1}$ studied by Chen (2018).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characterization of the finite minimal automorphic posets of width three is still an open problem. Niederle has shown that this task can be reduced to the characterization of the nice sections of width three having a non-trivial tower of nice sections as retract. In our article, we characterize those of them which have a 4-crown stack as retract and we develop a recursive approach for their determination. We apply the approach on a sub-class $\mathfrak{N}_2$ of nice sections of width three and determine all posets in $\mathfrak{N}_2$ with height up to six having a 4-crown stack as retract. For each integer $n \geq 2$, the class $\mathfrak{N}_2$ contains $2^{n-2}$ different isomorphism types of posets of height $n$.</description>

      <title>Regular triangle unions with maximal number of sides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22584v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an integer n&gt;=1. Suppose, a simple polygon is a union of n triangles so that vertices along the common boundary are arranged cyclically. What is the maximal number of sides such union - call it regular - can have? This is a sequence A375986, a recent entry into the OEIS. In this paper we prove that the sequence starts as 3, 12, 22, 33, 45, 56, 67, 80, 91, and satisfies simple linear lower and upper bounds. The latter is not only a bound, but in fact is realizable combinatorially. The questions whether it can be realized in pseudoline geometry, and, if so, whether such constructions are stretchable, are the next natural ones to pose. The paper is mostly expository and written in an informal style. However, it adds a new tool in investigating unions of objects; namely, triangulation shifts.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the higher Steklov eigenvalues of graphs on surfaces.
  We obtain the upper bound of higher Steklov eigenvalues of a finite graph $G$ with boundary $B$ and genus $g$ by using metrical deformation via probability flows.
  Our result can be regarded as a discrete analogue of Karpukhin's bound in spectral geometry.
  Moreover, this result implies the upper bound of higher Laplacian eigenvalues given by Kelner, Lee, Price and Teng (Geom. Funct. Anal., 2011).</description>

Abstract: Whereas Steiner systems $S(2,k,v)$ with block length $k \le 5$ have large amount of examples and the existence is established for all admissible $v$, for $k\ge 6$ only few examples are known even for decided cases. In this paper the existence of $S(2,9,369)$ is established and some new examples for other admissible pairs $(k,v)$ are given. In particular, lots of new unitals of order $6$ (or $S(2,7,217)$) together with $S(2,7,175)$, $S(2,7,259)$, $S(2,8,120)$, $S(2,8,504)$, $S(2,9,513)$ are presented. Found examples suggest two conjectures on infinite series of designs.</description>

Abstract: The famous pancake theorem states that for every finite set $X$ in the plane, there exist two orthogonal lines that divide $X$ into four equal parts. We propose an algorithm whose running time is linear in the number of points in $X$ and prove that this complexity is optimal. We also consider generalizations of the pancake theorem and show that orthogonal hyperplanes can be found in polynomial time.</description>

Abstract: A theory of matchings for finite subsets of an abelian group, introduced in connection with a conjecture of Wakeford on canonical forms for homogeneous polynomials, has since been extended to the setting of field extensions and to that of matroids. Earlier approaches have produced numerous criteria for matchability and unmatchability, but have offered little structural insight. In this paper, we develop parallel structure theorems which characterize unmatchable pairs in both abelian groups and field extensions. Our framework reveals analogous obstructions to matchability: nearly periodic decompositions of sets in the group setting correspond to decompositions of subspaces involving translates of a subfield in the linear setting. This perspective not only recovers previously known results through short proofs, but also leads to new matching criteria and guarantees the existence of nontrivial unmatchable pairs.</description>

      <title>Some lemmas on spectral radius of graphs: including an application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, the spectral radius $\rho(G)$ of $G$ is the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. In this paper, we give three lammas on $\rho(G)$ when $G$ contains a spanning complete bipartite graph. Using these lemmas and typical spectral method, we characterized the unique extremal graph with the maximum spectral radius among all planar graphs of large order $n$ without a cycle of length $\ell$, where $5\leq \ell\leq n$.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial proofs of some identities on overpartitions with repeated smallest non-overlined part</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\overline{\mathrm{spt}}k(n)$ denote the number of overpartitions of $n$ where the smallest non-overlined part, say $s(\pi)$, appears $k$ times and every overlined part is bigger than $s(\pi)$. Let $\overline{\mathrm{spt}}k_o(n)$ denote the number of overpartitions of $n$ where the smallest non-overlined part appears $k$ times, every overlined part is bigger than $s(\pi)$ and all parts other than $s(\pi)$ are incongruent modulo $2$ with $s(\pi)$. Also, let $b_e(k,n)$ (resp., $b_o(k,n)$) denote the number of overpartitions of $n$ counted by $\overline{\mathrm{spt}}k_o(n)$ where the number of parts greater than $s(\pi)$ is even (resp., odd), and let $$\overline{\mathrm{spt}}k_o'(n)=b_e(k,n)-b_o(k,n).$$ Recently, Malik and Sarma (arXiv:2601.15601v1) expressed the generating functions of these partition functions in terms of linear combinations of $q$-series with polynomials in $q$ as coefficients. As corollaries, they derived some partition identities involving the functions for $k=1$ and sought for combinatorial proofs of their results. In this paper, we present some desired proofs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new cryptomorphic definition of orthogonal matroids with coefficients using Grassmann--Pl\"ucker functions. The equivalence is motivated by Cayley's identities expressing principal and almost-principal minors of a skew-symmetric matrix in terms of its Pfaffians. As a corollary of the new cryptomorphism, we deduce that each component of the orthogonal Grassmannian is parameterized by certain part of the Pl\"ucker coordinates.</description>

      <title>Eulerian-type polynomials over matchings and matching permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Claesson and Linusson [Proc. Am. Math. Soc., 139 (2011), 435-449] observed that there are n! matchings on [2n] with no left-nestings. Inspired by this result, this paper is devoted to exploring a deeper connection between matchings and permutations. We first discover that a quadruple statistic over matchings corresponds to the well known quadruple statistic (exc,drop,fix,cyc) over permutations, where exc, drop, fix and cyc are the excedance, drop, fixed point and cycle statistics, respectively. By introducing matching permutations, we provide a symmetric expansion of a five-variable neighbor polynomial of matchings, which encodes a great deal of neighbor information. As an application, we discover the e-positivity of NCA-polynomials, which implies that the left-nesting number, the left-crossing number and the neighbor alignment number are distributed symmetrically over all matchings on [2n]. We also establish the relationship between the five-variable neighbor polynomials and the trivariate second-order Eulerian polynomials, which generalizes the related results of Claesson and Linusson, Cameron and Killpatrick as well as Chen and Fu.</description>

      <title>Intersection statistics for antichains in minuscule posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite poset $P$, we study the expected size of the intersection of two independent uniformly random antichains. Equivalently, we evaluate the sum of $|A\cap A'|$ over all ordered pairs of antichains. For general posets this statistic appears to have little structure, but for the classical minuscule posets with uniform combinatorial models it admits closed-form expressions. Though the proofs are elementary and combinatorial, the resulting formulas admit a natural interpretation in terms of weight diagrams of minuscule representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For certain pairs of unimodal maps on the interval with periodic critical orbits, it is known that one can combine them to create another map whose entropy is close to one while the poles of Artin-Mazur $\zeta$ function outside the unit circles can be made close to the other. We provided a formulation and proof of this result in symbolic dynamics setting, which allow us to generalize this fact to certain families of maps on finite trees.</description>

      <title>Fringe trees of Patricia tries, compressed binary search trees, and three other random full binary trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01239v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution of fringe trees in Patricia tries (extending earlier results by Ischebeck (2025)) and compressed binary search trees; both cases are random binary trees that have been compressed by deleting nodes of outdegree 1 so that they are random full binary trees. The main results are central limit theorems for the number of fringe trees of a given type, which imply quenched and annealed limit results for the fringe tree distribution; for Patricia tries, this is complicated by periodic oscillations in the usual manner. We also consider extended fringe trees. The results are derived from earlier results for uncompressed tries and binary search trees. In the case of compressed binary search trees, it seems difficult to give a closed formula for the asymptotic fringe tree distribution, but we provide a recursion and give examples.
  For comparison, we give also results, simpler and partly known, for three other models of random full binary trees: the extended binary search tree, the critical beta-spltting random tree, and the uniform random full binary tree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study certain orientation-preserving involutions on three-dimensional small covers. We prove that the quotient space of an orientable three-dimensional small cover by such an involution in $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ is homeomorphic to a connected sum of copies of $S^2 \times S^1$. If this quotient space is a 3-sphere, then the corresponding small cover is a two-fold branched covering of the 3-sphere along a link. We provide a description of this link in terms of the polytope and the characteristic function.</description>

      <title>Optimal Hardness of Online Algorithms for Large Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic problem of finding a large independent set in the Erd{\"o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $G(n,p)$. For constant $p$ and $b=1/(1-p)$, the largest independent set has size $2\log_b n$, while a simple greedy algorithm - revealing vertices sequentially and making decisions based only on previously seen vertices - finds an independent set of size $\log_b n$. In his seminal 1976 paper, Karp challenged to either improve this guarantee or establish its hardness. Decades later, this problem remains open - one of the most prominent algorithmic problems in the theory of random graphs.
  In this paper, we establish that a broad class of online algorithms fails to find an independent set of size $(1+\epsilon)\log_b n$ whp. This class includes Karp's algorithm as a special case, and extends it by allowing the algorithm to query exceptional edges, not yet "seen" by the algorithm. Our lower bound holds for $p\in [d/n,1-n^{-1/d}]$. In the dense regime (constant $p$), we also prove that our result is asymptotically tight with respect to the number of exceptional edges queried, by designing an online algorithm which beats the half-optimality threshold when the number of exceptional edges slightly exceeds our bound.
  Our result provides evidence for the algorithmic hardness of Karp's problem, by supporting the conjectured optimality of the greedy algorithm and establishing it within the class of online algorithms. Our proof relies on a refined analysis of the geometric structure of large independent sets, establishing a variant of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP). While OGP has predominantly served as a barrier to stable algorithms, online algorithms are inherently unstable, necessitating new ideas. Our proof refines the OGP framework by incorporating several new ideas (including temporal interpolation paths and stopping-times) that we expect to be useful for other online models.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations for the d'Arcais Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The d'Arcais polynomials $P_n(z)$ for $n\in\{0,1,\dots\}$ are defined as $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} P_n(z) q^n = \exp(-z\ln((q;q)_{\infty}))$ where the $q$-Pochhammer symbol is $(q;q)_{\infty} = \prod_{k=1}^{\infty} (1-q^k)$ for $|q|&lt;1$. Denoting the coefficients for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ by the formula $P_n(z) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} A(2,n,k) z^k/n!$, we prove that $k_n! A(2,n,k_n)/n!$ satisfies a Bahadur-Rao type large deviation formula in the limit $n \to \infty$ with $k_n/n \to \kappa \in [0,1)$ as long as $k_n \to \infty$. The large deviation rate function is the Legendre-Fenchel transform $g^*(-\kappa)$ where $g(\kappa) = f^{-1}(\kappa)$ for the function $f : (0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $f(y)= \ln(-\ln((e^{-y};e^{-y})_{\infty}))$. We relate this fact to information about the abundancy index.</description>

      <title>Semi-Autonomous Mathematics Discovery with Gemini: A Case Study on the Erd\H{o}s Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a case study in semi-autonomous mathematics discovery, using Gemini to systematically evaluate 700 conjectures labeled 'Open' in Bloom's Erd\H{o}s Problems database. We employ a hybrid methodology: AI-driven natural language verification to narrow the search space, followed by human expert evaluation to gauge correctness and novelty. We address 13 problems that were marked 'Open' in the database: 5 through seemingly novel autonomous solutions, and 8 through identification of previous solutions in the existing literature. Our findings suggest that the 'Open' status of the problems was through obscurity rather than difficulty. We also identify and discuss issues arising in applying AI to math conjectures at scale, highlighting the difficulty of literature identification and the risk of ''subconscious plagiarism'' by AI. We reflect on the takeaways from AI-assisted efforts on the Erd\H{o}s Problems.</description>
