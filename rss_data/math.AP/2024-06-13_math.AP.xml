      <title>Shape optimization problems involving nonlocal and nonlinear operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we investigate a general shape optimization problem in which the state equation is expressed using a nonlocal and nonlinear operator. We prove the existence of a minimum point for a functional $F$ defined on the family of all 'quasi-open' subsets of a bounded open set $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. This is ensured under the condition that $F$ demonstrates decreasing behavior concerning set inclusion and is lower semicontinuous with respect to a suitable topology associated with the fractional $p$-Laplacian under Dirichlet boundary conditions. Moreover, we study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions when $s\to1$ and extend this result to the anisotropic case.</description>

      <title>Operational Calculus for the 1st Level General Fractional Derivatives and its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1st level General Fractional Derivatives (GFDs) combine in one definition the GFDs of the Riemann-Liouville type and the regularized GFDs (or the GFDs of the Caputo type) that have been recently introduced and actively studied in the Fractional Calculus literature. In this paper, we first construct an operational calculus of Mikusi\'nski type for the 1st level GFDs. In particular, it includes the operational calculi for the GFDs of the Riemann-Liouville type and for the regularized GFDs as its particular cases. In the second part of the paper, this calculus is applied for derivation of the closed form solution formulas to the initial-value problems for the linear fractional differential equations with the 1st level GFDs.</description>

      <title>Finite Time Blowup of Integer- and Fractional-Order Time-Delayed Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, exact solutions are derived for an integer- and fractional-order time-delayed diffusion equation with arbitrary initial conditions. The solutions are obtained using Fourier transform methods in conjunction with the known properties of delay functions. It is observed that the solutions do not exhibit infinite speed of propagation for smooth initial conditions that are bounded and positive. Sufficient conditions on the initial condition are also established such that the finite time blowup of the solutions can be explicitly calculated. Examples are provided that highlight the contrasting behaviours of these exact solutions with the known dynamics of solutions to the standard diffusion equation.</description>

      <title>H\"{o}lder Continuity for Fully Fractional Parabolic Equations with Space-time Nonlocal Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local H\"{o}lder regularity of weak solutions to the fully fractional parabolic equations involving spatial fractional diffusion and fractional time derivatives of the Marchaud type. It is worth noting that we do not impose boundedness assumptions on the weak solutions and nonhomogeneous terms. Within the space-time nonlocal framework, it is crucial to consider both space-dependent nonlocal tail terms and the first introduced time-dependent nonlocal tail term. By adapting a nonlocal variant of the parabolic De Giorgi iterative technique, we initially establish a priori local boundedness with tail terms for weak solutions and then prove the local H\"{o}lder continuity.</description>

      <title>Two-component system modelling shallow-water waves with constant vorticity under the Camassa-Holm scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the derivation of a two-component system modelling shallow-water waves with constant vorticity under the Camassa-Holm scaling from our newly established Green-Naghdi equations with a linear shear. It is worth pointing out that the $\rho$ component in this new system is quite different from the previous two-component system due to the effects of both vorticity and larger amplitude. We then establish the local well-posedness of this new system in Besov spaces, and present a blow-up criterion. We finally give a sufficient condition for global strong solutions to the system in some special case.</description>

Abstract: We study an elliptic differential equation set in two habitats under semi-permeability conditions at the interface. This equation describes some dispersal process in population dynamics. Using functional calculus and results in Lutz Weis [22] among others, we show that the associated space operator generates an analytic semigroup in Lp-spaces.</description>

      <title>Potential systems with singular $\Phi$-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with solvability of the boundary value problem $$-\left[ \phi(u^{\prime}) \right] ^{\prime}=\nabla_u F(t,u), \quad \left ( \phi \left( u^{\prime }\right)(0), -\phi \left( u^{\prime }\right)(T)\right )\in \partial j(u(0), u(T)),$$ where $\phi$ is a homeomorphism from $B_a$ -- the open ball of radius $a$ centered at $0_{\mathbb{R}^N},$ onto $\mathbb{R}^N$, satisfying $\phi(0_{\mathbb{R}^N})=0_{\mathbb{R}^N}$, $\phi =\nabla \Phi$, with $\Phi: \overline{B}_a \to (-\infty, 0]$ of class $C^1$ on $B_a$, continuous and strictly convex on $\overline{B}_a.$ The potential $F:[0,T] \times \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$ is of class $C^1$ with respect to the second variable and $j:\mathbb{R}^N \times \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow (-\infty, +\infty]$ is proper, convex and lower semicontinuous. We first provide a variational formulation in the frame of critical point theory for convex, lower semicontinuous perturbations of $C^1$-functionals. Then, taking the advantage of this key step, we obtain existence of minimum energy as well as saddle-point solutions of the problem. Some concrete illustrative examples of applications are provided.</description>

      <title>Analytic smoothing effect of the Cauchy problem for a class of ultra-parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of strongly degenerate ultraparabolic equations with analytic coefficients. We demonstrate that the Cauchy problem exhibits an analytic smoothing effect. This means that, with an initial datum belonging to the Sobolev space $H^s$ (of real index s), the associated Cauchy problem admits a unique solution that is analytic in all spatial variables for any strictly positive time. This smoothing effect property is similar to that of the Cauchy problem for uniformly parabolic equations with analytic coefficients.</description>

      <title>Lie Symmetry Net: Preserving Conservation Laws in Modelling Financial Market Dynamics via Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper employs a novel Lie symmetry-based framework to model the intrinsic symmetries within financial market. Specifically, we introduce {\it Lie symmetry net} (LSN), which characterises the Lie symmetry of the differential equations (DE) estimating financial market dynamics, such as the Black-Scholes equation and the Va\v{s}i\v{c}ek equation. To simulate these differential equations in a symmetry-aware manner, LSN incorporates a Lie symmetry risk derived from the conservation laws associated with the Lie symmetry operators of the target differential equations. This risk measures how well the Lie symmetry is realised and guides the training of LSN under the structural risk minimisation framework. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that LSN effectively realises the Lie symmetry and achieves an error reduction of more than {\it one order of magnitude} compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/Jxl163/LSN_code}{https://github.com/Jxl163/LSN$\_$code}.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and regularity of solutions to neural field problems with dendritic processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study solutions to a recently proposed neural field model in which dendrites are modelled as a continuum of vertical fibres stemming from a somatic layer. Since voltage propagates along the dendritic direction via a cable equation with nonlocal sources, the model features an anisotropic diffusion operator, as well as an integral term for synaptic coupling. The corresponding Cauchy problem is thus markedly different from classical neural field equations. We prove that the weak formulation of the problem admits a unique solution, with embedding estimates similar to the ones of nonlinear local reaction-diffusion equations. Our analysis relies on perturbing weak solutions to the diffusion-less problem, that is, a standard neural field, for which weak problems have not been studied to date. We find rigorous asymptotic estimates for the problem with and without diffusion, and prove that the solutions of the two models stay close, in a suitable norm, on finite time intervals. We provide numerical evidence of our perturbative results.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of aggregation-diffusion systems with irregular kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider aggregation-diffusion equations with merely bounded nonlocal interaction potential $K$. We are interested in establishing their well-posedness theory when the nonlocal interaction potential $K$ is neither differentiable nor positive (semi-)definite, thus preventing application of classical arguments. We prove the existence of weak solutions in two cases: if the mass of the initial data is sufficiently small, or if the interaction potential is symmetric and of bounded variation without any smallness assumption. The latter allows one to exploit the dissipation of the free energy in an optimal way, which is an entirely new approach. Remarkably, in both cases, under the additional condition that $\nabla K\ast K$ is in $L^2$, we can prove that the solution is smooth and unique. When $K$ is a characteristic function of a ball, we construct the classical unique solution. Under additional structural conditions we extend these results to the $n$-species system.</description>

      <title>Global smooth solutions by transport noise of 3D Navier-Stokes equations with small hyperviscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of global smooth solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) with hyperviscosity $(-\Delta)^{\gamma}$ is open unless $\gamma $ is close to the J.-L. Lions exponent $ \frac{5}{4}$ at which the energy balance is strong enough to prevent singularity formation. If $1&lt;\gamma \ll \frac{5}{4}$, then the global well-posedness of the hyperviscous NSEs is widely open as for the usual NSEs. In this paper, for all $\gamma&gt;1$, we show the existence of a transport noise for which global smooth solutions to the stochastic hyperviscous NSEs on the three-dimensional torus exist with high probability. In particular, a suitable transport noise considerably improves the known well-posedness results in the deterministic setting.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we extend the example constructed in the paper by Sormani-Tian-Wang to build new examples that satisfy the assumptions of the conjecture by Gromov. Each of these new examples of sequence converges to a limit space with infinitely many poles in $\mathbb{S}^2$.

      <title>Uniform Large Deviation Principles of Fractional Reaction-Diffusion Equations Driven by Superlinear Multiplicative Noise on R^n</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the uniform large deviation principle of the fractional stochastic reaction-diffusion equation on the entire space R^n as the noise intensity approaches zero. The nonlinear drift term is dissipative and has a polynomial growth of any order. The nonlinear diffusion term is locally Lipschitz continuous and has a superlinear growth rate. By the weak convergence method, we establish the Freidlin-Wentzell uniform large deviations over bounded initial data as well as the Dembo-Zeitouni uniform large deviations over compact initial data. The main difficulties are caused by the superlinear growth of noise coefficients and the non-compactness of Sobolev embeddings on unbounded domains. The dissipativeness of the drift term and the idea of uniform tail-ends estimates of solutions are employed to circumvent these difficulties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of small solitary waves for one-dimensional lattices of particles that each repel every other particle with a force that decays as a power of distance. For force exponents $\alpha+1$ with $\frac43&lt;\alpha&lt;3$, we employ fixed-point arguments to find near-sonic solitary waves having scaled velocity profiles close to non-degenerate solitary-wave profiles of fractional KdV or generalized Benjamin-Ono equations. These equations were recently found to approximately govern unidirectional long-wave motions in these lattices.</description>

      <title>A general nonlinear characterization of stochastic incompleteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic incompleteness of a Riemannian manifold $M$ amounts to the nonconservation of probability for the heat semigroup on $M$. We show that this property is equivalent to the existence of nonnegative, nontrivial, bounded (sub)solutions to $\Delta W=\psi(W)$ for one, hence all, general nonlinearity $\psi$ which is only required to be continuous, nondecreasing, with $\psi(0)=0$ and $\psi&gt;0$ in $(0,+\infty)$. Similar statements hold for unsigned (sub)solutions. We also prove that stochastic incompleteness is equivalent to the nonuniqueness of bounded solutions to the nonlinear parabolic equation $\partial_t u =\Delta\phi(u)$ with bounded initial data for one, hence all, general nonlinearity $\phi$ which is only required to be continuous, nondecreasing and nonconstant. Such a generality allows us to deal with equations of both fast-diffusion and porous-medium type, as well as with the one-phase and two-phase classical Stefan problems, which seem to have never been investigated in the manifold setting.</description>

Abstract: We study a new flocking model which has the versatility to capture the physically realistic qualitative behavior of the Motsch-Tadmor model, while also retaining the entropy law, which lends to a similar 1D global well-posedness analysis to the Cucker-Smale model. This is an improvement to the situation in the Cucker-Smale case, which may display the physically unrealistic behavior that large flocks overpower the dynamics of small, far away flocks; and it is an improvement in the situation in the Motsch-Tadmor case, where 1D global well-posedness is not known. The new model was proposed in arXiv:2211.00117v3 and has a similar structure to the Cucker-Smale and Motsch-Tadmor hydrodynamic systems, but with a new feature: the communication strength is not fixed, but evolves in time according to its own transport equation along the Favre-filtered velocity field. This transport of the communication strength is precisely what preserves the entropy law. A variety of phenomenological behavior can be obtained from various choices of the initial communication strength, including the aforementioned Motsch-Tadmor-like behavior. We develop the general well-posedness theory for the new model and study the long time behavior -- including alignment, strong flocking in 1D, and entropy estimates to estimate the distribution of the limiting flock, all of which extend the classical results of the Cucker-Smale case. In addition, we provide numerical evidence to show the similar qualitative behavior</description>

      <title>Gradient Bounds and Liouville theorems for Quasi-linear equations on compact Manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we establish a gradient bound and Liouville-type theorems for solutions to Quasi-linear elliptic equations on compact Riemannian Manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Also, we provide a local splitting theorem when the inequality in the gradient bound becomes equality at some point. Moreover, we prove a Harnack-type inequality and an ABP estimate for the gradient of solutions in domains contained in the manifold.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Chemotactic Singularity via Viscous Flow with Large Buoyancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes equation with low Reynolds number and subject to large buoyancy force. We show that for initial cell density with arbitrarily large mass (i.e. the $L^1$ norm), the solution remains regular for all times in the regime of sufficiently large buoyancy and viscosity. The major blowup suppression mechanism is a norm-stabilizing property possessed by a ``static problem,'' where the full problem can be seen as a perturbation of this quasi-stationary model.</description>

      <title>The obstacle scattering for the biharmonic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the obstacle scattering problem for biharmonic equations with a Dirichlet boundary condition in both two and three dimensions. Some basic properties are first derived for the biharmonic scattering solutions, which leads to a simple criterion for the uniqueness of the direct problem. Then a new type far-field pattern is introduced, where the correspondence between the far-field pattern and scattered field is established. Based on these properties, we prove the well-posedness of the direct problem in associated function spaces by utilizing the boundary integral equation method, which relys on a natural decomposition of the biharmonic operator and the theory of the pseudodifferential operator. Furthermore, the inverse problem for determining the obstacle is studied. By establishing some novel reciprocity relations between the far-field pattern and scattered field, we show that the obstacle can be uniquely recovered from the measurements at a fixed frequency.</description>

      <title>Squeezing a fixed amount of gravitational energy to arbitrarily small scales, in $U(1)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove uniform finite-time existence of solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations in polarized U(1) symmetry which have uniformly positive incoming $H^1$ energy supported on an arbitrarily small set in the 2 + 1 spacetime obtained by quotienting by the U(1) symmetry. We also construct a subclass of solutions for which the energy remains concentrated (along a U(1) family of geodesics) throughout its evolution. These results rely on three innovations: a direct treatment of the 2 + 1 Einstein equations in a null geodesic gauge, a novel parabolic scaling of the Einstein equations in this gauge, and a new Klainerman-Sobolev inequality on rectangular strips.</description>

      <title>Random models for singular SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a proof of the convergence of the BHZ renormalized model associated with the generalized (KPZ) equation that does not require the full strength of the BPHZ renormalisation. Our approach is based on a convenient form of chaos decomposition. The other key ingredient is a generalisation of the Hairer-Quastel convergence theorem for Feynman diagrams with certain decorations encoding Taylor remainders. With these ideas we are able to construct the model for the generalised KPZ equation.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of infinite dimensional dissipative Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral theory for operator pencils and operator differential-algebraic equations is studied. Special focus is laid on singular operator pencils and three different concepts of singular operator pencils are introduced. The concepts are analyzed in detail and examples are presented that illustrate the subtle differences. It is investigated how these concepts are related to uniqueness of the underlying algebraic-differential operator equation, showing that, in general, classical results known from the finite dimensional case of matrix pencils and differential-algebraic equations do not prevail. The results are then studied in the setting of structured operator pencils arising in dissipative differential-algebraic equations. Here, unlike in the general infinite-dimensional case, the uniqueness of solutions is closely related to the singularity of the pencil.</description>
