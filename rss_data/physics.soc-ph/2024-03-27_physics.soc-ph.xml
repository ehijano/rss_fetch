      <title>Constant-selection evolutionary dynamics on weighted networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population structure often impacts evolutionary dynamics. In constant-selection evolutionary dynamics between two types, amplifiers of selection are networks that promote the fitter mutant to take over the entire population, and suppressors of selection do the opposite. It has been shown that most undirected and unweighted networks are amplifiers of selection under a common updating rule and initial condition. Here, we extensively investigate how edge weights influence selection on undirected networks. We show that random edge weights make small networks less amplifying than the corresponding unweighted networks in a majority of cases and also make them suppressors of selection (i.e., less amplifying than the complete graph, or equivalently, the Moran process) in many cases. Qualitatively, the same result holds true for larger empirical networks. These results suggest that amplifiers of selection are not as common for weighted networks as for unweighted counterparts.</description>

      <title>Use of Euler's theorem in the elucidation of economic concepts in goods exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a plausible assumption about the Total Revenue concept, a system of economic agents, that simulates the exchange of goods, is studied. Following a methodology equivalent to that used in the statistical-mechanical determination of the distribution of energies in a physical system, it is shown that the price of the exchanged goods arises naturally, as well as the well-known ``Law of demand". It is also shown that by using Euler's Theorem of homogeneous functions, the conditions emerge for the appearance of wholesale and retail prices. We found also that the Total Revenue is the product of two factors: the configurational entropy and a "free energy" type one. We study numerically the case in which the exchanged good is money itself, in systems in which economic agents have a "roof" on the amount of money they can possess. It is shown numerically that the increase in the quantity of money in the hands of the agents necessarily leads to its depreciation, and only the expansion of the economy, understood here as raising the "roof", minimizes this loss of purchasing power. The concept of indexing is discussed.</description>

      <title>$(\omega_1, \omega_2)$-Temporal random hyperbolic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a recent model of temporal random hyperbolic graphs by allowing connections and disconnections to persist across network snapshots with different probabilities, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$. This extension, while conceptually simple, poses analytical challenges involving the Appell $F_1$ series. Despite these challenges, we are able to analyze key properties of the model, which include the distributions of contact and intercontact durations, as well as the expected time-aggregated degree. The incorporation of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ enables more flexible tuning of the average contact and intercontact durations, and of the average time-aggregated degree, providing a finer control for exploring the effect of temporal network dynamics on epidemic processes. Overall, our results provide new insights into the analysis of temporal networks and contribute to a more general representation of real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Distance-Based Hierarchical Cutting of Complex Networks with Non-Preferential and Preferential Choice of Seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs and complex networks can be successively separated into connected components associated to respective seed nodes, therefore establishing a respective hierarchical organization. In the present work, we study the properties of the hierarchical structure implied by distance-based cutting of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, Barab\'asi-Albert, and a specific geometric network. Two main situations are considered regarding the choice of the seeds: non-preferential and preferential to the respective node degree. Among the obtained findings, we have the tendency of geometrical networks yielding more balanced pairs of connected components along the network progressive separation, presenting little chaining effects, followed by the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and Barab\'asi-Albert types of networks. The choice of seeds preferential to the node degree tended to enhance the balance of the connected components in the case of the geometrical networks.</description>

      <title>A severe local flood and social events show a similar impact on human mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While a social event, such as a concert or a food festival, is a common experience to people, a natural disaster is experienced by a fewer individuals. The ordinary and common ground experience of social events could be therefore used to better understand the complex impacts of uncommon, but devastating natural events on society, such as floods. Based on this idea, we present a comparison - in terms of human mobility -, between an extreme local flood that occurred in 2017 in Switzerland, and social events which took place in the same region, in the weeks before and after the inundation. Using mobile phone location data, we show that the severe local flood and social events have a similar impact on human mobility, both at the national scale and at a local scale. At the national level, we found a small difference between the distributions of visitors and their travelled distances among the several weeks in which the events took place. At the local level, instead, we detected the anomalies (in time series) in the number of people travelling each road and railway, and we found that the distributions of anomalies, and of their clusters, are comparable between the flood and the social events. Hence, our findings suggest that the knowledge on ubiquitous social events can be employed to characterise the impacts of rare natural disasters on human mobility. The proposed methods at the local level can thus be used to analyse the disturbances in complex spatial networks and, in general, as complementary approaches for the analyses of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Decoding excellence: Mapping the demand for psychological traits of operations and supply chain professionals through text mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current study proposes an innovative methodology for the profiling of psychological traits of Operations Management (OM) and Supply Chain Management (SCM) professionals. We use innovative methods and tools of text mining and social network analysis to map the demand for relevant skills from a set of job descriptions, with a focus on psychological characteristics. The proposed approach aims to evaluate the market demand for specific traits by combining relevant psychological constructs, text mining techniques, and an innovative measure, namely, the Semantic Brand Score. We apply the proposed methodology to a dataset of job descriptions for OM and SCM professionals, with the objective of providing a mapping of their relevant required skills, including psychological characteristics. In addition, the analysis is then detailed by considering the region of the organization that issues the job description, its organizational size, and the seniority level of the open position in order to understand their nuances. Finally, topic modeling is used to examine key components and their relative significance in job descriptions. By employing a novel methodology and considering contextual factors, we provide an innovative understanding of the attitudinal traits that differentiate professionals. This research contributes to talent management, recruitment practices, and professional development initiatives, since it provides new figures and perspectives to improve the effectiveness and success of Operations Management and Supply Chain Management professionals.</description>

      <title>Phase transition and universality in the majority-rule model with social noises on various network topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the impact of social noise, characterized by either independence or anticonformity, on order-disorder phase transitions within the majority-rule model framework. The study spans diverse network topologies, including the complete graph, two-dimensional (2-D) square lattice, three-dimensional (3-D) square lattice, and heterogeneous networks such as Watts-Strogatz, Barab\'asi-Albert, and Erd\H{o}s-Renyi networks. The social noise is represented by the fundamental parameter $p$, denoting the likelihood of agents displaying independent or anticonformist tendencies. The nature of the phase transitions observed depends on both the probability parameter $p$ and the network topologies. Specifically, the models show continuous phase transitions on the complete graph and the 2-D square lattice, with critical points subject to parameter variations. However, in the 3-D lattice, models featuring independence noise notably lack a distinct phase transition, whereas those with anticonformity noise still exhibit continuous phase transitions. Through finite-size scaling analysis and critical exponents evaluation, we confirm that all models align with the Ising model universality class, except in the 3-D model.</description>

      <title>Firm-level supply chains to minimize decarbonization unemployment and economic losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urgently needed carbon emission reductions might lead to strict command-and-control decarbonization strategies with potentially negative economic consequences. Analyzing the entire firm-level production network of a European economy, we explore how the worst outcomes of such approaches can be avoided. We compare the systemic relevance of every firm with its annual CO2 emissions to identify optimal emission-reducing strategies with a minimum of additional unemployment and economic losses. Setting specific reduction targets we study various decarbonization scenarios and quantify their economic consequences. We show that for an emission-reduction of 20% the most effective strategy leads to losses of about 2% of jobs and 2% of economic output. In contrast, a naive scenario targeting largest emitters first, results in 28% job losses and 33% output reduction for the same target. This demonstrates that it is possible to use firm-level production networks to design highly effective decarbonization strategies that practically preserve employment and economic output.</description>

      <title>Consensus formation in quality-sensitive interdependent agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of a collective decision-making model inspired by honeybee behavior. This model integrates individual exploration for option discovery and social interactions for information sharing, while also considering option qualities. Our assessment of the decision process outcome employs standard consensus metrics and investigates its correlation with convergence time, revealing common trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Furthermore, we investigate fluctuations arising from finite-size effects. In scenarios with strong interdependence, we identify an absorbing phase transition and scrutinize its key features, including critical fluctuations in finite spatial systems. We find that fluctuations play a significant role in the collective decision-making process, particularly when options have similar qualities. Our findings are especially relevant for finite adaptive systems, as they provide insights into navigating decision-making scenarios with similar options more effectively. Finally, we show that this model also fulfills Weber's Law of perception, aligning with previous analyses of collective-decision problems in their adherence to different psychophysical laws.</description>
