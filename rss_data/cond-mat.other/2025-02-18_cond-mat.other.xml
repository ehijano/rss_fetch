      <title>Filtering Spin and Orbital Moment in Centrosymmetric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of spin and orbital angular momentum without relying on magnetic materials is commonly accomplished by breaking of inversion symmetry, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and spin selectivity in electron transfer processes occurring in chiral media. In contrast to this perspective, we show that orbital moment filtering can be accomplished in centrosymmetric systems: the electron states can be selectively manipulated allowing for the preferential transfer of electrons with a particular orbital momentum orientation. We find that orbital moment filtering is indeed efficiently controlled through orbital couplings that break both mirror and rotational symmetries. We provide the symmetry conditions required for the electron transmission medium to achieve orbital filtering and relate them to the orientation of the orbital moment. The presence of atomic spin-orbit interaction in the centrosymmetric transmission medium leads to the selective filtering of spin and orbital moments. Our findings allow to identify optimal regimes for having highly efficient simultaneous spin and orbital moment filtering.</description>

      <title>Coherent Spin Pumping Originated from Sub-Terahertz N\'eel Vector Dynamics in Easy Plane {\alpha}-Fe2O3/Pt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a thorough study of spin-to-charge current interconversion in bulk and thin films of (0001) {\alpha}-Fe2O3 /Pt heterostructures by means of all-optical polarization-controlled microwave excitation at sub-Terahertz frequencies. Our results demonstrate that coherent spin pumping is generated through excitations of both the acoustic and optical modes of antiferromagnetic resonance, provided that the corresponding selection rules are met for the relative orientation between the microwave magnetic field h_ac and the magnetic moment m_0 of the Hematite. In particular, our results unanimously show that while a microwave field with h_ac perpendicular to m_0 pumps a net spin angular momentum from the acoustic mode, spin pumping from the optical mode is only enabled when h_ac parallel to m_0, as expected from the selection rules imposed by the Neel vector dynamics. Our results support the current understanding of spin mixing conductance in antiferromagnetic/non-magnetic interfaces, contrary to recent reports where the absence of spin pumping from the optical mode in Hematite was interpreted as a cancellation effect between the diagonal and off-diagonal components of the spin mixing conductance. We also provide an explanation for the previously reported observations and show how the optical spin pumping actually vanishes for thin films, which we speculate being either due to an increased level of inhomogeneities or to insufficient film thickness for the optical mode to fully realize.</description>

      <title>Effects of antiferromagnetic coupling and pinning on domain wall dynamics in synthetic ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain wall (DW) dynamics in antiferromagnetic (AFM) systems offer the advantages over their ferromagnetic counterparts of having faster and more energy efficient manipulation due to the absence of net magnetization, leading to reduced magnetic crosstalk and improved performance in spintronic devices. A comprehensive analysis of DW dynamics across regimes such as creep, depinning, and flow is well established in ferromagnetic systems but remains lacking in AFM-coupled systems. In this study, we explore the nature of DW dynamics in synthetic ferrimagnetic multilayers composed of Pt|Co|Tb|Al for different Tb thickness, focusing on the underlying pinning parameters, and on the different regimes of DW dynamics driven by spin-orbit torques (SOTs). We find that due to the AFM coupling between Co and Tb, the magnetic moment of Tb increases with Tb thickness resulting in a reduced saturation magnetization and an enhanced depinning field. The DW disorder interaction is found to vary weakly with the AFM coupling between Co and Tb, while the complete withdrawal of the Tb layer strongly increases the anisotropy and the DW pinning. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to measure effective SOTs by comparing depinning transitions in current and field-induced DW motion. This research reveals new insights into DW dynamics in coupled AFM systems, highlighting enhancements in mobility through optimized SOTs and pinning landscapes.</description>

      <title>Dephasing enhanced transport of spin excitations in a two dimensional lossy lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise is commonly regarded as an adverse effect disrupting communication and coher- ent transport processes or limiting their efficiency. However, as has been shown for example for small light-harvesting protein complexes decoherence processes can play a significant role in facilitating transport processes, a phenomenon termed environment- assisted quantum transport (ENAQT). We here study numerically and analytically how dephasing noise improves the efficiency of spin excitation transport in a two dimen- sional lattice with small homogeneous losses. In particular we investigate the efficiency and time of excitation transfer from a random initial site to a specific target site and show that for system sizes below a characteristic scale it can be substantially enhanced by adding small dephasing noise. We derive approximate analytic expressions for the efficiency which become rather accurate in the two limits of small (coherent regime) and large noise (Zeno regime) and give a very good overall estimate. These analytic expressions provide a quantitative description of ENAQT in spatially extended systems and allow to derive conditions for its existence.</description>

      <title>Time crystal optomechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time crystals are an enigmatic phase of matter in which a quantum mechanical system displays repetitive, observable motion - they spontaneously break the time translation symmetry. On the other hand optomechanical systems, where mechanical and optical degrees of freedom are coupled, are well established and enable a range of applications and measurements with unparalleled precision. Here, we connect a time crystal formed of magnetic quasiparticles, magnons, to a mechanical resonator, a gravity wave mode on a nearby liquid surface, and show that their joint dynamics evolves as a cavity optomechanical system. Our results pave way for exploiting the spontaneous coherence of time crystals in an optomechanical setting and remove the experimental barrier between time crystals and other phases of condensed matter.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Waves (PAW): extended resolution of unity method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) method is based on a linear transformation between the pseudo wavefunctions and the all electron wavefunctions. To obtain high accuracy with this method, it is important that the local part of the linear transform (inside each atomic sphere) be defined over a complete basis set (with deviations from completeness leading to corrections to the total energy not computed within current implementations of PAW). Here we show how to make this basis much closer to complete without significant additional computational work and without modifying the transformation in any significant way. This is done by extending the resolution of unity used for the transform to include more smooth wavefunctions (which have nothing to do with the atomic problem) and having them linearly transform via the identity.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Scaling Bosonic Path Integral Molecular Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18025v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic exchange symmetry leads to fascinating quantum phenomena, from exciton condensation in quantum materials to the superfluidity of liquid Helium-4. Unfortunately, path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations of bosons are computationally prohibitive beyond $\mathord{\sim} 100$ particles, due to a cubic scaling with the system size. We present an algorithm that reduces the complexity from cubic to quadratic, allowing the first simulations of thousands of bosons using PIMD. Our method is orders of magnitude faster, with a speedup that scales linearly with the number of particles and the number of imaginary time slices (beads). Simulations that would have otherwise taken decades can now be done in days. In practice, the new algorithm eliminates most of the added computational cost of including bosonic exchange effects, making them almost as accessible as PIMD simulations of distinguishable particles.</description>

      <title>Boundary Time Crystals as AC sensors: enhancements and constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of a boundary time crystals (BTCs) as quantum sensors of AC fields. Boundary time crystals are non-equilibrium phases of matter in contact to an environment, for which a macroscopic fraction of the many-body system breaks the time translation symmetry. We find an enhanced sensitivity of the BTC when its spins are resonant with the applied AC field, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information (QFI). The QFI dynamics in this regime is shown to be captured by a relatively simple ansatz consisting of an initial power-law growth and late-time exponential decay. We study the scaling of the ansatz parameters with resources (encoding time and number of spins) and identify a moderate quantum enhancement in the sensor performance through comparison with classical QFI bounds. Investigating the precise source of this performance, we find that despite of its long coherence time and multipartite correlations (advantageous properties for quantum metrology), the entropic cost of the BTC (which grows indefinitely in the thermodynamic limit) hinders an optimal decoding of the AC field information. This result has implications for future candidates of quantum sensors in open system and we hope it will encourage future study into the role of entropy in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protected Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana interference and non-adiabatic topological transport of edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interference under chiral-mirror-like symmetry and propose its application to non-adiabatic topological transport of edge states. Protected by this symmetry, complete destructive interference emerges and can be characterized through occupation probability. This symmetry-protected LZSM interference enables state transitions to be achieved within remarkably short time scales. To demonstrate our mechanism, we provide two distinctive two-level systems as examples and survey them in detail. By tuning evolution speed or increasing holding time, the complete destructive interferences are observed. Furthermore, we make use of this mechanism for topological edge states of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain by taking them as an isolated two-level system. Through carefully designed time sequences, we construct symmetry-protected LZSM interference of topological edge states, enabling non-adiabatic topological transport. Our work unveils an alternative way to study quantum control, quantum state transfer, and quantum communication via non-adiabatic topological transport.</description>

      <title>Energy density and stress fields in quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been an enduring interest and controversy about whether or not one can define physically meaningful energy density and stress fields, $e({\bf r})$ and $\sigma_{\alpha \beta}({\bf r})$ in quantum systems. A key issue is kinetic energy since $\frac{1}{2}|\nabla \Psi|^2$ and $-\frac{1}{2}\Psi\nabla^2 \Psi$ lead to different densities, and analogous issues arise interaction energies. This paper presents a resolution to the problems in two steps: 1) All effects of exchange and correlation are shown to be unique functions defined at each point ${\bf r}$; all issues of non-uniqueness involve only the density $n({\bf r})$ and are equivalent to a single-particle problem with wavefunction $s({\bf r}) = \sqrt{n({\bf r})/N}$. 2) Forms for the latter terms are proposed based on the nature of energy and stress, where energy has two distinct roles. Because the energy determines the ground state itself through the variational principle, the appropriate density involves the terms in the hamiltonian: $-\frac{1}{2}\Psi\nabla^2 \Psi$ and interactions in terms of potentials acting on the particles. This leads naturally to density functional theory with the interpretation that the energy density $e({\bf r})$ is equilibrated to minimize fluctuations with the same chemical potential throughout the system. On the other hand, the energy and stress (derivative of the energy with respect to strain) are properties of the ground state, and simple examples to show that the only acceptable expressions involve the combination $\frac{1}{4}[|\nabla \Psi|^2 - \Psi\nabla^2 \Psi]$, as derived by Schrodinger, Pauli and others, and Coulomb interactions in the Maxwell form in terms of electric fields, not potentials. Together these results lead to well-defined formulations of energy density and stress fields that are physically motivated and based on a clear set of arguments.</description>
