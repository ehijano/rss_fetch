      <title>Robust Stable Matchings: Dealing with Changes in Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stable matchings that are robust to preference changes in the two-sided stable matching setting of Gale and Shapley [GS62]. Given two instances $A$ and $B$ on the same set of agents, a matching is said to be robust if it is stable under both instances. This notion captures desirable robustness properties in matching markets where preferences may evolve, be misreported, or be subject to uncertainty. While the classical theory of stable matchings reveals rich lattice, algorithmic, and polyhedral structure for a single instance, it is unclear which of these properties persist when stability is required across multiple instances. Our work initiates a systematic study of the structural and computational behavior of robust stable matchings under increasingly general models of preference changes.
  We analyze robustness under a hierarchy of perturbation models:
  1. a single upward shift in one agent's preference list,
  2. an arbitrary permutation change by a single agent, and
  3. arbitrary preference changes by multiple agents on both sides.
  For each regime, we characterize when:
  1. the set of robust stable matchings forms a sublattice,
  2. the lattice of robust stable matchings admits a succinct Birkhoff partial order enabling efficient enumeration,
  3. worker-optimal and firm-optimal robust stable matchings can be computed efficiently, and
  4. the robust stable matching polytope is integral (by studying its LP formulation).
  We provide explicit counterexamples demonstrating where these structural and geometric properties break down, and complement these results with XP-time algorithms running in $O(n^k)$ time, parameterized by $k$, the number of agents whose preferences change. Our results precisely delineate the boundary between tractable and intractable cases for robust stable matchings.</description>

      <title>How Hard Is It to Rig a Tournament When Few Players Can Beat or Be Beaten by the Favorite?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In knockout tournaments, players compete in successive rounds, with losers eliminated and winners advancing until a single champion remains. Given a tournament digraph $D$, which encodes the outcomes of all possible matches, and a designated player $v^* \in V(D)$, the \textsc{Tournament Fixing} problem (TFP) asks whether the tournament can be scheduled in a way that guarantees $v^*$ emerges as the winner. TFP is known to be NP-hard, but is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by structural measures such as the feedback arc set (fas) or feedback vertex set (fvs) number of the tournament digraph. In this paper, we introduce and study two new structural parameters: the number of players who can defeat $v^*$ (i.e., the in-degree of $v^*$, denoted by $k$) and the number of players that $v^*$ can defeat (i.e., the out-degree of $v^*$, denoted by $\ell$).
  A natural question is that: can TFP be efficiently solved when $k$ or $\ell$ is small? We answer this question affirmatively by showing that TFP is FPT when parameterized by either the in-degree or out-degree of $v^*$. Our algorithm for the in-degree parameterization is particularly involved and technically intricate. Notably, the in-degree $k$ can remain small even when other structural parameters, such as fas or fvs, are large. Hence, our results offer a new perspective and significantly broaden the parameterized algorithmic understanding of the \textsc{Tournament Fixing} problem.</description>

      <title>Cities at Play: Improving Equilibria in Urban Neighbourhood Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How should cities invest to improve social welfare when individuals respond strategically to local conditions? We model this question using a game-theoretic version of Schelling's bounded neighbourhood model, where agents choose neighbourhoods based on concave, non-monotonic utility functions reflecting local population. While naive improvements may worsen outcomes - analogous to Braess' paradox - we show that carefully designed, small-scale investments can reliably align individual incentives with societal goals. Specifically, modifying utilities at a total cost of at most $0.81 \epsilon^2 \cdot \texttt{opt}$ guarantees that every resulting Nash equilibrium achieves a social welfare of at least $\epsilon \cdot \texttt{opt}$, where $\texttt{opt}$ is the optimum social welfare. Our results formalise how targeted interventions can transform supra-negative outcomes into supra-positive returns, offering new insights into strategic urban planning and decentralised collective behaviour.</description>

      <title>Determining the Winner in Alternating-Move Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a criterion for determining the winner in two-player win-lose alternating-move games on trees, in terms of the Hausdorff dimension of the target set. We focus our study on special cases, including the Gale-Stewart game on the complete binary tree and a family of Schmidt games. Building on the Hausdorff dimension games originally introduced by Das, Fishman, Simmons, and Urba{\'n}ski, which provide a game-theoretic approach for computing Hausdorff dimensions, we employ a generalized family of these games, and show that they are useful for analyzing sets underlying the win-lose games we study.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Universal Alignment: A New Alignment Framework via Test-Time Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) to serve users with heterogeneous and potentially conflicting preferences is a central challenge for personalized and trustworthy AI. We formalize an ideal notion of universal alignment through test-time scaling: for each prompt, the model produces $k\ge 1$ candidate responses and a user selects their preferred one. We introduce $(k,f(k))$-robust alignment, which requires the $k$-output model to have win rate $f(k)$ against any other single-output model, and asymptotic universal alignment (U-alignment), which requires $f(k)\to 1$ as $k\to\infty$. Our main result characterizes the optimal convergence rate: there exists a family of single-output policies whose $k$-sample product policies achieve U-alignment at rate $f(k)=\frac{k}{k+1}$, and no method can achieve a faster rate in general.
  We show that popular post-training methods, including Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), can fundamentally underutilize the benefits of test-time scaling. Even though NLHF is optimal for $k=1$, sampling from the resulting (often deterministic) policy cannot guarantee win rates above $\tfrac{1}{2}$ except for an arbitrarily small slack. This stems from a lack of output diversity: existing alignment methods can collapse to a single majority-preferred response, making additional samples redundant. In contrast, our approach preserves output diversity and achieves the optimal test-time scaling rate. In particular, we propose a family of symmetric multi-player alignment games and prove that any symmetric Nash equilibrium policy of the $(k+1)$-player alignment game achieves the optimal $(k,\frac{k}{k+1})$-robust alignment. Finally, we provide theoretical convergence guarantees for self-play learning dynamics in these games and extend the framework to opponents that also generate multiple responses.</description>

      <title>On Sybil-proof Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14485v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that in the single-parameter mechanism design environment, the only non-wasteful, symmetric, incentive compatible and Sybil-proof direct mechanism is a second price auction with symmetric tie-breaking. Thus, if there is private information, lotteries or other mechanisms that do not always allocate to a highest-value bidder are not Sybil-proof or not incentive compatible. Moreover, we show that our main (im)possibility result extends beyond linear valuations, but not to multi-unit object allocation with capacity constrained bidders.
  We also provide examples of mechanisms (with higher interim payoff for the bidders than a second price auction) that satisfy all of the other axioms and a weaker, Bayesian notion of Sybil-proofness. Thus, our (im)possibility result does not generalize to the Bayesian setting and we have a larger design space: With Sybil constraints, equivalence between dominant strategy and Bayesian implementation (that holds in classical single-parameter mechanism design without Sybils) no longer holds.</description>

      <title>VGC-Bench: Towards Mastering Diverse Team Strategies in Competitive Pok\'emon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to varying strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge in multi-agent learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with a vast space of approximately $10^{139}$ team configurations, far larger than those of other games such as Chess, Go, Poker, StarCraft, or Dota. The combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal strategies to vary substantially depending on both the controlled team and the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies a human-play dataset of over 700,000 battle logs and a range of baseline agents based on heuristics, large language models, behavior cloning, and multi-agent reinforcement learning with empirical game-theoretic methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated in a mirror match with a single team configuration, our methods can win against a professional VGC competitor. We repeat this training and evaluation with progressively larger team sets and find that as the number of teams increases, the best-performing algorithm in the single-team setting has worse performance and is more exploitable, but has improved generalization to unseen teams. Our code and dataset are open-sourced at https://github.com/cameronangliss/vgc-bench and https://huggingface.co/datasets/cameronangliss/vgc-battle-logs.</description>

      <title>Perceived Fairness in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The usual definitions of algorithmic fairness focus on population-level statistics, such as demographic parity or equal opportunity. However, in many social or economic contexts, fairness is not perceived globally, but locally, through an individual's peer network and comparisons. We propose a theoretical model of perceived fairness networks, in which each individual's sense of discrimination depends on the local topology of interactions. We show that even if a decision rule satisfies standard criteria of fairness, perceived discrimination can persist or even increase in the presence of homophily or assortative mixing. We propose a formalism for the concept of fairness perception, linking network structure, local observation, and social perception. Analytical and simulation results highlight how network topology affects the divergence between objective fairness and perceived fairness, with implications for algorithmic governance and applications in finance and collaborative insurance.</description>
