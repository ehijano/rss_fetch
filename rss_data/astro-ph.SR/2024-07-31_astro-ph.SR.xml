      <title>Spectropolarimetric Inversion in Four Dimensions with Deep Learning (SPIn4D): I. Overview, Magnetohydrodynamic Modeling, and Stokes Profile Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) will provide high-resolution, multi-line spectropolarimetric observations that are poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Sun. Given the massive data volume, novel inference techniques are required to unlock its full potential. Here, we provide an overview of our "SPIn4D" project, which aims to develop deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for estimating the physical properties of the solar photosphere from DKIST spectropolarimetric observations. We describe the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling and the Stokes profile synthesis pipeline that produce the simulated output and input data, respectively. These data will be used to train a set of CNNs that can rapidly infer the four-dimensional MHD state vectors by exploiting the spatiotemporally coherent patterns in the Stokes profile time series. Specifically, our radiative MHD model simulates the small-scale dynamo actions that are prevalent in quiet-Sun and plage regions. Six cases with different mean magnetic fields have been conducted; each case covers six solar-hours, totaling 109 TB in data volume. The simulation domain covers at least $25\times25\times8$ Mm with $16\times16\times12$ km spatial resolution, extending from the upper convection zone up to the temperature minimum region. The outputs are stored at a 40 s cadence. We forward model the Stokes profile of two sets of Fe I lines at 630 and 1565 nm, which will be simultaneously observed by DKIST and can better constrain the parameter variations along the line of sight. The MHD model output and the synthetic Stokes profiles are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Observations of Extremely Metal-Poor O Stars: Weak Winds and Constraints for Evolution Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-poor massive stars drive the evolution of low-mass galaxies, both locally and at high redshift. However, quantifying the feedback they impart to their local surroundings remains uncertain because models of stellar evolution, mass loss, and ionizing spectra are unconstrained by observations below 20% solar metallicity ($Z_\odot$). We present new Keck Cosmic Web Imager optical spectroscopy of three O stars in the nearby dwarf galaxies Leo P, Sextans A, and WLM, which have gas-phase oxygen abundances of 3-14% $Z_\odot$. To characterize their fundamental stellar properties and radiation-driven winds, we fit PoWR atmosphere models to the optical spectra simultaneously with Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra and multi-wavelength photometry. We find that all three stars have effective temperatures consistent with their spectral types and surface gravities typical of main-sequence dwarf stars. Yet, the combination of those inferred parameters and luminosity for the two lower-$Z$ stars is not reproduced by stellar evolution models, even those that include rotation or binary interactions. The scenario of multiple-star systems is difficult to reconcile with all available data, suggesting that these observations pose a challenge to current evolution models. We highlight the importance of validating the relationship between stellar mass, temperature, and luminosity at very low $Z$ for accurate estimates of ionizing photon production and spectral hardness. Finally, all three stars' FUV wind profiles reveal low mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities in tension with expectations from widely adopted radiation-driven wind models. These results provide empirical benchmarks for future development of mass-loss and evolution models for metal-poor stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Statistical Estimates of the Binary Properties of Rotational Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model to estimate the average primary masses, companion mass ranges, the inclination limit for recognizing a rotational variable, and the primary mass spreads for populations of binary stars. The model fits a population's binary mass function distribution and allows for a probability that some mass functions are incorrectly estimated. Using tests with synthetic data, we assess the model's sensitivity to each parameter, finding that we are most sensitive to the average primary mass and the minimum companion mass, with less sensitivity to the inclination limit and little to no sensitivity to the primary mass spread. We apply the model to five populations of binary spotted rotational variables identified in ASAS-SN, computing their binary mass functions using RV data from APOGEE. Their average primary mass estimates are consistent with our expectations based on their CMD locations ($\sim0.75 M_{\odot}$ for lower main sequence primaries and $\sim 0.9$--$1.2 M_{\odot}$ for RS CVn and sub-subgiants). Their companion mass range estimates allow companion masses down to $M_2/M_1\simeq0.1$, although the main sequence population may have a higher minimum mass fraction ($\sim0.4$). We see weak evidence of an inclination limit $\gtrsim50^{\circ}$ for the main sequence and sub-subgiant groups and no evidence of an inclination limit in the other groups. No groups show strong evidence for a preferred primary mass spread. We conclude by demonstrating that the approach will provide significantly better estimates of the primary mass and the minimum mass ratio and reasonable sensitivity to the inclination limit with 10 times as many systems.</description>

      <title>Observations of Kappa Distributions in Solar Energetic Protons and Derived Thermodynamic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we model the high-energy tail of observed solar energetic proton energy distributions with a kappa distribution function. We employ a technique for deriving the thermodynamic parameters of solar energetic proton populations measured by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS$\odot$IS) EPI-Hi high energy telescope (HET), over energies from 10 - 60 MeV. With this technique we explore, for the first time, the characteristic thermodynamic properties of the solar energetic protons associated with an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) and its driven shock. We find that (1) the spectral index, or equivalently, the thermodynamic parameter kappa of solar energetic protons ($\kappa_{\rm EP}$) gradually increases starting from the pre-ICME region (upstream of the CME-driven shock), reaching a maximum in the CME ejecta ($\kappa_{\rm EP} \approx 3.5$), followed by a gradual decrease throughout the trailing portion of the CME; (2) solar energetic proton temperature and density ($T_{\rm EP}$ and $n_{\rm EP}$) appear anti-correlated, a behavior consistent to sub-isothermal polytropic processes; and (3) values of $T_{\rm EP}$ and $\kappa_{\rm EP}$ appear are positively correlated, indicating an increasing entropy with time. Therefore, these proton populations are characterized by a complex and evolving thermodynamic behavior, consisting of multiple sub-isothermal polytropic processes, and a large-scale trend of increasing temperature, kappa, and entropy. This study and its companion study by Livadiotis et al. (2024) open a new set of procedures for investigating the thermodynamic behavior of energetic particles and their shared thermal properties.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Electron Capture Supernova Candidate AT 2019abn with JWST Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened up a new window to study highly reddened explosive transients. We present results from late-time (1421 days post-explosion) JWST follow-up spectroscopic observations with NIRSpec and MIRI LRS of the intermediate luminosity red transient (ILRT) AT 2019abn located in the nearby Messier 51 galaxy (8.6 Mpc). ILRTs represent a mysterious class of transients which exhibit peak luminosities between those of classical novae and supernovae and which are known to be highly dust obscured. Similar to the prototypical examples of this class of objects, NGC 300 2008-OT and SN 2008S, AT 2019abn has an extremely red and dusty progenitor detected only in pre-explosion Spitzer/IRAC imaging at 3.6 and 4.5 micron and not in deep optical or near-infrared HST images. We find that late time observations of AT 2019abn from NEOWISE and JWST are consistent with the late time evolution of SN 2008S. In part because they are so obscured by dust, it is unknown what produces an ILRT with hypotheses ranging from high mass stellar merger events, non-terminal stellar outbursts, or terminal supernovae explosions through electron-capture in super-AGB stars. Our JWST observations show strong mid-IR Class C PAH features at 6.3 and 8.25 micron typical of carbon-rich post-AGB sources. These features suggest the dust around AT 2019abn, either pre-existing or newly formed in the ejecta, is composed of carbonaceous grains which are not typically observed around red supergiants. However, depending on the strength and temperature of hot bottom burning, SAGBs may be expected to exhibit a carbon-rich chemistry. Thus our JWST observations are consistent with AT 2019abn having an SAGB progenitor.</description>

      <title>The effects of surface fossil magnetic fields on massive star evolution: V. Models at low metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At metallicities lower than that of the Small Magellanic Cloud, it remains essentially unexplored how fossil magnetic fields, forming large-scale magnetospheres, could affect the evolution of massive stars, thereby impacting the fundamental building blocks of the early Universe. We extend our stellar evolution model grid with representative calculations of main-sequence, single-star models with initial masses of 20 and 60 M$_\odot$, including appropriate changes for low-metallicity environments ($Z = 10^{-3}-10^{-6}$). We scrutinise the magnetic, rotational, and chemical properties of the models. When lowering the metallicity, the rotational velocities can become higher and the tendency towards quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution increases. While magnetic fields aim to prevent the development of this evolutionary channel, the weakening stellar winds lead to less efficient magnetic braking in our models. Since the stellar radius is almost constant during a blueward evolution caused by efficient chemical mixing, the surface magnetic field strength remains unchanged in some models. We find core masses at the terminal-age main sequence between 22 and 52 M$_\odot$ for initially 60 M$_\odot$ models. This large difference is due to the vastly different chemical and rotational evolution. We conclude that in order to explain chemical species and, in particular, high nitrogen abundances in the early Universe, the adopted stellar models need to be under scrutiny. The assumptions regarding wind physics, chemical mixing, and magnetic fields will strongly impact the model predictions.</description>

      <title>AGB and Post-AGB Stars versus Planetary Nebulae and Young Stellar Objects: Properties in Visual and IR Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of AGB and post-AGB (PAGB) stars, planetary nebulae, and young stellar objects (YSOs) in our Galaxy through an analysis of observational data covering visual and infrared (IR) wavelengths. Utilizing datasets from IRAS, 2MASS, AllWISE, Gaia DR3, and the SIMBAD object database, we perform an in-depth comparison between observational data and theoretical models. For this comparison, we present various color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) in visual and IR bands, as well as IR two-color diagrams (2CDs). Our results demonstrate that the CMDs, incorporating the latest distance and extinction data from Gaia DR3 for a majority of sample stars, are effective in distinguishing different classes of stars. To improve the precision of our analysis, we apply theoretical radiative transfer models for dust shells around AGB and PAGB stars. A thorough comparison of the theoretical models with observations across various IR 2CDs and CMDs shows a significant agreement. We find that AGB and PAGB stars are among the brightest classes in visual and IR bands. Furthermore, most YSOs are clearly distinguishable from AGB stars on various IR CMDs, exhibiting fainter absolute magnitudes in IR bands.</description>

      <title>A radio loud semiregular variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a byproduct of our search for Galactic stellar systems with gamma-ray emission, we have identified an unrelated cool and evolved star (IRC-10412) that attracted our attention due to its strong radio emission level with a spectral index matching, almost perfectly, the canonical +0.6 value expected from an ionized stellar wind. A follow-up observational analysis was undertaken given that these two properties are hard to reconcile as originating in the same stellar object. As a result, IRC-10412 has been classified as a new semiregular variable of SRb type in the asymptotic giant branch, and different but consistent estimates of its mass-loss parameter are reported. We propose that its unusually high radio emission arises from a ~ 1E-5 Msun/yr stellar wind exposed to an external source of ionizing photons, possibly coming from nearby OB associations.</description>

      <title>On the use of field RR Lyrae as Galactic probes VII. light curve templates in the LSST photometric system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \textit{Vera C. Rubin} Observatory will start operations in 2025. During the first two years, too few visits per target per band will be available, meaning that mean magnitude measurements of variable stars will not be precise and thus, standard candles like RR Lyrae (RRL) will not be usable. Light curve templates (LCTs) can be adopted to estimate the mean magnitude of a variable star with few magnitude measurements, provided that their period (plus amplitude and reference epoch, depending on how the LCT is applied) is known. LSST will provide precise RRL periods within the first six months, allowing to exploit RRLs if LCTs were available.
  We aim to build LCTs in the LSST bands to enhance the early science with LSST. Using them will provide a 1-2 years advantage with respect to a classical approach, concerning distance measurements.
  We collected $gri$-band data from the ZTF survey and $z$-band data from DECam to build the LCTs of RRLs. We also adopted synthetic $griz$-band data in the LSST system from pulsation models, plus SDSS, \gaia and OGLE photometry, inspecting the light amplitude ratios in different photometric systems to provide useful conversions to apply the LCTs.
  We have built LCTs of RRLs in the $griz$ bands of the LSST photometric system; for the $z$ band, we could build only fundamental-mode RRL LCTs. We quantitatively demonstrated that LCTs built with ZTF and DECam data can be adopted on the LSST photometric system. LCTs will decrease by a factor of at least two the uncertainty on distance estimates of RRLs, with respect to a simple average of the available measurements. Finally, within our tests, we have found a brand new behavior of amplitude ratios in the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) XVI: An asymmetric dust disk driving a multi-component molecular outflow in the young Class 0 protostar GSS30 IRS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the ALMA Large Program Early Planet Formation in Embedded disks observations of the Class 0 protostar GSS30 IRS3. Our observations included 1.3 mm continuum with a resolution of 0.''05 (7.8 au) and several molecular species including $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, H$_{2}$CO and c-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$. The dust continuum analysis unveiled a disk-shaped structure with a major axis size of $\sim$200 au. We observed an asymmetry in the minor axis of the continuum emission suggesting that the emission is optically thick and the disk is flared. On the other hand, we identified two prominent bumps along the major axis located at distances of 26 and 50 au from the central protostar. The origin of the bumps remains uncertain and might be due to an embedded substructure within the disk or the result of the temperature distribution instead of surface density due to optically thick continuum emission. The $^{12}$CO emission reveals a molecular outflow consisting of three distinct components: a collimated one, an intermediate velocity component exhibiting an hourglass shape, and a wider angle low-velocity component. We associate these components with the coexistence of a jet and a disk-wind. The C$^{18}$O emission traces both a Keplerian rotating circumstellar disk and the infall of the rotating envelope. We measured a stellar dynamical mass of 0.35$\pm$0.09 M$_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>A first systematic characterization of cataclysmic variables in SRG/eROSITA surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) We present an account of known cataclysmic variables (CVs) that were detected as X-ray sources in eROSITA X-ray surveys and have Gaia DR3 counterparts. We address standard CVs with main sequence donors and white dwarfs accreting via Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) and related objects, the double degenerates (DDs), and the symbiotic stars (SySts). We discern between nonmagnetic (dwarf novae and nova-like objects) and magnetic CVs (polars and intermediate polars (IPs)). In the publically available eROSITA catalog from the recent DR1, typically 65\% of known cataloged and classified CVs are detected. This fraction rises to over 90\% if the stack of all \ero X-ray surveys (called S45 in this paper) is considered and the search volume is restricted to a radius of 500\,pc. We examine the various classes of CVs in various diagnostic diagrams relating X-ray and optical properties (luminosity, absolute magnitude, color, X-ray spectral hardness, and optical variability) and establish their average class properties. We derive spectral properties for the 22 brightest polars and confirm an increase in the ratio of soft to hard X-rays with increasing magnetic field in the accretion region. We report three new soft IPs and present a spectral analysis of all soft IPs. Their blackbody temperatures agree well with published values. The DDs represent the bluest and faintest subcategory but reach the same identification fraction as the standard CVs. The SySts are the most distant systems; only 20 (13\%) were detected as X-ray sources in S45, and 7 of those are first-time detections. We investigate their mean properties using an upper limit on the flux of the nondetected CVs. Their X-ray nondetection is indeed a distance effect.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field diagnostics of prominences with the Mg II k line: 3D Stokes inversions vs. traditional methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mg II k resonance line is commonly used for diagnosing the solar chromosphere. Here we theoretically investigate its intensity and polarization in solar prominences, taking into account the effects of 3D radiative transfer and the Hanle and Zeeman effects. We use an optically thick 3D model representative of a solar prominence and apply several inversion methods to the synthetic Stokes profiles, clarifying their pros and cons for inferring prominence magnetic fields. We conclude that the self-consistent 3D inversion with radiative transfer is necessary to determine the magnetic field vector, although its geometry cannot be inferred with full fidelity. We also demonstrate that more traditional methods, such as those based on the weak field approximation or the constant-property slab assumption, can offer useful information under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Detailed abundances of the planet-hosting TOI-1173 A/B system: Possible evidence of planet engulfment in a very wide binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, studies of large samples of binary systems identified chemical anomalies, and showed that they might be attributed to planet formation or planet engulfment. However, both scenarios have primarily been tested in pairs without known exoplanets. In this work, we explore these scenarios in the newly detected planet-hosting wide binary TOI-1173 A/B (projected separation $\sim 11,400$ AU) using high-resolution MAROON-X and ARCES spectra. We determined photospheric stellar parameters both by fitting stellar models and via the spectroscopic equilibrium approach. Both analyses agree and suggest that they are cool main sequence stars located in the thin disc. A line-by-line differential analysis between the components (B$-$A) displays an abundance pattern in the condensation temperature plane where the planet-hosting star TOI-1173 A is enhanced in refractory elements such as iron by more than 0.05 dex. This suggests the engulfment of $\sim$18 M$_{\oplus}$ of rocky material in star A. Our hypothesis is supported by the dynamics of the system detailed in our companion paper Yana Galarza et al. 2024, which suggest that the Super-Neptune TOI-1173 A $b$ might have been delivered to its current short period ($\sim7$ days) through circulatization and von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanisms, thereby triggering the engulfment of inner rocky exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Dynamical and Atmospheric Characterization of the Substellar Companion HD 33632 Ab from Direct Imaging, Astrometry, and Radial-Velocity Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present follow-up SCExAO/CHARIS $H$ and $K$-band (R $\sim$ 70) high-contrast integral field spectroscopy and Keck/NIRC2 photometry of directly-imaged brown dwarf companion HD 33632 Ab and new radial-velocity data for the system from the SOPHIE spectrograph, complemented by Hipparcos and Gaia astrometry. These data enable more robust spectral characterization compared to lower-resolution spectra from the discovery paper and more than double the available astrometric and radial-velocity baseline. HD 33632 Ab's spectrum is well reproduced by a field L8.5--L9.5 dwarf. Using the Exo-REM atmosphere models, we derive a best-fit temperature, surface gravity and radius of $T_{\rm eff}$ = 1250 $K$, log(g) = 5, and $R$ = 0.97 $R_{\rm J}$ and a solar C/O ratio. Adding the SOPHIE radial-velocity data enables far tighter constraints on the companion's orbital properties (e.g. $i$=${46.6}_{-5.7}^{+2.9}$$^{o}$) and dynamical mass (${51.7}_{-2.5}^{+2.6}$$M_{\rm J}$) than derived from imaging data and \textit{Gaia} eDR3 astrometry data alone. HD 33632 Ab should be a prime target for multi-band imaging and spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope and the Roman Space Telescope's Coronagraphic Instrument, shedding detailed light on HD 33632 Ab's clouds and chemistry and providing a key reference point for understanding young exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Eccentric planet-disc interactions: orbital migration and eccentricity evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational coupling between a protoplanetary disc and an embedded eccentric planet is an important, long-standing problem, which has been not yet been conclusively explored. Here we study the torque and associated orbital evolution of an eccentric planet in a two-dimensional disc via the semi-analytical, fully global linear approach. Our methodology has the advantage that the spatial structure of the density waves launched by the planet is solved for fully. This allows us to account for the possibility of torque excitation over an extended radial interval for each Fourier harmonic of the perturbation, as opposed to earlier approximate treatments localized around Lindblad and corotation resonances. We systematically explore the torque behaviour across the space of disc properties (assuming power law profiles for the disc surface density and temperature), including the aspect ratio. Crucially, we examine the torque variation as the orbital eccentricity becomes supersonic relative to the gas motion (when planetary eccentricity is of order the disc aspect ratio), finding that the torque robustly reverses its sign near this transition. We also find that for shallow surface density gradients planetary migration may become outwards beyond this transition, although the rapid eccentricity damping (which is typically $\sim 10^2$ times faster than the orbital migration rate) would quickly restore inwards migration as the planet circularizes. Our self-consistently computed torques are in qualitative agreement with past numerical studies of eccentric planet-disc coupling. We provide our torque data for different disc parameters to the community for future testing and implementation in population synthesis studies.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Extremely Soft Binaries in Dense Star Clusters: On the Jupiter Mass Binary Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star-forming regions, characterized by dense environments, experience frequent encounters that significantly influence binary systems, leading to their hardening, softening, or ionization. We extend the Hut \&amp; Bahcall formalism to derive an analytical expression for the ionization cross-section in extreme mass ratio binary systems, allowing us to investigate the orbital evolution and population dynamics of binary planets and binary brown dwarfs in star clusters, while considering ongoing binary system formation. Our findings reveal that for low-mass soft binaries, the semi-major axis distribution asymptotes to a universal power law between $\propto a^{-8/3}$ and $\propto a^{-5/3}$ over the derived ionization timescale. We also discuss the implications of our results for the candidate Jupiter-mass binary objects putatively reported in the Trapezium cluster. We demonstrate that if their existence is verified, they likely form continuously with a spectrum proportional to $a^{1}$, aligning better with the ejection mechanism than with the in-situ formation mechanism, which predicts a distribution roughly proportional to $a^{-1}$. However, this implies an impractically high ejection formation rate. Alternatively, if these objects are binary brown dwarfs, continuous in-situ formation ($\propto a^{-1}$) with an initial minimal semi-major axis around 20 AU and a formation rate of 100 Myr$^{-1}$ plausibly matches the observed number of single objects, binary number, binary fraction, and semi-major axis distribution.</description>

      <title>The Fourth S-PLUS Data Release: 12-filter photometry covering $\sim3000$ square degrees in the southern hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) is a project to map $\sim9300$ sq deg of the sky using twelve bands (seven narrow and five broadbands). Observations are performed with the T80-South telescope, a robotic telescope located at the Cerro Tololo Observatory in Chile. The survey footprint consists of several large contiguous areas, including fields at high and low galactic latitudes, and towards the Magellanic Clouds. S-PLUS uses fixed exposure times to reach point source depths of about $21$ mag in the $griz$ and $20$ mag in the $u$ and the narrow filters. This paper describes the S-PLUS Data Release 4 (DR4), which includes calibrated images and derived catalogues for over 3000 sq deg, covering the aforementioned area. The catalogues provide multi-band photometry performed with the tools \texttt{DoPHOT} and \texttt{SExtractor} -- point spread function (\PSF) and aperture photometry, respectively. In addition to the characterization, we also present the scientific potential of the data. We use statistical tools to present and compare the photometry obtained through different methods. Overall we find good agreement between the different methods, with a slight systematic offset of 0.05\,mag between our \PSF and aperture photometry. We show that the astrometry accuracy is equivalent to that obtained in previous S-PLUS data releases, even in very crowded fields where photometric extraction is challenging. The depths of main survey (MS) photometry for a minimum signal-to-noise ratio $S/N = 3$ reach from $\sim19.5$ for the bluer bands to $\sim21.5$ mag on the red. The range of magnitudes over which accurate \PSF photometry is obtained is shallower, reaching $\sim19$ to $\sim20.5$ mag depending on the filter. Based on these photometric data, we provide star-galaxy-quasar classification and photometric redshift for millions of objects.</description>

      <title>The Interplay Between Collisionless Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alongside magnetic reconnection, turbulence is another fundamental nonlinear plasma phenomenon that plays a key role in energy transport and conversion in space and astrophysical plasmas. From a numerical, theoretical, and observational point of view there is a long history of exploring the interplay between these two phenomena in space plasma environments; however, recent high-resolution, multi-spacecraft observations have ushered in a new era of understanding this complex topic. The interplay between reconnection and turbulence is both complex and multifaceted, and can be viewed through a number of different interrelated lenses - including turbulence acting to generate current sheets that undergo magnetic reconnection (turbulence-driven reconnection), magnetic reconnection driving turbulent dynamics in an environment (reconnection-driven turbulence) or acting as an intermediate step in the excitation of turbulence, and the random diffusive/dispersive nature of magnetic field lines embedded in turbulent fluctuations enabling so-called stochastic reconnection. In this paper, we review the current state of knowledge on these different facets of the interplay between turbulence and reconnection in the context of collisionless plasmas, such as those found in many near-Earth astrophysical environments, from a theoretical, numerical, and observational perspective. Particular focus is given to several key regions in Earth's magnetosphere - Earth's magnetosheath, magnetotail, and Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices on the magnetopause flanks - where NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale mission has been providing new insights on the topic.</description>

Abstract: We present a new supergiant-rich stellar cluster hidden by extinction and christen it as Barb\'a 2, in honor of its discoverer Rodolfo Barb\'a. The cluster is at a distance of $7.39^{+0.65}_{-0.55}$ kpc and contains several supergiants, of which we provide spectral classifications for one blue, one yellow, and five red ones. The cluster extinction indicates an above-average grain-size ($R_{5495} \sim 3.7$), its age has a minimum value of 10 Ma, and its core radius is $0.84\pm0.19$ pc.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric characterization of the super-Jupiter HIP 99770 b with KPIC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young, self-luminous super-Jovian companions discovered by direct imaging provide a challenging test of planet formation and evolution theories. By spectroscopically characterizing the atmospheric compositions of these super-Jupiters, we can constrain their formation histories. Here we present studies of the recently discovered HIP 99770 b, a 16 MJup high-contrast companion on a 17 au orbit, using the fiber-fed high-resolution spectrograph KPIC (R~35,000) on the Keck II telescope. Our K-band observations led to detections of H2O and CO in the atmosphere of HIP 99770 b. We carried out free retrieval analyses using petitRADTRANS to measure its chemical abundances, including the metallicity and C/O ratio, projected rotation velocity (vsini), and radial velocity (RV). We found that the companion's atmosphere has C/O=0.55(-0.04/+0.06) and [M/H]=0.26(-0.23/+0.24) (1{\sigma} confidence intervals), values consistent with those of the Sun and with a companion formation via gravitational instability or core accretion. The projected rotation velocity &lt; 7.8 km/s is small relative to other directly imaged companions with similar masses and ages. This may imply a near pole-on orientation or effective magnetic braking by a circumplanetary disk. In addition, we added the companion-to-primary relative RV measurement to the orbital fitting and obtained updated constraints on orbital parameters. Detailed characterization of super-Jovian companions within 20 au like HIP 99770 b is critical for understanding the formation histories of this population.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent neutron star surface observations corroborate a long-standing theory that neutron stars may be accelerated over extended periods after their birth. We analyze how these prolonged rocket-like accelerations, combined with rapid birth kicks, impact binary orbits. We find that even a small contribution of rocket kicks combined with instantaneous natal kicks can allow binaries to reach period--eccentricity combinations unattainable in standard binary evolution models. We propose these kick + rocket combinations as a new channel to form wide low-eccentricity neutron star binaries such as Gaia NS1, as well as inducing stellar mergers months to years after a supernova to cause peculiar high-energy transients.</description>

      <title>Evolution of reconnection flux during eruption of magnetic flux ropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are powerful drivers of space weather, with magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) widely regarded as their primary precursors. However, the variation in reconnection flux during the evolution of MFR during CME eruptions remains poorly understood. In this paper, we develop a realistic 3D magneto-hydrodynamic model using which we explore the temporal evolution of reconnection flux during the MFR evolution using both numerical simulations and observational data. Our initial coronal configuration features an isothermal atmosphere and a potential arcade magnetic field beneath which an MFR emerges at the lower boundary. As the MFR rises, we observe significant stretching and compression of the overlying magnetic field beneath it. Magnetic reconnection begins with the gradual formation of a current sheet, eventually culminating with the impulsive expulsion of the flux rope. We analyze the temporal evolution of reconnection fluxes during two successive MFR eruptions while continuously emerging the twisted flux rope through the lower boundary. We also conduct a similar analysis using observational data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) for an eruptive event. Comparing our MHD simulation with observational data, we find that reconnection flux play a crucial role in determination of CME speeds. From the onset to the eruption, the reconnection flux shows a strong linear correlation with the velocity. This nearly realistic simulation of a solar eruption provides important insights into the complex dynamics of CME initiation and progression.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric heating and magnetism driven by $^{22}$Ne distillation in isolated white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of atmospheric heating in the cool, magnetic white dwarf GD 356 remains unsolved nearly 40 years after its discovery. This once idiosyncratic star with $T_{\rm eff}\approx7500$ K, yet Balmer lines in Zeeman-split emission is now part of a growing class of white dwarfs exhibiting similar features, and which are tightly clustered in the HR diagram suggesting an intrinsic power source. This paper proposes that convective motions associated with an internal dynamo can power electric currents along magnetic field lines that heat the atmosphere via Ohmic dissipation. Such currents would require a dynamo driven by core $^{22}$Ne distillation, and would further corroborate magnetic field generation in white dwarfs by this process. The model predicts that the heating will be highest near the magnetic poles, and virtually absent toward the equator, in agreement with observations. This picture is also consistent with the absence of X-ray or extreme ultraviolet emission, because the resistivity would decrease by several orders of magnitude at the typical coronal temperatures. The proposed model suggests that i) DAHe stars are mergers with enhanced $^{22}$Ne that enables distillation and may result in significant cooling delays; and ii) any mergers that distill neon will generate magnetism and chromospheres. The predicted chromospheric emission is consistent with the two known massive DQe white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The Implications of 'Oumuamua on Panspermia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Panspermia is the hypothesis that life originated on Earth from the bombardment of foreign interstellar ejecta harboring polyextremophile microorganisms. Since the 2017 discovery of the interstellar body 'Oumuamua (1I/2017 U1) by the Pans-STARRS telescope, various studies have re-examined panspermia based on updated number density models that accommodate for 'Oumuamua's properties. By utilizing 'Oumuamua's properties as an anchor, we estimate the mass and number density of ejecta in the ISM (rho_m [kg au^-3] and rho_n [au^-3]). We build upon prior work by first accounting for the minimum ejecta size to shield microbes from supernova radiation. Second, we estimate the total number of impact events C_n on Earth after its formation and prior to the emergence of life (~0.8Gyr). We derive a conditional probability relation for the likelihood of panspermia for Earth specifically of &lt;10^-5, given a number of factors including f_B, the fraction of ejecta harboring extremophiles and other factors that are poorly constrained. However, we find that panspermia is a plausible potential life-seeding mechanism for (optimistically) potentially up to ~10^5 of the ~10^9 Earth-sized habitable zone worlds in our Galaxy.</description>

Abstract: Context. Recent astrometric and spectroscopic surveys of OB stars have revealed a few stellar-mass black holes (BHs) with orbital periods as low as 10 days. No X-ray counterpart has been detected, due to the absence of a radiatively efficient accretion disk around the BH. Yet, dissipative processes in the hot, dilute and strongly magnetized plasma around the BH (so-called BH corona) can still lead to non-thermal X-ray emission (e.g. synchrotron).
  Aims. We determine the X-ray luminosity distribution from BH+OB star binaries up to orbital periods of a few thousand days.
  Methods. We use detailed binary evolution models computed with MESA for initial primary masses of 10-90 $M_{\odot}$ and orbital periods from 1-3000 d. The X-ray luminosity is computed for a broad range of radiative efficiencies.
  Results. We show that particle acceleration through magnetic reconnection can heat the BH corona. A substantial fraction of the gravitational potential energy from the accreted plasma is converted into non-thermal X-ray emission. Our population synthesis analysis predicts at least 28 (up to 72) BH+OB star binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to produce X-ray luminosity above 10$^{31}$ erg$\,$s$^{-1}$, observable through focused Chandra observations. We identify a population of SB1 systems in the LMC and HD96670 in the Milky Way comprising O stars with unseen companions of masses above 2.3 $M_{\odot}$ that aligns well with our predictions. The predicted luminosities of the OB companions to these X-ray-emitting BHs are 10$^{4.5-5.5}$ $L_{\odot}$.
  Conclusions. These results make the case for long-time exposure in X-rays of the stellar-mass BH candidates identified around OB stars. It will constrain the underlying population of X-ray-faint BHs, the evolution from single to double degenerate binaries, and the progenitors of gravitational wave mergers. (Abridged)</description>
