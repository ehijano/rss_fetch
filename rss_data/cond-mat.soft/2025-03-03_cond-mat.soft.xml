      <title>Thermally driven two-sphere microswimmer with internal feedback control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the locomotion of a thermally driven elastic two-sphere microswimmer with internal feedback control that is realized by the position-dependent friction coefficients. In our model, the two spheres are in equilibrium with independent heat baths having different temperatures, causing a heat flow between the two spheres. We generally show that the average velocity of the microswimmer is nonzero when the friction coefficients are position-dependent. Using the method of stochastic thermodynamics, we obtain the entropy production rate and discuss the efficiency of the two-sphere microswimmer. The proposed self-propulsion mechanism highlights the importance of information in active matter and can be a fundamental process in various biological systems.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity in the nematic liquid crystal under the direct current electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the electrical properties of the liquid crystal compound, known as an RM734, exhibiting a ferroelectric nematic phase. The influence of alternating (AC) and direct (DC) current electric fields on the switching process of the polarization vector and dielectric constant of planarly aligned ferronematic and nematic phases were examined. The decrease of the real part of electric permittivity in the ferronematic phase and the creation of ferroelectric order in the nematic phase under the DC field were demonstrated. The analysis of the results reveals the latching of the ferroelectric state. The applied DC field created a ferroelectric mode in the nematic phase. A new model of collective and molecular relaxations considering the domain structure of the ferronematic phase was proposed. The temperature and DC field dependence of dielectric properties were shown. The spontaneous polarization was measured using the field reversal technique. The spontaneous polarization value exhibits a maximum at the fixed temperature.</description>

      <title>Dual tunability of selective reflection by light and electric field for self-organizing materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oblique helicoidal structure is formed in right-angle cholesterics under the applied electric field. The electric field changes the pitch and cone angle but preserves the single-harmonic modulation of the refractive index. As a result, in such a supramolecular system, we can tune the selective reflection of light in a broad range. Here, we report that structural colors can be tuned by simultaneously illuminating the structure with UV light and the action of an electric field. The cholesterics with the oblique helicoidal structure were doped with newly designed rod-like, chiral, and bent-shaped azo-photosensitive materials characterized by a very low rate of thermal back isomerization. The isomerization of the photo-active compounds under UV light causes the red shift of the selective light reflection in the cholesteric mixtures. We found that the molecular structure of the photosensitive materials used affects the reflection coefficient, bandwidth, response time to UV irradiation, and tuning range. The effect was explained by considering the effect of molecular matching, cis-trans isomerization, and electric field action. We investigated the dynamics of molecular changes in the oblique helicoidal structure under the influence of external factors. The designed supramolecular system has the potential application in soft matter UV detectors.</description>

      <title>Melting of non reciprocal solids: how dislocations propel and fission in flowing crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When soft matter is driven out of equilibrium its constituents interact via effective interactions that escape Newton's action-reaction principle. Prominent examples include the hydrodynamic interactions between colloidal particles driven in viscous fluids, phoretic interactions between chemically active colloids, and quorum sensing interactions in bacterial colonies. Despite a recent surge of interest in non-reciprocal physics a fundamental question remains : do non-reciprocal interactions alter or strengthen the ordered phases of matter driven out of equilibrium? Here, through a combination of experiments and simulations, we show how nonreciprocal forces propel and fission dislocations formed in hydrodynamically driven Wigner crystals. We explain how dislocation motility results in the continuous reshaping of grain-boundary networks, and how their fission reaction melts driven crystals from their interfaces. Beyond the specifics of hydrodynamics, we argue theoretically that topological defects and nonreciprocal interactions should invariably conspire to deform and ultimately destroy crystals whose the elementary units defy Newton's third law</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Granular Material Flow: Discrete Element Method and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare two widely used Lagrangian approaches for modeling granular materials: the Discrete Element Method (DEM) and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). DEM models individual particle interactions, while SPH treats granular materials as a continuum using constitutive rheological models. In particular, we employ the Drucker Prager viscoplastic model for SPH. By examining key parameters unique to each method, such as the coefficient of restitution in DEM and the dilatancy angle in SPH, we assess their influence on two dimensional soil collapse predictions against experimental results. While DEM requires computationally expensive parameter calibration, SPH benefits from a continuum scale rheological model, allowing most parameters to be directly determined from laboratory measurements and requiring significantly fewer particles. However, despite its computational efficiency, viscoplastic SPH struggles to capture complex granular flow behaviors observed in DEM, particularly in rotating drum simulations. In contrast, DEM offers greater versatility, accommodating a broader range of flow patterns while maintaining a relatively simple model formulation. These findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of each method, aiding the selection of appropriate modeling techniques for granular flow simulations.</description>

      <title>Approximation of anisotropic pair potentials using multivariate interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between two particles with shape or interaction anisotropy can be modeled using a pairwise potential energy function that depends on their relative position and orientation; however, this function is often challenging to mathematically formulate. Data-driven approaches for approximating anisotropic pair potentials have gained significant interest due to their flexibility and generality but often require large sets of training data, potentially limiting their feasibility when training data is computationally demanding to collect. Here, we investigate the use of multivariate polynomial interpolation to approximate anisotropic pair potentials from a limited set of prescribed particle configurations. We consider both standard Chebyshev polynomial interpolation as well as mixed-basis polynomial interpolation that uses trigonometric polynomials for coordinates along which the pair potential is known to be periodic. We exploit mathematical reasoning and physical knowledge to refine the interpolation domain and to design our interpolants. We test our approach on two-dimensional and three-dimensional model anisotropic nanoparticles, finding satisfactory approximations can be constructed in all cases.</description>

      <title>Self Consistent Field Theory of isotropic-nematic interfaces and disclinations in a semiflexible molecule nematic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Self Consistent Field Theory description of equilibrium, but non uniform, configurations adopted by semi flexible liquid crystal molecules is presented. Two cases are considered, isotropic-nematic phase boundaries, and topological defects in the nematic phase (disclinations). Nematogens are modeled by worm-like chains, with microscopic interaction potential of the Maier-Saupe type, with an added isotropic excluded volume contribution. The thermodynamic fields obtained by numerical minimization of the free energy are the molecular density and the nematic tensor order parameter. Interfaces with both homeotropic and planar alignment are studied, as well as biaxiality and anisotropy around $\pm 1/2$ disclinations. The effects induced by fluid compressibility, interaction strength, and elastic anisotropy that follows from chain flexibility on both types of non-uniform configurations are discussed. Defect core sizes decrease as the system becomes less compressible, eventually reaching a constant value in the incompressible limit. The core size is influenced by the nematic interaction strength and chain persistence length, decreasing as the order increases in the nematic region through manipulation of persistence length and nematic interaction. Additionally, when the far field nematic order is fixed, the core size increases with the persistence length.</description>

      <title>Simple molecules and complex chemistry in a protoplanetary disk: A JWST investigation of the highly inclined disk d216-0939</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the number of detected molecules, particularly complex organic molecules, in the solid-state in astrophysical environments is still rather limited, laboratory experiments and astrochemical models predict many potential candidates. Detection of molecules in protoplanetary disks provides a bridge between the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium and the chemistry of planets and their atmospheres. The excellent spectral sensitivity, broad wavelength coverage and high spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allows for making progress in exploring chemical compositions of various astrophysical environments including planet-forming disks. They are a prerequisite for probing the disk content by means of sensitive absorption studies. In this paper, we present initial results of the JWST Cycle 1 GO program 1741 on d216-0939, a highly inclined TTauri disk located in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We utilise the NIRSpec and MIRI integral field unit spectrographs to cover its spectrum from 1.7 to 28~$\mu$m. In the d216-0939 disk, we give assignments of the composition of silicate grains. We unambiguously detect solid-state features of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, CO, OCN$^-$, and tentatively OCS; species that had been detected recently also in other circumstellar disks. For the first time in disks, we provide unique detections of ices carrying NH$_4^+$ and the complex organic molecule ammonium carbamate (NH$_4^+$NH$_2$COO$^-$). The latter detections speak for a very efficient NH$_3$ chemistry in the disk. We also show the very important role of scattering in the analysis of observational spectra of highly inclined disks.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of DNA-Templated Ultrafine Silver Nanowires Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research on silver nanowires prepared on DNA templates has focused on two fundamental applications: nano-scale circuits and sensors. Despite its broad potential, the formation kinetics of DNA-templated silver nanowires remains unclear. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of the formation of silver nanowires with a diameter of 2.2+0.4 nm at the single-molecule level through chemical reduction. We conducted equilibrium and perturbation kinetic experiments to measure force spectroscopy during the formation of Ag+ -DNA complexes and Ag-DNA complexes, using optical tweezers combined with microfluidics. The addition of AgNO3 resulted in an increase in force of 5.5-7.5 pN within 2 minutes, indicating that Ag+ compacts the DNA structure. In contrast, the addition of hydroquinone caused the force to decrease by 4-5 pN. Morphological characterization confirmed the presence of a dense structure formed by silver atoms bridging the DNA strands, and revealed conformational differences before and after metallization. We compare our experimental data with Brownian dynamics simulations using a coarse-grained double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) model that provides insights on the dependency of the force on the persistence length.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective optimization for targeted self-assembly among competing polymorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most approaches for designing self-assembled materials focus on the thermodynamic stability of a target structure or crystal polymorph. Yet in practice, the outcome of a self-assembly process is often controlled by kinetic pathways. Here we present an efficient machine learning-guided design algorithm to identify globally optimal interaction potentials that maximize both the thermodynamic yield and kinetic accessibility of a target polymorph. We show that optimal potentials exist along a Pareto front, indicating the possibility of a trade-off between the thermodynamic and kinetic objectives. Although the extent of this trade-off depends on the target polymorph and the assembly conditions, we generically find that the trade-off arises from a competition among alternative polymorphs: The most kinetically optimal potentials, which favor the target polymorph on short timescales, tend to stabilize a competing polymorph at longer times. Our work establishes a general-purpose approach for multi-objective self-assembly optimization, reveals fundamental trade-offs between crystallization speed and defect formation in the presence of competing polymorphs, and suggests guiding principles for materials design algorithms that optimize for kinetic accessibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During drying, particle-laden sessile droplets will leave so-called coffee-stain rings behind. This phenomenon is well-known and well-understood (Deegan et al., Nature 389, 827-829 (1997)). Here we show that when particle-laden droplets confined in a slit are allowed to evaporate very slowly, they do not deposit coffee rings, but form a surprisingly intricate, circular maze-like pattern. We present experiments that illustrate this pattern formation and discuss the factors that determine when such patterns can form. We are not aware of reports of natural examples of the formation of such beautiful patterns under confinement, although it seems likely that they exist.</description>
