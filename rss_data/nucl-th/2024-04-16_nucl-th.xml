      <title>Correlation between the charge radii difference in mirror partner nuclei and the symmetry energy slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlation between the charge radii difference of mirror partner nuclei $\Delta{R_{\mathrm{ch}}}$ and the slope parameter $L$ of symmetry energy has been built to ascertain the equation of state of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter. In this work, the influence of pairing correlations and isoscalar compression modulus on the $\Delta{R_{\mathrm{ch}}}$ are systematically investigated by Skyrme density functionals theory. The calculated results suggest that the linear correlation between $\Delta{R_{\mathrm{ch}}}$ and $L$ is decreased by the surface pairing correlations. The slope parameter deduced from the difference of charge radii of mirror-pair nuclei $^{32}$Ar-$^{32}$Si, $^{36}$Ca-$^{36}$S, $^{38}$Ca-$^{38}$Ar, and $^{54}$Ni-$^{54}$Fe falls into the range of $L=42.57$-$50.64$ MeV, namely the rather soft equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter. Besides, the range of slope parameter can also be influenced by the effective forces classified by various isoscalar incompressibility coefficients.</description>

      <title>Spin entanglement of multinucleons: experimental prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiprotons and multineutrons are among the most exotic and mysterious things ever produced on earth. They provide an exceptional opportunity to understand nuclear forces and nuclear dynamics at extreme conditions, as well as neutron stars in the heaven. Quantum entanglement, referred to as ``spooky action at a distance'' by Einstein, is a ubiquitous yet deep property of quantum systems. It not only occupies a central position in quantum information science but also is investigated intensively in high energy physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum gravity. In comparison, the study of nuclear entanglement is still in infancy, and the entanglement properties of multiprotons and multineutrons in free space are generally unknown. Here, we study the crucial problem of how to measure spin entanglement of these multinucleons in nuclear experiments, with special emphases on two- and three-nucleon states. These findings open a freshly new direction for the multinucleon research. They are also useful for understanding entanglement properties of other exotic nuclear objects.</description>

      <title>Historical introduction to ultra peripheral collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a brief history of photons, both soft and hard, real and virtual. About 150-100 years ago, Maxwell and Einstein discovered intriguing properties of electromagnetic fields and how to understand them both macroscopically and microscopically. Decades later, physicists developed the theory of renormalized quantum electrodynamics (QED), an incredibly accurate theory describing interactions of photons and other particles. Photons are used everywhere in academia and technological devices, from supermarket lasers and doors to academic studies in atomic, nuclear, and particle physics. In this article, I attempt to convey how the field of relativistic heavy ions rediscovered ultra-peripheral collisions (UPC) as a source of intense, almost real photons, and how it permits the study of a plethora of phenomena in the aforementioned academic fields. These phenomena are not always accessible by other means.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of neutron-skin thickness and neutron-star observables based on effective nuclear interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have obtained the constraints on the density dependence of the symmetry energy from neutron-skin thickness data by parity-violating electron scatterings and neutron-star observables using a Bayesian approach, based on the standard Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) model and its extension as well as the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. While the neutron-skin thickness data (neutron-star observables) mostly constrain the symmetry energy at subsaturation (suprasaturation) densities, they may more or less constrain the behavior of the symmetry energy at suprasaturation (subsaturation) densities, depending on the energy-density functional form. Besides showing the final posterior density dependence of the symmetry energy, we also compare the slope parameters of the symmetry energy at 0.10 fm$^{-3}$ as well as the values of the symmetry energy at twice saturation density from three effective nuclear interactions. The present work serves as a comparison study based on relativistic and nonrelativistic energy-density functionals for constraining the nuclear symmetry energy from low to high densities using a Bayesian approach.</description>

      <title>Global prediction of nuclear charge density distributions using deep neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) has been developed to generate the distributions of nuclear charge density, utilizing the training data from the relativistic density functional theory and incorporating available experimental charge radii of 1014 nuclei into the loss function. The DNN achieved a root-mean-square (rms) deviation of 0.0193 fm for charge radii on its validation set. Furthermore, the DNN can improve the description in both the tail and central regions of the charge density, enhancing agreement with experimental findings. The model's predictive capability has been further validated by its agreement with recent experimental data on charge radii. Finally, this refined model is employed to predict the charge density distributions in a wider range of nuclide chart, and the parameterized charge densities, charge radii, and higher-order moments of charge density distributions are given, providing a robust reference for future experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>1/2$^-$ $\alpha$ cluster resonances of $^{13}$C studied by the analytic continuation in the coupling constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1/2$^-$ resonant states in $^{13}{\rm C}$ are investigated to search for the Hoyle-analog state. In order to treat the resonance states located around the 3$\alpha+n$ threshold, the analytic continuation in the coupling constant (ACCC) has been combined with the real-time evolution method (REM). The properties of the 1/2$^-$ resonance states such as the radii and monopole transition probabilities are calculated. We show the 1/2$^-_3$ and 1/2$^-_4$ states are well-developed $\alpha$ cluster states, and the 1/2$^-_4$ state is a candidate of the Hoyle-analog state.</description>

      <title>Nuclear cluster structure effect in $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions at the top RHIC energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of nuclear structure has garnered considerable attention in the high-energy nuclear physics community in recent years. This work focuses on studying the potential nuclear cluster structure in $^{16}\text{O}$ nuclei using anisotropic flow observables in $\rm O+O$ collisions at 200 GeV. Employing an improved AMPT model with various cluster structure configurations, we find that an extended effective parton formation time is necessary to align with the recent STAR experimental data. In addition, we reveal that the presented flow observables serve as sensitive probes for differentiating configurations of $\alpha$-clustering of $^{16}\text{O}$ nuclei. The systematic AMPT calculations presented in this paper, along with comprehensive comparisons to forthcoming experimental measurements at RHIC and the LHC, pave the way for a novel approach to investigate the $\alpha$-clustering structure of $^{16}\text{O}$ nuclei using $\rm O+O$ collisions at the ultra-relativistic energies.</description>

      <title>The NICER data and a $\sigma$-field dependent stiffness of the hadronic equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyses for the NICER data indicate that there is no significant variation of the compact star radii within the mass range of 1.4 to 2.0 solar masses. Yamamoto et al. [Phys. Rev. C 108, 035811 (2023)] concluded recently that ``this feature cannot be reproduced by the hadronic matter due to the softening of the equation of state (EoS) by hyperon mixing, suggesting the possible existence of quark phases in neutron-star interiors.'' Using a collection of 162 purely nucleonic, hyperonic, and quarkish EoSs from CompOSE database and some other works, we verify that hyperons indeed lead to a significant difference in radii of stars of 1.4 and 2.0 solar masses, which diminishes in the presence of quarks. We compare the shapes of the mass-radius curves and show that hyperons and quarks in the neutron star cores prefer a particular curve shape with backbending. It is argued that the shape {is controlled by the density dependence} of the nuclear symmetry energy. We draw attention to the existence of a class of purely hadronic relativistic mean-field EoSs with scalar-field dependent hadron masses and coupling constants that satisfy the known constraints on the EoSs including the analyses of the new NICER data and the above requirement of no significant variation of the neutron star radii.</description>

      <title>Charmonium Transport in Ultra-Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an update on our semi-classical transport approach for quarkonium production in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, focusing on $J/\psi$ and $\psi(2S)$ mesons in 5.02 TeV Pb-Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at both forward and mid-rapidity. In particular, we employ the most recent charm-production cross sections reported in pp collisions, which are pivotal for the magnitude of the regeneration contribution, and their modifications due to cold-nuclear-matter (CNM) effects. Multi-differential observables are calculated in terms of nuclear modification factors as a function of centrality, transverse momentum, and rapidity, including the contributions from bottom-decay feeddown. For our predictions for $\psi(2S)$ production, the mechanism of sequential regeneration relative to the more strongly bound $J/\psi$ meson plays an important role in interpreting recent ALICE data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review, we present the most key aspects of modern thermal perturbation theory based on hard thermal loop (HTL) approximation including its theoretical foundations and discuss some applications within quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum chromodynamics (QCD) plasma. To maintain conciseness, our discussion is confined to thermal equilibrium scenarios, but consider a variety of different quantities and settings. Specifically, we discuss both bulk thermodynamic properties and real-time observables, spanning the domain of high temperatures, relevant for heavy-ion physics.</description>

      <title>Study of transport properties of a hot and dense QCD matter using a novel approximation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have studied the charge and heat transport properties of a hot and dense QCD matter using a novel approximation method within the quasiparticle model. Utilizing a novel collision integral for both the relaxation time approximation (RTA) and the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) models, we have solved the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation to estimate the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity. We have investigated the temperature dependence of these transport coefficients. We have also provided a comparison between our findings and those of the standard RTA and BGK models. Further, we have explored the temperature dependence of the thermal diffusion constant and the Lorenz number using the novel approaches of the aforesaid models.</description>

      <title>Upper Limit of Sound Speed in Nuclear Matter: A Harmonious Interplay of Transport Calculation and Perturbative QCD Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very recently, it has been shown that there is an upper bound on the squared sound speed of nuclear matter from the transport, which reads $c_{\rm s}^2 \leq 0.781$ \citep{2024arXiv240214085H}. In this work, we demonstrate that this upper bound is corroborated by the reconstructed equation of state (EOS) for ultra-dense matter. The reconstruction integrates multi-messenger observation for neutron stars (NSs), as well as the theoretical constraints, including that from chiral effective field theory and perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD). In particular, the latest radius measurements for PSR J0437-4715 ($11.36^{+0.95}_{-0.63}$ km) and PSR J0030+0451 ($11.71^{+0.88}_{-0.83}$ km, in the ST+PDT model) by NICER have been adopted. The result shows in all cases, the $c_{\rm s}^2 \leq 0.781$ upper limit for EOS will naturally yield the properties of matter near center of the massive neutron star consistent with the causality-driven constraint from pQCD, where in practice, the constraint is applied at ten nuclear saturation density ($n_{\rm L}=10n_{\rm s}$). We also note that there is a strong correlation for the maximum square of sound speed $c_s^2$ with $n_{\rm L}$, and $c_{\rm s}^2 \leq 0.781$ is somehow violated when $n_{\rm L} = n_{\rm c,TOV}$. The result indicates that a higher density in implementing the pQCD constraint, even considering the uncertainties from statistics, is more natural. Moreover, the remarkable agreement between the outcomes derived from these two distinct and independent constraints (i.e., the transport calculation and pQCD boundary) lends strong support to their validity.</description>

      <title>Electrical conductivity of QGP with quasiparticle quarks and Gribov gluon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electrical conductivity of a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium using non-perturbative resummation via Gribov gluon propagator. To calculate the electrical conductivity, we utilize the relativistic Boltzmann's kinetic equation, within the relaxation-time approximation (RTA). The relaxation times are obtained by computing the microscopic two-body scattering amplitude. We adopt the quasiparticle approach, which allows us to comprehend the transport properties in both the weak and strong coupling regimes. Above the transition temperature, we estimate the electrical conductivity of the quark-gluon plasma using the Gribov prescription and compare our findings with lattice results and various phenomenological models. We find our results in close agreement with the lattice data.</description>

      <title>A machine learning-based study of open-charm hadrons in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions, the study of charm hadrons plays a pivotal role in understanding the QCD medium and provides an undisputed testing ground for the theory of strong interaction, as they are mostly produced in the early stages of collisions via hard partonic interactions. The lightest open-charm, $D^{0}$ meson ($c\bar{u}$), can originate from two separate sources. The prompt $D^{0}$ originates from direct charm production or decay of excited open charm states, and the nonprompt stems from the decay of beauty hadrons. In this paper, using different machine learning (ML) algorithms such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forest, an attempt has been made to segregate the prompt and nonprompt production modes of $D^{0}$ meson signal from its background. The ML models are trained using the invariant mass ($M_{\pi K}$) through its hadronic decay channel, i.e., $D^{0}\rightarrow\pi^{+} K^{-}$, pseudoproper time ($t_{z}$), pseudoproper decay length ($c\tau$), and distance of closest approach of $D^{0}$ meson, using PYTHIA8 simulated $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\rm{TeV}$. The ML models used in this analysis are found to retain the pseudorapidity, transverse momentum, and collision energy dependence. In addition, we report the ratio of nonprompt to prompt $D^{0}$ yield, the self-normalized yield of prompt and nonprompt $D^{0}$ and explore the charmonium, $J/\psi$ to open-charm, $D^{0}$ yield ratio as a function of transverse momenta and normalized multiplicity. The observables studied in this manuscript are well predicted by all the ML models compared to the simulation.</description>

      <title>Efficient solver of relativistic hydrodynamics with implicit Runge-Kutta method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method to solve the relativistic hydrodynamic equations based on implicit Runge-Kutta methods with a locally optimized fixed-point iterative solver. For numerical demonstration, we implement our idea for ideal hydrodynamics using the one-stage Gauss-Legendre method as an implicit method. The accuracy and computational cost of our new method are compared with those of explicit ones for the (1+1)-dimensional Riemann problem, as well as the (2+1)-dimensional Gubser flow and event-by-event initial conditions for heavy-ion collisions generated by TrENTo. We demonstrate that the solver converges with only one iteration in most cases, and as a result, the implicit method requires a smaller computational cost than the explicit one at the same accuracy in these cases, while it may not converge with an unrealistically large $\Delta t$. By showing a relationship between the one-stage Gauss-Legendre method with the iterative solver and the two-step Adams-Bashforth method, we argue that our method benefits from both the stability of the former and the efficiency of the latter.</description>

      <title>Maximally local two-nucleon interactions at N$^3$LO in $\Delta$-less chiral effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new maximally local two-nucleon interactions derived in $\Delta$-less chiral effective field theory up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO), which include all contact and pion-exchange contributions to the nuclear Hamiltonian up to this order. Our interactions are fit to nucleon-nucleon phase shifts using a Bayesian statistical approach, and explore a wide cutoff range from $0.6-0.9$ fm ($\approx 660 - 440$ MeV). These interactions can be straightforwardly employed in quantum Monte Carlo methods, such as the auxiliary field diffusion Monte Carlo method. Together with local three-nucleon forces, calculations with these new interactions will provide improved benchmarks for the structure of atomic nuclei and serve as crucial input to analyses of astrophysical phenomena of neutron stars, such as binary neutron-star mergers.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative study of quantum many-body correlation effects in neutron stars: Equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although neutron stars have been studied for decades, their internal structure remains enigmatic, mainly due to large uncertainties in the equation of state. In neutron stars, nucleons are strongly interacting by exchanging mesons, which leads to significant quantum many-body correlation effects. Previous mean-field calculations failed to capture these effects. Here, we develop a non-perturbative quantum field-theoretic approach to handle strongly correlated nuclear matters. Based on a linear $\sigma$-$\omega$-$\rho$ model with a density-dependent isovector coupling $\Gamma_{\rho}$, we reproduce all the six frequently-used nuclear matter observables by tuning six parameters. After including quantum many-body effects into the equation of state of realistic neutron-star matters, we obtain a mass-radius relation that is in good agreement with recent astrophysical observations. Our results show that the maximal neutron-star mass supported by neutron-dominated matters is $\sim 2.67M_{\odot}$, where $M_{\odot}$ is solar mass.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of magnetized quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong transient magnetic fields are generated in non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions. These fields induce anisotropy within the strongly interacting medium that, in principle, can affect the thermodynamic properties of the medium. We use the Polyakov loop extended Nambu Jona-Lasinio model to study the quark matter subjected to an external magnetic field at vanishing baryon chemical potential ($\mu_{B}$). We have estimated the degree of anisotropy in the speed of sound and isothermal compressibility within the magnetized quark matter as a function of temperature ($T$) and magnetic field ($eB$). This study helps us to understand the extent of directionality generated in the initial stages of non-central collisions while giving us useful information about the system.</description>

      <title>Improved Standard-Model prediction for ${K_L\to \ell^+\ell^-}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive calculation of the $K_L\to\gamma^*\gamma^*$ form factor in dispersion theory, using input from the leptonic decays $K_L\to\ell^+\ell^-\gamma$, $K_L\to \ell_1^+\ell_1^-\ell_2^+\ell_2^-$, the hadronic mode $K_L\to \pi^+\pi^-\gamma$, the normalization $K_L\to\gamma\gamma$, and the matching to asymptotic constraints. As key result we obtain an improved determination of the long-distance contribution to $K_L\to\ell^+\ell^-$, leading to the Standard-Model predictions $\text{Br}[K_L\to\mu^+\mu^-]=7.44^{+0.41}_{-0.34}\times 10^{-9}$, $\text{Br}[K_L\to e^+e^-]=8.46(37)\times 10^{-12}$, and more stringent limits on physics beyond the Standard Model. We provide a detailed breakdown of the current uncertainty, and delineate how future experiments and the interplay with lattice QCD could help further improve the precision.</description>

      <title>Space-like Electromagnetic Form Factors of Lambda- and Sigma-Baryons from Quark-Diquark Faddeev Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important goal of ongoing and future experiments is to explore spectra and transition form factors of baryons with non-zero strangeness. Of particular interest is the transition form factor$\gamma^{(*)} \Sigma^0 \rightarrow \Lambda$ in the time-like momentum region that can be extracted from Dalitz decays. On the road towards a theoretical description of these form factors we extend a covariant dynamical quark-diquark model for the baryon Faddeev equation to the strange-quark sector. Based on an excellent description of the mass spectrum of selected baryon octet and decuplet states and reasonable results for the nucleon form factors we determine the elastic electromagnetic form factors of $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^+, \Sigma^0, \Sigma^-$ hyperons in the space-like region as well as the ones for the octet transition $\gamma^{(*)} \Sigma^0 \rightarrow \Lambda$.
  We discuss qualitative and quantitative features of the diquark-quark picture and compare systematically with previous results from a three-body Faddeev approach and lattice data where available.</description>

      <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Small-$x$ Evolution: Exact Results in the Large-$N_c$ Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an exact solution to the revised small-$x$ orbital angular momentum (OAM) evolution equations derived recently, based on an earlier work. These equations are derived in the double logarithmic approximation (summing powers of $\alpha_s \ln^2(1/x)$ with $\alpha_s$ the strong coupling constant and $x$ the Bjorken $x$ variable) and the large-$N_c$ limit, with $N_c$ the number of quark colors. From our solution, we extract the small-$x$, large-$N_c$ expressions of the quark and gluon OAM distributions. Additionally, we determine the large-$N_c$ small-$x$ asymptotics of the OAM distributions to be
  \begin{align}
  \notag
  L_{q+\bar{q}}(x,Q^2) \sim L_G(x,Q^2) \sim \Delta \Sigma (x,Q^2) \sim \Delta G(x,Q^2) \sim \left(\frac{1}{x} \right)^{\alpha_h},
  \end{align}
with the intercept $\alpha_h$ the same as obtained in the small-$x$ helicity evolution, which can be approximated as $\alpha_h \approx 3.66074 \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{2\pi}}$. This result is in complete agreement with the literature. Additionally, we calculate the ratio of the quark and gluon OAM distributions to the flavor-singlet quark and gluon helicity parton distribution functions respectively in the small-$x$ region.</description>

      <title>Threshold photoproduction of $\eta_c$ and $\eta_b$ using holographic QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility that threshold photoproduction of $\eta_{c,b}$ may be sensitive to the pseudovector $1^{+-}$ glueball exchange. We use the holographic construction to identify the pseudovector glueball with the Kalb-Ramond field, minimally coupled to bulk Dirac fermions. We derive the holographic C-odd form factor and its respective charge radius. Using the pertinent Witten diagrams, we derive and analyze the differential photoproduction cross section for $\eta_{c,b}$ in the threshold regime, including the interference from the dual bulk photon exchange with manifest vector dominance. The possibility of measuring this process at current and future electron facilities is discussed.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy dibaryons as seen by string theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09026v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the stringy description of the system consisting of two heavy and four light quarks in the case of two light flavors of equal mass. As an application, we consider the three low-lying Born-Oppenheimer potentials as a function of the heavy quark separation. Our analysis shows that the ground state potential is described in terms of both hadro-quarkonia and hadronic molecules. A connected string configuration makes the dominant contribution to the potential of an excited state at small separations, and for separations larger than $0.1\,\text{fm}$, it exhibits the diquark-diquark-diquark structure $[Qq][Qq][qq]$. For better understanding the quark organization inside the system, we introduce several critical separations related to the processes of string reconnection, breaking and junction annihilation. We also discuss the simplest string configurations including the five-string junctions and their implications for the system, in particular the emergence of composite quark objects different from diquarks and the process of junction fusion.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Collins-Soper Kernel from Chiral Quarks with Physical Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the rapidity anomalous dimension of quark transverse-momentum-dependent distributions, i.e., the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel, up to transverse separations of about 1 fm. This unitary lattice calculation is conducted, for the first time, employing the chiral-symmetry-preserving domain wall fermion discretization and physical values of light and strange quark masses. The CS kernel is extracted from the ratios of pion quasi-transverse-momentum-dependent wave functions (quasi-TMDWFs) at next-to-leading logarithmic perturbative accuracy. Also for the first time, we utilize the recently proposed Coulomb-gauge-fixed quasi-TMDWF correlator without a Wilson line. We observe significantly slower signal decay with increasing quark separations compared to the established gauge-invariant method with a staple-shaped Wilson line. This enables us to determine the CS kernel at large nonperturbative transverse separations and find its near-linear dependence on the latter. Our result is consistent with the recent lattice calculation using gauge-invariant quasi-TMDWFs, and agrees with various recent phenomenological parametrizations of experimental data.</description>
