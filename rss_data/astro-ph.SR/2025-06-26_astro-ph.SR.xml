      <title>Interior rotation modelling of the $\beta$ Cep pulsator HD 192575 including multiplet asymmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotation plays an important role in stellar evolution. However, the mechanisms behind the transport of angular momentum in stars at various stages of their evolution are not well understood. To improve our understanding of these processes, it is necessary to measure and validate the internal rotation profiles of stars across different stages of evolution and mass regimes. Our aim is to constrain the internal rotation profile of the 12Msun $\beta$ Cep pulsator HD 192575 from the observed pulsational multiplets and the asymmetries of their component frequencies. We update the forward asteroseismic modelling of HD 192575 based on new TESS observations. We invert for the rotation profile from the symmetric part of the splittings, and compute the multiplet asymmetries due to the Coriolis force and stellar deformation treated perturbatively. We compare the computed asymmetries with the observed asymmetries. Our new forward asteroseismic modelling is in agreement with previous results, but with increased uncertainties, partially due to increased frequency precision, requiring us to relax certain constraints. Ambiguity in the mode identification is the main source of the uncertainty, which also affects the inferred rotation profiles. Almost all acceptable rotation profiles occur in the regime below 0.4/d and favour weak radial differential rotation, with a ratio of core and envelope rotation below two. We find that the quality of the match between the observed and theoretically predicted mode asymmetries is strongly dependent on the mode identification and the internal structure of the star. Our results offer the first detailed rotation inversion for a $\beta$ Cep pulsator. They show that the rotation profile and the mode asymmetries provide a valuable tool to further constrain the evolutionary properties of HD 192575, and in particular the details of angular momentum transport in massive stars.</description>

      <title>Statistical analysis of interplanetary shock waves measured by a Solar Wind Analyzer and a magnetometer onboard the Solar Orbiter Mission in 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interplanetary (IP) shock waves are greatly interesting, as they represent significant phenomena in near-Earth space and are direct drivers of geomagnetic and radiation storms. Moreover, various data and parameters are being explored for the identification and characterization of these waves. The spatial dimensions of shock waves vary significantly with the conditions and parameters of the propagating medium. For example, the radii of curvature of the shock wave fronts can vary by several hundred Earth radii or more in the inner heliosphere. In this study, we improved the semi-automated identification of shock waves by analyzing the solar wind and IP magnetic field (MF) parameters. More precisely, we analyzed the data recorded by the Proton Alpha Sensor of the Solar Wind Analyzer (SWA-PAS) and magnetometer (MAG) onboard the Solar Orbiter (SolO) mission. These data were collected and analyzed during the SolO journey around the Sun in 2023 at distances of 0.29...0.95 AU. Employing the developed algorithm, we identified over 40 IP-shock waves that occurred in 2023 using SWA-PAS and MAG. Additionally, we determined and presented a list of shock types and their basic parameters, kinetic and magnetohydrodynamic. The compression ratios, plasma beta ${\beta}_{us}$, angle between the shock normal and upstream MF ${\theta}{_B}{_n}$, Mach number, and others were among these parameters. Furthermore, we investigated the statistical distributions of the ${\theta}{_B}{_n}$ and ${\beta}_{us}$ parameters in the upstream region. Finally, the dependence of number of the identified shock waves as a function of the distance away from the Sun was explored; the number of shocks increased gradually with the increasing heliocentric distance.</description>

      <title>Empirically Predicted Absolute Magnitudes for Red Clump Stars in Mephisto and CSST Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red clump (RC) stars are reliable standard candles for studying the structure and evolution of the Milky Way. In this study, we present empirical calibrations of RC absolute magnitudes in the Mephisto (v, g, r, i) and CSST (g, r, i) photometric systems using a high-purity sample of 25,059 RC stars cross-matched between APOGEE and Gaia DR3 XP spectra. Through synthetic photometry and polynomial fitting, we find that RC absolute magnitudes exhibit strong dependencies on effective temperature and metallicity, with the strongest variations observed in bluer bands and progressively decreasing towards redder wavelengths. In particular, the Mephisto v band exhibits the highest sensitivity, with variations reaching up to 2.0 mag across the metallicity range (-1.0 dex &lt;[Fe/H] &lt;0.5 dex) and the temperature range (4500-5200 K). The calibrations achieve high precision for all bands, enabling accurate determination of RC absolute magnitudes and distances. Furthermore, we evaluate the metallicity estimation capabilities of both systems using a Random Forest-based method, achieving a precision of 0.12 dex for Mephisto and 0.14 dex for CSST under typical photometric uncertainties (&lt; 0.01 mag). These results provide robust tools for distance and metallicity determinations, supporting future Galactic structure studies with Mephisto and CSST data.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Time-Dependent Diffusive Shock Acceleration in the 2022 September 5 Solar Energetic Particle Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On 2022 September 5, a large solar energetic particle (SEP) event was detected by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO), at heliocentric distances of 0.07 and 0.71 au, respectively. PSP observed an unusual velocity-dispersion signature: particles below $\sim$1 MeV exhibited a normal velocity dispersion, while higher-energy particles displayed an inverse velocity arrival feature, with the most energetic particles arriving later than those at lower energies. The maximum energy increased from about 20-30 MeV upstream to over 60 MeV downstream of the shock. The arrival of SEPs at PSP was significantly delayed relative to the expected onset of the eruption. In contrast, SolO detected a typical large SEP event characterized by a regular velocity dispersion at all energies up to 100 MeV. To understand these features, we simulate particle acceleration and transport from the shock to the observers with our newly developed SEP model - Particle ARizona and MIchigan Solver on Advected Nodes (PARMISAN). Our results reveal that the inverse velocity arrival and delayed particle onset detected by PSP originate from the time-dependent diffusive shock acceleration processes. After shock passage, PSP's magnetic connectivity gradually shifted due to its high velocity near perihelion, detecting high-energy SEPs streaming sunward. Conversely, SolO maintained a stable magnetic connection to the strong shock region where efficient acceleration was achieved. These results underscore the importance of spatial and temporal dependence in SEP acceleration at interplanetary shocks, and provide new insights to understand SEP variations in the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>A systematic study of hot O production and escape from Martian atmosphere in response to enhanced EUV Irradiance from Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the evolution of Martian atmosphere and its response to EUV irradiation is an extremely important topic in planetary science. One of the dominant effects of atmospheric losses is the photochemical escape of atomic oxygen from Mars. Increasing the magnitude of the irradiation changes the response of the atmosphere. The purpose of the current paper is to analyze the effects of enhanced EUV irradiation on the escape rates of oxygen atoms. We have used the solar flare of 2017 September 10 as the baseline flare intensity and varied the intensity of the flare from a factor of 3 up to 10 times the baseline flare. We see an increase in the escape flux by 40% for flares up to 5x the intensity of the baseline flare. However, beyond this point, the increase in escape flux tapers off, reaching only about 17% above the baseline. At 10x the baseline flare intensity, the escape flux decreases by nearly 25% compared to the escape rate of the original flare. We also found that the total escape amount of hot O peaks at 7x the original flare intensity. Additionally, we have studied the effects of the time scales over which the flare energy is delivered. We find that energy dissipative processes like radiative cooling and thermal collisions do not come into play instantaneously. The escape flux from higher intensity flares dominate initially, but as time progresses, energy dissipative processes have a significant effect on the escape rate.</description>

      <title>Signatures of planets and Galactic subpopulations in solar analogs. Precise chemical abundances with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to obtain precise atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances automatically for solar twins and analogs to find signatures of exoplanets, as well as to assess how peculiar the Sun is compared to these stars and to analyze any possible fine structures in the Galactic thin disk. We developed a neural network (NN) algorithm using Python to obtain these parameters for a sample of 99 solar twins and solar analogs previously studied in the literature from normalized high-quality spectra from HARPS, with a resolving power of R $\sim$ 115000 and a signal-to-noise ratio S/N &gt; 400. We obtained precise atmospheric parameters and abundance ratios [X/Fe] of 20 chemical elements (Li, C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, and Ba). The results are in line with the literature, with average differences and standard deviations of $(2 \pm 27)$ K for T$_{\rm eff}$, $(0.00 \pm 0.06)$ dex for log g, $(0.00 \pm 0.02)$ dex for [Fe/H], $(-0.01 \pm 0.05)$ km s$^{-1}$ for microturbulence velocity, $(0.02 \pm 0.08)$ km s$^{-1}$ for the macro turbulence velocity, and $(-0.12 \pm 0.26)$ km s$^{-1}$ for the projected rotational velocity (vsin$i$). Regarding the chemical abundances, most of the elements agree with the literature within 0.01 - 0.02 dex. The abundances were corrected from the effects of the Galactic chemical evolution and analyzed with the condensation temperature (T$_{\rm cond}$) to verify whether the stars presented depletion of refractories compared to volatiles. We found that the Sun is more depleted in refractory elements compared to volatiles than 89% of the studied solar analogs, with a significance of 9.5$\sigma$ when compared to the stars without detected exoplanets. We also found the possible presence of three subpopulations in the solar analogs: one Cu-rich, one Cu-poor, and the last one slightly older and poor in Na.</description>

      <title>The mixing of internal gravity waves and lithium production in intermediate-mass AGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars influence Galactic lithium evolution by ejecting surface material (including Li) via stellar winds. Internal gravity waves (IGW), excited by convective motions, drive turbulent mixing in non-convective regions, altering stellar surface and wind chemistry. Aims: Investigate IGW-induced extra-mixing in the radiative zone between thermal pulses and convective envelopes of AGB stars and its impact on Li production. Derive the total Li contribution from intermediate-mass AGB stars using stellar models and initial mass functions. Methods: Construct stellar models (from zero-age main sequence to AGB end) with MESA, incorporating IGW-induced mixing and element diffusion. Calculate Li yields for stars of varying masses and metallicities using grids and population synthesis. Results: IGW triggers extra-mixing during He-shell flashes, transporting Be-7 from the radiative zone to the convective envelope, where it decays into Li-7. The positive effect of IGW on Li yield decreases with initial stellar mass but increases with metallicity. Most AGB stars (3.5-7.5 solar masses) produce positive Li yields. The total Li yield with IGW mixing (approximately 15 solar masses) is twice that without, contributing about 10 percent to Galactic Li. Conclusions: Through this extra-mixing mechanism induced by IGW, AGB stars can achieve a maximum A(Li) exceeding 5 and intermediate-mass AGB stars significantly contribute to Li in the Galactic ISM. These findings underscore the crucial role of IGW in stellar evolution, particularly in enhancing Li production.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology with PBjam 2.0: measuring dipole mode frequencies in coupling regimes from main sequence to low-luminosity red giant stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PBjam is an open-source software package for measuring mode frequencies of solar-like oscillators. These frequencies help constrain stellar evolution models to precisely estimate masses, radii, and ages of stars. The overall aim of PBjam is to simplify this process to the point where it may be done by non-experts or performed on thousands of stars with minimal interaction. The initial release of PBjam was restricted to only identifying modes of $\ell=0$ and $\ell=2$, since these are the simplest to treat consistently across different stellar evolutionary stages. Here we introduce a new set of three separate models which lets PBjam automatically identify $\ell=1$ modes in stars that experience varying degrees of coupling between p- and g-modes. These include a simple asymptotic relation for p-modes which can be applied to main-sequence stars, a matrix formalism aimed at treating frequency dependent coupling in sub-giants, and a uniform coupling model which is suitable for red giants. These models follow the Bayesian methodology established in the first release of PBjam, where a large set of previous observations is used to construct a nonparametric prior probability density for the new set of model parameters. This extension allows PBjam to build a more complete description of the power due to oscillations across a wider range of evolutionary stages.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuned Supernova or Failed Explosion? Decoding the Origins of the G3425 Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A binary system (G3425) consisting of a massive unseen component and a red giant star on a nearly circular orbit was recently discovered. The formation of such a system is puzzling because orbital stability generally breaks down due to the large mass loss from the system caused by the SN explosion while forming the unseen component. Analytical solutions of the variable-mass two-body problem suggest that the explosion should have occurred when the component was close to its apocenter to explain the near-circular remnant system. This provides a strong constraint on the total mass and orbital configuration of the progenitor system. The nearly circular orbit of G3425 rules out type II SN scenarios and allows only for a fine-tuned SN~Ib/c explosion to occur when the secondary was close to its apocenter. Such a scenario, although possible, is highly unlikely. However, the most likely scenario is a failed SN that produced a black hole, for which no additional constraints on the position of the secondary are needed. We propose that the unseen component of G3425 is a mass-gap black hole with a mass constrained between the theoretical minimum for failed supernova progenitors (4 MSun) and the observed upper limit (4.4 MSun). Our analysis can be applied to any wide binary system containing an unseen component on a nearly circular orbit.</description>

      <title>A Sibling of AR Scorpii: SDSS J230641.47$+$244055.8 and the Observational Blueprint of White Dwarf Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio pulsating white dwarf (WD) systems, known as WD pulsars, are non-accreting binary systems where the rapidly spinning WD interacts with a low-mass companion producing pulsed non-thermal emission that can be observed across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Only two such systems are known: AR Sco and eRASSU J191213.9$-$441044. Here we present the discovery of a third WD pulsar, SDSS J230641.47$+$244055.8. The optical spectrum is dominated by molecular bands from an M-dwarf companion, with additional narrow emission lines from the Balmer series and He I. The long-term optical light-curve folded on its orbital period ($P_\mathrm{orb} = 3.49$ h) exhibits large scatter (roughly 10 per cent). High-cadence photometry reveals a short period signal, which we interpret to be the spin period of the WD primary ($P_\mathrm{spin} \simeq 92$ s). The WD spin period is slightly shorter than that of AR Sco ($\rm \sim 117$ s), the WD pulsar prototype. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals emission from the irradiated companion and Na I absorption lines approximately tracing its centre of mass, which yields a binary mass function of $f(M) \simeq 0.2 {\rm M_\odot}$. The H$\alpha$ emission includes a low-amplitude broad component, resembling the energetic emission line flashes seen in AR Sco. Using spectral templates, we classify the companion to be most likely a $\rm M4.0\pm 0.5$ star with $T_\mathrm{\rm eff} \approx 3300$ K. Modelling the stellar contribution constrains the secondary mass ($0.19\,{\rm M_\odot}\lesssim M_2\lesssim 0.28\,{\rm M_\odot}$), system distance ($\simeq1.25\,{\rm kpc}$), and inclination ($i \simeq 45-50^\circ$). We discuss the proposed evolutionary scenarios and summarize the observational properties of all three known WD pulsars, establishing a benchmark for identifying and classifying future members of this emerging class.</description>

      <title>Probing Solar Polar Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic fields and dynamical processes in the solar polar regions play a crucial role in the solar magnetic cycle and in supplying mass and energy to the fast solar wind, ultimately being vital in controlling solar activities and driving space weather. Despite numerous efforts to explore these regions, to date no imaging observations of the Sun's poles have been achieved from vantage points out of the ecliptic plane, leaving their behavior and evolution poorly understood. This observation gap has left three top-level scientific questions unanswered, 1) How does the solar dynamo work and drive the solar magnetic cycle? 2) What drives the fast solar wind? 3) How do space weather processes globally originate from the Sun and propagate throughout the solar system? The Solar Polar-orbit Observatory (SPO) mission, a solar polar exploration spacecraft, is proposed to address these three unanswered scientific questions by imaging the Sun's poles from high heliolatitudes. In order to achieve its scientific goals, SPO will carry six remote-sensing and four in-situ instruments to measure the vector magnetic fields and Doppler velocity fields in the photosphere, to observed the Sun in the extreme ultraviolet, X-ray, and radio wavelengths, to image the corona and the heliosphere up to 45 $R_\odot$, and to perform in-situ detection of magnetic fields, and low- and high-energy particles in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic star candidates in Gaia Data Release 3</title>

Abstract: Symbiotic stars, binary pairs with a cool giant fueling accretion onto a hot compact companion, offer unique insights to our understanding of stellar evolution. Yet, only a few hundred symbiotic stars are confirmed. Here, we report on a new search for symbiotic star candidates in Gaia Data Release 3 (GDR3), based entirely on the archive's astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic information. To begin our search, we identified known symbiotic stars in GDR3 and assessed their absolute magnitude and colors, which are dominated by the cool giant. We also considered measures of astrometric quality that might be affected by binary motion in these systems. Finally, from those sources with Gaia spectroscopic data, we built a low-resolution spectral template that characterizes the unique features of these systems, including H$\alpha$ emission from interaction with the giant's wind and radiation from the hot star. We then queried the full GDR3 archive for sources with spectroscopic data that are bright (&lt; 17 mag in G-band), have modest relative parallax uncertainties (&lt; 20%), and fall within a region of color-magnitude space characteristic of red giants, keeping only sources with spectra that quantitatively match our template. A machine-learning algorithm, trained on known symbiotic stars, produced a new catalog of 1,674 sources. From cross-matches with infrared and X-ray surveys, we present 25 of these sources as particularly compelling candidates for new symbiotic stars.</description>

      <title>Pushing the limits of eccentricity in planet-disc interactions</title>

Abstract: Modelling the gravitational interaction between an eccentric perturber and a differentially shearing gas disc is a longstanding problem with various astrophysical applications, ranging from the evolution of planetary systems to the migration of black holes embedded in AGN discs. Recent work has promoted the use of a global, linear, modal approach for calculating the excited wake and the resulting feedback on the perturber's orbital evolution. In this work we perform a complementary suite of targeted hydrodynamic simulations to test this linear framework across a range of disc temperature and density profiles. In particular, we push from circular orbits to highly eccentric trajectories for which the perturber moves supersonically with respect to the background gas. We find remarkable agreement between our simulations and the linear methodology across a range of diagnostics -- lending support to the predicted wake morphologies, complex radial torque density profiles, and torque reversal phenomena, which occur when the eccentricity exceeds the local scale height. In contrast, comparison with previous fitting functions exposes noticeable discrepancies, cautioning against their indiscriminate use in studies which explore a wide range of perturber eccentricities, in varied disc structures. Our simulations also probe the fundamentally nonlinear effects of shock induced angular momentum deposition and coorbital horseshoe drags, which exhibit clear variations with eccentricity. Finally, this careful comparison between linear theory and numerics provides a detailed benchmark for planet-disc interaction problems and therefore we have provided a repository of our linear calculations for use as a rigorous test of future numerical investigations.</description>

      <title>Gravity-sensitive Spectral Indices in Ultracool Dwarfs: Investigating Correlations with Metallicity and Planet Occurrence using SpeX and FIRE Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a near-infrared spectroscopic analysis (0.9-2.4 micron) of gravity indices for 57 ultracool dwarfs (spectral types M5.5 to L0), including exoplanet hosts TRAPPIST-1, SPECULOOS-2, SPECULOOS-3, and LHS 3154. Our dataset includes 61 spectra from the SpeX and FIRE spectrographs. Using gravity-sensitive indices such as FeH absorption (at 0.99, 1.20, and 1.55 microns), the VO band at 1.06 microns, the H-band continuum, and alkali lines like K I (at 1.17 and 1.25 microns), we investigate correlations between surface gravity, stellar metallicity, and the presence of close-in transiting planets. All four planet-hosting stars show intermediate-gravity spectral signatures despite indicators of field age. However, a volume-corrected logistic regression reveals no significant association between gravity class and planet occurrence. Among individual indices, FeH_z is the most promising tracer of planet-hosting status. We tentatively identify a correlation between FeH_z (0.99 micron) and planet presence at the 2-sigma level, though this may reflect observational biases including transit probability, small-number statistics, and detection sensitivity. More robustly, we find a significant anti-correlation between FeH_z and metallicity ([Fe/H]) at 3.3 sigma. A Kruskal-Wallis test shows no significant metallicity difference across gravity classes, suggesting the observed FeH_z-metallicity trend is not driven by bulk metallicity differences. We propose this anti-correlation reflects interplay between age, gravity, and composition: higher-metallicity objects may be systematically younger with lower gravities, suppressing FeH absorption. While our results only hint at a link between gravity-related characteristics and planet occurrence among late-M dwarfs, they underscore the need for caution when using spectral diagnostics to infer properties of planet-hosting ultracool dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Measurements of three exo-planetesimal compositions: a planetary core, a chondritic body, and an icy Kuiper belt analogue</title>

Abstract: The study of planetesimal debris accreted by white dwarfs offers unique insights into the composition of exoplanets. Using far-ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy, we have analysed the composition of planetesimals accreted by three metal enriched H-dominated white dwarfs with effective temperatures of T_eff = 20 000 K. WD 0059+257 is accreting an object composed of 71.8 +/- 7.9 per cent Fe and Ni by mass, indicating a large core mass fraction of 69 per cent, similar to that of Mercury. We model this planetesimal as having a differentiated Earth-like composition with 65 per cent of its mantle stripped, and we find this mass loss can be caused by vaporisation of the planetesimal's mantle during post-main sequence evolution. The tentative S detection in WD 0059+257 is a possible clue to the nature of the light element in planetary cores, including that of the Earth. The volatile-rich composition of WD 1943+163 is consistent with accretion of a carbonaceous chondrite-like object, but with an extreme Si depletion. WD 1953-715 accretes a planetesimal which contains 64 +/- 21 per cent of O in the form of ices, likely H2O. This body therefore requires an initial orbit at formation beyond a radial distance of &gt; 100 au for ice survival into the white dwarf phase. These three planetary enriched white dwarfs provide evidence of differing core fractions, volatile budgets, and initial orbital separations of the accreted planetesimals, all of which help us understand their formation and evolutionary history.</description>

      <title>Open Cluster Members in the APOGEE DR17. I. Dynamics and Star Members</title>

Abstract: Context. Open clusters are groups of stars formed from the same cloud of gas and cosmic dust. They play an important role in studying stars' formation and evolution and understanding galaxies' structure and dynamics. Aims. The main objective of this work is to identify stars that belong to open clusters using astrometric data from Gaia EDR3 and spectroscopic data from APOGEE DR17. Furthermore, we investigate the metallicity gradients and orbital properties of the open clusters in our sample. Methods. By applying the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm to this data, we identified observed stars in our galaxy with similar dynamics, chemical compositions, and ages. The orbits of the open clusters were also calculated using the GravPot16 code. Results. We found 1987 stars belonging to 49 open clusters, and 941 of these stars have probabilities above 80 % of belonging to open clusters. Our metallicity gradient presents a two-slope shape for two measures of different Galactic center distances, the projected Galactocentric distance, and the guiding center radius to the Galactic Center, as already reported in previous work. However, when we separate the open clusters by age, we observe no significant difference in the metallicity gradient slope beyond a certain distance from the Galactic center. Our results show a shallower gradient for clusters younger than 2 Gyr than those older than 2 Gyr. All our OCs dynamically assemble the Disk-like population very well, and they are in prograde orbits, which is typical for disk-like populations. Some OCs resonate with the Galactic bar at the Lagrange points L4 and L5.</description>

      <title>Particle Injection Problem in Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection and turbulence in magnetically-dominated environments have been proposed as important nonthermal particle acceleration mechanisms that generate high energy particles and associated emissions. While the acceleration to high energy that produces the power-law energy distribution has drawn strong interest, recent studies actively discuss pre-acceleration, or injection, to a sufficient energy for a sustained and prolonged Fermi-like acceleration. The injection process is important for determining the fraction of nonthermal particles and energy partition between thermal and nonthermal particles. We review recent advances in understanding the injection mechanisms responsible for populating these nonthermal power-law spectra, and conclude with an outlook for studies and applications of injection models.</description>

      <title>Shaping Galactic Habitability: the impact of stellar migration and gas giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In exoplanet research, the focus is increasingly on identifying Earth analogs, planets similar in density and habitability potential. As the number of rocky exoplanets grows, parallel discussions have emerged on system architectures and Galactic environments that may support life, drawing comparisons to our own Earth. This has brought renewed attention to the concept of the Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ) as a broader context for interpreting the diversity of planetary environments. This study is the first to use detailed chemical evolution models to investigate the impact of stellar migration, modeled through a parametric approach, on the GHZ. Our findings reveal that stellar migration significantly enhances the number of stars capable of hosting habitable planets in the outer Galactic regions, with an increase of up to a factor of five at 18 kpc relative to a baseline value of unity at 6 kpc. Furthermore, we explore a novel scenario where the presence of gas giant planets increases the probability for the formation of terrestrial ones. We find that this increased probability is higher in the inner Galactic disc, but is also mitigated by stellar migration. In particular, at the present time, the number of FGK stars hosting terrestrial planets with minimum habitability conditions in the ring centered at 4 kpc is approximately 1.4 times higher than in scenarios where gas giants are assumed to hinder the formation and evolution of Earth-like planets. Without stellar migration, this factor increases to 1.5. Even larger ratios are predicted for terrestrial planets orbiting retired A stars, reaching 2.8 in models with stellar migration and 3.3 in models without it.</description>

      <title>Investigating silicate, carbon, and water in the diffuse interstellar medium: the first shots from WISCI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dusty interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way is distributed in a complex, cloudy structure. It is fundamental to the radiation balance within the Milky Way, provides a reaction surface to form complex molecules, and is the feedstock for future generations of stars and planets. The life cycle of interstellar dust is not completely understood, and neither are its structure nor composition. The abundance, composition, and structure of dust in the diffuse ISM can be determined by combining infrared, optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy. JWST enables measurement of the faint absorption of ISM dust grains against bright stars at kiloparsec distances across the infrared spectrum. Here we present an overview of the project `Webb Investigation of Silicates, Carbons, and Ices' (WISCI) along with interpretation of two targets, GSC 08152-02121 and CPD-59 5831. Observations of 12 WISCI target stars were taken by JWST, the Hubble Space Telescope, Himalayan Chandra Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope. We use these to characterize the targets' spectral types and calculate their line-of-sight extinction parameters, $A_{\rm V}$ and $R_{\rm V}$. We find absorption in the JWST spectra of GSC 08152-02121, and CPD-59 5831 associated with carbonaceous dust around 3.4 and 6.2 micron and amorphous silicates at 9.7 micron. In GSC 08152-02121 we also find indications of absorption by trapped water around 3 micron. This first look from WISCI demonstrates the line-of-sight variability within the sample, and the program's potential to identify and correlate features across ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Low-Luminosity Type IIP Supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe. II: Lightcurve Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe survey yielded a sample of 330 Type IIP supernovae (SNe) with well-constrained peak luminosities. In paper I (arXiv:2502.19493), we measured their luminosity function and volumetric rate. Here (paper II), we present the largest systematic study of lightcurve properties for Type IIP SNe from a volume-limited survey, analyzing a selected subset of 129 events, including 16 low-luminosity Type IIP (LLIIP) SNe with M${r,peak} \geq -16$ mag. We find that plateau slope correlates with peak brightness, with many LLIIP SNe showing positive slopes--suggesting smaller progenitor radii and distinct density profiles compared to brighter Type IIP SNe. The plateau duration shows only a weak dependence on peak brightness, likely suggesting binary interaction. One SN exhibits a plateau-to-tail drop of &gt;3.5 mag, consistent with an electron-capture or failed SN with very low or zero nickel mass. We derive explosion and progenitor parameters of the entire Type IIP SN sample using semi-analytical and radiation-hydrodynamical models. Based on radiation-hydrodynamical model fitting, LLIIP SNe are characterized by low nickel masses (0.001-0.025 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$), low explosion energies (0.1-0.28 $\times 10^{51}$ erg), low ejecta masses ($8.1^{+0.8}_{-1.7}$ $\mathrm{M\odot}$), and ZAMS masses below 11 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$. In comparison, the full Type IIP SN sample spans a wider range with nickel masses (0.001-0.222 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$), explosion energies (0.10-4.43 $\times 10^{51}$ erg), ejecta masses (5.4-24.8 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$), and ZAMS masses (9.3-16.7 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$). We find strong correlations between peak brightness, explosion energy, and nickel mass that extend to the low-luminosity end. We conclude that LLIIP SNe represent the faint, low-energy end of the Type IIP population and originate from the lowest-mass core-collapse progenitors.</description>

      <title>MIRIS Pa{\alpha} Galactic Plane Survey. II. The Catalog of Pa{\alpha} Emission-line Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using data from the MIRIS Pa{\alpha} Galactic Plane Survey (MIPAPS), we present a Pa{\alpha} 1.87 um line image of the entire Galactic plane within the latitude range of -3{\deg} &lt; b &lt; +3{\deg}, revealing numerous Pa{\alpha} features. Based on the MIPAPS Pa{\alpha} image and the WISE H II region catalog, we compile a catalog of 1489 Pa{\alpha} emission-line sources in the Galactic plane within 90{\deg} &lt; l &lt; 330{\deg}. By comparing our Pa{\alpha} images with H{\alpha} images constructed from the IPHAS and VPHAS+ survey data, we demonstrate the advantages of Pa{\alpha} line observations. We identify 902 Pa{\alpha} sources associated with H II regions, and newly confirm 619 H II region candidates as definitive H II regions through Pa{\alpha} or H{\alpha} detections. We also identify 261 extended and 326 point-like Pa{\alpha} sources not included in the WISE catalog, most of which have H{\alpha} counterparts in the IPHAS or VPHAS+ images. A search of the SIMBAD database indicates that these sources originate from diverse object types. By measuring Pa{\alpha} and H{\alpha} fluxes, we estimate the E(B-V) color excesses derived from extended emissions for 138 Pa{\alpha} sources, showing good agreement with values obtained from spectrophotometry of ionizing stars in previous studies. Futhermore, we calculate total Lyman continuum luminosities for 42 Pa{\alpha} sources, providing constraints on the distances to H II regions and the spectral types of their ionizing stars. These results highlight the scientific potential of Pa{\alpha} line observations and the benefits of combining multiple hydrogen recombination lines in exploring ionized regions.</description>

      <title>Can tidal evolution lead to close-in planetary bodies around white dwarfs I: Orbital period distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of planetary systems around white dwarfs is crucial to understanding the presence of planetary material in the atmospheres of white dwarfs. These systems uniquely probe exoplanetary compositions. Periodic signals in the photometry of a handful of white dwarfs suggest material blocking the star, potentially from disintegrating planetesimals. Tidal evolution followed by scattering can bring planetesimals onto close-in orbits that would have been within the envelope of the white dwarf progenitor. The orbital period distribution of planetesimals undergoing tidal evolution will peak at short-period (nearly) circularized orbits (~ 10 hour-1 day), with a rising tail towards long-period highly eccentric orbits (~ 100 day). This prediction is generally consistent with the observed white dwarf transiting systems. In order for the planetesimal on the 4.5 hour period around WD 1145+017 to be explained by the tidal evolution of a planetesimal, that planetesimal must have an ultimate tensile strength comparable to that of iron meteorites.</description>

      <title>Can tidal evolution lead to close-in planetary bodies around white dwarfs II: volcanism and transits</title>

Abstract: Planetary material accreted by white dwarfs provides unique insights regarding exoplanetary composition. The evolutionary pathways of planetary bodies around white dwarfs are crucial to understanding the presence of close-in planetary material, observed in the form of pollutants in the atmospheres of white dwarfs and planetary material transiting white dwarfs. Periodic transits around white dwarfs potentially reveal the existence of close-in planetary bodies undergoing dust production. Tidal interactions can bring planetesimals that have been gravitationally perturbed onto long-period highly eccentric orbits around white dwarfs towards shorter orbital periods and smaller eccentricities. Tidal interactions may also induce melting and volcanism in these planetesimals, potentially being a mechanism for dust and debris production, the result of which may be seen in transit. Tidally induced volcanism may be triggered in a wide parameter space: for a 100km-sized rocky planetesimals perturbed to a pericentre distance $\lesssim$ 0.01AU ($\gtrsim$ twice its Roche limit), both on long-period (~ 100day) highly eccentric orbits and short-period (~ 10hr) near circular orbits. We comment on the potential link between the resultant volcanic ejecta and observed optical transits.</description>

Abstract: Stars are fossils that retain the history of their host galaxies. Carbon and heavier elements are created inside stars and are ejected when they die. From the spatial distribution of elements in galaxies, it is therefore possible to constrain the physical processes during galaxy formation and evolution. This approach, Galactic archaeology, has been popularly used for our Milky Way Galaxy thanks to a vast amount of data from the Gaia satellite and multi-object spectrographs, and now can also be applied to very distant galaxies with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) - extra-galactic archaeology. In these studies the most important factor is the input stellar physics, namely nucleosynthesis yields and binary physics, which predominantly determine the model predictions. In this review I give a summary of stellar nucleosynthesis, and how they are tested with the observations in the Milky Way. Then I show how chemical enrichment of galaxies can be calculated, and show some results with the latest nucleosynthesis yields.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of Photo-dissociation Regions. II. Aliphatic/Aromatic Carbonaceous Dust, Ices, and Gas Phase Spectral Line Inventory</title>

Abstract: This paper provides an overview of the spectroscopic data obtained by the JWST Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) program 1192, "The Physics and Chemistry of PDR Fronts", including an inventory of the spatially resolved dust, gas, and molecular content in the Horsehead nebula and the NW filament of NGC~7023. We demonstrate the unique capability of this high spatial resolution data set to elucidate the evolution of gas and dust at the interface between stars and their natal clouds at the scale at which the physics and chemistry occur. The Disassociation Regions (PDRs) in the Horsehead nebula and the North West (NW) filament of NGC 7023 were mapped with a spectral resolution 1000-3000 and a spatial resolution of ~2e-4 pc between 0.97-28um. Spectra extracted from template regions yield a large number of atomic, ionized, and molecular lines. Full line lists and extracted spectra for all 10 regions are provided through CDS. Absorption from H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and CO ices are identified in 3 regions in NGC 7023. In this overview, we have focused on the spectral region between 3 and 5 um which is dominated by emission from aromatic and aliphatic carbon bonds to illustrate the power of the data set. We confirm the entrainment of aromatic carbonaceous species in the photo-evaporative flow from the PDR surface into the H\,{\sc{ii}} region in the Horsehead. No aliphatic emission is present in the outflow, indicating the complete removal of aliphatic bonds when exposed to strong UV fields. There is a clear detection of deuterium substitution in the carbon bonds. Aliphatic D-substitution is more efficient relative to aromatic D-substitution, ranging from N$_{D}$/N$_{H}$ ~ 0.1-0.3 for aliphatics compared to ~0.03 for the aromatics.</description>

      <title>Properties of the cores and filaments in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud and its L1688 hub-filament system</title>

Abstract: Analyzing filaments and cores in molecular clouds is key to understanding galactic star formation and its environmental dependence. This paper studies the properties and distribution of dense cores and filaments in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud, with a focus on the L1688 hub-filament system (HFS) and its star formation potential. We extracted sources and filaments from Herschel images and a 13.5 arcsec resolution surface density map using the getsf method, identified prestellar cores among the extracted sources, evaluated core mass segregation, and constructed the core mass function (CMF). We derived properties of the filaments from their radial surface density profiles, constructed the filament linear density function (FLDF), and assessed the mass distribution in the L1688 HFS to estimate the core and filament formation efficiencies (CFE, FFE). The results suggest that the filament-dominated core formation is a key mechanism in star formation within the system.</description>

      <title>The JDISC Survey: Linking the Physics and Chemistry of Inner and Outer Protoplanetary Disk Zones</title>

Abstract: Mid-infrared spectroscopy of protoplanetary disks provides a chemical inventory of gas within a few au, where planets are readily detected around older stars. With the JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS), we explore demographic trends among 31 disks observed with MIRI (MRS) and with previous ALMA millimeter continuum imaging at high angular resolution (5-10 au). With these S/N $\sim$200-450 spectra, we report emission from H$_2$O, OH, CO, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, CO$_2$, [Ne II], [Ne III], and [Ar II]. Emission from H$_2$O, OH and CO is nearly ubiquitous for low-mass stars, and detection rates of all molecules are higher than for similar disks observed with Spitzer-IRS. Slab model fits to the molecular emission lines demonstrate that emission from C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, and possibly CO$_2$ is optically thin; thus since column densities and emitting radii are degenerate, observations are actually sensitive to the total molecular mass. C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN emission also typically originate in a hotter region ($920^{+70}_{-130}$, $820^{+70}_{-130}$ K, respectively) than CO$_2$ ($600^{+200}_{-160}$ K). The HCN to cold H$_2$O luminosity ratios are generally smaller in smooth disks, consistent with more efficient water delivery via icy pebbles in the absence of large dust substructures. The molecular emission line luminosities are also correlated with mass accretion rates and infrared spectral indices, similar to trends reported from Spitzer-IRS surveys. This work demonstrates the power of combining multi-wavelength observations to explore inner disk chemistry as a function of outer disk and stellar properties, which will continue to grow as the sample of observed Class II systems expands in the coming JWST observation cycles.</description>

      <title>The accretion luminosity of Class I protostars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The value of the accretion luminosity during the early phases of star formation is a crucial information which helps us understand how stars form, yet it is still very difficult to obtain. We develop a new methodology to measure accretion luminosity using mid-infrared hydrogen recombination lines, and apply it to a limited sample of Class~I protostars in the Taurus and Ophiuchus star forming regions. We adopt the commonly used assumption that the properties of disk-protostar accretion in Class I objects is similar to the disk-star accretion in Class II objects. Using simultaneous observations of three hydrogen recombination lines Brg, Pfg, and Bra, we derive the mean intrinsic line ratios, and we verified that these are constant across the probed range of photospheric and accretion properties. We establish correlations between the line luminosities and accretion luminosity. We measure the extinction towards the line emission regions in Class I protostars comparing the observed line ratios to the Class II mean values. We then derive the Class I accretion luminosities from the established Class II correlations. We find that the accretion luminosity dominates the bolometric luminosity for the more embedded protostars, corresponding to lower values of the bolometric temperature. As the bolometric temperature increases above ~700K, there is a sharp drop of the contribution of the accretion from the bolometric luminosity. Our finding are in qualitative agreement with numerical simulations of star formation. We suggest that this methodology should be applied to larger and more statistically significant samples of Class I objects, for a more detailed comparison. Our results also suggest that by combining multiple infrared line ratios, it will be possible to derive a more detailed description of the dust extinction law in protostellar envelopes.</description>

      <title>Interactions among binary black holes in star clusters: Eccentric gravitational wave captures and triple formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of star clusters with black holes find that there is only a single dynamically active binary black hole (BBH), at odds with the theoretical expectation of ~5 dynamically formed - or, commonly referred to as three-body - BBHs in clusters with a few hundred BHs. We test the recent suggestion that this tension is because interactions among three-body BBHs were neglected in the theory. We use the public catalogue of Cluster Monte Carlo models to obtain a sample of strong BBH-BBH interactions, which we integrate using post-Newtonian equations of motion up to 3.5PN. We explore the nature of the BBHs involved in BBH-BBH interactions in star clusters, as well as the various outcomes: gravitational wave (GW) captures and the associated eccentricities at the frequencies of ground-based GW detectors, as well as BH triple formation and their contribution to BBH mergers via the ZLK mechanism. We find that almost all BBHs involved in BBH-BBH interactions are indeed three-body binaries and that BBH formation and disruption in BBH-BBH interactions occur at approximately the same rate, providing an explanation for the finding of a single dynamically active BBH in N-body models. An important implication is that the resulting rates of GW capture and triple formation are independent of uncertain initial binary properties. With the use of a population synthesis model for BBH-BBH interactions in globular clusters, we obtain a local rate of GW captures of $R=1Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ as well as their eccentricity distribution and redshift dependence. We find that a BBH-BBH interaction is more likely to trigger a GW merger than a BH-BBH interaction. We also confirm that stable triples that are assembled in BBH-BBH interactions can merge via ZLK oscillations, although their merger rate is lower than GW captures. Our results will help with the interpretation of future GW signals from eccentric BBHs</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As part of the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey (CAPOS), high-resolution, high Signal-to-Noise Ratio Near-Infrared spectroscopy, we aim to conduct the most robust chemical study to date for NGC 6316, deriving abundances for a number of elements with a variety of nucleosynthetic origins, most of which have never been studied before in this cluster. We use the Brussels Automatic Code for Characterizing High accuracy Spectra (BACCHUS) with atmospheric parameters photometrically obtained in order to determine, for the first time, abundances for C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, P, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni and Ce for this cluster. We obtained a mean metallicity $[Fe/H]=-0.87\pm0.02$, finding no indication of an intrinsic metallicity spread. Our metallicity agrees with the most recent values from other studies, revising earlier values that were $\sim0.5$ dex metal-richer. With this new value, this cluster, long believed to be a member of the classical metal-rich group of bulge GCs around $-0.5$, now falls in the dominant bulge globular cluster peak around $[Fe/H]=-1$. The cluster presents a clear C-N anticorrelation. We also found a $[\alpha/Fe]=0.31\pm0.02$. Our abundances show similar behaviour to other in situ globular clusters with comparable metallicity. An isochrone fitting gave us $E(B-V)=0.71$, a higher value than any other from the literature for this cluster since we also estimated $R_V=2.7$, in good agreement with determinations from other works; $(M-m)_0=15.32\pm0.05$. We derive an overall metallicity $[M/H]=-0.6\pm0.05$, in agreement with our abundance determination.</description>

      <title>Scaling and universality in strange quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive scaling laws that connect certain macroscopic observables of strange quark stars with key microscopic properties of self-bound quark matter, such as the energy per baryon at zero pressure and the strength of repulsive interactions. We also identify universal relations linking global properties of strange quark stars - specifically, their moment of inertia, tidal deformability, and both gravitational and baryonic compactness. Remarkably, these relations hold for two substantially different microscopic models - the quark-mass density-dependent model with excluded-volume corrections and the vector MIT bag model - underscoring their robust, model-independent nature. We demonstrate that the universal relations for strange quark stars differ significantly from those previously established for neutron stars composed of hadronic matter, thus enabling discrimination between the two types of objects without requiring detailed knowledge of their equations of state. Moreover, observational constraints on the maximum mass of compact stars could place bounds on both the depth of quark-matter self-binding and the strength of quark repulsive interactions.</description>

      <title>CAMPOS II. The onset of protostellar disk substructures and planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 1.3 mm CAMPOS survey has resolved 90 protostellar disks with ~15 au resolution across the Ophiuchus, Corona Australis, and Chamaeleon star-forming regions. To address the fundamental question, `When does planet formation begin?', we combined the CAMPOS sample with literature observations of Class 0-II disks (bolometric temperature, $T_{bol} \le 1900 K$). To investigate substructure detection rates as a function of $T_{bol}$, we restricted the sample to disks observed at the 1.3 mm wavelength, with inclinations below 75$^\circ$, linear resolution $\le 20$ au and resolved with at least 4 resolution elements ($\theta_{disk}/\theta_{res} \ge 4$). We also considered the effects of extinction correction and the inclusion of Herschel Space Telescope data on the $T_{bol}$ measurements to constrain the lower and upper limits of $T_{bol}$ for each source. We find that by $T_{bol}$ ~200-400 K, substructure detection rates increased sharply to ~60%, corresponding to an age of ~0.2-0.4 Myr. No substructures are detected in Class 0 disks. The ratio of disk-averaged brightness temperature to predicted dust temperature shows a trend of increasing values toward the youngest Class 0 disks, suggesting higher optical depths in these early stages. Our statistical analysis confirms that substructures similar to those in Class II disks are already common by the Class I stage, and the emergence of structures at early Class I could represent only an upper limit. Classifying disks with substructures into those with and without large central cavities, we find both populations coexisting across evolutionary stages, suggesting they are not necessarily evolutionarily linked. If protostellar disk substructures do follow an evolutionary sequence, then our results imply that disk substructures evolve very rapidly and thus can be present in all Class I/II stages and/or that they can be triggered at different times.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS): overview of program and early results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The embedded phase is a crucial period in the development of a young star. Mid-IR observations, now possible with JWST with unprecedented sensitivity, spectral resolution and sharpness are key for probing many physical and chemical processes on sub-arcsecond scales. JOYS addresses a wide variety of questions, from protostellar accretion and the nature of primeval jets, winds and outflows, to the chemistry of gas and ice, and the characteristics of embedded disks. We introduce the program and show representative results. MIRI-MRS data of 17 low-mass and 6 high-mass protostars show a wide variety of features. Atomic line maps differ among refractory (e.g., Fe), semi-refractory (e.g., S) and volatile elements (e.g., Ne), linked to their different levels of depletion and local (shock) conditions. Nested, stratified jet structures consisting of an inner ionized core seen in [Fe II] with an outer H2 layer are commonly seen. Wide-angle winds are found in low-J H2 lines. [S I] follows the jet in the youngest protostars, but is concentrated on source when more evolved. [Ne II] reveals a mix of jet shock and photoionized emission. H I lines measure accretion, but are also associated with jets. Molecular emission (CO2, C2H2, HCN, H2O, ..) is cool compared with disks, and likely associated with hot cores. Deep ice absorption features reveal not just the major ice components but also ions (as part of salts) and complex organic molecules, with comparable abundances from low- to high-mass sources. A second detection of HDO ice in a solar-mass source is presented with HDO/H2O ~ 0.4%, providing a link with disks and comets. A deep search for solid O2 suggests it is not a significant oxygen reservoir. Only few embedded Class I disks show the same forest of water lines as Class II disks do, perhaps due to significant dust extinction of the upper layers [abridged].</description>

Abstract: In this work, we derive systemic velocities and subsequently orbits for 8456 RR~Lyrae stars. We identify interlopers from other Milky Way (MW) structures, which amount to 22 percent of the total sample. Most interlopers are associated with the halo, with the remainder linked to the Galactic disk. We confirm the previously reported lag in the rotation curve of bulge RR~Lyrae stars regardless of the removal of interlopers. Metal-rich RR~Lyrae stars' rotation patterns are consistent with that of non-variable metal-rich giants, following the MW bar, while metal-poor stars exhibit slower rotation. The analysis of orbital parameter space is used to distinguish bulge stars that, in the bar reference frame, have prograde orbits from those in retrograde orbits. We classify the prograde stars into orbital families and estimate the chaoticity (in the form of frequency drift) of their orbits. RR~Lyrae stars with banana-like orbits have a bimodal distance distribution, similar to the distance distribution seen in the metal-rich red clump stars. The fraction of stars with banana-like orbits decreases linearly with metallicity, as does the fraction of stars on prograde orbits (in the bar reference frame). The retrograde moving stars (in the bar reference frame) form a centrally concentrated nearly spherical distribution. Analyzing an $N$-body+SPH simulation, we find that some stellar particles in the central parts oscillate between retrograde and prograde orbits and only a minority stays prograde over a long period of time. Based on the simulation, the ratio between prograde and retrograde stellar particles seems to stabilize within a couple of gigayears after bar formation. The non-chaoticity of retrograde orbits and their high numbers can explain some of the spatial and kinematical features of the MW bulge that have been often associated with a classical bulge.</description>
