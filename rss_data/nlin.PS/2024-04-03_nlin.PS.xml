      <title>Semantic Information Theory in a feedback-control Kuramoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic Information Theory (SIT) offers a new approach to evaluating the information architecture of complex systems. In this study we describe the steps required to {\it operationalize} SIT via its application to dynamical problems. Our road map has four steps: (1) separating the dynamical system into agent-environment sub-systems; (2) choosing an appropriate coarse graining and quantifying correlations; (3) identifying a measure of viability; (4) implementing a scrambling protocol and measuring the semantic content. We apply the road map to a model inspired by the neural dynamics of epileptic seizures whereby an agent (a control process) attempts to maintain an environment (a base process) in a desynchronized state. The synchronization dynamics is studied through the well-known Kuramoto model of phase synchronization. Our application of SIT to this problem reveals new features of both semantic information and the Kuramoto model. For the latter we find articulating the correlational structure for agent and environment(the oscillators), allows us to cast the model in in a novel computational (information theoretic) perspective, where the agent-environment dynamics can be thought of as analyzing a communication channel. For the former we find that all the information in our system is semantic. This is in contrast to previous SIT studies of foragers in which semantic thresholds where seen above which no further semantic content was obtained.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Corner States in Topologically Nontrivial Kagome Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a higher-order topological insulator (HOTI) under strong nonlinearity, focusing on the existence and stability of high-amplitude corner states, which can find applications in optics, acoustics, elastodynamics, and other wave-based systems. Our study centers on a breathing Kagome lattice composed of point masses and springs known to exhibit edge and corner states in its linear regime. By introducing onsite cubic nonlinearity, we analyze its impact on both edge and corner states. The nonlinear continuation of the corner state unveils stable high-amplitude corner states within the lattice, featuring non-zero displacements at even sites from the corner -- a characteristic absent in the linear limit. Interestingly, the nonlinear continuation of the edge state reveals its transformation into distinct families of high-amplitude corner states via two pitchfork bifurcations. While some states maintain stability, others become unstable through real instability and Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. These unstable corner states dissipate their energy into the edges and the bulk over an extended period, as corroborated by long-time dynamical simulations. Consequently, our study provides insights into achieving significant energy localization at the corners of HOTIs through various classes of nonlinear states.</description>

      <title>Stable patterns in the Lugiato-Lefever equation with a confined vortex pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of a passive optical cavity based on a novel variety of the two-dimensional Lugiato-Lefever equation, with a localized pump carrying intrinsic vorticity S, and the cubic or cubic-quintic nonlinearity. Up to S = 5, stable confined vortex-ring states (vortex pixels) are produced by means of a variational approximation and in a numerical form. Surprisingly, vast stability areas of the vortex states are found, for both the self-focusing and defocusing signs of the nonlinearity, in the plane of the pump and loss parameters. When the vortex-rings are unstable, they are destroyed by azimuthal perturbations which break the axial symmetry. The results suggest new possibilities for mode manipulations in passive nonlinear photonic media by means of appropriately designed pump beams.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics and pressure of composite multimoded weakly nonlinear optical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics can provide a versatile theoretical framework for investigating the collective dynamics of weakly nonlinear waves-settings that can be utterly complex to describe otherwise. In optics, composite systems arise due to interactions between different frequencies and/or polarizations. The purpose of this work is to develop a thermodynamic theory that takes into account the synergistic action of multiple components. We find that the type of the nonlinearity involved can have important implications in the thermalization process and, hence, can lead to different thermal equilibrium conditions. Importantly, we derive closed-form expressions for the actual optomechanical pressure that is exerted on the system. In particular, the total optomechanical pressure is the sum of the partial pressures due to each component. Our results can be applied to a variety of weakly nonlinear optical settings such as multimode fibers, bulk waveguides, photonic lattices, and coupled microresonators. We present two specific examples, where two colors interact in a waveguide array with either a cubic or quadratic nonlinearity.</description>
