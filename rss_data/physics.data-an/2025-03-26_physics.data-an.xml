      <title>Enhancing Symbolic Regression with Quality-Diversity and Physics-Inspired Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents QDSR, an advanced symbolic Regression (SR) system that integrates genetic programming (GP), a quality-diversity (QD) algorithm, and a dimensional analysis (DA) engine. Our method focuses on exact symbolic recovery of known expressions from datasets, with a particular emphasis on the Feynman-AI benchmark. On this widely used collection of 117 physics equations, QDSR achieves an exact recovery rate of 91.6~$\%$, surpassing all previous SR methods by over 20 percentage points. Our method also exhibits strong robustness to noise. Beyond QD and DA, this high success rate results from a profitable trade-off between vocabulary expressiveness and search space size: we show that significantly expanding the vocabulary with precomputed meaningful variables (e.g., dimensionless combinations and well-chosen scalar products) often reduces equation complexity, ultimately leading to better performance. Ablation studies will also show that QD alone already outperforms the state-of-the-art. This suggests that a simple integration of QD, by projecting individuals onto a QD grid, can significantly boost performance in existing algorithms, without requiring major system overhauls.</description>

      <title>Role of spatial embedding and planarity in shaping the topology of the Street Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topology of city street networks (SNs) is constrained by spatial embedding, requiring non-crossing links and preventing random node placement or overlap. Here, we analyzed SNs of $33$ Indian cities to explore how the spatial embedding and the planarity jointly shape their topology. Overall, we found that all the studied SNs have small-world properties with higher clustering and efficiency. The efficiency of the empirical networks is even higher than that of the corresponding degree of preserved random networks. This increased efficiency can be explained by Dijkstra's path-length distribution, which closely fits a right-skewed normal or log-normal distribution. Moreover, we observed that the connectivity of the streets is length-dependent: the smaller streets connect preferably to the smaller streets, while longer streets tend to connect with the longer counterparts. This length-dependent connectivity is more profound in the empirical SNs than in the corresponding degree preserved random and random planar networks. However, planar networks maintaining the empirical spatial coordinates replicate the connectivity behavior of empirical SNs, highlighting the influence of spatial embedding. Moreover, the robustness of the cities in terms of resilience to random errors and targeted attacks is independent of the SN's size, indicating other factors, such as geographical constraints, substantially influence network stability.</description>

      <title>Approximate solutions of a general stochastic velocity-jump model subject to discrete-time noisy observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19787</link>

Abstract: Advances in experimental techniques allow the collection of high-resolution spatio-temporal data that track individual motile entities over time. These tracking data motivate the use of mathematical models to characterise the motion observed. In this paper, we aim to describe the solutions of velocity-jump models for single-agent motion in one spatial dimension, characterised by successive Markovian transitions within a finite network of n states, each with a specified velocity and a fixed rate of switching to every other state. In particular, we focus on obtaining the solutions of the model subject to noisy, discrete-time, observations, with no direct access to the agent state. The lack of direct observation of the hidden state makes the problem of finding the exact distributions generally intractable. Therefore, we derive a series of approximations for the data distributions. We verify the accuracy of these approximations by comparing them to the empirical distributions generated through simulations of four example model structures. These comparisons confirm that the approximations are accurate given sufficiently infrequent state switching relative to the imaging frequency. The approximate distributions computed can be used to obtain fast forwards predictions, to give guidelines on experimental design, and as likelihoods for inference and model selection.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Scattering Transform for Gravitational Waves Analysis. An Application to Glitch Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves, first predicted by Albert Einstein within the framework of general relativity, were confirmed in 2015 by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration, marking a pivotal breakthrough in astrophysics. Despite this achievement, a key challenge remains in distinguishing true gravitational wave signals from noise artifacts, or "glitches," which can distort data and affect the quality of observations. Current state-of-the-art methods, such as the Q-transform, are widely used for signal processing, but face limitations when addressing certain types of signals. In this study, we investigate the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST), a recent signal analysis method, as a complementary approach. Theoretical motivation for WST arises from its stability under signal deformations and its equivariance properties, which make it particularly suited for the complex nature of gravitational wave data. Our experiments on the LIGO O1a dataset show that WST simplifies classification tasks and enables the use of more efficient architectures compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we explore the potential benefits of integrating WST with the Q-transform, demonstrating that ensemble methods exploiting both techniques can capture complementary features of the signal and improve overall performance. This work contributes to advancing machine learning applications in gravitational wave analysis, introducing refined preprocessing techniques that improve signal detection and classification.</description>
