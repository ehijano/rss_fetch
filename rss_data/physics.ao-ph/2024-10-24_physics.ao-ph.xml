      <title>Heat spots as structural elements of synoptic turbulence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale dynamics of heat spots in a thin layer of incompressible rotating fluid under the action of Coriolis and gravity is considered to obtain a simple model of synoptic turbulence. The derivation of equations describing the evolution of the spots is based on the use of the variational principle, perturbation theory, and the assumption of geostrophic balance. Exact solutions with piecewise constant contour curvature are found. The simplest of them look like circular spots that move with constant velocity depending on their radius. More complex solutions, such as ``loop solitons'', are shown to have fractal structure and are constructed by the gluing method. Heat spots can act as structural elements of turbulence. In particular, we show that the spectral energy density for the velocity field of a random ensemble of heat spots has the power asymptotics $E\propto k^{\alpha}$ with exponents $\alpha=2$ at $k\bar{R}&lt;1$, and $\alpha=-1$ at $k\bar{R}&gt;1$, where $\bar{R}$ is the average (over ensemble) radius of spot.</description>

      <title>Modulated Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators for Temporal Interpolation of Weather Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weather and climate data are often available at limited temporal resolution, either due to storage limitations, or in the case of weather forecast models based on deep learning, their inherently long time steps. The coarse temporal resolution makes it difficult to capture rapidly evolving weather events. To address this limitation, we introduce an interpolation model that reconstructs the atmospheric state between two points in time for which the state is known. The model makes use of a novel network layer that modifies the adaptive Fourier neural operator (AFNO), which has been previously used in weather prediction and other applications of machine learning to physics problems. The modulated AFNO (ModAFNO) layer takes an embedding, here computed from the interpolation target time, as an additional input and applies a learned shift-scale operation inside the AFNO layers to adapt them to the target time. Thus, one model can be used to produce all intermediate time steps. Trained to interpolate between two time steps 6 h apart, the ModAFNO-based interpolation model produces 1 h resolution intermediate time steps that are visually nearly indistinguishable from the actual corresponding 1 h resolution data. The model reduces the RMSE loss of reconstructing the intermediate steps by approximately 50% compared to linear interpolation. We also demonstrate its ability to reproduce the statistics of extreme weather events such as hurricanes and heat waves better than 6 h resolution data. The ModAFNO layer is generic and is expected to be applicable to other problems, including weather forecasting with tunable lead time.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo: A Hybrid Approach to Data Assimilation in 4DVAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel hybrid quantum-classical framework that integrates the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (QMCMC) with variational particle filters to tackle the computational challenges in Four-Dimensional Variational Data Assimilation (4DVAR). 4DVAR, widely used in numerical weather prediction, suffers from inefficiencies in high-dimensional, non-linear systems. Our approach, the Quantum Variational Particle Filter (QVPF), uses QAOA to optimize particle proposals and QMCMC to efficiently compute particle weights and resample, accelerating convergence while reducing the computational load.
  The QVPF framework addresses the curse of dimensionality by minimizing the number of particles required for accurate state estimation, thus improving efficiency in systems with complex dynamics. The hybrid model offers enhanced accuracy by integrating quantum algorithms into the variational particle filter, making it particularly suited for applications in climate modeling, space weather prediction, and defense. The potential for achieving unprecedented resolution in predictive models could transform sectors that rely on high-resolution forecasting.
  We present the mathematical foundations of the approach, along with discussions on algorithmic implementation and hardware requirements. Early results suggest that this hybrid framework could significantly improve data assimilation, with future implementations on near-term quantum devices offering a practical pathway for scaling up. This work demonstrates how quantum computing can address the growing need for more accurate and computationally feasible methods in large-scale data assimilation.</description>

      <title>Statistical Response of ENSO Complexity to Initial Condition and Model Parameter Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03281</link>

Abstract: Studying the response of a climate system to perturbations has practical significance. Standard methods in computing the trajectory-wise deviation caused by perturbations may suffer from the chaotic nature that makes the model error dominate the true response after a short lead time. Statistical response, which computes the return described by the statistics, provides a systematic way of reaching robust outcomes with an appropriate quantification of the uncertainty and extreme events. In this paper, information theory is applied to compute the statistical response and find the most sensitive perturbation direction of different El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events to initial value and model parameter perturbations. Depending on the initial phase and the time horizon, different state variables contribute to the most sensitive perturbation direction. While initial perturbations in sea surface temperature (SST) and thermocline depth usually lead to the most significant response of SST at short- and long-range, respectively, initial adjustment of the zonal advection can be crucial to trigger strong statistical responses at medium-range around 5 to 7 months, especially at the transient phases between El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na. It is also shown that the response in the variance triggered by external random forcing perturbations, such as the wind bursts, often dominates the mean response, making the resulting most sensitive direction very different from the trajectory-wise methods. Finally, despite the strong non-Gaussian climatology distributions, using Gaussian approximations in the information theory is efficient and accurate for computing the statistical response, allowing the method to be applied to sophisticated operational systems.</description>

      <title>Lightning declines over shipping lanes following regulation of fuel sulfur emissions</title>

Abstract: Aerosol interactions with clouds represent a significant uncertainty in our understanding of the Earth system. Deep convective clouds may respond to aerosol perturbations in several ways that have proven difficult to elucidate with observations. Here, we leverage the two busiest maritime shipping lanes in the world, which emit aerosol particles and their precursors into an otherwise relatively clean tropical marine boundary layer, to make headway on the influence of aerosol on deep convective clouds. The recent seven-fold change in allowable fuel sulfur by the International Maritime Organization allows us to test the sensitivity of the lightning to changes in ship plume aerosol size distributions. We find that, across a range of atmospheric thermodynamic conditions, the previously documented enhancement of lightning over the shipping lanes has fallen by over 40%. The enhancement is therefore at least partially aerosol-mediated, a conclusion that is supported by observations of droplet number at cloud base, which show a similar decline over the shipping lane. These results have fundamental implications for our understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions, suggesting that deep convective clouds are impacted by the aerosol number distribution in the remote marine environment.</description>

      <title>Verifying The Radiosonde Humidity Sensor Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monitoring the performance of humidity sensors has become particularly relevant due to the lack of in-house production of humidity sensors in the Russian Federation and the logistical problems that have arisen. Humidity is subject to high spatial variability, therefore, standard methods for monitoring data quality based on the difference with the field of the first approximation are not applicable for its control. It is proposed to carry out monitoring by comparing readings on the surface and at altitude with a pressure of 850 hPa, where humidity is less than 60% in the absence of low clouds, and more than 70% in its presence. The fact of the presence/absence of low clouds is determined by the readings of a vertically oriented pyrometer. The difference between the air temperature at the surface and the temperature from the pyrometer of more than 14{\deg}K corresponds to the absence of low clouds, and less than 14{\deg}K corresponds to the presence of low clouds. Accordingly, a serviceable humidity sensor should show the appropriate values.</description>
