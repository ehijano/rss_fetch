      <title>Designing a Multimodal Viewer for Piano Performance Analysis -- a Pedagogy-First Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstract instructions in piano education, such as "raise your wrist" and "relax your tension," lead to varying interpretations among learners, preventing instructors from effectively conveying their intended pedagogical guidance. To address this problem, this study conducted systematic interviews with a piano professor with 18 years teaching experience, and two researchers derived seven core need groups through cross-validation. Based on these findings, we developed a web-based dashboard prototype integrating video, motion capture, and musical scores, enabling instructors to provide concrete, visual feedback instead of relying solely on abstract verbal instructions. Technical feasibility was validated through 109 performance datasets.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Information Disorder on Video-Sharing Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video sharing platforms (VSPs) have become central information hubs but also facilitate the spread of information disorder, from misleading narratives to fabricated content. This survey synthesizes research on VSPs' multimedia ecosystems across three dimensions: (1) types of information disorder, (2) methodological approaches, and (3) platform features. We conclude by identifying key challenges and open questions for future research.</description>

      <title>TIP and Polish: Text-Image-Prototype Guided Multi-Modal Generation via Commonality-Discrepancy Modeling and Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal generation struggles to ensure thematic coherence and style consistency. Semantically, existing methods suffer from cross-modal mismatch and lack explicit modeling of commonality and discrepancy. Methods that rely on fine-grained training fail to balance semantic precision with writing style consistency. These shortcomings lead to suboptimal generation quality. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{\textit{TIPPo}}, a simple yet effective framework with explicit input modeling and comprehensive optimization objectives. It extracts the input text and images via multi-modal encoder and adapters, then measures the visual prototype. \textbf{T}extual, \textbf{I}mage, and \textbf{P}rototype signals are then fed to our proposed Dual Alignment Attention and Difference Operator modules before language model decoding. The proposed \textbf{Po}lishPPO reinforces the style consistency, while the unsupervised contrastive learning during SFT mitigates inter-sample representation collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of \textbf{\textit{TIPPo}} in automatic evaluation and LLM-based criteria for creativity and semantic consistency.</description>

      <title>3MDiT: Unified Tri-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Text-Driven Synchronized Audio-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have recently achieved impressive visual quality, yet most systems still generate silent clips and treat audio as a secondary concern. Existing audio-video generation pipelines typically decompose the task into cascaded stages, which accumulate errors across modalities and are trained under separate objectives. Recent joint audio-video generators alleviate this issue but often rely on dual-tower architectures with ad-hoc cross-modal bridges and static, single-shot text conditioning, making it difficult to both reuse T2V backbones and to reason about how audio, video and language interact over time. To address these challenges, we propose 3MDiT, a unified tri-modal diffusion transformer for text-driven synchronized audio-video generation. Our framework models video, audio and text as jointly evolving streams: an isomorphic audio branch mirrors a T2V backbone, tri-modal omni-blocks perform feature-level fusion across the three modalities, and an optional dynamic text conditioning mechanism updates the text representation as audio and video evidence co-evolve. The design supports two regimes: training from scratch on audio-video data, and orthogonally adapting a pretrained T2V model without modifying its backbone. Experiments show that our approach generates high-quality videos and realistic audio while consistently improving audio-video synchronization and tri-modal alignment across a range of quantitative metrics.</description>

      <title>VSpeechLM: A Visual Speech Language Model for Visual Text-to-Speech Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of Visual Text-to-Speech (VisualTTS), also known as video dubbing, aims to generate speech synchronized with the lip movements in an input video, in additional to being consistent with the content of input text and cloning the timbre of a reference speech. Existing VisualTTS models typically adopt lightweight architectures and design specialized modules to achieve the above goals respectively, yet the speech quality is not satisfied due to the model capacity and the limited data in VisualTTS. Recently, speech large language models (SpeechLLM) show the robust ability to generate high-quality speech. But few work has been done to well leverage temporal cues from video input in generating lip-synchronized speech. To generate both high-quality and lip-synchronized speech in VisualTTS tasks, we propose a novel Visual Speech Language Model called VSpeechLM based upon a SpeechLLM. To capture the synchronization relationship between text and video, we propose a text-video aligner. It first learns fine-grained alignment between phonemes and lip movements, and then outputs an expanded phoneme sequence containing lip-synchronization cues. Next, our proposed SpeechLLM based decoders take the expanded phoneme sequence as input and learns to generate lip-synchronized speech. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VSpeechLM significantly outperforms previous VisualTTS methods in terms of overall quality, speaker similarity, and synchronization metrics.</description>

      <title>Angle-Optimized Partial Disentanglement for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (MERC) aims to enhance emotion understanding by integrating complementary cues from text, audio, and visual modalities. Existing MERC approaches predominantly focus on cross-modal shared features, often overlooking modality-specific features that capture subtle yet critical emotional cues such as micro-expressions, prosodic variations, and sarcasm. Although related work in multimodal emotion recognition (MER) has explored disentangling shared and modality-specific features, these methods typically employ rigid orthogonal constraints to achieve full disentanglement, which neglects the inherent complementarity between feature types and may limit recognition performance. To address these challenges, we propose Angle-Optimized Feature Learning (AO-FL), a framework tailored for MERC that achieves partial disentanglement of shared and specific features within each modality through adaptive angular optimization. Specifically, AO-FL aligns shared features across modalities to ensure semantic consistency, and within each modality it adaptively models the angular relationship between its shared and modality-specific features to preserve both distinctiveness and complementarity. An orthogonal projection refinement further removes redundancy in specific features and enriches shared features with contextual information, yielding more discriminative multimodal representations. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of AO-FL for MERC, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, AO-FL can be seamlessly integrated with various unimodal feature extractors and extended to other multimodal fusion tasks, such as MER, thereby highlighting its strong generalization beyond MERC.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Disentanglement with Projected Feature Alignment for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (MERC) significantly enhances emotion recognition performance by integrating complementary emotional cues from text, audio, and visual modalities. While existing methods commonly utilize techniques such as contrastive learning and cross-attention mechanisms to align cross-modal emotional semantics, they typically overlook modality-specific emotional nuances like micro-expressions, tone variations, and sarcastic language. To overcome these limitations, we propose Orthogonal Disentanglement with Projected Feature Alignment (OD-PFA), a novel framework designed explicitly to capture both shared semantics and modality-specific emotional cues. Our approach first decouples unimodal features into shared and modality-specific components. An orthogonal disentanglement strategy (OD) enforces effective separation between these components, aided by a reconstruction loss to maintain critical emotional information from each modality. Additionally, a projected feature alignment strategy (PFA) maps shared features across modalities into a common latent space and applies a cross-modal consistency alignment loss to enhance semantic coherence. Extensive evaluations on widely-used benchmark datasets, IEMOCAP and MELD, demonstrate effectiveness of our proposed OD-PFA multimodal emotion recognition tasks, as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>A Progressive Evaluation Framework for Multicultural Analysis of Story Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image generative models have improved narrative consistency in story visualization. However, current story visualization models often overlook cultural dimensions, resulting in visuals that lack authenticity and cultural fidelity. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive multicultural analysis of story visualization using current text-to-image models across multilingual settings on two datasets: FlintstonesSV and VIST. To assess cultural dimensions rigorously, we propose a Progressive Multicultural Evaluation Framework and introduce five story visualization metrics, Cultural Appropriateness, Visual Aesthetics, Cohesion, Semantic Consistency, and Object Presence, that are not addressed by existing metrics. We further automate assessment through an MLLM-as-Jury framework that approximates human judgment. Human evaluations show that models generate more coherent, visually appealing, and culturally appropriate stories for real-world datasets than for animated ones. The generated stories exhibit a stronger alignment with English-speaking cultures across all metrics except Cohesion, where Chinese performs better. In contrast, Hindi ranks lowest on all metrics except Visual Aesthetics, reflecting real-world cultural biases embedded in current models. This multicultural analysis provides a foundation for future research aimed at generating culturally appropriate and inclusive visual stories across diverse linguistic and cultural settings.</description>

      <title>AutoRec: Accelerating Loss Recovery for Live Streaming in a Multi-Supplier Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the limited permissions for upgrading dualside (i.e., server-side and client-side) loss tolerance schemes from the perspective of CDN vendors in a multi-supplier market, modern large-scale live streaming services are still using the automatic-repeat-request (ARQ) based paradigm for loss recovery, which only requires server-side modifications. In this paper, we first conduct a large-scale measurement study with up to 50 million live streams. We find that loss shows dynamics and live streaming contains frequent on-off mode switching in the wild. We further find that the recovery latency, enlarged by the ubiquitous retransmission loss, is a critical factor affecting live streaming's client-side QoE (e.g., video freezing). We then propose an enhanced recovery mechanism called AutoRec, which can transform the disadvantages of on-off mode switching into an advantage for reducing loss recovery latency without any modifications on the client side. AutoRec allows users to customize overhead tolerance and recovery latency tolerance and adaptively adjusts strategies as the network environment changes to ensure that recovery latency meets user demands whenever possible while keeping overhead under control. We implement AutoRec upon QUIC and evaluate it via testbed and real-world commercial services deployments. The experimental results demonstrate the practicability and profitability of AutoRec.</description>

      <title>OralGPT-Omni: A Versatile Dental Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited immense potential across numerous medical specialties; yet, dentistry remains underexplored, in part due to limited domain-specific data, scarce dental expert annotations, insufficient modality-specific modeling, and challenges in reliability. In this paper, we present OralGPT-Omni, the first dental-specialized MLLM designed for comprehensive and trustworthy analysis across diverse dental imaging modalities and clinical tasks. To explicitly capture dentists' diagnostic reasoning, we construct TRACE-CoT, a clinically grounded chain-of-thought dataset that mirrors dental radiologists' decision-making processes. This reasoning supervision, combined with our proposed four-stage training paradigm, substantially strengthens the model's capacity for dental image understanding and analysis. In parallel, we introduce MMOral-Uni, the first unified multimodal benchmark for dental image analysis. It comprises 2,809 open-ended question-answer pairs spanning five modalities and five tasks, offering a comprehensive evaluation suite to date for MLLMs in digital dentistry. OralGPT-Omni achieves an overall score of 51.84 on the MMOral-Uni benchmark and 45.31 on the MMOral-OPG benchmark, dramatically outperforming the scores of GPT-5. Our work promotes intelligent dentistry and paves the way for future advances in dental image analysis. All code, benchmark, and models will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>ReAG: Reasoning-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in jointly understanding text, images, and videos, often evaluated via Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with domain-specific or knowledge-intensive queries, where relevant information is underrepresented in pre-training data. Knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA) addresses this by retrieving external documents to condition answer generation, but current retrieval-augmented approaches suffer from low precision, noisy passages, and limited reasoning. To address this, we propose ReAG, a novel Reasoning-Augmented Multimodal RAG approach that combines coarse- and fine-grained retrieval with a critic model that filters irrelevant passages, ensuring high-quality additional context. The model follows a multi-stage training strategy leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning over retrieved content, while supervised fine-tuning serves only as a cold start. Extensive experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate that ReAG significantly outperforms prior methods, improving answer accuracy and providing interpretable reasoning grounded in retrieved evidence. Our source code is publicly available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/ReAG.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Feelings: Aligning MLLMs with Human Cognitive Perception of Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are adept at answering what is in an image-identifying objects and describing scenes-they often lack the ability to understand how an image feels to a human observer. This gap is most evident when considering subjective cognitive properties, such as what makes an image memorable, funny, aesthetically pleasing, or emotionally evocative. To systematically address this challenge, we introduce CogIP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on such image cognitive properties. Our evaluation reveals a significant gap: current models are poorly aligned with human perception of these nuanced properties. We then demonstrate that a post-training phase can effectively bridge this gap, significantly enhancing the model's alignment with human judgments. Furthermore, we show that this learned cognitive alignment is not merely predictive but also transferable to downstream creative tasks. By integrating our cognitively-aligned MLLM into an image generation pipeline, we can guide the synthesis process to produce images that better embody desired traits, such as being more memorable or visually appealing. Our work provides a benchmark to measure this human-like perception, a post-training pipeline to enhance it, and a demonstration that this alignment unlocks more human-centric AI.</description>

      <title>Cap2Sum: Learning to Summarize Videos by Generating Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of video data on the internet, video summarization is becoming a very important AI technology. However, due to the high labelling cost of video summarization, existing studies have to be conducted on small-scale datasets, leading to limited performance and generalization capacity. In this work, we introduce the use of dense video captions as a supervision signal to train video summarization models. Motivated by this, we propose Cap2Sum, a model that learns to summarize videos by generating captions, to exploit dense video caption annotations. This weakly-supervised approach allows us to train the models on large-scale dense video caption datasets to achieve better performance and generalization capacity. To further improve the generalization capacity, we introduce a CLIP (a strong vision-language model) Prior mechanism to enhance the learning of important objects that captions may ignore in the videos. In practice, Cap2Sum can perform zero-shot video summarization or be fine-tuned by the ground-truth summary or video caption of the target dataset. To examine the performance of Cap2Sum after weakly-supervised fine-tuning by the video captions, we propose two new datasets, TVSum-Caption and SumMe-Caption, which are derived from two common video summarization datasets and will be publicly released. We conduct extensive experiments and the results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in performance and generalization capacity compared with previous methods.</description>

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash-Omni, a state-of-the-art open-source omni-modal model with 560 billion parameters, excelling at real-time audio-visual interaction. By adopting a curriculum-inspired progressive training strategy that transitions from simpler to increasingly complex modality sequence modeling tasks, LongCat-Flash-Omni attains comprehensive multimodal capabilities while maintaining strong unimodal capability. Building upon LongCat-Flash, which adopts a high-performance Shortcut-connected Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with zero-computation experts, LongCat-Flash-Omni integrates efficient multimodal perception and speech reconstruction modules. Despite its immense size of 560B parameters (with 27B activated), LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves low-latency real-time audio-visual interaction. For training infrastructure, we developed a modality-decoupled parallelism scheme specifically designed to manage the data and model heterogeneity inherent in large-scale multimodal training. This innovative approach demonstrates exceptional efficiency by sustaining over 90% of the throughput achieved by text-only training. Extensive evaluations show that LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on omni-modal benchmarks among open-source models. Furthermore, it delivers highly competitive results across a wide range of modality-specific tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, as well as audio understanding and generation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the model architecture design, training procedures, and data strategies, and open-source the model to foster future research and development in the community.</description>

      <title>Holistic Evaluation of Multimodal LLMs on Spatial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13142v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, the very capability that anchors artificial general intelligence in the physical world. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models (GPT, Gemini, Grok, Seed, Qwen, and Intern) stand on the path toward spatial intelligence (SI). We thus propose EASI for holistic Evaluation of multimodAl LLMs on Spatial Intelligence. EASI conceptualizes a comprehensive taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and a growing collection of newly curated ones, enabling systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models. In this report, we conduct the study across eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding ten billion total tokens. Our empirical study then reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in SI, yet (2) still falls short of human performance significantly across a broad spectrum of SI-tasks. Moreover, we (3) show that SI-tasks expose greater model capability deficiency than non-SI tasks, to the extent that (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult ones. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans, yet fail the most advanced multimodal models. EASI is an ongoing community effort: we have open-sourced the EASI codebase that provides a one-stop and reproducible solution with standardized interfaces, integrated protocols and prompts that significantly reduce the friction of configuring and running multiple benchmarks; we have also launched an accompanying EASI leaderboard to provide a continually updated snapshot of model performance across the full SI spectrum, accelerating collective progress toward robust SI.</description>

      <title>Mina: A Multilingual LLM-Powered Legal Assistant Agent for Bangladesh for Empowering Access to Justice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface. Evaluated by law faculty from leading Bangladeshi universities across all stages of the 2022 and 2023 Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, Mina scored 75-80% in Preliminary MCQs, Written, and simulated Viva Voce exams, matching or surpassing average human performance and demonstrating clarity, contextual understanding, and sound legal reasoning. Even under a conservative upper bound, Mina operates at just 0.12-0.61% of typical legal consultation costs in Bangladesh, yielding a 99.4-99.9\% cost reduction relative to human-provided services. These results confirm its potential as a low-cost, multilingual AI assistant that automates key legal tasks and scales access to justice, offering a real-world case study on building domain-specific, low-resource systems and addressing challenges of multilingual adaptation, efficiency, and sustainable public-service AI deployment.</description>

      <title>Video Echoed in Music: Semantic, Temporal, and Rhythmic Alignment for Video-to-Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video-to-Music generation seeks to generate musically appropriate background music that enhances audiovisual immersion for videos. However, current approaches suffer from two critical limitations: 1) incomplete representation of video details, leading to weak alignment, and 2) inadequate temporal and rhythmic correspondence, particularly in achieving precise beat synchronization. To address the challenges, we propose Video Echoed in Music (VeM), a latent music diffusion that generates high-quality soundtracks with semantic, temporal, and rhythmic alignment for input videos. To capture video details comprehensively, VeM employs a hierarchical video parsing that acts as a music conductor, orchestrating multi-level information across modalities. Modality-specific encoders, coupled with a storyboard-guided cross-attention mechanism (SG-CAtt), integrate semantic cues while maintaining temporal coherence through position and duration encoding. For rhythmic precision, the frame-level transition-beat aligner and adapter (TB-As) dynamically synchronize visual scene transitions with music beats. We further contribute a novel video-music paired dataset sourced from e-commerce advertisements and video-sharing platforms, which imposes stricter transition-beat synchronization requirements. Meanwhile, we introduce novel metrics tailored to the task. Experimental results demonstrate superiority, particularly in semantic relevance and rhythmic precision.</description>

      <title>Scaling Spatial Intelligence with Multimodal Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite remarkable progress, multimodal foundation models still exhibit surprising deficiencies in spatial intelligence. In this work, we explore scaling up multimodal foundation models to cultivate spatial intelligence within the SenseNova-SI family, built upon established multimodal foundations including visual understanding models (i.e., Qwen3-VL and InternVL3) and unified understanding and generation models (i.e., Bagel). We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En). More importantly, we analyze the impact of data scaling, discuss early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, analyze the risk of overfitting and language shortcuts, present a preliminary study on spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, and validate the potential downstream application. SenseNova-SI is an ongoing project, and this report will be updated continuously. All newly trained multimodal foundation models are publicly released to facilitate further research in this direction.</description>

      <title>RacketVision: A Multiple Racket Sports Benchmark for Unified Ball and Racket Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce RacketVision, a novel dataset and benchmark for advancing computer vision in sports analytics, covering table tennis, tennis, and badminton. The dataset is the first to provide large-scale, fine-grained annotations for racket pose alongside traditional ball positions, enabling research into complex human-object interactions. It is designed to tackle three interconnected tasks: fine-grained ball tracking, articulated racket pose estimation, and predictive ball trajectory forecasting. Our evaluation of established baselines reveals a critical insight for multi-modal fusion: while naively concatenating racket pose features degrades performance, a CrossAttention mechanism is essential to unlock their value, leading to trajectory prediction results that surpass strong unimodal baselines. RacketVision provides a versatile resource and a strong starting point for future research in dynamic object tracking, conditional motion forecasting, and multimodal analysis in sports.
