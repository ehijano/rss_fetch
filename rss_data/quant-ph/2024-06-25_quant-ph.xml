      <title>Pragmatic Self-adjoint Procedure in the Schrodinger Equation for the Inverse Square Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-adjoint extension (SAE) procedure is considered in the Schrodinger equation for potentials behaving as an attractive inverse square at the origin of coordinates. This approach guarantees self-adjointness of the radial Hamiltonian in three dimensions. It is shown that the single bound state appears after such an extension, which depends on SAE parameter. The same parameter arises for the scattering case as well, when the extension is made by orthogonality requirement. The closed form is derived for the modified scattering amplitude, which consists an extra factor depended on the SAE parameter. That guarantees the appearance of the same bound state in the form of the scattering amplitude pole. So, the generalization of pragmatic method is demonstrated in case of continuous spectrum.</description>

      <title>Thermal state preparation of the SYK model using a variational quantum algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the preparation of thermal states of the dense and sparse Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model using a variational quantum algorithm for $6 \le N \le 12$ Majorana fermions over a wide range of temperatures. Utilizing IBM's 127-qubit quantum processor, we perform benchmark computations for the dense SYK model with $N = 6$, showing good agreement with exact results. The preparation of thermal states of a non-local random Hamiltonian with all-to-all coupling using the simulator and quantum hardware represents a significant step toward future computations of thermal out-of-time order correlators in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of a non-Hermitian supersonic mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers have long been anticipated to excel in simulating quantum many-body physics. While most previous work has focused on Hermitian physics, we demonstrate the power of variational quantum circuits for resource-efficient simulations of dynamical and equilibrium physics in non-Hermitian systems, revealing new phenomena beyond standard Hermitian quantum machines. Using a variational quantum compilation scheme for fermionic systems, we reduce gate count, save qubits, and eliminate the need for postselection, a major challenge in simulating non-Hermitian dynamics via standard Trotterization. Experimentally, we observed a supersonic mode in the connected density-density correlation function on an $ n = 18 $ fermionic chain after a non-Hermitian, locally interacting quench, which would otherwise be forbidden by the Lieb-Robinson bound in a Hermitian system. Additionally, we investigate sequential quantum circuits generated by tensor networks for ground state preparation, here defined as the eigenstate with the lowest real part eigenvalue, using a variance minimization scheme. Through a trapped-ion implementation on the Quantinuum H1 quantum processor, we accurately capture correlation functions and energies across an exceptional point on a dissipative spin chain up to length $ n = 20 $ using only 3 qubits. Motivated by these advancements, we provide an analytical example demonstrating that simulating single-qubit non-Hermitian dynamics for $\Theta(\log(n))$ time from certain initial states is exponentially hard on a quantum computer, offering insights into the opportunities and limitations of using quantum computation for simulating non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>Introducing Moment: A toolkit for semi-definite programming with moment matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-commutative polynomial optimization is a powerful technique with numerous applications in quantum nonlocality, quantum key distribution, causal inference, many-body physics, amongst others. The standard approach is to reduce such optimizations to a hierarchy of semi-definite programs, which can be solved numerically using well-understood interior-point methods. A key, but computationally costly, step is the formulation of moment matrices, whose size (and hence cost) grows exponentially with the depth of the hierarchy. It is therefore essential to have highly-optimized software to construct moment matrices. Here, we introduce Moment: a toolkit that produces moment matrix relaxations from the specification of a non-commutative optimization problem. In order to obtain the absolute best performance, Moment is written in C++, and for convenience of use provides an interface via MATLAB. We benchmark Moment's performance, and see that it can be up to four orders of magnitude faster than current software with similar functionality.</description>

      <title>Escaping the Shadow of Bell's Theorem in Network Nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of nonclassicality in networks unrelated to Bell's original eponymous theorem has recently attracted significant interest. Here, we identify a sufficient condition for being "outside the shadow of Bell's theorem" and introduce a testable criterion capable of certifying the novelty of instances of network-nonclassicality which we call minimal network nonclassicality. We provide examples of minimally network nonclassical correlations realizable in quantum theory as well as examples coming from more exotic operational probabilistic theories. In particular, we apply these concepts to the simplest configuration of the 3-chain scenario (a.k.a. the bilocality scenario) to prove that certain correlations have escaped the shadow of Bell's theorem. While some of the examples herein are unprecedented, we also revisit more familiar examples of network nonclassicality in order to highlight the contrast between our approach versus prior approaches with respect to assessing novelty.</description>

      <title>Assessing and Advancing the Potential of Quantum Computing: A NASA Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is one of the most enticing computational paradigms with the potential to revolutionize diverse areas of future-generation computational systems. While quantum computing hardware has advanced rapidly, from tiny laboratory experiments to quantum chips that can outperform even the largest supercomputers on specialized computational tasks, these noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) processors are still too small and non-robust to be directly useful for any real-world applications. In this paper, we describe NASA's work in assessing and advancing the potential of quantum computing. We discuss advances in algorithms, both near- and longer-term, and the results of our explorations on current hardware as well as with simulations, including illustrating the benefits of algorithm-hardware co-design in the NISQ era. This work also includes physics-inspired classical algorithms that can be used at application scale today. We discuss innovative tools supporting the assessment and advancement of quantum computing and describe improved methods for simulating quantum systems of various types on high-performance computing systems that incorporate realistic error models. We provide an overview of recent methods for benchmarking, evaluating, and characterizing quantum hardware for error mitigation, as well as insights into fundamental quantum physics that can be harnessed for computational purposes.</description>

      <title>On the Multiplicity of Density Operator Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density operator is usually defined starting from a set of kets in the Hilbert space and a probability distribution. From this definition it is easy to obtain a factorization of a given density operator, here called density factor (DF). The multiplicity and the variety of DFs is investigated using the tools of Matrix Analysis, arriving in particular to establish the DF with minimal size. The approach based on Matrix Analysis does not seem to be available elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Generalized Type II Fusion of Cluster States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement based quantum computation is a quantum computing paradigm, that employs single-qubit measurements performed on an entangled resource state in the form of a cluster state. A basic ingredient in the construction of the resource state is the type II fusion procedure, which connects two cluster states. We generalize the type II fusion procedure by generalizing the fusion matrix, and classify the resulting final states, which also include cluster states up to single-qubit rotations. We prove that the probability for the success of the generalized type II fusion is bounded by fifty percent, and classify all the possibilities to saturate the bound. We analyze the enhancement of the fusion success probability above the fifty percent bound, by the reduction of the entanglement entropy of the fusion link. We prove that the only states, that can be obtained with hundred percent probability of success, are product states.</description>

      <title>A photonic quantum engine driven by superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance of nano- and micro-scale heat engines can be improved with a help from quantum mechanical phenomena. Recently, heat reservoirs with quantum coherence have been proposed to enhance engine performance beyond the Carnot limit even with a single reservoir. However, no physical realizations have been achieved so far. Here, we report the first proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of a photonic quantum engine driven by superradiance employing a single heat reservoir composed of atoms and photonic vacuum. Reservoir atoms prepared in a quantum coherent superposition state underwent superradiance while traversing the cavity. This led to about 40-fold increase of the effective engine temperature, resulting in a near-unity engine efficiency. Moreover, the observed engine output power grew quadratically with respect to the atomic injection rate. Our work can be utilized in quantum mechanical heat transfer as well as in boosting engine powers, opening a pathway to development of photomechanical devices that run on quantum coherence embedded in heat baths.</description>

      <title>Clapton: Clifford-Assisted Problem Transformation for Error Mitigation in Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) show potential for quantum advantage in the near term of quantum computing, but demand a level of accuracy that surpasses the current capabilities of NISQ devices. To systematically mitigate the impact of quantum device error on VQAs, we propose Clapton: Clifford-Assisted Problem Transformation for Error Mitigation in Variational Quantum Algorithms. Clapton leverages classically estimated good quantum states for a given VQA problem, classical simulable models of device noise, and the variational principle for VQAs. It applies transformations on the VQA problem's Hamiltonian to lower the energy estimates of known good VQA states in the presence of the modeled device noise. The Clapton hypothesis is that as long as the known good states of the VQA problem are close to the problem's ideal ground state and the device noise modeling is reasonably accurate (both of which are generally true), then the Clapton transformation substantially decreases the impact of device noise on the ground state of the VQA problem, thereby increasing the accuracy of the VQA solution. Clapton is built as an end-to-end application-to-device framework and achieves mean VQA initialization improvements of 1.7x to 3.7x, and up to a maximum of 13.3x, over the state-of-the-art baseline when evaluated for a variety of scientific applications from physics and chemistry on noise models and real quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Perturbative stability and error correction thresholds of quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically-ordered phases are stable to local perturbations, and topological quantum error-correcting codes enjoy thresholds to local errors. We connect the two notions of stability by constructing classical statistical mechanics models for decoding general CSS codes and classical linear codes. Our construction encodes correction success probabilities under uncorrelated bit-flip and phase-flip errors, and simultaneously describes a generalized Z2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We observe that the clean limit of the latter is precisely the discretized imaginary time path integral of the corresponding quantum code Hamiltonian when the errors are turned into a perturbative X or Z magnetic field. Motivated by error correction considerations, we define general order parameters for all such generalized Z2 lattice gauge theories, and show that they are generally lower bounded by success probabilities of error correction. For CSS codes satisfying the LDPC condition and with a sufficiently large code distance, we prove the existence of a low temperature ordered phase of the corresponding lattice gauge theories, particularly for those lacking Euclidean spatial locality and/or when there is a nonzero code rate. We further argue that these results provide evidence to stable phases in the corresponding perturbed quantum Hamiltonians, obtained in the limit of continuous imaginary time. To do so, we distinguish space- and time-like defects in the lattice gauge theory. A high free-energy cost of space-like defects corresponds to a successful "memory experiment" and suppresses the energy splitting among the ground states, while a high free-energy cost of time-like defects corresponds to a successful "stability experiment" and points to a nonzero gap to local excitations.</description>

      <title>Feedback-driven quantum reservoir computing for time-series analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is a highly promising computational paradigm that leverages quantum systems as a computational resource for nonlinear information processing. While its application to time-series analysis is eagerly anticipated, prevailing approaches suffer from the collapse of the quantum state upon measurement, resulting in the erasure of temporal input memories. Neither repeated initializations nor weak measurements offer a fundamental solution, as the former escalates time complexity while the latter restricts the information extraction from the Hilbert space. To address this issue, we propose a feedback-driven QRC framework. This methodology employs projective measurements on all qubits for unrestricted access to the quantum state, with the measurement outcomes subsequently fed back into the reservoir to restore the memory of prior inputs. We demonstrate that our QRC successfully acquires the fading-memory property through the feedback, a critical element in time-series processing. Notably, analysis of measurement trajectories reveal three distinct phases depending on the feedback strength, with the memory performance maximized at the edge of chaos. We also evaluate the predictive capabilities of our QRC, demonstrating its suitability for forecasting signals originating from quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Risk-Dominant Equilibrium in Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The choice of a unique Nash equilibrium (NE) is crucial in theoretical classical and quantum games. The Eiswer-Wilkens-Lewenstein quantization scheme solves the prisoner's dilemma only for high entanglement. At medium entanglement, there are multiple NEs. We investigate the selection of a unique NE in the quantum prisoner's dilemma with variable dilemma strength parameters. The risk-dominance criterion is used. The influence of the dilemma strength parameters and entanglement is emphasized. We found that entanglement completely controls the risk-dominant equilibrium. Entanglement promotes quantum-cooperation in the risk-dominant equilibrium and thus improves its outcome.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, Jin et al. proposed a quantum simulation technique for any a linear PDE, called Schr\"{o}dingerisation [1-3], which has been successfully applied to solve many non-Hamiltonian linear PDEs. In this paper, the Schr\"{o}dingerisation technique of quantum simulation is expanded to any a nonlinear PDE by means of combining the Schr\"{o}dingerisation technique with the homotopy analysis method (HAM) [4-6] that can transfer any a nonlinear PDE into a series of linear PDEs with convergence guarantee of series solution. In this way, a nonlinear PDE can be solved by quantum simulation using a quantum computer -- yet to be developed in the future. For simplicity, we call it ``the HAM-Schr\"{o}dingerisation quantum algorithm''.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Hall effects provide intuitive ways of revealing the topology in crystals, i.e., each quantized "step" represents a distinct topological state. Here, we seek a counterpart for "visualizing" quantum geometry, which is a broader concept. We show how geometry emerges in quantum as an intrinsic consequence of unitary evolution, independent of specific details or approximations, suggesting quantum geometry may have widespread applicability. Indeed, we exemplify geometric observables, such as oscillation, dephasing, in spin and band scenarios. These phenomena are robust owing to the continuity of geometry, and can be tuned by geometric parameters. Anomalies, supported by both analytic and numerical solutions, underscore the advantages of adopting a geometric perspective, potentially yielding distinguishable experimental signatures.</description>

      <title>Repeater-Like Asynchronous Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Conference Key Agreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum conference key agreement facilitates secure communication among multiple parties through multipartite entanglement and is anticipated to be an important cryptographic primitive for future quantum networks. However, the experimental complexity and low efficiency associated with the synchronous detection of multipartite entangled states have significantly hindered their practical application. In this work, we propose a measurement-device-independent conference key agreement protocol that utilizes asynchronous Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state measurement.This approach achieves a linear scaling of the conference key rate among multiple parties, exhibiting performance similar to that of the single-repeater scheme in quantum networks. The asynchronous measurement strategy bypasses the need for complex global phase locking technologies, concurrently extending the intercity transmission distance with composable security in the finite key regime. Additionally, our work also showcases the advantages of the asynchronous pairing concept in multiparty quantum entanglement.</description>

Abstract: We illustrate Heisenberg's method of matrix mechanics using the planar quantum rotor example. We show how to find the spectrum of this simple model without the need to use the eigenstates of the system. This then leads us to speculate on the role the Heisenberg state plays in quantum mechanics and to ask whether one could even completely dispose of the need for states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonpolar atoms or molecules with light particle mass and weak particle-particle interaction can form quantum liquids and solids (QLS) at low temperatures. Excess electrons can be naturally bound to the surface of a QLS in a vacuum and exhibit unique quantum electronic behaviors in two and lower dimensions. In this article, we review the historical study and recent progress in this area. The main topics covered in this review include the collective and individual electron transport on liquid helium, solid neon, and solid hydrogen, the theoretical proposal and experimental effort toward single electron qubits on superfluid helium, the recent experimental realization of single electron charge qubits on solid neon and the related theoretical calculation. In the end, we review and envision extended exploration of quantum electronics on heterogeneous QLS.</description>

      <title>Tomita-Takesaki theory and quantum concurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum entanglement measure of concurrence is shown to be directly calculable from a Tomita- Takesaki modular operator framework constructed from the local von Neumann algebras of observables for two quantum systems. Specifically, the Tomita-Takesaki modular conjugation operator $J$ that links two separate systems with respect to their von Neumann algebras is related to the quantum concurrence $C$ of a pure bi-variate entangled state composed from these systems. This concurrence relation provides a direct physical meaning to $J$ as both a symmetry operator and a quantitative measure of entanglement. This procedure is then demonstrated for a supersymmetric quantum mechanical system and a real scalar field interacting with two entangled spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Unruh-DeWitt qubit detectors. For the latter system, the concurrence result is shown to be consistent with some known results on the Bell-CHSH inequality for such a system.</description>

      <title>Enantiomer-Specific Pumping of Chiral Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enantiomer-specific state transfer (ESST), which involves transferring enantiomers with different handedness of a chiral molecule into different-energy internal states, is a challenging yet significant task. Previous ESST methods are based on dynamic processes and thus require the preparation of initial states and precise control of microwave operation times. We propose a novel ESST approach, called enantiomer-specific pumping (ESP), which is based on a {\it dissipative} process, and thereby eliminates the need for these two technical requirements. This approach utilizes a special microwave-induced dark state that appears exclusively for the enantiomer with a specific handedness. Specifically, in ESP, the enantiomer lacking the dark state can be pumped out of the subspace of relevant internal states, while the enantiomer with the dark state maintains a finite probability within this subspace, offering high efficiency in ESST. Notably, ESP facilitates enantiodetection without the need for enantiopure samples as reference.</description>

      <title>Multitype entanglement dynamics induced by exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a most important feature of non-Hermitian systems, exceptional points (EPs) lead to a variety of unconventional phenomena and applications. Here we discover that multitype entanglement dynamics can be induced by engineering different orders of EP. By studying a generic model composed of two coupled non-Hermitian qubits, we find that diverse entanglement dynamics on the two sides of the fourth-order EP (EP4) and second-order EP (EP2) can be observed simultaneously in the weak coupling regime. With the increase of the coupling strength, the EP4 is replaced by an additional EP2, leading to the disappearance of the entanglement dynamics transition induced by EP4 in the strong coupling regime. Considering the case of Ising type interaction, we also realize EP-induced entanglement dynamics transition without the driving field. Our study paves the way for the investigation of EP-induced quantum effects and applications of EP-related quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Shortcut to adiabaticity and holonomic transformation are the same thing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stable and fast path linking arbitrary pair of quantum states is commonly desired for the engineering protocols inspired by stimulated Raman adiabatic passage, such as shortcut to adiabaticity and holonomic transformation. It has immediate applications in quantum control and quantum computation and is fundamental about the exact solution of a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. We construct a universal control framework based on the system dynamics within an ancillary picture, in which the system Hamiltonian is diagonal so that no transition exists among the ancillary bases during the time evolution. Practically the desired evolution path can be obtained by the von Neumann equation for the parametric ancillary bases. We demonstrate that our control framework can be reduced to the nonadiabatic holonomic quantum transformation, the Lewis-Riesenfeld theory for invariant, and the counterdiabatic driving method under distinct scenarios and conditions. Also it can be used to achieve the cyclic transfer of system population that could be a hard or complex problem for the existing methods. For the state engineering over a finite-dimensional quantum system, our work can provide a full-rank nonadiabatic time-evolution operator.</description>

      <title>Competing excitation quenching and charge exchange in ultracold Li-Ba$^+$ collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid atom-ion systems are a rich and powerful platform for studying chemical reactions, as they feature both excellent control over the electronic state preparation and readout as well as a versatile tunability over the scattering energy, ranging from the few-partial wave regime to the quantum regime. In this work, we make use of these excellent control knobs, and present a joint experimental and theoretical study of the collisions of a single $^{138}$Ba$^+$ ion prepared in the $5d\,^2D_{3/2,5/2}$ metastable states with a ground state $^6$Li gas near quantum degeneracy. We show that in contrast to previously reported atom-ion mixtures, several non-radiative processes, including charge exchange, excitation exchange and quenching, compete with each other due to the inherent complexity of the ion-atom molecular structure. We present a full quantum model based on high-level electronic structure calculations involving spin-orbit couplings. Results are in excellent agreement with observations, highlighting the strong coupling between the internal angular momenta and the mechanical rotation of the colliding pair, which is relevant in any other hybrid system composed of an alkali-metal atom and an alkaline-earth ion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Grover search algorithm is a pivotal advancement in quantum computing, promising a remarkable speedup over classical algorithms in searching unstructured large databases. Here, we report results for the implementation and characterization of a three-qubit Grover search algorithm using the state-of-the-art scalable quantum computing technology of superconducting quantum architectures. To delve into the algorithm's scalability and performance metrics, our investigation spans the execution of the algorithm across all eight conceivable single-result oracles, alongside nine two-result oracles, employing IBM Quantum's 127-qubit quantum computers. Moreover, we conduct five quantum state tomography experiments to precisely gauge the behavior and efficiency of our implemented algorithm under diverse conditions; ranging from noisy, noise-free environments to the complexities of real-world quantum hardware. By connecting theoretical concepts with real-world experiments, this study not only shed light on the potential of NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) computers in facilitating large-scale database searches but also offer valuable insights into the practical application of the Grover search algorithm in real-world quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metropolis Sampling via Weak Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gibbs sampling is a crucial computational technique used in physics, statistics, and many other scientific fields. For classical Hamiltonians, the most commonly used Gibbs sampler is the Metropolis algorithm, known for having the Gibbs state as its unique fixed point. For quantum Hamiltonians, designing provably correct Gibbs samplers has been more challenging. [TOV+11] introduced a novel method that uses quantum phase estimation (QPE) and the Marriot-Watrous rewinding technique to mimic the classical Metropolis algorithm for quantum Hamiltonians. The analysis of their algorithm relies upon the use of a boosted and shift-invariant version of QPE which may not exist [CKBG23]. Recent efforts to design quantum Gibbs samplers take a very different approach and are based on simulating Davies generators [CKBG23,CKG23,RWW23,DLL24]. Currently, these are the only provably correct Gibbs samplers for quantum Hamiltonians.
  We revisit the inspiration for the Metropolis-style algorithm of [TOV+11] and incorporate weak measurement to design a conceptually simple and provably correct quantum Gibbs sampler, with the Gibbs state as its approximate unique fixed point. Our method uses a Boosted QPE which takes the median of multiple runs of QPE, but we do not require the shift-invariant property. In addition, we do not use the Marriott-Watrous rewinding technique which simplifies the algorithm significantly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum battery (QB) is an energy storage and extraction device conforming to the principles of quantum mechanics. In this study, we consider the characteristics of QBs for the Heisenberg spin chain models in the absence and presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. Our results show that the DM interaction can enhance the ergotropy and power of QBs, which shows the collective charging can outperform parallel charging regarding QB's performance. Besides, it turns out that first-order coherence is a crucial quantum resource during charging, while quantum steering between the cells is not conducive to the energy storage of QBs. Our investigations offer insight into the properties of QBs with Heisenberg spin chain models with DM interaction and facilitate us to acquire the performance in the framework of realistic quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>Constrained Measurement Incompatibility from Generalised Contextuality of Steered Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a bipartite Bell scenario involving two local measurements per party and two outcome per measurement, the measurement incompatibility in one wing is both necessary and sufficient to reveal the nonlocality. However, such a one-to-one correspondence fails when one of the observers performs more than two measurements. In such a scenario, the measurement incompatibility is necessary but not sufficient to reveal the nonlocality. In this work, within the formalism of general probabilistic theory (GPT), we demonstrate that unlike the nonlocality, the incompatibility of N arbitrary measurements in one wing is both necessary and sufficient for revealing the generalised contextuality for the sub-system in the other wing. Further, we formulate a novel form of inequality for any GPT that are necessary for N-wise compatibility of N arbitrary observables. Moreover, we argue that any theory that violates the proposed inequality possess a degree of incompatibility that can be quantified through the amount of violation. Finally, we claim that it is the generalised contextuality that provides a restriction to the allowed degree of measurement incompatibility of any viable theory of nature and thereby super-select the the quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient coupling of single photons using a pair of nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically report highly efficient coupling of single photons from a single dipole source (SDS) using a pair of nanostructures. The maximum coupling efficiency ({\eta}p) of 56%, into guided modes of a silica nanotip (SNT), is found when the SNT of radius 0.43 {\mu}m is placed in the vicinity of a diamond nanotip (DNT) and a diamond nanowire (DNW). Additionally, we found that varying the radius of the DNT/DNW does not significantly affect the {\eta}p-value. Furthermore, we investigate the coupling efficiency ({\eta}) of single photons from the SDS into guided modes of the DNT. The maximum {\eta}-value of 87% is found when the radially oriented SDS is positioned on the facet of the DNT of radius 0.4 {\mu}m. We found that the {\eta}p-value is enhanced when the DNT is placed in the vicinity of another DNT and the DNW. The present platform may open new possibilities in quantum networks.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{PT}$ Symmetric Non-Hermitian Cavity Magnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design and explore PT-symmetric behavior of a hybrid non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanics consisting of a ferromagnetic YIG sphere driven by external magnetic field. Non-Hermicity is engineered by using a traveling field directly interacting with YIG. The external magnetic field excites collective mechanical modes of magnons, which later excites cavity mode leading to a coupling between cavity magnons and photons. The magnomechanical interaction of the system also excites phonon and couple them to the system. By computing eigenvalue spectrum, we demonstrate the occurrence of three-order exceptional point emerge with the increase of magnon-photon coupling at a specific incidence angle of traveling field. We illustrate the unique bi-broken and uni-protected PT-symmetry regions in eigenvalue spectrum unlike previously investigated non-Hermitian system, which can be tuned with gain and loss configuration by manipulating ratio between traveling field strength and magnon-photon coupling. Interestingly, protected PT-symmetry only exists on the axis of exceptional point. We further show that the PT-symmetry can only be govern at two angle of incident of traveling field. However, later, by performing stability analysis, we illustrate that the system is only stable at $\pi/2$ and, on all other angles, either the system is non-PT-symmetric or it is unstable. Furthermore, we govern the parametric stability conditions for the system and, by defining stablity parameter, illustrate the stable and unstable parametric regimes. Our finding not only discusses a new type of PT-symmetric system, but also could act as foundation to bring cavity magnomechanics to the subject of quantum information and process.</description>

      <title>Circuit Complexity of Sparse Quantum State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation is a fundamental and significant subroutine in quantum computing. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation on the circuit size for sparse quantum state preparation. A quantum state is said to be $d$-sparse if it has only $d$ non-zero amplitudes. For the task of preparing $n$-qubit $d$-sparse quantum states, we obtain the following results:
  (a) We propose the first approach that uses $o(dn)$ elementary gates without using ancillary qubits. Specifically, it is proven that any $n$-qubit $d$-sparse quantum state can be prepared by a quantum circuit of size $O(\frac{dn}{\log n} + n)$ without using ancillary qubits. This is asymptotically optimal when $d = poly(n)$, and this optimality extends to a broader scope under some reasonable assumptions.
  (b) We show that any $n$-qubit $d$-sparse quantum state can be prepared by a quantum circuit of size $O(\frac{dn}{\log d})$ and depth $\Theta(\log dn)$ using at most $O(\frac{n{d}}{\log d} )$ ancillary qubits, which not only reduces the circuit size compared to the one without ancillary qubits when $d = \omega(poly(n))$, but also achieves the same asymptotically optimal depth while utilizing fewer ancillary qubits and applying fewer quantum gates compared to the result given in [PRL, 129, 230504(2022)]. (ii) We establish the lower bound $\Omega(\frac{dn}{\log(n + m) + \log d} + n)$ on the circuit size with $m$ ancillary qubits available. we also obtain a slightly stronger lower bound under reasonable assumptions.
  (c) We prove that with arbitrary amount of ancillary qubits available, the circuit size for preparing $n$-qubit $d$-sparse quantum states is $\Theta({\frac{dn}{\log dn} + n})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies to solve nuclear structure problems using quantum computers rely on a quantum algorithm known as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). In this study, we calculate the correlation energy in Helium-6 using VQE, with a \textit{full-term} unitary-paired-coupled-cluster-doubles (UpCCD) ansatz on a quantum computer simulator and implement a set of custom termination criteria to shorten the optimization time. Using this setup, we test out noisy quantum computer simulators of various coherence times and quantum errors to find the required specification for such calculations. We also look into the contribution of errors from the quantum computers and optimization process. We find that the minimal specification of 5~ms coherence times and $10^{-4}$ quantum errors is required to reliably reproduce state-vector results within 8\% discrepancy. Our study indicates the possibility of performing VQE calculations using a full-term UpCCD ansatz on a slightly noisy quantum computer, without implementing quantum error correction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of a charged particle moving on a flat surface is studied through the constants of motion associated to the system, given the magnetic gauge. The usual Landau' solution and the non separable solution for the Landau's gauge are found, and new non separable solution for the symmetric gauge is given. As a consequence of this, the quantization of the magnetic flux results from the invariance of the solutions under the unitary transformations which arise from the operators constants of motion.</description>

      <title>Refined Tsirelson Bounds on Multipartite Bell Inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their importance, there is an on-going challenge characterizing multipartite quantum correlations. The Svetlichny and Mermin-Klyshko (MK) inequalities present constraints on correlations in multipartite systems, a violation of which allows to classify the correlations by using the non-separability property. In this work we present refined Tsirelson (quantum) bounds on these inequalities, derived from inequalities stemming from a fundamental constraint, tightly akin to quantum uncertainty. Unlike the original, known inequalities, our bounds do not consist of a single constant point but rather depend on correlations in specific subsystems (being local correlations for our bounds on the Svetlichny operators and bipartite correlations for our bounds on the MK operators). We analyze concrete examples in which our bounds are strictly tighter than the known bounds.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Quantum Homomorphic Encryption Through Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE), allows a quantum cloud server to compute on private data as uploaded by a client. We provide a proof-of-concept software simulation for QHE, according to the "EPR" scheme of Broadbent and Jeffery, for universal quantum circuits. We demonstrate the near-term viability of this scheme and provide verification that the additional cost of homomorphic circuit evaluation is minor when compared to the simulation cost of the quantum operations. Our simulation toolkit is an open-source Python implementation, that serves as a step towards further hardware applications of quantum homomorphic encryption between networked quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Validity condition for high-fidelity Digitized Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digitizing an adiabatic evolution is a strategy able to combine the good performance of gate-based quantum processors with the advantages of adiabatic algorithms, providing then a hybrid model for efficient quantum information processing. In this work we develop validity conditions for high fidelity digital adiabatic tasks. To this end, we assume a digitizing process based on the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition, which allows us to introduce a $Digitized$ $Adiabatic$ $Theorem$. As consequence of this theorem, we show that the performance of such a hybrid model is limited by the fundamental constraints on the adiabatic theorem validity, even in ideal quantum processors. We argue how our approach predicts the existence of intrinsic non-adiabatic errors reported by R. Barends $et$ $al$., Nature 534, 222 (2016) through an empirical study of digital annealing. In addition, our approach allows us to explain the existence of a scaling of the number of Suzuki-Trotter blocks for the optimal digital circuit with respect to the optimal adiabatic total evolution time, as reported by G. B. Mbeng $et$ $al$, Phys. Rev. B 100, 224201 (2019) through robust numerical analysis of digital annealing. We illustrate our results through two examples of digitized adiabatic algorithms, namely, the two-qubits exact-cover problem and the three-qubits adiabatic factorization of the number 21.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of neutral atoms constitute an important quantum system for fundamental research and precision metrology. Many applications require short preparation times of BECs, for example, for optimized data acquisition rates in scientific applications, and reduced dead times and improved bandwidths for atomic quantum sensors. Here, we report on the generation of rubidium BECs with a repetition rate of more than 2 Hz. The system relies on forced evaporation in a dynamically adjusted optical potential, which is created by the spatial modulation of laser beams. Our system provides a versatile source of the ubiquitous rubidium BECs, and promotes their exploitation for high-precision atom interferometers.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a Squeezed Light Source on Thin-Film Lithium Niobate with Modal Phase Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezed states are essential for continuous variable (CV) quantum information processing, with wide-ranging applications in computing, sensing and communications. Integrated photonic circuits provide a scalable, convenient platform for building large CV circuits. Thin-film Lithium Niobate (TFLN) is particularly promising due to its low propagation loss, efficient parametric down conversion, and fast electro-optical modulation.
  In this work, we demonstrate a squeezed light source on an integrated TFLN platform, achieving a measured shot noise reduction of 0.46 dB using modal phase matching and grating couplers with an efficiency of up to -2.2 dB.
  The achieved squeezing is comparable to what has been observed using more complex circuitry based on periodic poling.
  The simpler design allows for compact, efficient and reproducible sources of squeezed light.</description>

      <title>Analyzing performance of $f$-deformed displaced Fock state in continuous-variable quantum teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performing non-Gaussian operations, namely photon addition, photon subtraction, photon-addition-then-subtraction, photon-subtraction-then-addition can successfully enhance the fidelity of the continuous-variable quantum teleportation. However, a shortcoming of these non-Gaussian resources is that they are probabilistic in nature. In this article, we investigate the success probability of the non-Gaussian resources for optimal performance of the ideal teleportation protocol. To this end, we first derive the analytical expression for the two-mode entangled channel having $f$-deformed displaced Fock state or photon-added displaced Fock state or photon-subtracted displaced Fock state at one port and vacuum at another port of a symmetric beam-splitter. The generalized displaced Fock states are obtained by replacing the conventional bosonic functions by the nonlinear $f$-deformed operators such as $A=af(a^\dag a)$ and $B=af(a^\dag a)^{-1}$. The Wigner characteristic functions describing these three aforementioned non-Gaussian states are determined and utilized to attain the teleportation fidelity for input coherent and squeezed vacuum states. It is found that the nonlinear substitution leads to an enhancement in teleportation fidelity beyond the threshold limit. Moreover, the entangled photon-subtracted displaced Fock state demonstrates maximum efficiency as a quantum channel for teleporting single-mode coherent and squeezed states. We provide the squeezing regime values corresponding to the optimal performance of the non-Gaussian states considered, which will be of significant interest to the experimental fraternity. Further, we show that the entangled photon-added displaced Fock states have larger amount of entanglement but the entangled photon-subtracted displaced Fock states have stronger Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fabricating patterned nanostructures with matter waves can help to realise new nanophotonic devices. However, due to dispersion effects, designing patterns with nanoscale features is challenging. Here, we consider the propagation of a helium matter wave through different holes in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a case study for the weakest dispersion interaction and the matter wave's diffraction as it passes through the holes. We use a quantum-mechanical model to calculate the polarisability of edge atoms around the holes, where we observe polarization ripples of enhanced and reduced polarisabilities around the holes. We use these values to calculate van der Waals dispersion coefficients for the scattered helium atoms. We find that the resulting diffraction patterns are affected by the shape and size of the holes, where the smallest holes have a radius of just $6$~\AA. These results can be used to predict the resolution limits of nano-hole patterns on nanophotonic materials.</description>

      <title>Multi-qubit state visualizations to support problem solving $-$ a pilot study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field of quantum information science and technology, a big obstacle is the necessity of understanding high-level mathematics to solve complex problems. Visualizations like the (dimensional) circle notation enable us to visualize not only single-qubit but also complex multi-qubit states, entanglement, and quantum algorithms. Current findings in educational research suggest that incorporating visualizations in settings of problem solving can have beneficial effects on students' performance and cognitive load compared to solely relying on symbolic problem solving content. In this pilot study, we aim to take a first step to identify in which contexts students benefit from the presentation of visualizations of multi-qubit systems in addition to mathematical formalism. We compare students' performance, time taken, and cognitive load when solving problems using the mathematical-symbolic Dirac notation alone with using it accompanied by the circle notation or the dimensional circle notation in single- and multi-qubit systems. Although little overall differences in students' performance can be detected depending on the presented representations, we observe that problem-solving performance is student- and context-dependent. In addition, the results indicate reduced cognitive load when participants are presented with visualization. The results are discussed with respect to relevant design aspects for future studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theory of the absorption of a laser field by an atomic or condensed matter medium is presented for the case where the medium is also interacting with a strong electromagnetic field. The rotating wave approximation is not assumed for the latter. It is shown that in the weak probe limit the Lindblad master equation reduces to a smaller system of linear equations for the relevant steady state coherences. In this limit, the complex susceptibility of the medium can be expressed in terms of individual contributions of decaying dressed states, the latter being eigenstates of a non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom suggests that within a fixed preparation-measurement setup, a qubit system offers no advantage over a bit. This indeed holds true when considering the standard communication and the famous Holevo bound then formalizes the statement that one qubit can encode at most one bit of information. However, there exist subtle differences between these two physical systems that, when properly exploited, can be converted into practical applications. We begin by discussing the similarities between qudits and dits as information carriers. Then we recall a general framework for communication tasks and review some differences that qudits and dits have. In the end, we present a simple communication application that utilizes the quantum character of the qubit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an infinite-range interacting quantum spin-1/2 model, undergoing periodic kicking and dissipatively coupled with an environment. In the thermodynamic limit, it is described by classical mean-field equations that can show regular and chaotic regimes. At finite size, we describe the system dynamics using stochastic quantum trajectories. We find that the asymptotic nonstabilizerness (alias the magic, a measure of quantum complexity), averaged over trajectories, mirrors the classical chaotic behavior, while the entanglement entropy has no relation with chaos in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Generation of Quantum Frequency Combs across Distinct Modal Families in a Single $Si_3 N_4$ Whispering Gallery Mode Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum frequency combs (QFCs) are versatile resources for multi-mode entanglement, such as cluster states, crucial for quantum communication and computation. On-chip whispering gallery mode resonators (WGMRs) can generate these states at ultra-low threshold power. In this paper, we demonstrate the simultaneous generation of three QFCs using a single on-chip $Si_3N_4$ WGMR across distinct modal families. We designed a micro-ring resonator with a radius of 240 $\mu m$, capable of supporting four modal families within the 130 to 260 $THz$ frequency range for consistency regulation. Our results indicate that, by carefully designing the structure of $Si_3 N_4$ WGMRs, it is possible to generate quantum entangled frequency combs across distinct modal families simultaneously using monochromatic pump light. This is achieved by modulating the pump mode profiles with a spatial light modulator (SLM). Our approach offers a simple and low-cost method to achieve higher-density entanglement integration on-chip.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate potential scattering and tunneling dynamics of a particle wavepacket evolving according to the relativistic Schr\"odinger equation (also known as the Salpeter equation). The tunneling properties of the Salpeter equation differ from those of the standard relativistic wave equations (such as the Klein-Gordon or Dirac equations). In particular, the tunneling solutions must be found by working in momentum space, given that the equation in configuration space contains a pseudo-differential operator. The resulting integral equations are derived and solved numerically for wavepackets scattering on model potential barriers. The solutions are characterized by the absence of Klein tunneling and an effect of the potential on the fraction of the transmitted wavepacket that propagates outside the light cone, a feature that has in the past been well-studied only for free propagation.</description>

      <title>OQuPy: A Python package to efficiently simulate non-Markovian open quantum systems with process tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Markovian dynamics arising from the strong coupling of a system to a structured environment is essential in many applications of quantum mechanics and emerging technologies. Deriving an accurate description of general quantum dynamics including memory effects is however a demanding task, prohibitive to standard analytical or direct numerical approaches. We present a major release of our open source software package, OQuPy (Open Quantum System in Python), which provides several recently developed numerical methods that address this challenging task. It utilizes the process tensor approach to open quantum systems in which a single map, the process tensor, captures all possible effects of an environment on the system. The representation of the process tensor in a tensor network form allows an exact yet highly efficient description of non-Markovian open quantum systems (NM-OQS). The OQuPy package provides methods to (1) compute the dynamics and multi-time correlations of quantum systems coupled to single and multiple environments, (2) optimize control protocols for NM-OQS, (3) simulate interacting chains of NM-OQS, and (4) compute the mean-field dynamics of an ensemble of NM-OQS coupled to a common central system. Our aim is to provide an easily accessible and extensible tool for researchers of open quantum systems in fields such as quantum chemistry, quantum sensing, and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Security of Partially Corrupted Repeater Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution allows two parties to establish a secret key that is secure against computationally unbounded adversaries. To extend the distance between parties, quantum networks, and in particular repeater chains, are vital. Typically, security in such scenarios assumes the absolute worst case: namely, an adversary has complete control over all repeaters and fiber links in a network and is able to replace them with perfect devices, thus allowing her to hide her attack within the expected natural noise. In a large-scale network, however, such a powerful attack may be infeasible. In this paper, we analyze the case where the adversary can only corrupt a contiguous subset of a repeater chain connecting Alice and Bob, while some portion of the network near Alice and Bob may be considered safe from attack (though still noisy). We derive a rigorous finite key proof of security assuming this attack model and show that improved performance and noise tolerances are possible.</description>

      <title>Faster Computation of Stabilizer Extent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization of nonstabilizerness is fruitful due to its application in gate synthesis and classical simulation. In particular, the resource monotone called the $\textit{stabilizer extent}$ is indispensable to estimate the simulation cost using the rank-based simulators, one of the state-of-the-art simulators of Clifford+$T$ circuits. In this work, we propose fast numerical algorithms to compute the stabilizer extent. Our algorithm utilizes the Column Generation method, which iteratively updates the subset of pure stabilizer states used for calculation. This subset is selected based on the overlaps between all stabilizer states and a target state. Upon updating the subset, we make use of a newly proposed subroutine for calculating the $\textit{stabilizer fidelity}$ that (i) achieves the linear time complexity with respect to the number of stabilizer states, (ii) super-exponentially reduces the space complexity by in-place calculation, and (iii) prunes unnecessary states for the computation. As a result, our algorithm can compute the stabilizer fidelity and the stabilizer extent for Haar random pure states up to $n=9$ qubits, which naively requires a memory of 305 EiB. We further show that our algorithm runs even faster when the target state vector is real. The optimization problem size is reduced so that we can compute the case of $n=10$ qubits in 4.7 hours.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Opto-Electro-Mechanical Entanglement through Three-Level Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the dynamical bipartite entanglement in an opto-electro-mechanical system that involves a three-level atom. The system consists of a degenerate three-level atom, a mechanical resonator, an optical cavity, and a microwave cavity. By utilizing the linearization approximation and nonlinear quantum-Langevin equations, the dynamics of the system are analyzed, and the bipartite entanglement is evaluated using the logarithmic negativity. The research findings indicate that the entanglement between each subsystem increases with the atom injection rate, suggesting that a higher atom injection rate leads to enhanced information transmission between the subsystems. Additionally, it is observed that the correlation between subsystems increases with an increase in the coupling rate. Moreover, the study demonstrates that the correlation between each subsystem decreases as temperature rises. The results highlight the positive impact of three-level atoms on the bipartite entanglement in an opto-electro-mechanical system. Consequently, such electro-optomechanical systems can offer a framework for optomechanical information transfer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon loss is the dominant noise mechanism in photonic quantum technologies. Designing fault-tolerant schemes with high tolerance to loss is thus a central challenge in scaling photonic quantum information processors. Concatenation of a fault-tolerant construction with a code able to efficiently correct loss is a promising approach to achieve this, but practical ways to implement code concatenation with photons have been lacking. We propose schemes for generating concatenated graph codes using multi-photon emission from two quantum emitters or a single quantum emitter coupled to a memory; capabilities available in several photonic platforms. We show that these schemes enable fault-tolerant fusion-based quantum computation in practical regimes with high photon loss and standard fusion gates without the need for auxiliary photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the preparation of a large quantum register of 5612 qubits, with the unprecedented high global fidelity of $F\simeq 0.9956$. This was achieved by applying an improved cooperative quantum information erasure (CQIE) protocol [Buffoni, L. and Campisi, M., Quantum 7, 961 (2023)] to a programmable network of superconducting qubits featuring a high connectivity. At variance with the standard method based on the individual reset of each qubit in parallel, here the quantum register is treated as a whole, thus avoiding the well-known orthogonality catastrophe wehereby even an extremely high individual reset fidelity $f$ results in vanishing global fidelities $F=f^N$ with growing number $N$ of qubits.</description>

      <title>Quantum resolution limit of long-baseline imaging using distributed entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that shared entanglement between two telescope sites can in principle be used to localize a point source by mimicking the standard phase-scanning interferometer, but without physically bringing the light from the distant telescopes together. In this paper, we show that a receiver that employs spatial-mode sorting at each telescope site, combined with pre-shared entanglement and local quantum operations can be used to mimic the most general multimode interferometer acting on light collected from the telescopes. As an example application to a quantitative passive-imaging problem, we show that the quantum-limited precision of estimating the angular separation between two stars can be attained by an instantiation of the aforesaid entanglement based receiver. We discuss how this entanglement assisted strategy can be used to achieve the quantum-limited precision of any complex quantitative imaging task involving any number of telescopes. We provide a blueprint of this general receiver that involves quantum transduction of starlight into quantum memory banks and spatial mode sorters deployed at each telescope site, and measurements that include optical detection as well as qubit gates and measurements on the quantum memories. We discuss the relative contributions of local mode sorting at telescope sites vis-a-vis distributed entanglement-assisted interferometry, to the overall quantum-limited information about the scene, based on the ratio of the baseline distance to the individual telescope diameter.</description>

      <title>Testing multipartite productness is easier than testing bipartite productness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a lower bound on the number of copies needed to test the property of a multipartite quantum state being product across some bipartition (i.e. not genuinely multipartite entangled), given the promise that the input state either has this property or is $\epsilon$-far in trace distance from any state with this property. We show that $\Omega(n / \log n)$ copies are required (for fixed $\epsilon \leq \frac{1}{2}$), complementing a previous result that $O(n / \epsilon^2)$ copies are sufficient. Our proof technique proceeds by considering uniformly random ensembles over such states, and showing that the trace distance between these ensembles becomes arbitrarily small for sufficiently large $n$ unless the number of copies is at least $\Omega (n / \log n)$. We discuss implications for testing graph states and computing the generalised geometric measure of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Can Quantum Computers Do Nothing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing platforms are subject to contradictory engineering requirements: qubits must be protected from mutual interactions when idling ('doing nothing'), and strongly interacting when in operation. If idling qubits are not sufficiently protected, information can 'leak' into neighbouring qubits, become non-locally distributed, and ultimately inaccessible. Candidate solutions to this dilemma include patterning-enhanced many-body localization, dynamical decoupling, and active error correction. However, no information-theoretic protocol exists to actually quantify this information loss due to internal dynamics in a similar way to e.g. SPAM errors or dephasing times. In this work, we develop a scalable, flexible, device non-specific protocol for quantifying this bitwise idle information loss based on the exploitation of tools from quantum information theory. We implement this protocol in over 3500 experiments carried out across 4 months (Dec 2023 - Mar 2024) on IBM's entire Falcon 5.11 series of processors. After accounting for other sources of error, and extrapolating results via a scaling analysis in shot count to zero shot noise, we detect idle information leakage to a high degree of statistical significance. This work thus provides a firm quantitative foundation from which the protection-operation dilemma can be investigated and ultimately resolved.</description>

      <title>Manipulating Spectral Windings and Skin Modes through Nonconservative Couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has revolutionized our understanding of wave propagation in non-Hermitian systems, highlighting unexpected localization effects beyond conventional theories. Here, we discover that NHSE, accompanied by multi-type spectral phases, can be induced by manipulating nonconservative couplings. By characterizing the spectrum through the windings of the energy bands, we demonstrate that band structures with identical, opposite, and even twisted windings can be achieved. These inequivalent types of spectra originate from the multi-channel interference resulting from the interplay between conservative and nonconservative couplings. Associated with the multi-type spectra, unipolar and bipolar NHSE with different eigenmode localizations can be observed. Additionally, our findings link the nonreciprocal transmission properties of the system to multiple spectral phases, indicating a connection with the skin modes. This work paves new pathways for investigating non-Hermitian topological effects and manipulating nonreciprocal energy flow.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims at studying the spin once again. The departure point is thus the Stern and Gerlach experimental results that can be described in a coherent way in the frame of quantum mechanics only. Instead, the relativistic mechanics point of view is proposed here following the work presented in a previous article about rigid body rotation. Indeed, a careful study of the horizon of this relativistic rigid body rotation appears to be invariant from any observation angle in full agreement with the spin property.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced photoprotection in neuroprotein architectures emerges from collective light-matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study here the collective quantum optical effect of superradiance in neuroprotein architectures. This phenomenon arises from the interaction of the electromagnetic field with an organized network of tryptophan chromophores, where each can be effectively modeled as a two-level quantum emitter. Building on our prior experimental confirmation of single-photon superradiance in microtubules, we predict that bright superradiant states will also emerge in simulated actin filament bundles and amyloid fibrils, which manifests in the form of high quantum yields that are robust to static disorder up to five times that of room temperature. For microtubules and amyloid fibrils, the quantum yield is enhanced with increasing system size, contrary to the conventional expectations of quantum effects in a thermally equilibrated environment. We conduct our analyses using a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian derived from the Lindblad equation for an open quantum system that describes the interaction of a chromophore network with the electromagnetic field, in the single-photon limit. Our detailed quantum yield predictions in realistic neuroprotein structures -- including analysis of the potential information-processing applications of correlated superradiant and subradiant states at divergent timescales -- provide motivation for a range of in vitro experiments to confirm these quantum enhancements, which can serve in vivo as a mechanism for dissipating or downconverting high-energy UV metabolic photon emissions in intensely oxidative pathological environments, including those found in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.</description>

      <title>Quantum Diamond Microscope for Narrowband Magnetic Imaging with High Spatial and Spectral Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum diamond microscope (QDM) is a recently developed technology for near-field imaging of magnetic fields with micron-scale spatial resolution. In the present work, we integrate a QDM with a narrowband measurement protocol and a lock-in camera; and demonstrate imaging of radiofrequency (RF) magnetic field patterns produced by microcoils, with spectral resolution $\approx1$\,Hz. This RF-QDM provides multi-frequency imaging with a central detection frequency that is easily tunable over the MHz-scale, allowing spatial discrimination of both crowded spectral peaks and spectrally well-separated signals. The present instrument has spatial resolution $\approx2\,\mathrm{\mu m}$, field-of-view $\approx300\times300\,\mathrm{\mu m^2}$, and per-pixel sensitivity to narrowband fields $\sim{1}\,$nT$\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$. Spatial noise can be reduced to the picotesla scale by signal averaging and/or spatial binning. The RF-QDM enables simultaneous imaging of the amplitude, frequency, and phase of narrowband magnetic field patterns at the micron-scale, with potential applications in real-space NMR imaging, AC susceptibility mapping, impedance tomography, analysis of electronic circuits, and spatial eddy-current-based inspection.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics in Curved Space(time) with a Noncommutative Geometric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have previously presented a version of the Weak Equivalence Principle for a quantum particle as an exact analog of the classical case, based on the Heisenberg picture analysis of free particle motion. Here, we take that to a full formalism of quantum mechanics in a generic curved space(time). Our basic perspective is to take seriously the noncommutative symplectic geometry corresponding to the quantum observable algebra. Particle position coordinate transformations and a nontrivial metric assigning an invariant inner product to vectors, and covectors, are implemented accordingly. That allows an analog to the classical picture of the phase space as the cotangent bundle. The mass-independent quantum geodesic equations as equations of free particle motion under a generic metric as a quantum observable are obtained from an invariant Hamiltonian. Hermiticity of momentum observables is to be taken as reference frame dependent. Our results have a big contrast to the alternative obtained based on the Schr\"odinger wavefunction representation. Hence, the work points to a very different approach to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of Histories: Chaotic Versus Integrable Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the emergence of decoherent histories in isolated systems based on exact numerical integration of the Schr\"odinger equation for a Heisenberg chain. We reveal that the nature of the system, which we switch from (i) chaotic to (ii) interacting integrable to (iii) non-interacting integrable, strongly impacts decoherence. From a finite size scaling law we infer a strong exponential suppression of coherences for (i), a weak exponential suppression for (ii) and no exponential suppression for (iii) on a relevant short (nonequilibrium) time scale. Moreover, for longer times we find stronger decoherence for (i) but the opposite for (ii), hinting even at a possible power-law decay for (ii) at equilibrium time scales. This behaviour is encoded in the multi-time properties of the quantum histories and it can not be explained by environmentally induced decoherence. Our results suggest that chaoticity plays a crucial role in the emergence of classicality in finite size systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of interacting fermions in the continuum. Our approach uses the concept of lattice-localized frames, which we introduce here. We first prove a Lieb-Robinson bound that is valid for a general class of local interactions, which implies the existence of the dynamics at the level of the CAR algebra. We then turn to the physical situation relevant to the (fractional) quantum Hall effect, namely the quasi-free second quantized Landau Hamiltonian to which electron-electron interactions can be added.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Low-Noise Optomechanical Crystal Photon-Phonon Transducers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optomechanical crystals (OMCs) enable coherent interactions between optical photons and microwave acoustic phonons, and represent a platform for implementing quantum transduction between microwave and optical signals. Optical absorption-induced thermal noise at cryogenic (millikelvin) temperatures is one of the primary limitations of performance for OMC-based quantum transducers. Here, we address this challenge with a two-dimensional silicon OMC resonator that is side-coupled to a mechanically detached optical waveguide, realizing a six-fold reduction in the heating rate of the acoustic resonator compared to prior state-of-the-art, while operating in a regime of high optomechanical-backaction and millikelvin base temperature. This reduced heating translates into a demonstrated phonon-to-photon conversion efficiency of 93.1 $\pm$ 0.8% at an added noise of 0.25 $\pm$ 0.01 quanta, representing a significant advance toward quantum-limited microwave-optical frequency conversion and optically-controlled quantum acoustic memories.</description>

      <title>A frame-bundle formulation of quantum reference frames: from superposition of perspectives to superposition of geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a possible fully geometric formulation of the core idea of quantum reference frames (QRFs) as it has been applied in the context of gravity, freeing its definition from unnecessary (though convenient) ingredients, such as coordinate systems. Our formulation is based on two main ideas. First, a QRF encodes uncertainty about what is the observer's (and, hence, the measuring apparatus's) perception of time and space at each spacetime point (i.e., event). For this, an observer at an event $p$ is modeled, as usual, as a tetrad in the tangent space $T_p$. So a QRF at an event $p$ is a complex function on the tetrads at $p$. Second, we use the result that one can specify a metric on a given manifold by stipulating that a basis one assigns at each tangent space is to be a tetrad in the metric one wants to specify. Hence a spacetime, i.e. manifold plus metric, together with a choice of "point of view" on it, is represented by a section of the bundle of bases, understood as taking the basis assigned to each point to be a tetrad. Thus a superposition of spacetimes gets represented as, roughly speaking, an assignment of complex amplitudes to sections of this bundle. A QRF, defined here as the collection of complex amplitudes assigned to bases at events--i.e., a complex function defined on the bundle of bases of the manifold--can describe, in a local way (i.e., attributing the amplitudes to bases at events instead of to whole sections), these superpositions.
  We believe that this formulation sheds some light on some conceptual aspects and possible extensions of current ideas about QRFs. For instance, thinking in geometric terms makes it clear that the idea of QRFs applied to the gravitational scenarios treated in the literature (beyond linear approximation) lacks predictive power due to arbitrariness which, we argue, can only be resolved by some further input from physics.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Mapping of Magnetic Auto-oscillations with a single Spin Sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic auto-oscillations are damping-compensated magnetization precessions. They can be generated in spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNO) among others. Current research on these devices is dedicated to create next generation energy-efficient hardware for communication technologies. However, the underlying physics governing the formation of auto-oscillation modes, their output power and line width in a single SHNO device have remained elusive so far. We image the sources of magnetic auto-oscillations in a metallic SHNO using a single spin quantum sensor. We directly measure the microwave field generated by an auto-oscillation spot at the nanoscale by driving the electron spin resonance transition of the sensor spin, enabling faster acquisition speed (100 ms/pixel). Instead of being defined by the points of the largest antidamping only, we experimentally demonstrate for the first time with quantitative magnetometry that the auto-oscillation spots are determined by the positions of the magnetic field minima. The latter act as local potential wells for confining spin-waves, thus supporting large amplitude auto-oscillations. By comparing the magnitude of the magnetic stray field at these spots, we decipher the different frequencies of the auto-oscillation modes. The insights gained regarding the interaction between auto-oscillation modes and spin-wave potential wells enable advanced engineering of real devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The periodic flashing potential has proven to be a powerful tool for investigating directed atomic currents. By applying the flashing ring-shaped potential to spin-orbit (SO) coupled, noninteracting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) systems, through photon-assisted tunneling (resonance) techniques, we demonstrate the generation of tunable alternating (AC) spin and atomic mass currents that can be precisely controlled in terms of direction and strength. The underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon is that the flashing potential supplies enough photons to induce Rabi oscillations and provides momentum transfer for spin and atomic transport. As the single-particle ground state of the unperturbed SO-coupled BEC depends on the Raman coupling strength, we demonstrate how to generate and control AC spin currents in the cases where the initial state resides in a single-well or double-well phase. In particular, we realize and explain the mechanism of generating a net AC spin current without mass current through single-photon resonance processes. It is shown that these interesting resonance phenomena can be analytically described only by the simple three-level model, which creates the possibility of transparent controls of spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Precision Gyroscope from the Spin of Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a gyroscope that measures rotation based on the effects of the rotation on the polarization of light. Rotation induces a differential phase shift in the propagation of left and right circularly polarized light and this phase shift can be measured in suitably designed interferometric setups. The signal in this setup is independent of the frequency of light, unlike various sources of noise such as vibrations, which cause phase shifts that depend on the frequency. Such vibrations are the practical limit on the sensitivity of conventional Sagnac-style optical interferometers that are typically used as gyroscopes. In the proposed setup, one can potentially mitigate this source of noise by simultaneously using two (or more) sources of light that have different frequencies. The signal in this setup scales with the total storage time of the light. Due to its frequency independence, it is thus most optimal to measure the signal using superconducting RF systems where the high finesse of the available cavities enables considerably longer storage times than is possible in an optical setup.</description>

Abstract: In quantum field theory, Hamiltonians contain particle creation and annihilation terms that are usually ultraviolet (UV) divergent. It is well known that these divergences can sometimes be removed by adding counter-terms and taking limits in which an UV cut-off tends to infinity. Here, I review a novel way of removing UV divergences: by imposing a kind of boundary condition on the wave function. These conditions, called interior-boundary conditions (IBCs), relate the values of the wave function at two configurations linked by the creation or annihilation of a particle. They allow for a direct definition of the Hamiltonian without renormalization or limiting procedures. In the last section, I review another boundary condition that serves for determining the probability distribution of detection times and places on a timelike 3-surface.</description>

      <title>Impact of Loss Mechanisms on Linear Spectra of Excitonic and Polaritonic Aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of loss mechanisms governed by empirical time-scales affect the dynamics and spectra of systems in profound ways. However, incorporation of these effects and their interaction with the thermal dissipative environments interacting with the system prove to be challenging. We have recently developed the path integral Lindblad dynamics (PILD) method to combine numerically rigorous path integral simulations with Lindblad dynamics to account for such empirical loss mechanisms. In this work, we utilize the PILD method to study the absorption and circular dichroism spectra of chiral molecular aggregates and excitonic polaritons. We demonstrate that the effect of loss on particular states in both systems can differ not just on the basis of the symmetries of the state but also on the basis of complicated "interactions" of the system and the loss mechanism with the dissipative environments. We present probably the first numerical exploration of the CD spectrum of chiral molecular aggregates confined in a cavity. While the CD spectrum of just the excitonic aggregates itself is not amenable to simplistic understanding like the exciton chirality (EC) rule, the CD spectrum of polaritonic molecules is even more complex. Additionally, the impact of empirical loss on the polaritonic CD spectrum seems to be highly site-dependent. The impact of a lossy cavity is qualitatively different from the impact of a molecule that leaks the excitation. We explore some of those effects in depth leveraging the framework of path integral Lindblad dynamics.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of non-Hermitian BCS superfluids in a dissipative asymmetric Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Fermi-Hubbard model with asymmetric hopping and complex-valued interactions, which should be realized by collective one-body loss and two-body loss. By means of the NH BCS theory, we find that the weak asymmetry of the hopping does not affect the BCS superfluidity since it only affects the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the BdG Hamiltonian. Systematic analysis in the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattices clarifies that the singularity in the density of states affects the phase boundary between the normal and dissipation-induced superfluid states. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by using the photoassociation techniques and a nonlocal Rabi coupling with local losses and postselecting null measurement outcomes utilized by quantum-gas microscopes.</description>

      <title>Phase driven exact and unconventional superradiance phase transition in non-Hermitian cascaded Rabi cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work reports the phase driven symmetry breaking and exact and unconventional superradiance phase transition in the non-Hermitian cascaded Rabi cavities. The non-Hermiticity is introduced in the coupling phase (denoted by $\varphi$) between the atom and the optical field. The exactness refers to the fact that the superradiance phase boundary is obtained analytically and verified by the observables. The unconventionality is reflected in that when $|\varphi|=\frac{\pi}{4}$ or $|\varphi|=\frac{3\pi}{4}$, the phase boundary is uniquely determined by $\mathcal{J}=\frac{1}{2}$ (where $\mathcal{J}$ is the dimensionless cavity coupling strength) and is independent of the atom-optical field coupling strength $g$. For other $\varphi$, the phase boundary is determined by $\mathcal{J}$ and the dimensionless atom-optical field coupling strength $g$ together. Besides, we find that there are phase driven first-order and second-order superradiance phase transitions, and the quantum criticality for the second-order superradiance phase transition is studied. In addition, the experimental feasibility is discussed. This work will stimulate the studies of non-Hermitian superradiance quantum phase transitions and their experimental realizations, as well as the underlying universality class of phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the universal signatures of quantum phase transitions that can be extracted with the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm applied to quantum chains with a gradient. We present high-quality data collapses for the order parameter and for the entanglement entropy for three minimal models: transverse-field Ising, 3-state Potts and Ashkin-Teller. Furthermore, we show that scan-DMRG successfully captures the universal critical scaling when applied across the magnetic Wess-Zumino-Witten and non-magnetic Ising transitions in the frustrated Haldane chain. In addition, we report a universal scaling of the lowest excitation energy as a function of a gradient rate. Finally, we argue that the scan-DMRG approach has significantly lower computational cost compare to the conventional DMRG protocols to study quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Great progress has been made in quantum computing in recent years, providing opportunities to overcome computation resource poverty in many scientific computations like computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In this work, efforts are made to exploit quantum potentialities in CFD, and a hybrid classical and quantum computing CFD framework is proposed to release the power of current quantum computing. In this framework, the traditional CFD solvers are coupled with quantum linear algebra libraries in weak form to achieve collaborative computation between classical and quantum computing. The quantum linear solver provides high-precision solutions and scalable problem sizes for linear systems and is designed to be easily callable for solving linear algebra systems similar to classical linear libraries, thus enabling seamless integration into existing CFD solvers. Some typical cases are performed to validate the feasibility of the proposed framework and the correctness of quantum linear algorithms in CFD.</description>

      <title>Can the noble metals (Au, Ag and Cu) be superconductors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is common knowledge that noble metals are excellent conductors but do not exhibit superconductivity. On the other hand, quantum confinement in thin films has been consistently shown to induce a significant enhancement of the superconducting critical temperature in several superconductors. It is therefore an important fundamental question whether ultra-thin film confinement may induce observable superconductivity in non-superconducting metals. We present a generalization, in the Eliashberg framework, of a BCS theory of superconductivity in good metals under thin-film confinement. By numerically solving these new Eliashberg-type equations, we find the dependence of the superconducting critical temperature on the film thickness $L$. This parameter-free theory predicts a maximum increase in the critical temperature for a specific value of the film thickness, which is a function of the number of free carriers in the material. Exploiting this fact, we predict that ultra-thin films of gold, silver and copper of suitable thickness could be superconductors at low but experimentally accessible temperatures. We demonstrate that this is a fine-tuning problem where the thickness must assume a very precise value, close to half a nanometer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest a somewhat non-standard view on a set of curious, paradoxical from the standpoint of simple classical physics and everyday experience phenomena. There are the quantisation (discrete set of values) of the observables (e.g., energy, momentum, angular momentum); forbidden simultaneous measurements of the observables in the most cases (e.g., of a coordinate and momentum, of angular momentum projections on difference axis); counter-intuitive relations on the simultaneously measurable quantities (e.g., the famous expression for the square momentum $l(l+1)$ with the maximal projection $l$). These and other paradoxes are traditionally related to "purely quantum" phenomenon, i.e., having no analogue in the "classical world" ones. However, there are deep analogies between classical and "quantum" worlds, as soon as the quantum technique is applied to the classical phenomenon. We follow these analogies with the examples of relatively simple and well known models of classical physics, such as a simplified model of light transition through the media, a system of electric charges close to each other and far from the observer; the specific of motion in the Coulomb/Newtonian field. This text can be considered as a mini-course addressed to higher school and undergraduate students who are interested in basics of quantum mechanics, but are not yet ready for systematic study of standard courses. The text may be also useful to those who supervise such students.</description>

      <title>Probing Yu-Shiba Rushinov state via quantum noise and $\Delta_T$ noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent attention has been drawn to temperature gradient generated $\Delta_T$ noise at vanishing charge current. This study delves into examining the properties of spin-polarised $\Delta T$ noise in conjunction with $\Delta_T$-shot noise, $\Delta_T$-thermal noise, and quantum noise (again both shot and thermal noise) in a one-dimensional (1D) structure comprising metal/spin-flipper/metal/insulator/superconductor junction to probe Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states. YSR bound states, which are localized states within the superconducting gap of a superconductor are induced by a magnetic impurity acting as a spin-flipper. A YSR bound state should be distinguished from a Majorana bound state (MBS), which too can occur due to interaction with magnetic impurities, e.g., magnetic adatoms on superconductors, and this can lead to false positives in detecting MBS. Clarifying this by providing a unique signature for the YSR-bound state is the main aim of this work. In this paper, we show that YSR bound states can be effectively probed using quantum noise and the recently discovered $\Delta_T$ noise, with a focus on especially spin transport. We see that the spin $\Delta_T$ noise is a superior tool compared to the charge $\Delta_T$ noise as a probe for YSR bound states. Additionally, our analysis of quantum noise reveals that similar to $\Delta_T$ noise, spin quantum noise is more effective than charge quantum noise in detecting YSR bound states.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, I first establish -- via methods other than the Gottesman-Knill theorem -- the existence of an infinite set of instances of simulating a quantum circuit to decide a decision problem that can be simulated classically. I then examine under what restrictions on quantum circuits the existence of infinitely many classically simulable instances persists. There turns out to be a vast number of such restrictions, and any combination of those found can be applied at the same time without eliminating the infinite set of classically simulable instances. Further analysis of the tools used in this then shows there exists a language that every (promise) BQP language is one-one reducible to. This language is also not P-bi-immune under very many promises.</description>

Abstract: Integrated photonics offers compact and stable manipulation of optical signals in miniaturized chips, with the possibility of changing dynamically their functionality by means of integrated phase shifters. Cryogenic operation of these devices is becoming essential for advancing photonic quantum technologies, accommodating components like quantum light sources, single photon detectors and quantum memories operating at liquid helium temperatures. In this work, we report on a programmable glass photonic integrated circuit (PIC) fabricated through femtosecond laser waveguide writing (FLW) and controlled by thermo-optic phase shifters both in a room-temperature and in a cryogenic setting. By taking advantage of a femtosecond laser microstructuring process, we achieved reliable PIC operation with minimal power consumption and confined temperature gradients in both conditions. This advancement marks the first cryogenically-compatible programmable FLW PIC, paving the way for fully integrated quantum architectures realized on a laser-written photonic chip.</description>

Abstract: Atom interferometers provide a powerful tool for measuring physical constants and testifying fundamental physics with unprecedented precision. Conventional atom interferometry focuses on the phase difference between two paths and utilizes matter waves with fixed coherence. Here, we report on realizing a Ramsey-Bord\'e interferometer of coherent matter waves dressed by a moving optical lattice in the gravity direction, and explore the resulting interference along multiple paths with tunable coherence. We investigate spatial correlations of atoms both within the lattice and between two arms by interferometry, and observe the emerging multiple interference peaks owing to the long-range coherence nature of the Bose-Einstein condensate. Our findings agree well with theoretical simulations, paving the way for high-precision interferometry with ultracold atoms.</description>

Abstract: We report some nonsmooth dynamics of a Bloch state in a one-dimensional tight binding model with the periodic boundary condition. After a sudden change of the potential of an arbitrary site, quantities like the survival probability of the particle in the initial Bloch state show cusps periodically, with the period being the Heisenberg time associated with the energy spectrum. This phenomenon is a \emph{nonperturbative} counterpart of the nonsmooth dynamics observed previously (Zhang and Haque, arXiv:1404.4280) in a periodically driven tight binding model. Underlying the cusps is an exactly solvable model, which consists of equally spaced levels extending from $-\infty$ to $+\infty $, between which two arbitrary levels are coupled to each other by the same strength.</description>

Abstract: The Quantum Reverse Shannon Theorem has been a milestone in quantum information theory. It states that asymptotically reliable simulation of a quantum channel, assisted by unlimited shared entanglement, requires a rate of classical communication equal to the channel's entanglement-assisted classical capacity. In this paper, we study the error exponent of quantum channel simulation, which characterizes the optimal speed of exponential convergence of the performance towards the perfect, as the blocklength increases. Based on channel purified distance, we derive lower and upper bounds for the error exponent. Then we show that the two bounds coincide when the classical communication rate is below a critical value, and hence, we have determined the exact formula of the error exponent in the low-rate case. This enables us to obtain an operational interpretation to the channel's sandwiched R\'enyi information of order from 1 to 2, since our formula is expressed as a transform of this quantity. In the derivation, we have also obtained an achievability bound for quantum channel simulation in the finite-blocklength setting, which is of realistic significance.</description>

Abstract: Quantum walks contribute significantly to developing quantum algorithms and quantum simulations. Here, we introduce a first of its kind one-dimensional quantum walk in the $d$-dimensional quantum domain, where $d&gt;2$, and show its equivalence for circuit realization in an arbitrary finite-dimensional quantum logic for utilizing the advantage of larger state space, which helps to reduce the run-time of the quantum walks as compared to the conventional binary quantum systems. We provide efficient quantum circuits for the implementation of discrete-time quantum walks (DTQW) in one-dimensional position space in any finite-dimensional quantum system when the dimension is odd using an appropriate logical mapping of the position space on which a walker evolves onto the multi-qudit states. With example circuits for various qudit state spaces, we also explore scalability in terms of $n$-qudit $d$-ary quantum systems. Further, the extension of one-dimensional DTQW to $d$-dimensional DTQW using $2d$-dimensional coin space on $d$-dimensional lattice has been studied, where $d&gt;=2$. Thereafter, the circuit design for the implementation of scalable $d$-dimensional DTQW in $d$-ary quantum systems has been portrayed. Lastly, we exhibit the circuit design for the implementation of DTQW using different coins on various search spaces.</description>

Abstract: Achieving quantum-enhanced performances when measuring unknown quantities requires developing suitable methodologies for practical scenarios, that include noise and the availability of a limited amount of resources. Here, we report on the optimization of sub-standard quantum limit Bayesian multiparameter estimation in a scenario where a subset of the parameters describes unavoidable noise processes in an experimental photonic sensor. We explore how the optimization of the estimation changes depending on which parameters are either of interest or are treated as nuisance ones. Our results show that optimizing the multiparameter approach in noisy apparata represents a significant tool to fully exploit the potential of practical sensors operating beyond the standard quantum limit for broad resources range.</description>

Abstract: We investigate what can be concluded about a quantum system when sequential quantum measurements of its observable -- a prominent example of the so-called quantum stochastic process -- fulfill the Kolmogorov consistency condition and thus appear to an observer as a sampling of a classical trajectory. We identify a set of physical conditions imposed on the system dynamics, that when satisfied, lead to the aforementioned trajectory interpretation of the measurement results. We then show that when another quantum system is coupled to the observable, the operator representing it can be replaced by external noise. Crucially, the realizations of this surrogate (classical) stochastic process follow the same trajectories as those measured by the observer. Therefore, it can be said that the trajectory interpretation suggested by the Kolmogorov consistent measurements also applies in contexts other than sequential measurements.</description>

      <title>Succinct quantum testers for closeness and $k$-wise uniformity of probability distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore potential quantum speedups for the fundamental problem of testing the properties of closeness and $k$-wise uniformity of probability distributions.
  \textit{Closeness testing} is the problem of distinguishing whether two $n$-dimensional distributions are identical or at least $\varepsilon$-far in $\ell^1$- or $\ell^2$-distance. We show that the quantum query complexities for $\ell^1$- and $\ell^2$-closeness testing are $O\rbra{\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon}$ and $O\rbra{1/\varepsilon}$, respectively, both of which achieve optimal dependence on $\varepsilon$, improving the prior best results of \hyperlink{cite.gilyen2019distributional}{Gily{\'e}n and Li~(2019)}.
  \textit{$k$-wise uniformity testing} is the problem of distinguishing whether a distribution over $\cbra{0, 1}^n$ is uniform when restricted to any $k$ coordinates or $\varepsilon$-far from any such distributions. We propose the first quantum algorithm for this problem with query complexity $O\rbra{\sqrt{n^k}/\varepsilon}$, achieving a quadratic speedup over the state-of-the-art classical algorithm with sample complexity $O\rbra{n^k/\varepsilon^2}$ by \hyperlink{cite.o2018closeness}{O'Donnell and Zhao (2018)}. Moreover, when $k = 2$ our quantum algorithm outperforms any classical one because of the classical lower bound $\Omega\rbra{n/\varepsilon^2}$.
  All our quantum algorithms are fairly simple and time-efficient, using only basic quantum subroutines such as amplitude estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17815v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When reformulated as a resource theory, thermodynamics can analyze system behaviors in the single-shot regime. In this, the work required to implement state transitions is bounded by {\alpha}-Renyi divergences and so differs in identifying efficient operations compared to stochastic thermodynamics. Thus, a detailed understanding of the difference between stochastic and resource-theoretic thermodynamics is needed. To this end, we explore reversibility in the single-shot regime, generalizing the two-level work reservoirs used there to multi-level work reservoirs. This achieves reversibility in any transition in the single-shot regime. Building on this, we systematically develop multi-level work reservoirs in the nondissipation regime with and without catalysts. The resource-theoretic results show that two-level work reservoirs undershoot Landauer's bound, misleadingly implying energy dissipation during computation. In contrast, we demonstrate that multilevel work reservoirs achieve Landauer's bound while producing arbitrarily low entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adrian Kent has recently presented a critique [arXiv:2307.06191] of our paper [Nat. Comms. 10, 1361 (2019)] in which he claims to refute our main result: the measurement postulates of quantum mechanics can be derived from the rest of postulates, once we assume that the set of mixed states of a finite-dimensional Hilbert space is finite-dimensional. To construct his argument, Kent considers theories resulting from supplementing quantum mechanics with hypothetical "post-quantum" measurement devices. We prove that each of these theories contains pure states (i.e. states of maximal knowledge) which are not rays of the Hilbert space, in contradiction with the "pure state postulate" of quantum mechanics. We also prove that these alternatives violate the finite-dimensionality of mixed states. Each of these two facts separately invalidates the refutation. In this note we also clarify the assumptions used in [Nat. Comms. 10, 1361 (2019)] and discuss the notions of pure state, physical system, and the sensitivity of the structure of the state space under modifications of the measurements or the dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Raman scattering of photons into phonons gives rise to entangled photon pairs when the phonon emitted in a Stokes process is coherently absorbed in antiStokes scattering, forming the photonic analog of Cooper pairs. We present a nonperturbative theory for the time evolution of photonic Cooper pairs that treats interacting photons and phonons as a hybrid excitation, the Ramaniton. As the Ramaniton propagates in a wave guide it displays quantum oscillations between photon and phonon occupation, leading to resonant squeezed Stokes-antiStokes light when the phonon occupation becomes equal to zero without recurring back to the photon vacuum. This phenomenon is predicted to generate up to 28 dB of squeezed light even in standard silicon on insulator waveguides.</description>

      <title>Multiple quantum Mpemba effect: exceptional points and oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the role of exceptional points and complex eigenvalues on the occurrence of the quantum Mpemba effect. To this end, we study a two-level driven dissipative system subjected to an oscillatory electric field and dissipative coupling with the environment. We find that both exceptional points and complex eigenvalues can lead to $multiple$ quantum Mpemba effect. It occurs in an observable when time evolved copies corresponding to two different initial conditions, one initially having higher observable value compared to the other and both relaxing towards the same steady state, intersect each other more than once during their relaxation process. Each of the intersections denotes a quantum Mpemba effect and marks the reversal of identities between the two copies i.e. the copy with higher observable value before the intersection becomes the lower valued copy (and vice versa) after the intersection. Such multiple intersections originate from additional algebraic time dependence at the exceptional points and due to oscillatory relaxation in the case of complex eigenvalues. We provide analytical results for quantum Mpemba effect in the density matrix in presence of coherence. Depending on the control parameters (drive and dissipation), observables such as energy, von Neumann entropy, temperature etc. exhibit either single or multiple quantum Mpemba effect. However, the distance from steady state measured in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence shows only single quantum Mpemba effect although the corresponding speed gives rise to either single or multiple quantum Mpemba effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Postselected quantum metrological scheme is especially advantageous when the final measurements are either very noisy or expensive in practical experiments. In this work, we put forward a general theory on the compression channels in postselected quantum metrology. We define the basic notions characterizing the compression quality and illuminate the underlying structure of lossless compression channels. Previous experiments on Postselected optical phase estimation and weak-value amplification are shown to be particular cases of this general theory. Furthermore, for two categories of bipartite systems, we show that the compression loss can be made arbitrarily small even when the compression channel acts only on one subsystem. These findings can be employed to distribute quantum measurements so that the measurement noise and cost are dramatically reduced.</description>

Abstract: By analyzing the characteristics of hardware-native Ising Models and their performance on current and next generation quantum annealers, we provide a framework for determining the prospect of advantage utilizing adiabatic evolution compared to classical heuristics like simulated annealing. We conduct Ising Model experiments with coefficients drawn from a variety of different distributions and provide a range for the necessary moments of the distributions that lead to frustration in classical heuristics. By identifying the relationships between the linear and quadratic terms of the models, analysis can be done a priori to determine problem instance suitability on annealers. We then extend these experiments to a prototype of D-Wave's next generation device, showing further performance improvements compared to the current Advantage annealers.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Dynamic Quantum Control: Differential Sensitivity Bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic control via optimized, piecewise-constant pulses is a common paradigm for open-loop control to implement quantum gates. While numerous methods exist for the synthesis of such controls, there are many open questions regarding the robustness of the resulting control schemes in the presence of model uncertainty; unlike in classical control, there are generally no analytical guarantees on the control performance with respect to inexact modeling of the system. In this paper a new robustness measure based on the differential sensitivity of the gate fidelity error to parametric (structured) uncertainties is introduced, and bounds on the differential sensitivity to parametric uncertainties are used to establish performance guarantees for optimal controllers for a variety of quantum gate types, system sizes, and control implementations. Specifically, it is shown how a maximum allowable perturbation over a set of Hamiltonian uncertainties that guarantees a given fidelity error, can be reliably computed. This measure of robustness is inversely proportional to the upper bound on the differential sensitivity of the fidelity error evaluated under nominal operating conditions. Finally, the results show that the nominal fidelity error and differential sensitivity upper bound are positively correlated across a wide range of problems and control implementations, suggesting that in the high-fidelity control regime, rather than there being a trade-off between fidelity and robustness, higher nominal gate fidelities are positively correlated with increased robustness of the controls in the presence of parametric uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Scalability of Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation of Unitary Matrices for Ground State Preparation through Adaptive Finer Filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is a domain where quantum computers have the potential to outperform their classical counterparts due to their inherent quantum behavior. One of the main challenges of such quantum algorithms is up-scaling the system size, which is necessary to achieve meaningful quantum advantage. In this work, we present an approach to improve the scalability of eigenspace filtering for the ground state preparation of a given Hamiltonian. Our method aims to tackle limitations introduced by a small spectral gap and high degeneracy of low energy states. It is based on an adaptive sequence of eigenspace filtering through Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation of Unitary Matrices (QETU) followed by spectrum profiling. By combining our proposed algorithm with state-of-the-art phase estimation methods, we achieved good approximations for the ground state energy with local, two-qubit gate depolarizing probability up to $10^{-4}$. To demonstrate the key results in this work, we ran simulations with the transverse-field Ising Model on classical computers using Qiskit. We compare the performance of our approach with the static implementation of QETU and show that we can consistently achieve three to four orders of magnitude improvement in the absolute error rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of an entangled electron pair emerging from a system composed of two quantum dots attached to a superconductor Cooper pair beam splitter. We take into account three processes: Crossed Andreev Reflection, cotuneling, and Coulomb interaction. Together, these processes play crucial roles in the formation of entangled electronic states, with electrons being in spatially separated quantum dots. By using perturbation theory, we derive an analytical effective model that allows a simple picture of the intricate process behind the formation of the entangled state. Several entanglement quantifiers, including quantum mutual information, negativity, and concurrence, are employed to validate our findings. Finally, we define and calculate the covariance associated with the detection of two electrons, each originating from one of the quantum dots with a specific spin value. The time evolution of this observable follows the dynamics of all entanglement quantifiers, thus suggesting that it can be a useful tool for mapping the creation of entangled electrons in future applications within quantum information protocols.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Robinson correlation function for the quantum transverse field Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lieb-Robinson correlation function is the norm of a commutator between local operators acting on separate subsystems at different times. This provides a useful state-independent measure for characterizing the specifically quantum interaction between spatially separated qubits. The finite propagation velocity for this correlator defines a "light-cone" of quantum influence. We calculate the Lieb-Robinson correlation function for one-dimensional qubit arrays described by the transverse field Ising model. Direct calculations of this correlation function have been limited by the exponential increase in the size of the state space with the number of qubits. We introduce a new technique that avoids this barrier by transforming the calculation to a sum over Pauli walks which results in linear scaling with system size. We can then explore propagation in arrays of hundreds of qubits and observe the effects of the quantum phase transition in the system. We observe the emergence of two distinct velocities of propagation: a correlation front velocity, which is affected by the phase transition, and the Lieb-Robinson velocity which is not. The correlation front velocity is equal to the maximum group velocity of single quasiparticle excitations. The Lieb-Robinson velocity describes the extreme leading edge of correlations when the value of the correlation function itself is still very small. For the semi-infinite chain of qubits at the quantum critical point, we derive an analytical result for the correlation function.</description>

Abstract: Combining quantum and Bayesian principles leads to optimality in metrology, but the optimisation equations involved are often hard to solve. This work mitigates this problem with a novel class of measurement strategies for quantities isomorphic to location parameters, which are shown to admit a closed-form optimisation. The resulting framework admits any parameter range, prior information, or state, and the associated estimators apply to finite samples. As an example, the metrology of relative weights is formulated from first principles and shown to require hyperbolic errors. The primary advantage of this approach lies in its simplifying power: it reduces the search for good strategies to identifying which symmetry leaves a state of maximum ignorance invariant. This will facilitate the application of quantum metrology to fundamental physics, where symmetries play a key role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing have led to the development of hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNNs) that employ a mixed set of quantum layers and classical layers, such as Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuNNs). While several works have shown security threats of classical neural networks, such as adversarial attacks, their impact on QuNNs is still relatively unexplored. This work tackles this problem by designing AdvQuNN, a specialized methodology to investigate the robustness of HQNNs like QuNNs against adversarial attacks. It employs different types of Ansatzes as parametrized quantum circuits and different types of adversarial attacks. This study aims to rigorously assess the influence of quantum circuit architecture on the resilience of QuNN models, which opens up new pathways for enhancing the robustness of QuNNs and advancing the field of quantum cybersecurity. Our results show that, compared to classical convolutional networks, QuNNs achieve up to 60\% higher robustness for the MNIST and 40\% for FMNIST datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we propose an approach for implementing time-evolution of a quantum system using product formulas. The quantum algorithms we develop have provably better scaling (in terms of gate complexity and circuit depth) than a naive application of well-known Trotter formulas, for systems where the evolution is determined by a Hamiltonian with different energy scales (i.e., one part is "large" and another part is "small"). Our algorithms generate a decomposition of the evolution operator into a product of simple unitaries that are directly implementable on a quantum computer. Although the theoretical scaling is suboptimal compared with state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., quantum signal processing), the performance of the algorithms we propose is highly competitive in practice. We illustrate this via extensive numerical simulations for several models. For instance, in the strong-field regime of the 1D transverse-field Ising model, our algorithms achieve an improvement of one order of magnitude in both the system size and evolution time that can be simulated with a fixed budget of 1000 arbitrary 2-qubit gates, compared with standard Trotter formulas.</description>

Abstract: Characterizing the minimal communication needed for the quantum channel simulation is a fundamental task in the quantum information theory. In this paper, we show that, in fidelity, the quantum channel simulation can be directly achieved via quantum state splitting without using a technique known as the de~Finetti reduction, and thus provide a pair of tighter one-shot bounds. Using the bounds, we also recover the quantum reverse Shannon theorem in a much simpler way.</description>

Abstract: The work is devoted to superoperator master equations. Namely, the superoperator master equations in the case of the twirling hyperprojector with respect to the whole unitary group are derived. To be consistent with such a hyperprojector the free dynamics is assumed to be depolarizing. And it is perturbed by the arbitrary Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad generator. The explicit form of the second order master equations are presented in this case.</description>

      <title>On the applicability of Kolmogorov's theory of probability to the description of quantum phenomena. Part I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a common view that von Neumann laid the foundations of a "quantum probability theory" with his axiomatization of quantum mechanics (QM). As such, it is regarded a generalization of the "classical probability theory" due to Kolmogorov. Outside of quantum physics, however, Kolmogorov's axioms enjoy universal applicability. This raises the question of whether quantum physics indeed requires such a generalization of our conception of probability or if von Neumann's axiomatization of QM was contingent on the absence of a general theory of probability in the 1920s.
  In this work I argue in favor of the latter position. In particular, I show that for non-relativistic $N$-body quantum systems subject to a time-independent scalar potential, it is possible to construct a mathematically rigorous theory based on Kolmogorov's axioms and physically natural random variables, which reproduces central predictions of QM. The respective theories are distinct, so that an empirical comparison may be possible. Moreover, the approach can in principle be adapted to other classes of quantum-mechanical models.
  Part II of this series will address the projection postulate and the question of measurement in this approach.</description>

Abstract: The spectral collocation method (SCM) exhibits a clear superiority in solving ordinary and partial differential equations compared to conventional techniques, such as finite difference and finite element methods. This makes SCM a powerful tool for addressing the Schr\"odinger-like equations with boundary conditions in physics. However, the Chebyshev differential matrix (CDM), commonly used in SCM to replace the differential operator, is not Hermitian but pseudo-Hermitian. This non-Hermiticity subtly affects the pseudospectra and leads to a loss of completeness in the eigenstates. Consequently, several issues arise with these eigenstates. In this paper, we revisit the non-Hermitian Liouville quantum mechanics by emphasizing the pseudo-Hermiticity of the CDM and explore its expanded models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spectral instability can be influenced by the compactification parameter.</description>

Abstract: The Wannier-Stark localization dynamically alters the entanglement behavior of non-Hermitian free fermions. Utilizing the single-particle correlation matrix technique, we analyze the effective Hamiltonian of these fermions with a Wannier-Stark ladder. Under open boundary conditions, we observe the steady state half-chain entanglement entropy and identify two distinct area law regions and an algebraic scaling region. Finite-size scaling analysis reveals critical scaling behavior of the half-chain entanglement entropy. Notably, the system demonstrates unique entanglement characteristics under periodic boundary conditions, which diverge from the (1+1)D conformal field theory predictions for Anderson localization. Our findings highlight novel entanglement phases emerging from the interplay between the non-Hermitian skin effect and disorder-free localization.</description>

      <title>A complete scheme for atom-mediated deterministic photonic graph state generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Highly-entangled multi-photon graph states are a crucial resource in photonic quantum computation and communication. Yet, the lack of photon-photon interactions makes the construction of such graph states especially challenging. Typically, these states are produced through probabilistic single-photon sources and linear-optics entangling operations that require indistinguishable photons. The resulting inefficiency of these methods necessitates a large overhead in the number of sources and operations, creating a major bottleneck in the photonic approach. Here, we show how harnessing single-atom-based photonic operations can enable deterministic generation of photonic graph states, while also lifting the requirement for photon indistinguishability. To this end, we introduce a multi-gate quantum node comprised of a single atom in a W-type level scheme coupled to an optical resonator. This configuration provides a versatile toolbox for generating graph states, allowing the operation of two fundamental photon-atom gates, as well as the deterministic generation of single photons. We investigate the implementation of this setup with a $^{87}$Rb atom and evaluate its performance through numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: High-dimensional encodings based on temporal modes (TMs) of photonic quantum states provide the foundations for a highly versatile and efficient quantum information science (QIS) framework. Here, we demonstrate a crucial building block for any QIS applications based on TMs: a programmable source of maximally entangled high-dimensional TM states. Our source is based on a parametric down-conversion process driven by a spectrally shaped pump pulse, which facilitates the generation of maximally entangled TM states with a well-defined dimensionality that can be chosen programmatically. We characterize the effective dimensionality of the generated states via measurements of second-order correlation functions and joint spectral intensities, demonstrating the generation of bi-photon TM states with a controlled dimensionality in up to 20 dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Hyperfine energy levels in trapped ions offer long-lived spin states. In addition, the motion of these charged particles couples strongly to external electric field perturbations. These characteristics make trapped ions attractive platforms for the quantum sensing of electric fields. However, the spin states do not exhibit a strong intrinsic coupling to electric fields. This limits the achievable sensitivities. Here, we amplify the coupling between electric field perturbations and the spin states by using a static magnetic field gradient. Displacements of the trapped ion resulting from the forces experienced by an applied external electric field perturbation are thereby mapped to an instantaneous change in the energy level splitting of the internal spin states. This gradient mediated coupling of the electric field to the spin enables the use of a range of well-established magnetometry protocols for electrometry. Using our quantum sensor, we demonstrate AC sensitivities of $\mathrm{S^{AC}_{min}=960(10)\times 10^{-6}~V m^{-1}Hz^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$ at a signal frequency of $\omega_{\epsilon}/2\pi=5.82~\mathrm{Hz}$, and DC sensitivities of $\mathrm{S^{DC}_{min}=1.97(3)\times 10^{-3} ~V m^{-1}Hz^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$ with a Hahn-echo type sensing sequence. We also employ a rotating frame relaxometry technique, with which our quantum sensor can be utilised as an electric field noise spectrum analyser. We measure electric field signals down to a noise floor of $\mathrm{S_{E}(\omega)=6.2(5)\times 10^{-12}~V^2 m^{-2}Hz^{-1}}$ at a frequency of $\mathrm{30.0(3)~kHz}$. We therefore demonstrate unprecedented electric field sensitivities for the measurement of both DC signals and AC signals across a frequency range of sub-Hz to $\sim\mathrm{500~kHz}$. Finally, we describe a set of hardware modifications that are capable of achieving a further improvement in sensitivity by up to six orders of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: Thermodynamics as a fundamental branch of physics examines the relationships between heat, work, and energy. The maximum energy extraction can be characterized by using the passive states that has no extracted energy under any cyclic unitary process. In this paper, we focus on the concept of marginal passive state energy and derive polygon inequalities for multi-qubit entangled pure states. We show that the marginal passive state energies collectively form a convex polytope for each class of quantum states that are equivalent under SLOCC. We finally introduce multipartite passive state energy criteria to classify multipartite entanglement under SLOCC. The present result provides a thermodynamic method to witness multipartite entanglement.</description>

      <title>Quantum Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robot Navigation Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.12180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We utilize hybrid quantum deep reinforcement learning to learn navigation tasks for a simple, wheeled robot in simulated environments of increasing complexity. For this, we train parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) with two different encoding strategies in a hybrid quantum-classical setup as well as a classical neural network baseline with the double deep Q network (DDQN) reinforcement learning algorithm. Quantum deep reinforcement learning (QDRL) has previously been studied in several relatively simple benchmark environments, mainly from the OpenAI gym suite. However, scaling behavior and applicability of QDRL to more demanding tasks closer to real-world problems e. g., from the robotics domain, have not been studied previously. Here, we show that quantum circuits in hybrid quantum-classic reinforcement learning setups are capable of learning optimal policies in multiple robotic navigation scenarios with notably fewer trainable parameters compared to a classical baseline. Across a large number of experimental configurations, we find that the employed quantum circuits outperform the classical neural network baselines when equating for the number of trainable parameters. Yet, the classical neural network consistently showed better results concerning training times and stability, with at least one order of magnitude of trainable parameters more than the best-performing quantum circuits. However, validating the robustness of the learning methods in a large and dynamic environment, we find that the classical baseline produces more stable and better performing policies overall.</description>

Abstract: We define and analyze the fermionic entanglement entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole horizon for the regularized vacuum state of an observer at infinity. Using separation of variables and an integral representation of the Dirac propagator, the entanglement entropy is computed to be a prefactor times the number of occupied angular momentum modes on the event horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06510v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum thermal average plays a central role in describing the thermodynamic properties of a quantum system. Path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) is a prevailing approach for computing quantum thermal averages by approximating the quantum partition function as a classical isomorphism on an augmented space, enabling efficient classical sampling, but the theoretical knowledge of the ergodicity of the sampling is lacking. Parallel to the standard PIMD with $N$ ring polymer beads, we also study the Matsubara mode PIMD, where the ring polymer is replaced by a continuous loop composed of $N$ Matsubara modes. Utilizing the generalized $\Gamma$ calculus, we prove that both the Matsubara mode PIMD and the standard PIMD have uniform-in-$N$ ergodicity, i.e., the convergence rate towards the invariant distribution does not depend on the number of modes or beads $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11197v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics induced by a local perturbation in fracton field theory. For the ${\mathbb Z}_4$ and ${\mathbb Z}_8$-symmetric free fractonic theories, we compute the time dynamics of several observables such as the two-point Green function, $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ condensate, energy density, and the dipole momentum. The time-dependent considerations highlight that the free fractonic theory breaks causality and exhibits instantaneous signal propagation, even if an additional relativistic term is included to enforce a speed limit in the system. We show that it is related to the fact that the Lieb-Robinson bound does not hold in the continuum limit of the fracton field theory, and the effective bounded speed of light does not emerge. For the theory in finite volume, we show that the fracton wave front acquires fractal shape with non-trivial Hausdorff dimension, and argue that this phenomenon cannot be explained by a simple self-interference effect.</description>

Abstract: We study statistical properties of matrix elements of observables written in the energy eigenbasis and truncated to small microcanonical windows. We present numerical evidence indicating that for all few body operators in chaotic many-body systems, truncated below certain energy scale, collective statistical properties of matrix elements exhibit emergent unitary symmetry. Namely, we show that below certain scale the spectra of the truncated operators exhibit universal behavior, matching our analytic predictions, which are numerically testable for system sizes beyond exact diagonalization. We discuss operator and system-size dependence of the energy scale of emergent unitary symmetry and put our findings in context of previous works exploring emergence of random-matrix behavior at small energy scales.</description>

Abstract: The identification, description, and classification of topological features is an engine of discovery and innovation in several fields of physics. This research encompasses a broad variety of systems, from the integer and fractional Chern insulators in condensed matter, to protected states in complex photonic lattices in optics, and the structure of the QCD vacuum. Here, we introduce another playground for topology: the dissipative dynamics of pseudo-Hermitian many-body quantum systems. For that purpose, we study two different systems, the dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, and a quantum chaotic dephasing spin chain. For the two different many-body models, we find the same topological features for a wide range of parameters suggesting that they are universal. In the SYK model, we identify four universality classes, related to pseudo-Hermiticity, characterized by a rectangular block representation of the vectorized Liouvillian that is directly related to the existence of an anomalous trace of the unitary operator implementing fermionic exchange. As a consequence of this rectangularization, we identify a topological index $\nu$ that only depends on symmetry. Another distinct consequence of the rectangularization is the observation, for any coupling to the bath, of purely real topological modes in the Liouvillian. The level statistics of these real modes agree with that of the corresponding random matrix ensemble and therefore can be employed to characterize the four topological symmetry classes. In the limit of weak coupling to the bath, topological modes govern the approach to equilibrium, which may enable a direct path for experimental confirmation of topology in dissipative many-body quantum chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Belief Propagation Decoding of Quantum LDPC Codes with Guided Decimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes have emerged as a promising technique for quantum error correction. A variety of decoders have been proposed for QLDPC codes and many of them utilize belief propagation (BP) decoding in some fashion. However, the use of BP decoding for degenerate QLDPC codes is known to have issues with convergence. These issues are typically attributed to short cycles in the Tanner graph and code degeneracy (i.e. multiple error patterns with the same syndrome). Although various methods have been proposed to mitigate the non-convergence issue, such as BP with ordered statistics decoding (BP-OSD) and BP with stabilizer inactivation (BP-SI), achieving better performance with lower complexity remains an active area of research.
  In this work, we propose a decoder for QLDPC codes based on BP guided decimation (BPGD), which has been previously studied for constraint satisfaction and lossy compression problems. The decimation process is applicable to both binary and quaternary BP and it involves sequentially fixing the value of the most reliable qubits to encourage BP convergence. Despite its simplicity, We find that BPGD significantly reduces the BP failure rate due to non-convergence, achieving performance on par with BP with ordered statistics decoding and BP with stabilizer inactivation, without the need to solve systems of linear equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulators of lattice gauge theories involve dynamics of typically short-ranged interacting particles and dynamical fields. Elimination of the latter via Gauss law leads to infinite range interactions as exemplified by the Schwinger model in a staggered formalism. This motivates the study of long-range interactions, not necessarily diminishing with the distance. Here we consider localization properties of a spin chain with interaction strength growing linearly along the chain as for the Schwinger model. We generalize the problem to models with different interaction ranges. Using exact diagonalization we find the participation ratio of all eigenstates, which allows us to quantify the localization volume in Hilbert space. Surprisingly, the localization volume changes nonmonotonically with the interaction range. Our study is relevant for quantum simulators of lattice gauge theories implemented in state-of-the-art cold atom/ion devices, and it could help to reveal hidden features in disorder-free confinement phenomena in long-range interacting systems.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the entanglement asymmetry emerged as an informative tool to understand dynamical symmetry restoration in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems after a quantum quench. For integrable systems the asymmetry can be understood in the space-time scaling limit via the quasiparticle picture, as it was pointed out in Ref. [1]. However, a quasiparticle picture for quantum quenches from generic initial states was still lacking. Here we conjecture a full-fledged quasiparticle picture for the charged moments of the reduced density matrix, which are the main ingredients to construct the asymmetry. Our formula works for quenches producing entangled multiplets of an arbitrary number of excitations. We benchmark our results in the $XX$ spin chain. First, by using an elementary approach based on the multidimensional stationary phase approximation we provide an $\textit{ab initio}$ rigorous derivation of the dynamics of the charged moments for the quench treated in [2]. Then, we show that the same results can be straightforwardly obtained within our quasiparticle picture. As a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain a general criterion ensuring a vanishing entanglement asymmetry at long times. Next, by using the Lindblad master equation, we study the effect of gain and loss dissipation on the entanglement asymmetry. Specifically, we investigate the fate of the so-called quantum Mpemba effect (QME) in the presence of dissipation. We show that dissipation can induce QME even if unitary dynamics does not show it, and we provide a quasiparticle-based interpretation of the condition for the QME.</description>

      <title>Unscrambling of single-particle wave functions in systems localized through disorder and monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In systems undergoing localization-delocalization quantum phase transitions due to disorder or monitoring, there is a crucial need for robust methods capable of distinguishing phases and uncovering their intrinsic properties. In this work, we develop a process of finding a Slater determinant representation of free-fermion wave functions that accurately characterizes localized particles, a procedure we dub "unscrambling". The central idea is to minimize the overlap between envelopes of single-particle wave functions or, equivalently, to maximize the inverse participation ratio of each orbital. This numerically efficient methodology can differentiate between distinct types of wave functions: exponentially localized, power-law localized, and conformal critical, also revealing the underlying physics of these states. The method is readily extendable to systems in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we apply this approach to a more challenging problem involving disordered monitored free fermions in one dimension, where the unscrambling process unveils the presence of a conformal critical phase and a localized area-law quantum Zeno phase. Importantly, our method can also be extended to free fermion systems without particle number conservation, which we demonstrate by estimating the phase diagram of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric disordered monitored free fermions. Our results unlock the potential of utilizing single-particle wave functions to gain valuable insights into the localization transition properties in systems such as monitored free fermions and disordered models.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional Fermi polaron after a kick: two-sided singularity of the momentum distribution, Bragg reflection and other exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02099</link>

Abstract: A mobile impurity particle immersed in a quantum fluid forms a polaron - a quasiparticle consisting of the impurity and a local disturbance of the fluid around it. We ask what happens to a one-dimensional polaron after a kick, i.e. an abrupt application of a force that instantly delivers a finite impulse to the impurity. In the framework of an integrable model describing an impurity in a one-dimensional gas of fermions or hard-core bosons, we calculate the distribution of the polaron momentum established when the post-kick relaxation is over. A remarkable feature of this distribution is a two-sided power-law singularity. It emerges due to one of two processes. In the first process, the whole impulse is transferred to the polaron, without creating phonon-like excitations of the fluid. In the second process, the impulse is shared between the polaron and the center-of-mass motion of the fluid, again without creating any fluid excitations. The latter process is, in fact, a Bragg reflection at the edge of the emergent Brillouin zone. We carefully analyze the conditions for each of the two processes. The asymptotic form of the distribution in the vicinity of the singularity is derived.</description>

      <title>Interacting quasiperiodic spin chains in the prethermal regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in the study of many-body localization (MBL) in strongly disordered interacting spin chains has emphasized the importance of distinguishing finite time prethermal behavior from long time and large volume asymptotics. We re-examine a reported non-ergodic extended (NEE) regime in the interacting quasiperiodic Ganeshan-Pixley-Das Sarma model from this perspective, and propose that this regime is a prethermal feature. Indeed, we argue that the NEE regime may be identified through a change in the functional form of spin-spin autocorrelation functions, demonstrating that the NEE regime is distinguishable within intermediate-time dynamics. This is in contrast with existing conjectures relating the NEE regime to the presence of an asymptotic mobility edge in the single-particle spectrum. Thus, we propose a mechanism for the formation of an NEE regime which does not rely on asymptotic properties of the spin chain. Namely, we propose that the NEE regime emerges due to regularly spaced deep wells in the disorder potential. The highly detuned sites suppress spin transport across the system, effectively cutting the chain, and producing a separation of time scales between the spreading of different operators. To support this proposal, we show that the NEE phenomenology also occurs in random models with deep wells but with no mobility edges, and does not occur in quasiperiodic models with mobility edges but with no deep wells. Our results support the broad conclusion that there is not a sharp distinction between the dynamics of quasiperiodically and randomly disordered systems in the prethermal regime. More specifically, we find that generic interacting quasiperiodic models do not have stable intermediate dynamical phases arising from their single-particle mobility edges, and that NEE phenomenology in such models is transient.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of electron spin qubit during transfer between two semiconductor quantum dots at low magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron shuttling is one of the currently pursued avenues towards the scalability of semiconductor quantum dot-based spin qubits. We theoretically analyze the dephasing of a spin qubit adiabatically transferred between two tunnel-coupled quantum dots. We focus on the regime where the Zeeman splitting is lower than the tunnel coupling, at which interdot tunneling with spin flip is absent, and analyze the sources of errors in spin-coherent electron transfer for Si- and GaAs-based quantum dots. Apart from the obvious effect of fluctuations in spin splitting in each dot (e.g., due to nuclear Overhauser fields) leading to finite $ T_{2}^{*} $ of the stationary spin qubit, we consider effects activated by detuning sweeps aimed at adiabatic qubit transfer between the dots: failure of charge transfer caused by charge noise and phonons, spin relaxation due to enhancement of spin-orbit mixing of levels, and spin dephasing caused by low- and high-frequency noise coupling to the electron's charge in the presence of differences in Zeeman splittings between the two dots. Our results indicate that achieving coherent transfer of electron spin in a $10\,\mu$m long dot array necessitates a large and uniform tunnel coupling, with a typical value of $ 2t_c \gtrsim 60 \, \mu$eV.</description>

      <title>Unraveling hydrodynamization using ultracold 1D gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum evolution of 1D Bose gases immediately after several variants of high-energy quenches, both experimentally and theoretically. Using the advantages conveyed by the relative simplicity of these nearly integrable many-body systems, we are able to differentiate the behavior of two distinct but often temporally overlapping processes, hydrodynamization and local prethermalization. There is a universal character to our findings, which can be applied to the short-time behavior of any interacting many-body quantum system after a sudden high-energy quench. We specifically discuss its potential relevance to heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Observation of full contrast icosahedral Bose-Einstein statistics in laser desorbed, buffer gas cooled C$_{60}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum mechanical nature of spherical top molecules is particularly evident at low angular momentum quantum number J. Using infrared spectroscopy on the 8.4$\mu$m rovibrational band of buffer gas cooled $^{12}$C$_{60}$, we observe the hitherto unseen R(J = 0 - 29) rotational progression, including the complete disappearance of certain transitions due to the molecule's perfect icosahedral symmetry and identical bosonic nuclei. The observation of extremely weak C$_{60}$ absorption is facilitated by a laser desorption C$_{60}$ vapor source, which transfers 1000-fold less heat to the cryogenic buffer gas cell than a traditional oven source. This technique paves the way to cooling C$_{60}$ and other large gas phase molecules to much lower temperatures, providing continued advances for spectral resolution and sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Application of Haldane's statistical correlation theory in classical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates the application of Haldane's statistical correlation theory in classical systems. A modified statistical correlation theory has been proposed by including non-linearity in the form of an exponent into the original theory of Haldane. The dependence of the statistical correlation on indistinguishability is highlighted. Using this modified theory, a quasi-classical derivation of intermediate statistics is shown where indistinguishability can be introduced into distinguishable systems in the form of a statistical correlation. The final result is equivalent to the classical fractional exclusion statistics (CFES), which was derived earlier using a purely classical route. An extended non-linear correlation model based on power series expansion is also proposed, which can produce various intermediate statistical models.</description>
