      <title>Stochastic diffusion using mean-field limits to approximate master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic diffusion is the noisy and uncertain process through which dynamics like epidemics, or agents like animal species, disperse over a larger area. Understanding these processes is becoming increasingly important as we attempt to better prepare for potential pandemics and as species ranges shift in response to climate change. Unfortunately, modeling of stochastic diffusion is mostly done through inaccurate deterministic tools that fail to capture the random nature of dispersal or else through expensive computational simulations. In particular, standard tools fail to fully capture the heterogeneity of the area over which this diffusion occurs. Rural areas with low population density require different epidemic models than urban areas; likewise, the edges of a species range require us to explicitly track low integer numbers of individuals rather than vague averages. In this work, we introduce a series of new tools called "mean-FLAME" models that track stochastic dispersion using approximate master equations that explicitly follow the probability distribution of an area of interest over all of its possible states, up to states that are active enough to be approximated using a mean-field model. In one limit, this approach is locally exact if we explicitly track enough states, and in the other limit collapses back to traditional deterministic models if we track no state explicitly. Applying this approach, we show how deterministic tools fail to capture the uncertainty around the speed of nonlinear dynamical processes. This is especially true for marginal areas that are close to unsuitable for diffusion, like the edge of a species range or epidemics in small populations. Capturing the uncertainty in such areas is key to producing accurate forecasts and guiding potential interventions.</description>

      <title>Analysing pandemics in phase-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the SIRD-model a new model including time-delay is proposed for a description of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 pandemic. All data were analysed by representing all quantities as a function of the susceptible population, as opposed to the usual dependence on time. The total number of deaths could be predicted for the first, second and third wave of the pandemic in Germany with an accuracy of about 10\%, shortly after the maximum of infectious people was reached. By using the presentation in phase space, it could be shown that a classical SEIRD- and SIRD-model with constant parameters will not be able to describe the first wave of the pandemic accurately.</description>

      <title>Integrated population model reveals human and environment driven changes in Baltic ringed seal (Pusa hispida botnica) demography and behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated population models (IPMs) are a promising approach to test ecological theories and assess wildlife populations in dynamic and uncertain conditions. By combining multiple data sources into a single, unified model, they enable the parametrization of versatile, mechanistic models that can predict population dynamics in novel circumstances. Here, we present a Bayesian IPM for the ringed seal (Pusa hispida botnica) population inhabiting the Bothnian Bay in the Baltic Sea. Despite the availability of long-term monitoring data, traditional assessment methods have faltered due to dynamic environmental conditions, varying reproductive rates, and the recently re-introduced hunting, thus limiting the quality of information available to managers. We fit our model to census and various demographic, reproductive and harvest data from 1988 to 2023 to provide a comprehensive assessment of past population trends, and predict population response to alternative hunting scenarios. We estimated that 20,000 to 36,000 ringed seals inhabit the Bothnian Bay, and the population is increasing 3% to 6% per year. Reproductive rates have increased since 1988, leading to a substantial increase in the growth rate up until 2015. However, the re-introduction of hunting has since reduced the growth rate, and even minor quota increases are likely to reduce it further. Our results also support the hypothesis that a greater proportion of seals haul-out under lower ice cover circumstances, leading to higher aerial survey counts in such years. In general, our study demonstrates the value of IPMs for monitoring natural populations under changing environments, and supporting science-based management decisions.</description>

      <title>On the Evolution of Virulence in Vector-borne Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence or adaptation of pathogens may lead to epidemics or even pandemics, highlighting the need for a thorough understanding of pathogen evolution. The tradeoff hypothesis suggests that virulence evolves to reach an optimal transmission intensity relative to the mortality caused by the disease. This study introduces a mathematical model that incorporates key factors such as recovery times and mortality rates, focusing on the diminishing effects of parasite growth on transmission, with a focus on vector-borne diseases. The analysis reveals conditions under which heightened virulence occurs in hosts, indicating that these factors can support vector-host transmission of a pathogen, even if the host-only component is insufficient for sustainable transmission. This insight helps explain the increased presence of pathogens with high fatality rates, especially in vector-borne diseases. The findings emphasize an elevated risk in major pandemics involving vector-host diseases. Enhanced surveillance of mortality rates and techniques to monitor pathogen evolution are vital to effectively control future epidemics. This study provides essential insights for pandemic preparedness and highlights the need for ongoing research into pathogen evolution.</description>

      <title>Incorporating changeable attitudes toward vaccination into an SIR infectious disease model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mechanistic model that classifies individuals both in terms of epidemiological status (SIR) and vaccination attitude (willing or unwilling), with the goal of discovering how disease spread is influenced by changing opinions about vaccination. Analysis of the model identifies existence and stability criteria for both disease-free and endemic disease equilibria. The analytical results, supported by numerical simulations, show that attitude changes induced by disease prevalence can destabilize endemic disease equilibria, resulting in limit cycles.</description>
