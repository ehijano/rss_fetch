      <title>Probing Purely Inelastic Scalar Dark Matter Across Colliders and Gravitational Wave Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study a purely inelastic scalar dark matter model, where two real scalars-dark matter $\phi_1$ and its excited partner $\phi_2$ interact with the Standard Model via a Higgs portal. After mass diagonalization, only inelastic couplings remain, allowing the model to evade stringent bounds from direct detection. We show that thermal (co-)annihilation between $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ naturally yields the observed dark matter relic abundance. The same interaction structure can induce a strongly first-order phase transition in the early universe, generating detectable gravitational waves in upcoming experiments. Meanwhile, the slight mass splitting between $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$, along with the heavy off-shell mediator SM Higgs, leads to long-lived particle signatures of $\phi_2$ at the HL-LHC via the displaced muon-jets technique. We pinpoint a feasible parameter space where the correct relic abundance, observable gravitational waves, and collider signals can all be achieved concurrently, presenting a valuable chance to validate this scenario through a comprehensive examination encompassing cosmological, astrophysical, and collider investigations.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Starobinsky Inflation in No-Scale SU(5) and SO(10) GUTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original Starobinsky $R + R^2$ model of inflation is consistent with Planck and other measurements of the CMB, but recent results from the ACT and SPT Collaborations hint that the tilt of scalar perturbations may be in tension with the prediction of the Starobinsky model. No-scale models of inflation can reproduce the predictions of the Starobinsky model, but also provide a framework for incorporating deformations that could accommodate more easily the ACT and SPT data. We discuss this possibility in the contexts of SU(5) GUTs, taking into account the constraints on these models imposed by the longevity of the proton, the cold dark matter density and the measured value of the Higgs boson. We find that SU(5) with a CMSSM-like pattern of soft supersymmetry breaking has difficulty in accommodating all the constraints, whereas SU(5) with pure gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking can accommodate them easily. We also consider two SO(10) symmetry-breaking patterns that can accommodate the ACT and SPT data. In both the SU(5) and SO(10) models, the deformations avoid issues associated with large initial field values in the Starobinsky model: in particular, the total number of e-folds is largely independent of the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Harnessing data-driven methods for precise model independent event shape estimation in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the application of supervised machine learning (ML) techniques to distinguish between isotropic and jet-like event topologies in heavy-ion collisions via the spherocity observable. State-of-the-art ML algorithms, optimized through systematic hyperparameter tuning, are employed to predict both traditional transverse spherocity $S_{0}$ and unweighted transverse spherocity $S_{0}^{p_{\rm T}=1}$ directly from raw event data. Moreover, the results from this study demonstrated that our approach remains largely model-independent, underscoring its potential applicability in future experimental heavy-ion physics analyses.</description>

      <title>Complementarity between gravitational wave signatures and Higgs precision measurements of a classically conformal hidden U(1) extended Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a classically conformal extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a hidden $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, where the $U(1)$ symmetry is radiatively broken via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. This radiative breaking then induces electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking through a negative mixed quartic coupling between the hidden sector Higgs field and the SM Higgs doublet. Due to the mixed quartic coupling, the original two Higgs fields mix with a small angle $\theta$ to form two mass eigenstates, $h_1$ (SM-like Higgs) and $h_2$ (SM singlet-like Higgs). Setting their masses as $M_{h_1} &gt; 2 M_{h_2}$ to allow the decay process, $h_1 \to h_2 h_2$, we find a remarkable prediction of the conformal Higgs potential: the corresponding decay width is strongly suppressed in contrast to the one in the conventional Higgs potential. This anomalous behavior provides a striking experimental signature testable at the International Linear Collider (ILC) and other future high-energy lepton colliders. In this work, we investigate further experimental signatures of the model which are complementary to the Higgs physics at the colliders. First, we study the hidden $U(1)$ gauge boson as a cold dark matter (DM) candidate. While we find parameter regions consistent with both the observed relic abundance and collider sensitivities, these regions are excluded by current direct DM detection limits. Second, we consider a strong first-order phase transition associated with hidden $U(1)$ breaking in the early universe and compute the resulting gravitational wave (GW) spectrum. We find that for parameter regions complementary to Higgs precision measurements at the ILC, the predicted GW signals lie well above the projected sensitivities of future GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Froggatt-Nielsen like mechanism in the framework of Modular Symmetry for Neutrino Mass, Mixing and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a neutrino mass model with Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) like modular symmetry. The FN mechanism requires an additional gauge symmetry, $U(1)_{FN}$, which is spontaneously broken at high energies. But in this work, we do not need an extra symmetry as modular weights play the role of the FN charges of the additional $U(1)_{FN}$ symmetry. We have constructed a neutrino mass model using FN-like modular symmetry in the $T'$ group. This model can accommodate neutrino oscillation parameters and also address other phenomena beyond the Standard Model, such as neutrinoless double beta decay and the baryon asymmetry of the universe.</description>

      <title>Inert dark matter in three Higgs doublet model: a blind spot narrative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenology of three Higgs doublet scenario, where the scalar potential is augmented by $\mathbb{Z}_{3} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry making one doublet inert. Thus in effect, our model of interest is two Higgs plus inert Higgs doublet model charged under $\mathbb{Z}_3$ ((2+I)HDM-$\mathbb{Z}_3$) symmetry. We observe a blind spot feature for dark matter direct detection, as the tree-level dark matter-nucleon scattering cross-section vanishes depending on the mass splitting of dark sector particles. We perform a detailed analysis based on vacuum stability, unitarity, relic abundance, and direct detection results on the model. We also perform profile likelihood analysis and constrain the corresponding parameter space.</description>

      <title>Weak decays of singly heavy baryons: the $1/2\to3/2$ case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to investigating the $1/2\to3/2$ weak decays of singly heavy baryons. Due to the orthogonality between the spin wavefunctions of antitriplet baryons and spin-3/2 baryons, the weak decay amplitude for such processes vanishes at the leading order of QCD. Consequently, this study exclusively examines the weak decays of $\Omega_{Q}$. Using the light-front approach under the three-quark picture, we first extract the relevant form factors, and then apply them to investigate corresponding semileptonic and nonleptonic decays. Finally, we compare our phenomenological predictions with existing results in the literature. Our findings are expected to be helpful in experimentally establishing these decay channels.</description>

      <title>Entropy, purity and gluon cascades at high energies with recombinations and transitions to vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study one dimensional dipole cascade models in the high-energy limit of QCD. Motivated by data on hadron multiplicities in the LHCb kinematical range, we generalize existing cascade models for splitting and recombination to account also for transitions to the vacuum. This modification allows us to describe the data. Furthermore, we perform both analytical and numerical studies of the cascades and find that the cascade including loop corrections, as well as the one accounting for transitions to the vacuum, can both be related to the Negative Binomial Distribution. In the latter case, however, one must properly normalize the cascade to account for transitions to the vacuum. We also study the scaling properties of the cascades and identify new regimes, which we call "focal" and "parallel." Finally, we investigate the Quantum Information (QI) measures of the cascades, which allow us to highlight their distinctive properties.</description>

      <title>Explaining Data Anomalies over the NMSSM Parameter Space with Deep Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent results from particle physics analyses, we investigate the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) as a framework capable of accommodating a range of current data anomalies across low- and high-energy experiments. These include the so-called 95GeV and 650GeV excesses from Higgs studies, the Electro-Weakino excess from Supersymmetry searches, the latest $(g-2)_\mu$ measurements as well as potential deviations from Standard Model (SM) predictions that would appear as a consequence in mono-$H$ (where $H=h_{\rm SM}$) and -$Z$ signatures of Dark Matter. Our analysis demonstrates that viable NMSSM parameter regions exist where all these features can be accommodated at the $2\sigma$ level while remaining consistent with the most up-to-date theoretical and experimental constraints. To identify such regions, we employ an efficient numerical scanning strategy assisted by deep learning techniques. We further present several benchmark points that realize these scenarios, offering promising directions for future phenomenological studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the current status of the phenomenon of Color Transparency (CT), a fundamental consequence of the description of hadrons from Quantum Chromo Dynamics. CT refers to the vanishing of final (and/or initial) state interactions with the nuclear medium for exclusive process at sufficiently high enough momentum transfers. We discuss the current experimental observations relating to CT and their theoretical implications for other high energy processes. Future CT experiments and facilities are also described.</description>

      <title>Weakly Supervised Anomaly Detection in Events with a Higgs Boson and Exotic Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning-based anomaly detection strategy designed to identify anomalous physics in events containing resonant Standard Model physics and demonstrate this method on the final state of a Higgs boson decaying to two photons. The demonstration targets high-dimensional deviations in the region of phase space containing the Higgs mass peak in a fully signal-agnostic manner. A latent-space embedding, learned from event kinematics, enables the use of a large set of potentially sensitive features. Backgrounds are estimated using a hybrid approach that combines machine learning-based generative modelling with traditional simulation, and a discriminator is trained in the latent space to distinguish data from background estimates. After applying a selection on the classifier output, the invariant mass distribution of the diphoton system is examined for localized excesses above the simulated Higgs peak. We benchmark the sensitivity of this strategy using simplified simulated proton-proton collisions corresponding to data recorded during Run 2 of the LHC, and show that the method can provide significant improvements in sensitivity, even for small signal injections that could remain undetected in an inclusive analysis. These results demonstrate that the proposed strategy is a promising and viable approach for future searches and should be applied to recorded collider data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model that extends the standard model by incorporating the simplest discrete symmetry groups, $Z_2$ and $Z_3$. This model introduces vector-like leptons and a real scalar singlet. Based on this framework, we generate Dirac neutrino masses and explain the neutrino normal mass ordering. The model also aligns well with current oscillation data regarding theoretical values of the leptonic mixing angles and the Dirac CP-violating phase. Furthermore, it predicts that the atmospheric mixing angle falls in the higher octant and proposes a viable dark matter candidate. We also discuss other phenomenological aspects and future testability of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generic constraints on dark photons are generally presented assuming they have Stueckelberg masses. These constraints are strengthened if instead the mass is due to the Higgs mechanism and the dark Higgs is light. First, we show that under reasonable assumptions on the origin of kinetic mixing $\epsilon$ and perturbativity, the strengthened constraints on $\epsilon$ cannot be arbitrarily relaxed by making the Higgs heavy. Second, we demonstrate a simple mechanism for generating dark photon dark matter after inflation, where fluctuations of a dark Higgs by stochastic misalignment can produce stable dark photons through $h\to A'A'$ decay. Third, we point out new lower bounds on $\epsilon$ in the case where the dark photon mediates thermal freeze-out of light dark matter by $s$-channel exchange, taking account of generic expectations for the size of $\epsilon$, and astrophysical upper bounds on the self-interaction cross section.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the newly reported $B\to D^*(\to D\pi)\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell$ differential decay rates by the Belle and Belle II Collaborations, we revisit the $V_{cb}$ puzzle in semi-leptonic $B\to D^*$ decays, considering the latest lattice QCD~(LQCD) simulations and light-cone sum rule~(LCSR) results. We examine the commonly used Caprini-Lellouch-Neubert~(CLN), Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed~(BGL), and heavy quark effective theory~(HQET) parameterizations. We demonstrate that these three parameterizations yield consistent results and reconfirm the $V_{cb}$ puzzle. Then, we use a state-of-the-art Bayesian method to estimate the impact of higher-order terms beyond the present HQET expansion on the uncertainty of $V_{cb}$. We show that higher-order effects cannot eliminate the deviation between the exclusive and inclusive determinations of $V_{cb}$. Finally, utilizing the best-fit results obtained in the HQET parameterization via fitting LQCD and LCSR data only as inputs, we predict the relevant observables, i.e., $R_{D^*}$, $F_L^{D^*}$, and $P_\tau^{D^*}$, sensitive to new physics in the $B\to D^*\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell$ decays. We conclude that lepton-flavour universality violations still exist in the $b\to c\tau\nu$.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Functional Methods Beyond One-Loop Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional methods can be applied to the quantum effective action to efficiently determine counterterms and matching conditions for effective field theories. We extend the toolbox to two-loop order and beyond and show how to evaluate the expansion of the path integral in a manifestly gauge-covariant manner. We also generalize the method to theories with mixed spin statistics and prove the validity of the hard-region matching formula to all loop orders. The methods are exemplified with a two-loop matching calculation of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian resulting from decoupling the electron in QED.</description>

      <title>Accuracy complements energy: electroweak precision tests at Tera-Z</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Tera-$Z$ factory, such as FCC-ee or CEPC, will have indirect sensitivity to heavy new physics up to the tens of TeV scale through higher-order loop contributions to precision measurements at the $Z$ pole. These indirect quantum effects may provide complementary, or even better, sensitivity to potential deviations from the Standard Model that are typically thought to best be constrained at leading order at higher energies above the $Z$ pole. We show in the SMEFT framework how accuracy complements energy for operators that modify the Higgs and gauge boson two- and three-point functions, leading to improved projected sensitivities for models such as the real singlet scalar, weakly interacting massive particles, and a custodial weak quadruplet. A thorough Tera-$Z$ programme may thus anticipate aspects of physics runs at higher energies and provide a wider scope of quantum exploration of the TeV scale than had previously been appreciated.</description>

      <title>Metastable Cosmic Strings and Gravitational Waves from Flavour Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metastable cosmic strings (MSCSs) are among the best-fitting explanations of the 2023 pulsar timing array (PTA) signal for gravitational waves at nanohertz frequencies. We propose the novel possibility that a network of MSCSs generating this signal originates from the multi-step spontaneous breaking of a gauged flavour symmetry. As a specific example, we construct a model of $SU(2)$ flavour symmetry in the context of $SU(5)$ grand unification, where the $SU(2)$ acts exclusively on the first two generations of the matter 10-plet, such that it is ``right for leptons'' and allows for large lepton mixing. The model explains the mass hierarchies of the Standard Model fermions, and predicts the string scale of the MSCSs in a range compatible with the 2023 PTA signal. Cosmic inflation is associated with the latter step of (two-step) family symmetry breaking, and the phase transition ending inflation generates the cosmic string network.</description>

      <title>Ultraheavy diquark decaying into vectorlike quarks at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the discovery potential of an ultraheavy $(7-8.5$ TeV) diquark scalar produced in the collisions of two up quarks at the LHC. Assuming that the diquark scalar decays into two vectorlike quarks of mass around 2 TeV, each of them decaying into a $W^{+}$ boson and a $b$ quark, we focus on the fully-hadronic final state. We present a signal-from-background separation study based on a discriminator built with Machine Learning techniques. For this six-jet final state and a luminosity of $3000 \ \text{fb}^{-1}$, we estimate that a diquark scalar of mass near 8 TeV may be discovered or ruled out even when its coupling to up quarks is as low as 0.2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The IceCube Upgrade will provide unprecedented sensitivity to dark matter particles annihilating in the core of the Sun. For dark matter candidates with spin-dependent couplings to nuclei and that annihilate significantly to tau leptons or neutrinos, we find that the IceCube Upgrade will be capable of testing parameter space that is beyond the reach of existing direct detection experiments. After calculating the sensitivity of the IceCube Upgrade to dark matter annihilation in the Sun, we explore dark matter models that could be tested by this experiment, identifying two classes of scenarios as promising targets for such searches.</description>

      <title>Emergent symmetry in a two-Higgs-doublet model from quantum information and nonstabiliserness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studies of scattering processes in scalar models with two Higgs doublets have recently hinted at a connection between the absence of flavour-space entanglement in $\Phi^+\Phi^0$ scattering and an emergent $\mathrm{SO}(8)$ symmetry in the scalar potential. We extend the analysis to all scattering channels with two particles in the external states by treating the process as a four-qubit system in the weak isospin and flavour subspaces of the $2$-particle state. We work with a generic quantum information-theoretic principle encoded by the commutativity of the initial state density matrix with the transition matrix (at leading order in perturbation theory). This yields a special case of the entanglement minimisation conditions previously derived in the literature, and we interpret the principle in terms of the conservation of non-stabiliserness (or magic). Working at leading order in the quartic couplings, we find a consistent set of conditions that implies an $\mathrm{SO}(8)$ symmetry on the quartic part of the potential for scattering an arbitrary initial state, but a smaller $\mathrm{SU}(2)_R$ symmetry when the initial state is chosen to have definite isospin. This follows by accounting for Bose symmetry in the initial state, which introduces entanglement between the isospin and flavour subspaces.</description>

      <title>Return of the Lepton Number: Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter Production and the Revival of the Shi-Fuller Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter via the Shi-Fuller (SF) mechanism, revisiting its cosmological viability in light of recent results demonstrating that lepton-number asymmetries $L_\alpha \gtrsim 1$ at temperatures $T &gt; 20\rm\,MeV$ are consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Using a quasi-classical Boltzmann transport calculation of the dark matter production, we compute the non-thermal phase space distributions of sterile neutrinos across a broad range of particle mass $m_s$ and mixing angle $\sin^2{(2\theta)}$ parameter space. We then evolve the resulting distributions through linear structure formation using CLASS and fit the resulting matter power spectra to thermal warm dark matter (WDM) transfer functions, enabling a direct mapping between SF models and equivalent thermal WDM particle masses $m_{\mathrm{th}}$. This allows us to reinterpret existing structure formation limits and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest preferences in the context of SF production. We find that lepton asymmetries $L \gtrsim 0.5$ at high temperatures open significant viable parameter space in the $m_s \gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{keV}$ and $\sin^2 (2\theta) \lesssim 10^{-14}$ regime, compatible with both X-ray constraints from NuSTAR and INTEGRAL/SPI and recent Lyman-$\alpha$ inferences of $m_{\mathrm{th}} \approx 4.1\,\mathrm{keV}$. Following lepton number evolution below 20 MeV, we also specifically show that this lepton asymmetry parameter space is compatible with BBN and cosmic microwave background constraints. We present updated constraints, a refined $m_{\mathrm{th}}$ fitting function, and power-law approximations for $L$ across the parameter space. Our results motivate future X-ray observations targeting the $\sim 20$ keV photon regime and testing of the $m_\mathrm{th} \gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{keV}$ WDM region.</description>

      <title>Impact of Non-Thermal Leptogenesis with Early Matter Domination on Gravitational Waves from First-order Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of non-thermal leptogenesis on the spectrum of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by a strong first-order phase transition in the early Universe. We consider a scenario in which a heavy scalar field, $\phi$, dominates the energy density of the early Universe and decays into heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). The subsequent decay of RHNs generates a lepton asymmetry, which is partially converted into the observed baryon asymmetry via the sphaleron process. The $\phi$-dominated era and the entropy injection from the decays of $\phi$ and RHNs leave characteristic imprints on the GW spectrum, such as damping and modified frequency dependence, that distinguish it from the standard cosmological evolution. We identify the parameter space in which non-thermal leptogenesis is successful, leading to distinctive GW spectral features. We show that these GW signals can fall within the sensitivity ranges of future detectors such as ET, DECIGO and BBO. If observed, they would provide valuable insights into the thermal history and dynamics of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Variation of the QCD Interaction Scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laboratory and astrophysical tests of ''constant variation'' have so far concentrated on the dimensionless fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and on the electron or quark mass ratios $X_{e,q}=m_{e,q}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$, treating the QCD scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ as unchangeable. Certain beyond Standard Model frameworks, most notably those with a dark matter or dark energy scalar field $\phi$ coupling with the gluon field, would make $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ itself time dependent while leaving $\alpha$ and the electron mass untouched. Under the minimal assumption that this gluonic channel is the sole $\phi$ interaction, we recast state-of-the-art atomic clock comparisons into $\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}=(3.2 \pm 3.5) \times 10^{-17} \ \text{yr}^{-1}$ limits, translate the isotope yields of the 1.8-Gyr-old Oklo natural reactor into a complementary geophysical limit of $|\delta\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;2\times10^{-9}$ over that time span, corresponding to the linear drift limit $|\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;1\times10^{-18} \text{yr}^{-1}$, and show that the proposed $8.4$ eV $^{229}$Th nuclear clock would amplify a putative $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ drift by four orders of magnitude compared with present atomic clocks. We also obtain constraints from quasar absorption spectra and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis data.</description>

      <title>Fermion mass ratios from the exceptional Jordan algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the "three generations" problem and the pattern of charged-fermion masses from the vantage of octonionic and Clifford algebra structures. Working with the exceptional Jordan algebra J3(OC) (right-handed flavor) and the symmetric cube of SU(3) (left-handed charge frame), we show that a single minimal ladder in the symmetric cube, together with the Dynkin Z2 swap (the A2 diagram flip), leads to closed-form expressions for the square-root mass ratios of all three charged families. The universal Jordan spectrum (q - delta, q, q + delta) with a theoretically derived delta squared = 3/8 fixes the endpoint contrasts; fixed Clebsch factors (2, 1, 1) ensure rung cancellation ("edge universality") so that adjacent ratios depend only on which edge is taken. The down ladder determines one step, its Dynkin reflection gives the lepton ladder, and choosing the other outward leg from the middle yields the up sector.
  From the same inputs we obtain compact CKM "root-sum rules": with one 1-2 phase and a mild 2-3 cross-family normalization, the framework reproduces the Cabibbo angle and Vcb and provides leading predictions for Vub and Vtd/Vts. We perform apples-to-apples phenomenology (common scheme/scale) and find consistency with current determinations within quoted uncertainties. Conceptually, rank-1 idempotents (points of the octonionic projective plane), fixed symmetric-cube Clebsches, and the Dynkin swap together account for why electric charge is generation-blind while masses follow the observed hierarchies, and they furnish clear, falsifiable mass-ratio relations beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Roles of $\bar{D}^{*}K^{*}$ and $D^*\bar{D}$ molecular states in decay $B^+ \to D^{*+} D^- K^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the three-body decay process $B^+ \to D^{*+} D^- K^+$, aiming to explore the possible origins of $T^*_{\bar{c}\bar{s}0}(2870)^0$ and $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ as intermediate states. Within the molecular state framework, $T^*_{\bar{c}\bar{s}0}(2870)^0$ and $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ are considered as possible $\bar{D}^{*}K^{}$ and $D^*\bar{D}$ molecular states, respectively. Using effective Lagrangians, the interaction kernels of the $\bar{D}^{*}K^{*}$ and $D^*\bar{D}$ systems are constructed within the one-boson-exchange model. The corresponding rescattering amplitudes and pole positions are obtained by solving the quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation. These amplitudes are incorporated into the decay amplitude of the three-body process, and the $D^-K^+$ and $D^{*+}D^-$ invariant mass spectra are simulated via Monte Carlo methods. To better reproduce the experimental data, additional Breit-Wigner contributions from $T^*_{\bar{c}\bar{s}1}(2900)^0$, $\chi_{c1}(4010)$, and $h_c(4300)$ are included. The results show a pronounced enhancement near 2900 MeV in the $D^-K^+$ invariant mass spectrum, strongly supporting the interpretation of $T^*_{\bar{c}\bar{s}0}(2870)^0$ as a $\bar{D}^{*}K^{*}$ molecular state. While the $\bar{D}^{*}K^{*}$ molecular state provides a reasonable contribution to the $D^-K^+$ spectrum, the $D^*\bar{D}$ molecular state yields no significant effect on either the $D^-K^+$ or $D^{*+}D^-$ distributions. This suggests that the observed $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ structure around 3872 MeV may not be interpreted as a $D^*\bar{D}$ molecular state.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from First-Order Cosmological Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.07481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of forming primordial black holes during a first-order phase transition in the early Universe. As is well known, such a phase transition proceeds through the formation of true-vacuum bubbles in a Universe that is still in a false vacuum. When there is a particle species whose mass increases significantly during the phase transition, transmission of the corresponding particles through the advancing bubble walls is suppressed. Consequently, an overdensity can build up in front of the walls and become sufficiently large to trigger primordial black hole formation. We track this process quantitatively by solving a Boltzmann equation, and we delineate the phase transition properties required for our mechanism to yield an appreciable abundance of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Detailed Calculation of Primordial Black Hole Formation During First-Order Cosmological Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.00005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes could potentially form during a first-order cosmological phase transition due to a build-up of particles which are predominantly reflected from the advancing bubble walls. After discussing the general mechanism, we examine the criteria that need to be satisfied for a black hole to form. We then set out the Boltzmann equation that describes the evolution of the relevant phase space distribution function, carefully describing our treatment of the Liouville operator and the collision term. Assuming a spherical false vacuum pocket of sufficient size and a constant wall velocity, we find that black holes can form in a range of different scenarios.</description>

      <title>The role of intermediate $\Delta\Delta$ states in nucleon-nucleon scattering in the large-$N_c$ and unitary limits, and $\Delta\Delta$ and $\Omega\Omega$ scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore potential explanations for why using large-$N_c$ ($N_c$ is the number of colors) scaling to determine the relative size of few-nucleon low-energy operators agrees with experiment even when dynamical $\Delta$'s are not explicitly included. Given that the large-$N_c$ analysis is predicated on the nucleons and $\Delta$'s being degenerate, this is a curious result. We show that for purely $S$-wave interactions the relationships dictated by large-$N_c$ scaling are unaffected whether the $\Delta$ is included or not. In the case of higher partial waves that do not mix with $S$-waves, the impact of the $\Delta$ is perturbative, which makes the agreement with naive ($\Delta$-less) large-$N_c$ ordering unsurprising. For higher partial waves that mix with $S$-waves, the nucleon and $\Delta$ would need to decouple to get agreement with naive large-$N_c$ ordering. We find all $NN$, $\Delta N$, and $\Delta\Delta$ low energy coefficients for leading-order baryon-baryon scattering in $\Delta$-full pionless effective field theory in terms of the two independent parameters dictated by the SU($2F$) spin-flavor symmetry that arises in the $N_c \rightarrow \infty$ limit. Because of recent lattice QCD results and experimental interest, we extend our analysis to the three-flavor case to study $\Omega\Omega$ scattering. We show that in the unitary limit (where scattering lengths become infinite) one of the two SU($2F$) parameters is driven to zero, resulting in enhanced symmetries, which agree with those found in spin-1/2 entanglement studies.</description>

      <title>Geminga: A Window of the Role Played by Local Halo in the Cosmic Ray Propagation Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel phenomenon among the recently observed Geminga pulsar halo is the presence of distinct radiation morphology at high energies, while no extended radiation is detected in the 10-500 GeV energy band within a $40\degree\times40\degree$ region. This phenomenon suggests that pulsar halos play a crucial role in the local propagation of cosmic rays, making it necessary to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon. This work focuses on the 3D propagation study of cosmic rays, incorporating the Geminga pulsar into our propagation framework to investigate its contribution to different observational spectra. We consider Geminga a dominant local source of positrons, partially reproducing the observed positron spectrum and multi-wavelength radiative spectra of the Geminga halo. Through calculations of signal and background at different angles, we find that: (1) The slow-diffusion properties near the Geminga pulsar and its proper motion may cause the radiation from electrons originating from Geminga to be distributed across a more extended region. (2) The incomplete subtraction of radiation from the local halo may contribute, to some extent, to the diffuse gamma ray fluctuations detected by LHAASO. We hope that LHAASO will detect more sources of cosmic ray halo to further validate our model.</description>

      <title>Bounds on decaying sterile neutrinos via magnetic dipole moment from COB intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent observation by Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) mounted on NASA's New Horizons yielded the most accurate measurement of the cosmic optical background (COB). The reported COB intensity is $11.16\pm 1.35$ $\mathrm{nW/m^2/sr}$ at a pivot wavelength $ \lambda_{piv} = 0.608 \, \mu\mathrm{m}$ observed in the range \( 0.4 \, \mu\mathrm{m} \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 0.9 \, \mu\mathrm{m} \). After subtracting the measured intensity from the deep Hubble Space Telescope count, diffused galactic light, and scattered light from bright star foregrounds, an anomalous intensity of $2.99 \pm 2.03~\mathrm{nW/m^2/sr}$ has been found. We considered radiatively decaying sterile neutrinos of keV mass scale, as dark matter candidate, that could contribute to this anomalous reported intensity. Using this, we derive upper bounds on the sterile-to-sterile transition magnetic moment. We find that sterile neutrinos with mass of $\mathcal{O}(\rm keV)$ scale take values of the transition magnetic moment in the range $ 3\times 10^{-13}\,\rm eV^{-1} - 10^{-9}\,\rm eV^{-1}$ to explain the anomalous intensity of $2.99\pm 2.03\,\rm nW/m^2/sr$. % Future experiments such as, Cosmological Advanced Survey Telescope for Optical-UV Research (CASTOR), James Web Space Telescope (JWST), and Spectro-Photometer for the history of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) might help us derive a better bound on the sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Regression as a Sustainable Data-driven Background Estimate Method at the (HL)-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07289v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we evaluate the performance of a data-driven background estimate method based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). A realistic background spectrum from a search conducted by CMS is considered, where a large sub-region below the trigger threshold is included. It is found that the $L_2$ regularisation can serve as a set of hyperparameters and control the overall modelling performance to satisfy common standards established by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In addition, we show the robustness of this method against increasing luminosity via pseudo-experiments matching the expected luminosity at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). While traditional methods relying on empirical functions have been challenged during LHC Run 2 already, a GPR-based technique can offer a solution that is valid through the entire lifetime of the (HL)-LHC.</description>

      <title>Axion-Like Particle Mediated Dark Matter and Neutron Star Properties in the QHD Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of the ALP-mediated dark matter (DM) model on neutron star properties using the Quantum Hadrodynamics model (QHD). Using the relativistic mean-field approximation with the QHD-ALP-DM framework, we compute the equation of state (EoS) of neutron stars. Based on our previous study, we find that typical ALP parameter values have no significant effect on the EoS. We then explore various parametrizations of this model by varying the DM Fermi momentum, $q_f$, and DM mass, $m_{\chi}$. Our results show that increasing $q_f$ or $m_{\chi}$ shifts the energy density to higher values while reducing the maximum mass, radius, and tidal deformability of neutron stars. Finally, comparison with observational constraints from gravitational wave events and pulsar measurements indicates that the allowed parameter space for this model is constrained to $q_f &lt; 0.05$ GeV and $m_{\chi} &lt; 1000$ GeV. As a result, our study highlights the importance of next-generation gamma-ray observatories, such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), in probing the ALP-mediated DM model.</description>

      <title>Magnetar field dynamics shaped by chiral anomalies and helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) -- a macroscopic manifestation of the quantum chiral anomaly -- induces currents along magnetic field lines, facilitating mutual conversion between chiral asymmetry and magnetic helicity. Although the finite electron mass suppresses chiral asymmetry through spin-flip processes, we demonstrate that the CME effectively shapes magnetar field evolution. Magnetic helicity acts as a persistent internal source of chiral asymmetry, which mediates the redistribution of magnetic energy across spatial scales, without requiring an external energy source. Our three-dimensional magneto-thermal simulations of the neutron star crust reveal a novel mechanism that significantly reconfigures the magnetic field inherited at birth, amplifying both toroidal and poloidal large-scale dipolar components (crucial for spin-down) to strengths of &gt;1e14 G within just a century, at the expense of small-scale structures. This astrophysical application of the CME, distinct and complementary to conventional hydrodynamic dynamo models, offers an innovative framework for understanding magnetar field dynamics and provides a transformative solution to the origin of their exceptionally strong, large-scale fields.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of the butterfly velocity in holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study quantum chaos in a variety of holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potentials. This includes the 1 R-Charge black hole (1RCBH) model, the 2 R-Charge black hole (2RCBH) model, a potential reconstruction-based analytic bottom-up model, and a numerical bottom-up model. All these models are different avatars of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity action, distinguished by their specific choices of dilaton potentials and gauge-kinetic coupling functions. We focus on computing the chaos parameter, the butterfly velocity, using three distinct methods: entanglement wedge reconstruction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and pole-skipping. We show that all three methods yield identical results for the butterfly velocity across all the holographic QCD models considered, further establishing the equivalence between the three approaches. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of the butterfly velocity as a function of chemical potential and temperature. Interestingly, a universal trend emerges across all models: the butterfly velocity increases/decreases with temperature/chemical potential for thermodynamically stable phases. Additionally, in the high-temperature limit, the butterfly velocity in all models approaches that of the chargeless plasma.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Planck-DESI tension by non-minimally coupled quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Planck measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has established the $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model as the concordant model along with other observations. However, recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration have renewed the matter fraction $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension between DESI-$\Lambda$CDM and Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. Directly reconciling this CMB-BAO tension with a dynamical DE in Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization seems to imply a crossing of the equation-of-state through $w=-1$ at low redshifts. In this letter, we will illustrate with a string-theory-motivated model that, when the DM non-minimally couples to gravity via a quintessence field, a misidentification with the $w_0w_a$CDM model would exactly fake such a crossing behavior, while the coupled quintessence never crosses $w=-1$ but behaves as a standard CDM in the early Universe and approaches a cosmological constant in the late Universe. Such a non-minimal coupling is preferred over $3\sigma$ confidence level. The worsened $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension and $S_8$ tension in the $w_0w_a$CDM model are also resolved in our model.</description>

      <title>From Hyperons to Hypernuclei: A New Route to Unravel Proton Spin Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions create the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) known as the hottest, least viscous, and most vortical fluid ever produced in terrestrial laboratories. Its vortical structure has been uncovered through the spin polarization of Lambda ($\Lambda$) hyperons, attributed to the spin-orbit coupling that transfers the system's orbital angular momentum to the quark spin, which is then inherited by hadrons via quark recombination or coalescence. However, $\Lambda$ polarization reflects primarily the strange-quark component, leaving the spin dynamics of the up and down quarks largely unexplored. Although the proton is an ideal probe, its stability makes direct measurements experimentally challenging. Here, we propose to reveal proton spin polarization via hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda \text{H}$) measurements, exploiting the fact that spin information is preserved when polarized nucleons and $\Lambda$ coalesce to form hypertriton. We show that, over a broad range of collision energies, the polarizations of proton, $\Lambda$, and hypertriton are related by a simple linear scaling law. Since both $\Lambda$ and hypertriton polarizations can be measured via their self-analyzing weak decays, this linear relation provides a practical experimental avenue for accessing spin polarizations of protons and neutrons-the dominant baryonic degrees of freedom in nuclear collisions.</description>
