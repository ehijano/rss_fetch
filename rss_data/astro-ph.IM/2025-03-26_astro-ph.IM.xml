      <title>Classification of Radio Sources Through Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The morphology of radio galaxies is indicative, for instance, of their interaction with their surroundings. Since modern radio surveys contain a large number of radio sources that will be impossible to analyse and classify manually, it is important to develop automatic schemes. Unlike other fields, which benefit from established theoretical frameworks and simulations, for radio galaxies there are no such comprehensive models, posing unique challenges for data analysis. In this study, we investigate the classification of radio galaxies from the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey Data Release 2 (LoTSS-DR2) using self-supervised learning. Our classification strategy involves three main steps: (i) self-supervised pre-training; (ii) fine-tuning using a labelled subsample created from the learned representations; and (iii) final classification of the selected unlabelled sample. To enhance morphological information in the representations, we developed an additional random augmentation. Our results demonstrate that the learned representations contain rich morphological information, enabling the creation of a labelled subsample that effectively captures the morphological diversity within the unlabelled sample. Additionally, the classification of the unlabelled sample into 12 morphological classes yields robust class probabilities. We successfully demonstrate that a subset of radio galaxies from LoTSS-DR2, encompassing diverse morphologies, can be classified using self-supervised learning. The methodology developed here bridges the gap left by the absence of simulations and theoretical models, offering a framework that can readily be applied to astronomical image analyses in other wavebands.</description>

      <title>Using the antenna impedance to estimate soil electrical parameters for the MIST global 21-cm experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio experiments trying to detect the global $21$-cm signal from the early Universe are very sensitive to the electrical properties of their environment. For ground-based experiments with the antenna above the soil it is critical to characterize the effect from the soil on the sky observations. This characterization requires estimating the soil's electrical conductivity and relative permittivity in the same frequency range as the observations. Here we present our initial effort to estimate the conductivity and relative permittivity of the soil using the impedance of an antenna mounted at a distance above the surface. The antenna used is part of the MIST global $21$-cm experiment. We measured the antenna impedance at three sites in the Greater Concepci\'on area, Chile. The measurements were done between $25$ and $125$ MHz, matching the range used by MIST for sky observations. The soil parameters were estimated by fitting the impedance measurements with electromagnetic simulations of the antenna and soil. In this initial effort the soil was modeled as homogeneous. The conductivity at the three sites was found to be between $0.007$ and $0.049$ Sm$^{-1}$, and the relative permittivity between $1.6$ and $12.7$. The percent precision of the estimates at $68\%$ probability is, with one exception, better (lower) than $33\%$. The best-fit simulations have a better than $10\%$ agreement with the measurements relative to the peak values of the resistance and reactance across our frequency range. For MIST, these results represent a successful proof of concept of the use of the antenna impedance for soil characterization, and are expected to significantly improve in future implementations.</description>

      <title>Combined Annual Modulation Dark Matter Search with COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The annual modulation signal, claimed to be consistent with dark matter as observed by DAMA/LIBRA in a sodium-iodide based detector, has persisted for over two decades. COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112 were designed to test the claim directly using the same target material. COSINE-100, located at Yangyang Underground Laboratory in South Korea, and ANAIS-112, located at Canfranc Underground Laboratory in Spain, have been taking data since 2016 and 2017, respectively. Each experiment published its respective results independently. In this paper, we present the results of an annual modulation search as a test of the signal observed by DAMA/LIBRA with the first three respective years of data from COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we find best fit values for modulation amplitude of $-0.0002 {\pm} 0.0026$ cpd/kg/keV in the 1-6 keV and $0.0021 {\pm} 0.0028$ cpd/kg/keV in the 2-6 keV energy regions. These results are not compatible with DAMA/LIBRA's assertion for their observation of annual modulation at $3.7{\sigma}$ and $2.6{\sigma}$, respectively. Performing a simple combination of the newly released 6-years datasets from both experiments find values consistent with no modulation at $0.0005 {\pm} 0.0019$ cpd/kg/keV in the 1-6 keV and $0.0027 {\pm} 0.0021$ cpd/kg/keV in the 2-6 keV energy regions with $4.68{\sigma}$ and $3.53{\sigma}$ respective exclusions of the DAMA/LIBRA signal.</description>

      <title>ALeRCE light curve classifier: Tidal disruption event expansion pack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ALeRCE (Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events) processes the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream in preparation for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, classifying objects using a broad taxonomy. The ALeRCE light curve classifier is a balanced random forest (BRF) algorithm with a two-level scheme that uses variability features from the ZTF alert stream and colors from AllWISE and ZTF photometry. This work presents an updated version of the ALeRCE broker light curve classifier that includes tidal disruption events (TDEs) as a new subclass. We incorporated 24 new features, including the distance to the nearest source detected in ZTF science images and a parametric model of the power-law decay for transients. The labeled set was expanded to 219792 spectroscopically classified sources, including 60 TDEs. To integrate TDEs into ALeRCE's taxonomy, we identified specific characteristics that distinguish them from other transients: their central position in a galaxy, their typical decay pattern when fully disrupted, and their lack of color variability after disruption. We developed features to separate TDEs from other transient events. The updated classifier improves performance across all classes and integrates the TDE class with 91 percent recall. It also identifies a large number of potential TDE candidates in the ZTF alert stream's unlabeled data.</description>

      <title>An Upper Limit on the Interstellar Meteoroid Flux at Video Sizes from the Global Meteor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Material arriving at our solar system from the Galaxy may be detected at Earth in the form of meteors ablating in our atmosphere. Here we report on a search for interstellar meteors within the highest-quality events in the Global Meteor Network (GMN) database. No events were detected that were conclusively hyperbolic with respect to the Sun; however, our search was not exhaustive and examined only the top 57% of events, with a deeper examination planned for future work.
  This study's effective meteoroid mass limit is 6.6 +/- 0.8 x 10^{-5} kg (5 millimeter diameter at a density of 1000 kg m^{-3}). Theoretical rates of interstellar meteors at these sizes range from 3 to 200 events globally per year. The highest rates can already be largely excluded by this study, while at the lowest rates GMN would have to observe for 25 more years to be 50% confident of seeing at least one event. GMN is thus well positioned to provide substantial constraints on the interstellar population at these sizes over the coming years. This study's results are statistically compatible with a rate of interstellar meteors at the Earth at less than 1 per million meteoroid impacts at Earth at millimeter sizes, or a flux rate of less than 8 +/- 2 x 10^{-11} per sq. km per hour at the 95% confidence level.</description>

      <title>A cryogenic test-mass suspension with flexures operating in compression for third-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of the conceptual design of a novel silicon suspension for the cryogenic test-mass mirrors of the low-frequency detector of the Einstein Telescope gravitational-wave observatory. In traditional suspensions, tensional stress is a severe limitation for achieving low thermal noise, safer mechanical margins and high thermal conductance simultaneously. In order to keep the tensional stress sufficiently low, we propose the use of rigid beams with large cross sections, combined with short flexures under compressional load. This configuration takes advantage of the many times higher strength of silicon in compression to respect to its strength in tension. The flexures are mechanically robust and at the same time soft in the working direction, thus producing low suspension thermal noise and, by being short, provide high thermal conductance for cryogenic cooling. The rigid beams, located between the test mass and an intermediate mass, allow the elimination of the recoil mass used conventionally for applying control forces for interferometer lock, and the use of optical anti-springs to reduce the pendulum resonant frequency to further improve the vibration isolation of the test mass. The configuration has the capability to reach a lower mirror operational temperature, which is expected to produce a substantial reduction of the thermal noise in the mirrors of the interferometer.</description>

      <title>Growing 3D clouds from 2D maps via full spherization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel framework for constructing three-dimensional (3D) objects from two-dimensional (2D) maps, tailored for the analysis of complex structures in the interstellar medium (ISM). The framework extends the Abel transform and the AVIATOR algorithm. By expanding medial-axis trees along the $z$-coordinate and transforming circular components into spheres, we generate 3D objects from 2D flux slices while preserving key structural features such as filament intersections, the spatial distribution of bright cores, and filamentary twists. The framework introduces multiple expansion strategies--random, fiducial, and physical--allowing for different interpretations of the underlying 3D structures. While the column density probability density function (PDF) remains largely invariant across different construction methods, the high degree of freedom in the 3D expansion poses challenges in accurately recovering true spatial configurations in complex regions. Our work provides a flexible, extensible platform for exploring the 3D organization of ISM structures, with potential applications in star formation and molecular cloud analysis.</description>

      <title>Along-trajectory acoustic signal variations observed during the hypersonic reentry of the OSIRIS-REx Sample Return Capsule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reentry of the OSIRIS-REx Sample Return Capsule (SRC) on September 24, 2023, presented a rare opportunity to study atmospheric entry dynamics through a dense network of ground-based infrasound sensors. As the first interplanetary capsule to reenter over the United States since Stardust in 2006, this event allowed for unprecedented observations of infrasound signals generated during hypersonic descent. We deployed 39 single-sensor stations across Nevada and Utah, strategically distributed to capture signals from distinct trajectory points. Infrasound data were analyzed to examine how signal amplitude and period vary with altitude and propagation path for a non-ablating hypersonic object with well-defined physical and aerodynamic properties. Raytracing simulations incorporated atmospheric specifications from the Ground-2-Space model to estimate source altitudes for observed signals. Results confirmed ballistic arrivals at all stations, with source altitudes ranging from 44 km to 62 km along the trajectory. Signal period and amplitude exhibited strong dependence on source altitude, with higher altitudes corresponding to lower amplitudes, longer periods, and reduced high-frequency content. Regression analysis demonstrated strong correlations between signal characteristics and both altitude and propagation geometry. Our results suggest, when attenuation is considered, the amplitude is primarily determined by the source, with the propagation path playing a secondary role over the distances examined. These findings emphasize the utility of controlled SRC reentries for advancing our understanding of natural meteoroid dynamics, refining atmospheric entry models, and improving methodologies for planetary defense.</description>

      <title>Systematic Reanalysis of KMTNet Microlensing Events, Paper II: Two New Planets in Giant-Source Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we continue to apply the updated KMTNet tender-love care (TLC) photometric pipeline to historical microlensing events. We apply the pipeline to a subsample of events from the KMTNet database, which we refer to as the giant source sample. Leveraging the improved photometric data, we conduct a systematic search for anomalies within this sample. The search successfully uncovers four new planet-like anomalies and recovers two previously known planetary signals. After detailed analysis, two of the newly discovered anomalies are confirmed as clear planets: KMT-2019-BLG-0578 and KMT-2021-BLG-0736. Their planet-to-host mass ratios are $q\sim4\times10^{-3}$ and $q\sim1\times10^{-4}$, respectively. Another event, OGLE-2018-BLG-0421 (KMT-2018-BLG-0831), remains ambiguous. Both a stellar companion and a giant planet in the lens system could potentially explain the observed anomaly. The anomaly signal of the last event, MOA-2022-BLG-038 (KMT-2022-BLG-2342), is attributed to an extra source star. Within this sample, our procedure doubles the number of confirmed planets, demonstrating a significant enhancement in the survey sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Spectral classification of young stars using conditional invertible neural networks II. Application to Trumpler 14 in Carina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an updated version of our deep learning tool that predicts stellar parameters from the optical spectra of young low-mass stars with intermediate spectral resolution. We adopt a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) architecture to infer the posterior distribution of stellar parameters and train our cINN on two Phoenix stellar atmosphere model libraries (Settl and Dusty). Compared to the cINNs presented in our first study, the updated cINN considers the influence of the relative flux error on the parameter estimation and predicts an additional fourth parameter, veiling. We test the performance of cINN on synthetic test models to quantify the intrinsic error of the cINN as a function of relative flux error and on 36 class III template stars to validate the performance on real spectra. Using our cINN, we estimate the stellar parameters of young stars in Trumpler 14 (Tr14) in the Carina Nebula Complex, observed with VLT-MUSE, and compare them with those derived using the classical template fitting method. We provide Teff, log g, Av, and veiling values measured by our cINN as well as stellar ages and masses derived from the HR diagram. Our parameter estimates generally agree well with those measured by template fitting. However, for K- and G-type stars, the Teff derived from template fitting is, on average, 2-3 subclasses hotter than the cINN estimates, while the corresponding veiling values from template fitting appear to be underestimated compared to the cINN predictions. We obtain an average age of 0.7(+3.2)(-0.6) Myr for the Tr14 stars. By examining the impact of veiling on the equivalent width-based classification, we demonstrate that the main cause of temperature overestimation for K- and G-type stars in the previous study is that veiling and effective temperature are not considered simultaneously in their process.</description>

      <title>A New Hope for Obscured AGN: The PRIMA-NewAthena Alliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the AGN-galaxy co-evolution, feedback processes, and the evolution of Black Hole Accretion rate Density (BHAD) requires accurately estimating the contribution of obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). However, detecting these sources is challenging due to significant extinction at the wavelengths typically used to trace their emission. We evaluate the capabilities of the proposed far-infrared observatory PRIMA and its synergies with the X-ray observatory NewAthena in detecting AGN and in measuring the BHAD. Starting from X-ray background synthesis models, we simulate the performance of NewAthena and of PRIMA in Deep and Wide surveys. Our results show that the combination of these facilities is a powerful tool for selecting and characterising all types of AGN. While NewAthena is particularly effective at detecting the most luminous, the unobscured, and the moderately obscured AGN, PRIMA excels at identifying heavily obscured sources, including Compton-thick AGN (of which we expect 7500 detections per deg$^2$). We find that PRIMA will detect 60 times more sources than Herschel over the same area and will allow us to accurately measure the BHAD evolution up to z=8, better than any current IR or X-ray survey, finally revealing the true contribution of Compton-thick AGN to the BHAD evolution.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{synax}$: A Differentiable and GPU-accelerated Synchrotron Simulation Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce synax, a novel library for automatically differentiable simulation of Galactic synchrotron emission. Built on the JAX framework, synax leverages JAX's capabilities, including batch acceleration, just-in-time compilation, and hardware-specific optimizations (CPU, GPU, TPU). Crucially, synax uses JAX's automatic differentiation (AD) mechanism, enabling precise computation of derivatives with respect to any model parameters. This feature facilitates powerful inference algorithms, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and gradient-based optimization, which enables inference over models that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive. In its initial release, synax supports synchrotron intensity and polarization calculations down to GHz frequencies, alongside several models of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), cosmic ray (CR) spectra, and thermal electron density fields. We demonstrate the transformative potential of AD for tasks involving full posterior inference using gradient-based techniques or Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) optimization. Notably, we show that GPU acceleration brings a twenty-fold enhancement in efficiency, while HMC achieves a two-fold improvement over standard random walk Metropolis-Hastings (RWMH) when performing inference over a four-parameter test model. HMC still works on a more complex, 16-parameter model while RWMH fails to converge. Additionally, we showcase the application of synax in optimizing the GMF based on the Haslam 408 MHz map, achieving residuals with a standard deviation below 1 K.</description>

      <title>COCOA: a compact Compton camera for astrophysical observation of MeV-scale gamma rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: COCOA (COmpact COmpton cAmera) is a next-generation, cost-effective gamma-ray telescope designed for astrophysical observations in the MeV energy range. The detector comprises a scatterer volume employing the LiquidO detection technology and an array of scintillating crystals acting as absorber. Surrounding plastic scintillator panels serve as a veto system for charged particles. The detector's compact, scalable design enables flexible deployment on microsatellites or high-altitude balloons. Gamma rays at MeV energies have not been well explored historically (the so-called "MeV gap") and COCOA has the potential to improve the sensitivity in this energy band by more than one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>$\mu$-GLANCE: A Novel Technique to Detect Chromatically and Achromatically Lensed Gravitational Wave Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing in the wave-optics (WO) regime occurs when the Schwarzschild radius of a lensing object is comparable to or smaller than the wavelength of incoming gravitational waves (GWs), producing chromatic amplitude and phase modulations. In contrary, geometric optics effects happen when wavelength is much smaller than the lensing object leading to frequency independent amplifications and phase shifts. GWs can undergo both effects of lensing due to interactions with objects of different scales. To detect and characterize the wave-optics features from a lensed GW, we have developed a novel method \texttt{$\mu$-GLANCE} (Micro-Gravitational Lensing Authenticator using Non-modelled Cross-correlation Exploration). In this technique, we calculate the cross-correlation between the residuals from different detectors. We assign a false alarm rate to each potential WO microlensed candidate from a statistical viewpoint, depending on how many times the noise cross-correlation matches the strength of the residual cross-correlation of the candidate over a certain period of time. We show that for an event with a matched-filtering signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) close to thirty, a residual due to wave-optics lensing with an amplitude about $10\%$ of magnification $\mu\approx 3.2$ will start to show deviation from noise distribution at more than $68\%$ Confidence interval with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA sensitivity for the fourth observation run. This method provides the first technique to detect geometric optics and wave-optics effects from a WO microlensed GW without assuming any specific lensing model, and its application on the current and future GW data can identify events with both chromatic and achromatic lensed scenarios.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Scattering Transform for Gravitational Waves Analysis. An Application to Glitch Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves, first predicted by Albert Einstein within the framework of general relativity, were confirmed in 2015 by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration, marking a pivotal breakthrough in astrophysics. Despite this achievement, a key challenge remains in distinguishing true gravitational wave signals from noise artifacts, or "glitches," which can distort data and affect the quality of observations. Current state-of-the-art methods, such as the Q-transform, are widely used for signal processing, but face limitations when addressing certain types of signals. In this study, we investigate the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST), a recent signal analysis method, as a complementary approach. Theoretical motivation for WST arises from its stability under signal deformations and its equivariance properties, which make it particularly suited for the complex nature of gravitational wave data. Our experiments on the LIGO O1a dataset show that WST simplifies classification tasks and enables the use of more efficient architectures compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we explore the potential benefits of integrating WST with the Q-transform, demonstrating that ensemble methods exploiting both techniques can capture complementary features of the signal and improve overall performance. This work contributes to advancing machine learning applications in gravitational wave analysis, introducing refined preprocessing techniques that improve signal detection and classification.</description>

      <title>An experiment to observe GNSS signals with the Australian VGOS array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new instrument enabling a novel combination of Earth measuring techniques: direct observations with the radio astronomical instruments to satellites of the global navigation satellite systems. Inter-technique biases are a major error source in the terrestrial reference frame. Combining two major space-geodetic techniques, GNSS and VLBI, through observations to identical sensors has been considered infeasible due to their seemingly incompatible operating frequencies. The newly accessible L-band capability of the Australian VGOS telescopes is shown here, invalidating this prevailing opinion. A series of test observations demonstrates geodetic VLBI observations to GPS satellites for a continental-wide IVS telescope array, with the potential for observations at a critical scale. We anticipate immediate impact for the geodetic community, through first-ever inter-technique ties between VLBI and GNSS in the Australian region and via the opportunity for critical test observations towards the Genesis mission, geodesy's flagship project in the area of space ties set for launch in 2028.</description>

      <title>Investigating the relationship between bolide entry angle and apparent direction of infrasound signal arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infrasound sensing offers critical capabilities for detecting and geolocating bolide events globally. However, the observed back azimuths, directions from which infrasound signals arrive at stations, often differ from the theoretical expectations based on the bolide's peak brightness location. For objects with shallow entry angles, which traverse longer atmospheric paths, acoustic energy may be emitted from multiple points along the trajectory, leading to substantial variability in back azimuth residuals. This study investigates how the entry angle of energetic bolides affects the back azimuth deviations, independent of extrinsic factors such as atmospheric propagation, station noise, and signal processing methodologies. A theoretical framework, the Bolide Infrasound Back-Azimuth EXplorer Model (BIBEX-M), was developed to compute predicted back azimuths solely from geometric considerations. The model quantifies how these residuals vary as a function of source-to-receiver distance, revealing that bolides entering at shallow angles of 10 degrees can experience average residuals of 20 degrees, with deviations reaching up to 46 degrees at distances below 1000 km, and remaining significant even at 10,000 km. In contrast, bolides with steeper entry angles (greater than 60 degrees) show much smaller deviations, typically under 5 degrees at 1000 km and diminishing to less than 1 deg beyond 5000 km. These findings attest to the need for careful interpretation when evaluating signal detections and estimating bolide locations. This work is not only pertinent to bolides but also to other high-energy, extended-duration atmospheric phenomena such as space debris and reentry events, where similar geometric considerations can influence infrasound arrival directions.</description>
