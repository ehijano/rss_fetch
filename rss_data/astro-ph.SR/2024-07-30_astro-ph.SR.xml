      <title>Weighing The Options: The Unseen Companion in LAMOST J2354 is Likely a Massive White Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LAMOST J235456.73+335625 (J2354) is a binary system hosting a $\sim 0.7~\rm M_\odot$ K dwarf and a $\sim 1.4~\rm M_\odot$ dark companion, supposedly a neutron star, in a 0.48d orbit. Here we present high- and low-resolution spectroscopy to better constrain the properties of the system. The low-resolution spectrum confirms that the luminous star is a slightly metal-poor K dwarf and strengthens the limits on any optical flux from the dimmer companion. We use the high-resolution spectra to measure atmospheric parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], $v_{\rm rot}\sin i$) and abundances for 8 elements for the K dwarf. We refine the mass of the compact object to $M_{\rm co} \sim 1.3~\rm M_\odot$ with a minimum mass of $M_{\rm co, min} = 1.23\pm0.04~\rm M_\odot$. The expected overabundance of intermediate-mass elements from the incident supernova ejecta is not detected in the K-dwarf atmosphere. This contrasts with known binaries hosting neutron stars where almost all companions show evidence for polluting material. Moving the neutron-star progenitor further from the K-dwarf at the time of explosion to minimize atmospheric pollution requires a finely-tuned kick to produce the current orbital separation of $\sim 3.3~\rm R_\odot$. Instead, we find that a massive white dwarf with a cooling age of $\gtrsim 3~$Gyr satisfies all observational constraints. The system likely experienced two common-envelope phases leading to its current state because the white dwarf progenitor was massive enough to ignite He-shell burning. The system will become a cataclysmic variable in the distant future when the K-dwarf evolves off of the main sequence. These short-period high-$q$ binaries represent an intriguing formation pathway for compact double white dwarf binaries and thermonuclear supernovae. An ultraviolet spectrum is the most promising avenue for directly detecting the white dwarf companion.</description>

      <title>A Data-driven Spectral Model of Main Sequence Stars in Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise spectroscopic classification of planet hosts is an important tool of exoplanet research at both the population and individual system level. In the era of large-scale surveys, data-driven methods offer an efficient approach to spectroscopic classification that leverages the fact that a subset of stars in any given survey has stellar properties that are known with high fidelity. Here, we use The Cannon, a data-driven framework for modeling stellar spectra, to train a generative model of spectra from the Gaia Data Release 3 Radial Velocity Spectrometer. Our model derives stellar labels with precisions of 72 K in Teff , 0.09 dex in log g, 0.06 dex in [Fe/H], 0.05 dex in [{\alpha}/Fe] and 1.9 km/s in vbroad for main-sequence stars observed by Gaia DR3 by transferring GALAH labels, and is publicly available at https://github.com/isabelangelo/gaiaspec. We validate our model performance on planet hosts with available Gaia RVS spectra at SNR&gt;50 by showing that our model is able to recover stellar parameters at {\geq}20% improved accuracy over the existing Gaia stellar parameter catalogs, measured by the agreement with high-fidelity labels from the Spectroscopic Observations of Cool Stars (SPOCS) survey. We also provide metrics to test for stellar activity, binarity, and reliability of our model outputs and provide instructions for interpreting these metrics. Finally, we publish updated stellar labels and metrics that flag suspected binaries and active stars for Kepler Input Catalog objects with published Gaia RVS spectra.</description>

      <title>Destruction of interstellar methyl cyanide (CH3CN) via collisions with He+ ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methyl cyanide is one of the simplest interstellar complex organic molecules, widely detected in young solar analogues, shocked regions, protoplanetary disks and comets. CH3CN can be considered a key species to explore the chemical connections between planet forming disks and comets. For such comparison to be meaningful kinetics data for the reactions leading to CH3CN formation and destruction must be updated. We focus on the destruction of methyl cyanide through collisions with He+. A combined experimental and theoretical methodology is employed to obtain cross sections (CSs) and branching ratios (BRs) as a function of collision energy, from which reaction rate coefficients $k(T)$ are calculated in the temperature range from 10 to 300 K. CSs and BRs are measured using a guided ion beam set-up. A theoretical treatment based on an analytical formulation of the potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the charge exchange process is developed. The method employs a Landau Zener model to obtain reaction probabilities at crossings between the entrance and exit PESs, and an adiabatic centrifugal sudden approximation to calculate CSs and k(T). Rates and BRs differ from those predicted from widely-used capture models. In particular, the rate coefficient at 10 K is estimated to be almost one order of magnitude smaller than what reported in the KIDA database. As for BRs, the charge exchange is completely dissociative and the most abundant fragments are HCCN+/CCNH+, HCNH+ and CH2+. Our results, combined with a revised chemical network for formation of CH3CN, support the hypothesis that methyl cyanide in protoplanetary disks could be mostly the product of gas-phase processes rather than grain chemistry, as currently proposed. These findings are expected to have implications in the comparison of the abundance ratios of N-bearing molecules observed in disks with cometary abundance ratios</description>

      <title>Primeval very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs -- VIII. The first age benchmark L subdwarf, a wide companion to a halo white dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of five white dwarf + ultracool dwarf systems identified as common proper motion wide binaries in the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars. The discoveries include a white dwarf + L subdwarf binary, VVV~1256-62AB, a gravitationally-bound system located 75.6(+1.9/-1.8) pc away with a projected separation of 1375(+35/-33) au. The primary is a cool DC white dwarf with a hydrogen dominated atmosphere, and has a total age of 10.5(+3.3/-2.1) Gyr, based on white dwarf model fitting. The secondary is an L subdwarf with a metallicity of [M/H] = -0.72(+0.08/-0.10) (i.e. [Fe/H] = -0.81\pm0.10) and Teff = 2298(+45/-43) K based on atmospheric model fitting of its optical to near infrared spectrum, and likely has a mass just above the stellar/substellar boundary. The subsolar metallicity of the L subdwarf and the system's total space velocity of 406 km/s indicates membership in the Galactic halo, and it has a flat eccentric Galactic orbit passing within 1~kpc of the centre of the Milky Way every ~0.4 Gyr and extending to 15-31 kpc at apogal. VVV 1256-62B is the first L subdwarf to have a well-constrained age, making it an ideal benchmark of metal-poor ultracool dwarf atmospheres and evolution.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric heating and magnetism driven by $^{22}$Ne distillation in isolated white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19289v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of atmospheric heating in the cool, magnetic white dwarf GD 356 remains unsolved nearly 40 years after its discovery. This once idiosyncratic star with $T_{\rm eff}\approx7500$ K, yet Balmer lines in Zeeman-split emission is now part of a growing class of white dwarfs exhibiting similar features, and which are tightly clustered in the HR diagram suggesting an intrinsic power source. This paper proposes that convective motions associated with an internal dynamo can power electric currents along magnetic field lines that heat the atmosphere via Ohmic dissipation. Such currents would require a dynamo driven by core $^{22}$Ne distillation, and would further corroborate magnetic field generation in white dwarfs by this process. The model predicts that the heating will be highest near the magnetic poles, and virtually absent toward the equator, in agreement with observations. This picture is also consistent with the absence of X-ray or extreme ultraviolet emission, because the resistivity would decrease by several orders of magnitude at the typical coronal temperatures. The proposed model suggests that i) DAHe stars are mergers with enhanced $^{22}$Ne that enables distillation and may result in significant cooling delays; and ii) any mergers that distill neon will generate magnetism and chromospheres. The predicted chromospheric emission is consistent with the two known massive DQe white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Why could a new-born active region produce coronal mass ejections?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar active regions (ARs) are the main sources of flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). NOAA AR 12089, which emerged on 2014 June 10, produced two C-class flares accompanied by CMEs within five hours after its emergence. When producing the two eruptive flares, the total unsigned magnetic flux ($\Phi_{\text{AR}}$) and magnetic free energy ($E_f$) of the AR are much smaller than the common CME-producing ARs. Why can this extremely small AR produce eruptive flares so early? We compare the AR magnetic environment for the eruptive flares to that for the largest confined flare from the AR. Besides the $\Phi_{\text{AR}}$ and $E_f$, we calculate the ratio between the mean characteristic twist parameter ($\alpha_{\text{FPIL}}$) within the flaring polarity inversion line (FPIL) region and $\Phi_{\text{AR}}$, a parameter considering both background magnetic field constraint and non-potentiality of the core region, for the three flares. We find higher $\alpha_{\text{FPIL}}/{\Phi_{\text{AR}}}$ values during the eruptive flares than during the confined flare. Furthermore, we compute the decay index along the polarity inversion line, revealing values of 1.69, 3.45, and 0.98 before the two eruptive and the confined flares, respectively. Finally, nonlinear force-free field extrapolation indicates that a flux rope was repeatedly formed along the FPIL before eruptive flares, which ejected out and produced CMEs. No flux rope was found before the confined flare. Our research suggests that even a newly emerged, extremely small AR can produce eruptive flares if it has sufficiently weak background field constraint and strong non-potentiality in the core region.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the statistical equilibrium of H$^-$ in stellar atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negative hydrogen ion H$^-$ is, almost without exception, treated in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in modelling of F, G and K stars, where it is the dominant opacity source in the visual spectral region. This assumption in practice rests on the study by Lambert &amp; Pagel from 1968. Since that work, knowledge of relevant atomic processes, and theoretical calculations of stellar atmospheres and their spectra, have advanced significantly, yet this question has not been reexamined. Calculations are presented for a slightly modified version of Lambert &amp; Pagel's analytical model including H, H$_2$ and H$^-$, together with modern atomic data and a grid of 1D LTE theoretical stellar atmosphere models with stellar parameters ranging from T$_\mathrm{eff} = 4000$ to 7000~K, $\log{g} = 1$ to 5 cm/s$^2$, and [Fe/H]$=-3$ to 0. We find direct non-LTE effects on populations in spectrum forming regions, continua and spectral lines of the order of 1-2 percent in stars with higher T$_\mathrm{eff}$ and/or lower $\log g$. Effects in models for solar parameters are a factor of 10 smaller, of order 0.1-0.2 percent, and in models with lower T$_\mathrm{eff}$ and/or higher $\log g$ practically absent. These departures from LTE found in our calculations originate from radiative recombination of electrons with hydrogen to form H$^-$ exceeding photodetachment, i.e. overrecombination. Modern atomic data are not a source of significant differences compared to Lambert &amp; Pagel's work, though detailed data for processes on H$_2$ resolved with vibrational and rotational states provide a more complete and complex picture of the role of H$_2$ in the equilibrium of H$^-$. In the context of modern studies of stellar spectra at percent level, our results suggest this question requires further attention, including a more extensive reaction network, and indirect effects due to non-LTE electron populations.</description>

      <title>The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs: Magnesium and silicon abundances of K7-M5.5 stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the abundances of magnesium (Mg) and silicon (Si) for 314 dwarf stars with spectral types in the interval K7.0-M5.5 (Teff range ~4200-3050 K) observed with the CARMENES high-resolution spectrograph at the 3.5 m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory. Our analysis employs the BT-Settl model atmospheres, the radiative transfer code Turbospectrum, and a state-of-the-art selection of atomic and molecular data. These Mg and Si abundances are critical for understanding both the chemical evolution and assembly of the Milky Way and the formation and composition of rocky planets. Our chemical abundances show a line-to-line scatter at the level of 0.1 dex for all studied spectral types. The typical error bar of our chemical abundance measurements is +- 0.11 dex (Mg) and +- 0.16 dex (Si) for all spectral types based on the comparison of the results obtained for stellar components of multiple systems. The derived abundances are consistent with the galactic evolution trends and observed chemical abundance distribution of earlier FGK-type stars in the solar neighbourhood. Besides, our analysis provides compatible abundances for stars in multiple systems. In addition, we studied the abundances of different galactic stellar populations. In this paper, we also explore the relation of the Mg and Si abundances of stars with and without known planets.</description>

      <title>FAUST. XVIII. Evidence for annular substructure in a very young Class 0 disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the planet formation process begins in the disks surrounding young stars is still an open question. Annular substructures such as rings and gaps in disks are intertwined with planet formation, and thus their presence or absence is commonly used to investigate the onset of this process. Current observations show a limited number of disks surrounding protostars exhibiting annular substructures, all of them in the Class I stage. The lack of observed features in most of these sources may indicate a late emergence of substructures, but it could also be an artifact of these disks being optically thick. To mitigate the problem of optical depth, we investigate substructures within a very young Class 0 disk characterized by a low inclination using observations at longer wavelengths. We use 3 mm ALMA observations tracing dust emission at a resolution of 7 au to search for evidence of annular substructures in the disk around the deeply embedded Class 0 protostar Oph A SM1. The observations reveal a nearly face-on disk (i$\sim$16$^{\circ}$) extending up to 40 au. The radial intensity profile shows a clear deviation from a smooth profile near 30 au, which we interpret as the presence of either a gap at 28 au or a ring at 34 au with Gaussian widths of $\sigma=1.4^{+2.3}_{-1.2}$ au and $\sigma=3.9^{+2.0}_{-1.9}$ au, respectively. The 3 mm emission at the location of the possible gap or ring is determined to be optically thin, precluding the possibility that this feature in the intensity profile is due to the emission being optically thick. Annular substructures resembling those in the more evolved Class I and II disks could indeed be present in the Class 0 stage, earlier than previous observations suggested. Similar observations of embedded disks in which the high optical depth problem can be mitigated are clearly needed to better constrain the onset of substructures in the embedded stages.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of stars with planets in the solar neighbourhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: - Aims: We intended to quantify the impact of stellar multiplicity on the presence and properties of exoplanets. - Methods: We investigated all exoplanet host stars at less than 100 pc using the latest astrometric data from Gaia DR3 and advanced statistical methodologies. We complemented our search for common proper motion and parallax companions with data from the Washington Double Star catalogue and the literature. After excluding a number of systems based on radial velocity data, and membership in clusters and open associations, or with resolved ultracool companions, we kept 215 exoplanet host stars in 212 multiple-star systems. - Results: We found 17 new companions in the systems of 15 known exoplanet host stars, measured precise angular and projected physical separations and position angles for 236 pairs of stars, compiled key parameters for 276 planets in multiple systems, and established a comparison sample comprising 687 single stars with exoplanets. With all of this, we statistically analysed a series of hypothesis regarding planets in multiple stellar systems. Although they are only statistically significant at a 2{\sigma} level, our analysis pointed to several interesting results on the comparison in the mean number of planets in multiple versus single stellar systems and the tendency of high mass planets to be located in closer orbits in multiple systems. We confirm that planets in multiple systems tend to have orbits with larger eccentricities than those in single systems. In particular, we found a significant (&gt; 4{\sigma}) preference for planets to exhibit high orbital eccentricities at small ratios between star-star projected physical separations and star-planet semi-major axes.</description>

      <title>The ANTARESS workflow I. Optimal extraction of spatially resolved stellar spectra with high-resolution transit spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution spectrographs open a detailed window onto the atmospheres of stars and planets. As the number of systems observed with different instruments grows, it is crucial to develop a standard in analyzing spectral time series of exoplanet transits and occultations, for the benefit of reproducibility. Here, we introduce the ANTARESS workflow, a set of methods aimed at processing high-resolution spectroscopy datasets in a robust way and extracting accurate exoplanetary and stellar spectra. While a fast preliminary analysis can be run on order-merged 1D spectra and cross-correlation functions (CCFs), the workflow was optimally designed for extracted 2D echelle spectra to remain close to the original detector counts, limit the spectral resampling, and propagate the correlated noise. Input data from multiple instruments and epochs were corrected for relevant environmental and instrumental effects, processed homogeneously, and analyzed independently or jointly. In this first paper, we show how planet-occulted stellar spectra extracted along the transit chord and cleaned from planetary contamination provide a direct comparison with theoretical stellar models and enable a spectral and spatial mapping of the photosphere. We illustrate this application of the workflow to archival ESPRESSO data, using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect Revolutions (RMR) technique to confirm the spin-orbit alignment of HD\,209458b and unveil biases in WASP-76b's published orbital architecture. Because the workflow is modular and its concepts are general, it can support new methods and be extended to additional spectrographs to find a range of applications beyond the proposed scope. In a companion paper, we will present how planet-occulted spectra can be processed further to extract and analyze planetary spectra decontaminated from the star, providing clean and direct measurements of atmospheric properties.</description>

The effect of this environment on the planet-formation process, however, is important, especially in the earliest stage. Aims: We investigate the differences in planet populations forming in star-cluster environments through pebble accretion and compare these results with the planet formation around isolated stars. We try to provide potential signatures on the young planetary systems to guide future observation. Methods: We design and present a new planet population synthesis code for clustered environments. The planet formation model is based on pebble accretion and includes migration in the circumstellar disk. The disk's gas and dust are evolved in 1D simulations considering the effects of photo-evaporation of the nearby stars. Results: Planetary systems in a clustered environment are different than those born in isolation; the environmental effects are important for a wide range of observable parameters and the eventual architecture of the planetary systems. Planetary systems born in a clustered environment lack cold Jupiters compared to isolated planetary systems. This effect is more pronounced for low-mass stars ($\lesssim$0.2 $M_\odot$). On the other hand, planetary systems born in clusters show an excess of cold Neptune around these low-mass stars. Conclusions: In future observations, finding an excess of cold Neptunes and a lack of cold Jupiters could be used to constrain the birth environments of these planetary systems. Exploring the dependence of cold Jupiter's intrinsic occurrence rate on stellar mass provides insights into the birth environment of their proto-embryos.</description>

      <title>Secular aberration drift in stellar proper motions: An additional term due to the change in line-of-sight direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motion of the barycenter of the Solar System (SSB), the origin of the International Celestial Reference System, causes a directional displacement known as secular aberration. The secular aberration drift caused by the galactocentric acceleration of the SSB has been modeled in the third generation of the International Celestial Reference Frame. We aim to address another secular aberration drift effect due to the change in the line-of-sight direction and study its implications for stellar proper motions. A complete formula of secular aberration drift is derived, and its influence on stellar proper motion is computed based on the astrometric data in \textit{Gaia} Data Release 3. We found that the secular aberration drift due to the change in the line-of-sight direction tends to decrease the observed proper motions for stars with galactic longitudes between $0^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$, and increase the observed proper motion for stars in the remaining region. If this secular aberration drift effect is ignored, it will induce an additional proper motion of $&gt;1\,\mathrm{mas\,yr^{-1}}$ for 84 stars and $&gt;0.02\,\mathrm{mas\,yr^{-1}}$ for 5\,944\,879 stars, which is comparable to or several times greater than the typical formal uncertainty of the \textit{Gaia} proper motion measurements at $G&lt;13$. The secular aberration drift due to the change in the line-of-sight direction and the acceleration of the SSB should be modeled to make the stellar reference frame consistent with the extragalactic reference frame.</description>

      <title>The 2021 outburst of 2S 1417-624 revisited with AstroSat</title>

Abstract: This work presents the first ever broadband (0.7-25.0 keV) timing and spectral analysis of Be-HMXB 2S 1417-624 during its 2021 outburst. Using AstroSat observations, coherent pulsations at ~17.36633 s (MJD 59239.082) were detected in 0.7-7.0 keV SXT and 3.0-25.0 keV LAXPC data. The pulse profile was dual peaked at all energies, with the relative intensity of main peak increasing with energy. The peaks in the SXT profiles were broad and comprised of several mini-structures. The LAXPC profiles were relatively smooth and had higher pulsed fraction which increased with energy. The SXT+LAXPC simultaneous energy spectrum is well described by an absorbed power-law with exponential cut-off, along with ~1.6 keV black body component and 6.47 keV emission line. A model comprising of an absorbed power law with high energy cutoff plus a partial covering absorber and Gaussian emission line also fits the spectrum quite well. These results have been compared with timing and spectral features during the previous outbursts of this transient pulsar.</description>

      <title>Type Ia Supernovae From The First Generation Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered at redshift $z\lesssim2.5$ are presumed to be produced from Population (Pop) I/II stars. {In this work, we investigate the production of SNe Ia from Pop III binaries in the cosmological framework. We derive the SN Ia rate as a function of redshift under a theoretical context for the production of first generation stars and emanate the likelihood of their detection by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).} {Assuming the initial stellar mass function (IMF) favors low-mass stars as from recent numerical simulations, we found Pop III stars may give rise to a considerable amount of SNe Ia at high redshift and Pop III stars may even be the dominant SN Ia producer at z $\gtrsim 6$.} {In an optimistic scenario, we expect $\sim 1(2)$ SNe Ia from Pop III stars at $z\approx 4(5)$ for a survey of area $300 \;\rm arcmin^2$ during a $3\;\rm yr$ period with JWST. The same survey may record more than $\sim 400$ SNe Ia at lower redshift ($z\lesssim 2.5$) but with only about one of them from Pop III progenitors. There will be $\sim 6$ Pop III SNe Ia in the same field of view at redshifts of $5-10$.} Observational constraints on SN Ia rates at the redshift range of $5-10$ can place crucial constraints on the IMF of Pop III stars.</description>

      <title>Filamentary mass accretion towards the high-mass protobinary system G11.92-0.61 MM2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present deep, sub-arcsecond ($\sim$2000 AU) resolution ALMA 0.82 mm observations of the former high-mass prestellar core candidate G11.92-0.61 MM2, recently shown to be an $\sim$500 AU-separation protobinary. Our observations show that G11.92-0.61 MM2, located in the G11.92-0.61 protocluster, lies on a filamentary structure traced by 0.82 mm continuum and N$_2$H$^+$(4-3) emission. The N$_2$H$^+$(4-3) spectra are multi-peaked, indicative of multiple velocity components along the line of sight. To analyse the gas kinematics, we performed pixel-by-pixel Gaussian decomposition of the N$_2$H$^+$ spectra using SCOUSEPY and hierarchical clustering of the extracted velocity components using ACORNS. Seventy velocity- and position-coherent clusters (called "trees") are identified in the N$_2$H$^+$-emitting gas, with the 8 largest trees accounting for &gt;60% of the fitted velocity components. The primary tree, with $\sim$20% of the fitted velocity components, displays a roughly north-south velocity gradient along the filamentary structure traced by the 0.82 mm continuum. Analysing a $\sim$0.17 pc-long substructure, we interpret its velocity gradient of $\sim$10.5 km s$^{-1}$pc$^{-1}$ as tracing filamentary accretion towards MM2 and estimate a mass inflow rate of $\sim$1.8$\times10^{-4}$ to 1.2$\times10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Based on the recent detection of a bipolar molecular outflow associated with MM2, accretion onto the protobinary is ongoing, likely fed by the larger-scale filamentary accretion flows. If 50% of the filamentary inflow reaches the protostars, each member of the protobinary would attain a mass of 8 M$_\odot$ within $\sim1.6\times$10$^5$ yr, comparable to the combined timescale of the 70 $\mu$m- and MIR-weak phases derived for ATLASGAL-TOP100 massive clumps using chemical clocks.</description>

      <title>JOYS+: link between ice and gas of complex organic molecules. Comparing JWST and ALMA data of two low-mass protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rich inventory of complex organic molecules (COMs) has been observed in high abundances in the gas phase toward Class 0 protostars. These molecules are suggested to be formed in ices and sublimate in the warm inner envelope close to the protostar. However, only the most abundant COM, methanol (CH3OH), has been firmly detected in ices before the era of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Now it is possible to detect the interstellar ices of other COMs and constrain their ice column densities quantitatively. We aim to determine the column densities of several oxygen-bearing COMs (O-COMs) in both gas and ice for two low-mass protostellar sources, NGC 1333 IRAS 2A and B1-c, as case studies in our JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS+) program. By comparing the column density ratios w.r.t. CH3OH between both phases measured in the same sources, we can probe into the evolution of COMs from ice to gas in the early stages of star formation. We are able to fit the fingerprints range of COM ices between 6.8 and 8.8 um in the JWST/MIRI-MRS spectra of B1-c using similar components as recently used for IRAS 2A. We claim detection of CH4, OCN-, HCOO-, HCOOH, CH3CHO, C2H5OH, CH3OCH3, CH3OCHO, and CH3COCH3 in B1-c, and upper limits are estimated for SO2, CH3COOH, and CH3CN. The comparison of O-COM ratios w.r.t CH3OH between ice and gas shows two different cases. 1) the column density ratios of CH3OCHO and CH3OCH3 match well between the two phases, which may be attributed to a direct inheritance from ice to gas or strong chemical links with CH3OH. 2) the ice ratios of CH3CHO and C2H5OH w.r.t. CH3OH are higher than the gas ratios by 1-2 orders of magnitudes. This difference can be explained by the gas-phase reprocessing following sublimation, or different spatial distributions of COMs in the envelope.</description>

      <title>$I$-Love-$Q$, and $\delta M$ too: The role of the mass in universal relations of compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of rotating neutron stars the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations refer to the existence of various approximate, equation of state-independent relations involving the moment of inertia, the Love number and the quadrupole moment. These relations are relevant for observational astrophysics, since they allow (in theory) the inference of any two quantities within the $I$-Love-$Q$ triad out of the third one alone. However, the quantities involved in the relations are, in fact, normalized by a parameter $M_0$ that arises in the usual perturbative analytical approach as the mass of the background configuration. Since $M_0$ is not the mass of the rotating star $M_S$, it is not an observational quantity, which may affect the application of the relations to actual observations. This situation is usually ignored in most studies by taking $M_0$ to be the mass of the star, an approximation that can, in some cases, be inconsistent. In this paper we extract the value of $M_0$ using an $\textit{extended}$ version of the universal relations that involve a fourth parameter, $\delta M$, proportional to the difference $M_S-M_0$. We analyze to which degree this extended set of relations yields a more precise inference of compact star properties and equation of state parameters.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Grain Alignment by Magnetically Enhanced Radiative Torques from Multiwavelength Dust Polarization Modeling of HL Tau</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionized the field of dust polarization in protoplanetary disks across multiple wavelengths. Previous observations and empirical modeling suggested multiple mechanisms of dust polarization toward HL Tau, including grain alignment and dust scattering. However, a detailed modeling of dust polarization based on grain alignment physics is not yet available. Here, using our updated POLARIS code, we perform numerical modeling of dust polarization arising from both grain alignment by Magnetically Enhanced Radiative Torque (MRAT) mechanism and self-scattering to reproduce the HL Tau polarization observed at three wavelengths 0.87, 1.3, and 3.1$\,$mm. Our modeling results show that the observed multi-wavelength polarization could be reproduced only when large grains contain embedded iron inclusions and those with slow internal relaxation must have wrong internal alignment (i.e., the grain's major axis parallel to its angular momentum). The abundance of iron embedded inside grains in the form of clusters is constrained to be $\gtrsim 16$%, and the number of iron atoms per cluster is $N_{\rm cl} \sim 9\times10^2$. Maximum grain sizes probed at wavelengths $\lambda$ = 0.87, 1.3, and 3.1$\,$mm are constrained at $\sim$ 60, 80, and 90$\,\mu$m, respectively.</description>

      <title>Solar rotation and activity for cycle 24 from SDO/AIA observations</title>

Abstract: The differential rotation plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the Sun. We study the solar rotation and its correlation with solar activity by applying a modified machine learning algorithm to identify and track coronal bright points (CBPs) from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly observations at 193 \AA\ during cycle 24. For more than 321,440 CBPs, the sidereal and meridional velocities are computed. We find the occurring height of CBPs about 5627 km above the photosphere. We obtain a rotational map for the corona by tracking CBPs at the formation height of Fe\,{\sc xii} (193 \AA) emissions. The equator rotation (14.$^{\circ}$40 to 14.$^{\circ}$54 day$^{-1}$) and latitudinal gradient of rotation ($ - $3.$^{\circ}$0 to $ - $2.$^{\circ}$64 day$^{-1}$) show very slightly positive and negative trends with solar activity (sunspots and flares), respectively. For cycle 24, our investigations show that the northern hemisphere has more differential rotation than the southern hemisphere, confirmed by the asymmetry of the midlatitude rotation parameter. The asymmetry (ranked) of the latitudinal gradient of the rotation parameter is concordant with the sunspot numbers for 7 yr within the 9 yr of the cycle; however, for only 3 yr, it is concordant with the flare index. The minimum horizontal Reynolds stress changes from about $ - $2500 m$^{2}$ s$^{-2}$ (corresponding to high activity) in 2012 and 2014 to $ - $100 m$^{2}$ s$^{-2}$ (corresponding to low activity) in 2019 over 5$^{\circ}$ to 35$^{\circ}$ latitudes within cycle 24. We conclude that the negative horizontal Reynolds stress (momentum transfer toward the Sun's equator) is a helpful indication of solar activity.</description>

Abstract: We present an eigenfunction method to analyze 161 visual light curves (LCs) of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained by the Carnegie Supernova Project to characterize their diversity and host-galaxy correlations. The eigenfunctions are based on the delayed-detonation scenario using three parameters: the LC stretch being determined by the amount of deflagration-burning governing the 56Ni production, the main-sequence mass M_MS of the progenitor white dwarf controlling the explosion energy, and its central density rho_c shifting the 56Ni distribution. Our analysis tool (SPAT) extracts the parameters from observations and projects them into physical space using their allowed ranges M_MS &lt; 8 M_sun, rho_c &lt; 7-8x10^9g/cc. The residuals between fits and individual LC-points are ~ 1-3% for ~ 92% of objects. We find two distinct M_MS groups corresponding to a fast (~ 40-65 Myrs) and a slow(~ 200-500 Myrs) stellar evolution. Most underluminous SNe Ia have hosts with low star formation but high M_MS, suggesting slow evolution times of the progenitor system. 91T-likes SNe show very similar LCs and high M_MS and are correlated to star formation regions, making them potentially important tracers of star formation in the early Universe out to z = 4-11. Some 6% outliers with `non-physical' parameters can be attributed to superluminous SNe Ia and subluminous SNe Ia with hosts of active star formation. For deciphering the SNe Ia diversity and high-precision SNe Ia cosmology, the importance is shown for LCs covering out to ~ 60 days past maximum. Finally, our method and results are discussed within the framework of multiple explosion scenarios, and in light of upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Mass and wind luminosity of young Galactic open clusters in Gaia DR2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Star clusters constitute a significant part of the stellar population in our Galaxy. The feedback processes they exert on the interstellar medium impact multiple physical processes from the chemical to the dynamical evolution of the Galaxy. In addition, young and massive stellar clusters might act as efficient particle accelerators and contribute to the production of cosmic rays. Aims. We aim at evaluating the wind luminosity driven by the young (&lt; 30 Myr) Galactic open stellar clusters observed by the Gaia space mission. This is crucial for determining the energy channeled into accelerated particles. Methods. To do this, we developed a method relying on the number, magnitude, and line-of-sight extinction of the stars observed per cluster. Assuming that the stellar mass function follows a Kroupa mass distribution and accounting for the maximum stellar mass allowed by the age and mass of the parent cluster, we conservatively estimated the mass and wind luminosity of 387 local clusters within the second data release of Gaia. Results. We compared the results of our computation with recent estimates of young cluster masses. With respect to these, our sample is three times more abundant, particularly above a few thousand solar masses. This is of the utmost relevance for predicting the gamma-ray emission resulting from the interaction of accelerated particles. The cluster wind luminosity distribution we obtained extends up to 3x10^38 erg/s. This is a promising feature in terms of potential particle acceleration scenarios.</description>

      <title>Stellar $\beta$-decay rate of $s$-process branching-point $^{204}$Tl: forbidden transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical method to calculate the stellar $\beta$-decay rates of nuclei in stellar environments with high temperature and density, based on the projected shell model, where contributions from both allowed and first-forbidden transitions are taken into account. As the first example, the stellar $\beta$-decay rate of one of the last $s$-process branching-point nuclei, $^{204}$Tl, is calculated and studied, where all related transitions are first-forbidden transitions. For the terrestrial case, the ground-state to ground-state transition is unique first-forbidden transition, which is described reasonably by our calculations. At the typical $s$-process temperature ($T\approx 0.3$ GK), non-unique first-forbidden transitions from thermally populated excited states of the parent nucleus are involved, the effective rate from our calculations is much lower than the one from the widely used data tables by Takahashi and Yokoi. Effect of the quenching factors for nuclear matrix elements in first-forbidden transitions on the stellar $\beta$-decay rates is discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-Neutron Scattering Opacities in Supernova Matter</title>

Abstract: We compute the static density and spin structure factors in the long wavelength limit for pure neutron matter at subsaturation densities relevant to core-collapse supernovae within the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) approach. The BHF results are reliable at high densities, extending beyond the validity of the virial expansion. Motivated by the similarities between the dilute neutron gas and a unitary gas, we propose a phenomenological approach to derive the static structures with finite momentum transfer as well as the dynamic ones with simple analytical expressions, based on the computed static structures in the long wavelength limit. We also compare the in-medium neutrino-neutron scattering cross sections using different structure factors. Our study emphasizes the importance of accurately computing the static structure factors theoretically and utilizing the full dynamic structure factors in core-collapse supernova simulations.</description>

      <title>Diamond phase in space and the possibility of its spectroscopic detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eventual presence of the diamond carbon allotrope in space is discussed in numerous theoretical and experimental studies. The review summarizes the principal mechanisms of nanodiamond formation and experimental results of spectroscopic and structural investigations of nano- and microdiamonds from meteorites. The size dependence of diamond spectroscopic properties is discussed. Infrared spectroscopy allows detection of C-H bonds on surfaces of hot nanodiamond grains. Spectroscopic observation of nitrogen-related point defects in nanodiamonds is very challenging; moreover, such defects have never been observed in nanodiamonds from meteorites. At the same time, photoluminescence and, eventually, absorption of some impurity-related defects, in particular, of the silicon-vacancy (SiV) center, observed in real meteoritic nanodiamonds opens the possibility of diamond detection in astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Constraining Wind-Driven Accretion Onto Gaia BH3 With Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07602</link>

Abstract: Gaia BH3 is the most massive known stellar-origin black hole in the Milky Way, with a mass $M_\bullet \approx 33 \, \rm M_\odot$. Detected from Gaia's astrometry, this black hole is in the mass range of those observed via gravitational waves, whose nature is still highly debated. Hosted in a binary system with a companion giant star that is too far away for Roche-lobe mass transfer, this black hole could nonetheless accrete at low levels due to wind-driven mass-loss from its companion star, thus accreting in advection-dominated accretion flow, or ADAF, mode. Using stellar wind models, we constrain its Eddington ratio in the range $10^{-9} &lt; f_{\rm Edd} &lt; 10^{-7}$, corresponding to radiative efficiencies $5\times10^{-5} &lt; \epsilon &lt; 10^{-3}$, compatible with radiatively inefficient accretion modes. Chandra ACIS-S observed this object and obtained the most sensitive upper bound of its [2-10] keV flux: $F_X &lt; 3.25 \times 10^{-15} \, \rm erg \, s^{-1} \, cm^{-2}$ at $90\%$ confidence level corresponding to $L_{[2-10]}&lt; 2.10 \times 10^{29} \, \rm erg \, s^{-1}$. Using ADAF emission models, we constrained its accretion rate to $f_{\rm Edd}&lt; 4.91 \times 10^{-7}$ at the apastron, in agreement with our theoretical estimate. At the periastron, we expect fluxes $\sim 50$ times larger. Because of the inferred low rates, accretion did not significantly contribute to black hole growth over the system's lifetime. Detecting the electromagnetic emission from Gaia BH3 will be fundamental to informing stellar wind and accretion disk models.</description>

      <title>Irradiation effect and binary radio pulsars with giant companions</title>

Abstract: Pulsars are neutron stars that rotate rapidly. Most of the pulsars in binary systems tend to spin faster than those in isolation. According to binary evolution theory, radio pulsars in binary systems can have various types of companion stars. However, binary radio pulsars with giant stars, helium stars, and black holes as companions are lacking so far. We aim to investigate the possible parameter space of binary radio pulsars with giant companions. We used the MESA stellar evolution code to consider the effect of irradiation in binary evolution and evolved a series of binary models. We present the potential physical properties of binary radio pulsars with giant star companions in the framework of the classical recycling scenario and the irradiation model. We found that the parameter space of binary radio pulsars with giant companions can be greatly expanded by the effect of irradiation. Moreover, when irradiation is strong enough, submillisecond pulsars might be accompanied by giant companion stars. We also demonstrate a correlation between the timescale of the binary system as a low-mass X-ray binary and the irradiation efficiency. The birthrate problem between millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries might not be resolved by the irradiation effect. A more detailed binary population synthesis is necessary. Our findings may offer guidance for observers that wish to locate binary radio pulsars with giant companions or submillisecond pulsars.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of exocomet transits: Insights from \{beta} Pic and KIC 3542116</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the topic of existence and exploration of exocomets has been gaining increasing attention. The asymmetrical decrease in the stellar brightness due to the passage of a comet-like object in front of the star was successfully predicted. It was subsequently confirmed on the basis of the light curves of stars observed by Kepler and TESS orbital telescopes. Since then, there have been successful attempts to fit the asymmetrical dips observed in the stellar light curves utilizing a simple 1D model of an exponentially decaying optically thin dust tail. In this work, we propose fitting the photometric profiles of some known exocomet transits based on a Monte Carlo approach to build up the distribution of dust particles in a cometary tail. As the exocomet prototypes, we used the physical properties of certain Solar System comets belonging to the different dynamical groups and moving at heliocentric distances of 0.6 au, 1.0 au, 5.0 au, and 5.5 au. We obtained a good agreement between the observed and modeled transit light curves. We also show that the physical characteristics of dust particles, such as the particle size range, the power index of dust size distribution, the particle terminal velocity, and distance to the host star affect the shape of the transit light curve, while the dust productivity of the comet nucleus and the impact parameter influence its depth and duration. The estimated dust production rates of the transiting exocomets are at the level of the most active Solar System comets.</description>
