      <title>New approach to affine Moser-Trudinger inequalities via Besov polar projection bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the affine inequalities on $\mathbb{R}^n$ for Sobolev functions in $W^{s,p}$ with $1 \leq p &lt; n/s$ obtained recently by Haddad-Ludwig [16, 17] to the remaining range $p \geq n/s$. For each value of $s$, our results are stronger than affine Moser-Trudinger and Morrey inequalities. As a byproduct, we establish the analog of the classical $L^p$ Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu inequalities related to the Moser-Trudinger case $p=n$. Our main tool is the affine invariant provided by Besov polar projection bodies.</description>

      <title>Definitions of quasiconformality on metric surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the interplay between different definitions of distortion for mappings $f\colon X\to \mathbb{R}^2$, where $X$ is any metric surface, meaning that $X$ is homeomorphic to a domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and has locally finite 2-dimensional Hausdorff measure. We establish that finite distortion in terms of the familiar analytic definition always implies finite distortion in terms of maximal and minimal stretchings along paths. The converse holds for maps with locally integrable distortion. In particular, we prove the equivalence of various notions of quasiconformality, implying a novel uniformization result for metric surfaces.</description>

      <title>Sharp estimates for the Cram\'{e}r transform of log-concave measures and geometric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a new comparison between the Legendre transform of the cumulant generating function and the half-space depth of an arbitrary log-concave probability distribution on the real line, that carries on to the multidimensional setting. Combined with sharp estimates for the Cram\'{e}r transform of rotationally invariant measures, we are led to some new phase-transition type results for the asymptotics of the expected measure of random polytopes. As a byproduct of our analysis, we address a question on the sharp exponential separability constant for log-concave distributions, in the symmetric case.</description>

      <title>Separation axiom $S_3$ for geodesic convexity in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semispaces of a convexity space $(X,C)$ are maximal convex sets missing a point. The separation axiom $S_3$ asserts that any point $x_0\in X$ and any convex set $A$ not containing $x_0$ can be separated by complementary halfspaces (convex sets with convex complements) or, equivalently, that all semispaces are halfspaces. In this paper, we study $S_3$ for geodesic convexity in graphs and the structure of semispaces in $S_3$-graphs. We characterize $S_3$-graphs and their semispaces in terms of separation by halfspaces of vertices $x_0$ and special sets, called maximal $x_0$-proximal sets and in terms of convexity of their mutual shadows $x_0/K$ and $K/x_0$. In $S_3$-graphs $G$ satisfying the triangle condition (TC), maximal proximal sets are the pre-maximal cliques of $G$ (i.e., cliques $K$ such that $K\cup\{ x_0\}$ are maximal cliques). This allows to characterize the $S_3$-graphs satisfying (TC) in a structural way and to enumerate their semispaces efficiently. In case of meshed graphs (an important subclass of graphs satisfying (TC)), the $S_3$-graphs have been characterized by excluding five forbidden subgraphs. On the way of proving this result, we also establish some properties of meshed graphs, which maybe of independent interest. In particular, we show that any connected, locally-convex set of a meshed graph is convex. We also provide several examples of $S_3$-graphs, including the basis graphs of matroids. Finally, we consider the (NP-complete) halfspace separation problem, describe two methods of its solution, and apply them to particular classes of graphs and graph-convexities.</description>

      <title>Finitely generated groups and harmonic functions of slow growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are mainly concerned with $(\mathbb{G},\mu)$-harmonic functions that grow at most polynomially, where $\mathbb{G}$ is a finitely generated group with a probability measure $\mu$. In the initial part of the paper, we focus on Lipschitz harmonic functions and how they descend onto finite index subgroups. We discuss the relations between Lipschitz harmonic functions and harmonic functions of linear growth and conclude that for groups of polynomial growth, they coincide. In the latter part of the paper, we specialise to positive harmonic functions and give a characterisation for strong Liouville property in terms of the Green's function. We show that the existence of a non-constant positive harmonic function of polynomial growth guarantees that the group cannot have polynomial growth.</description>

      <title>New lower bound on ball packing density in high-dimensional hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new lower bound on the Bowen-Radin maximal density of radius-R ball packings in the m-dimensional hyperbolic space, improving on the basic covering bound by factor \Omega(m(R+\ln m)) as m tends to infinity. This is done by applying the recent theorem of Campos, Jenssen, Michelen and Sahasrabudhe on independent sets in graphs with sparse neighbourhoods.</description>

      <title>Stability of polydisc slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a dimension-free stability result for polydisc slicing due to Oleszkiewicz and Pelczy\'nski (2000). Intriguingly, compared to the real case, there is an additional asymptotic maximiser. In addition to Fourier-analytic bounds, we crucially rely on a self-improving feature of polydisc slicing, established via probabilistic arguments.</description>

      <title>Magnitude function determines generic finite metric spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00786v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give sufficient conditions for a finite metric space to be determined by the magnitude function. In particular, a generic finite metric space such that the distances between the points are rationally independent is determined by the asymptotic behavior of the magnitude function.</description>

      <title>Applications of equidistant supporting surfaces of a convex body in the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a hyperplane $H$ supporting a convex body $C$ in the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^d$ we define the width of $C$ determined by $H$ as the distance between $H$ and a most distant ultraparallel hyperplane supporting $C$. The thickness (i.e., the minimum width) of $C$ is denoted by $\Delta(C)$. A convex body $R \subset \mathbb{H}^d$ is called reduced if for every body $Z \subsetneq R$ we have $\Delta(Z) &lt; \Delta(R)$. We show that for any extreme point $e$ of a reduced body $R \subset \mathbb{H}^d$ there exists a supporting hyperplane $H$ of $R$ which passes through $e$ or its equidistant surface supporting $R$ passes through $e$. Bodies of constant width in $\mathbb{H}^d$ are defined as bodies whose all widths are equal. We prove that every complete body in $\mathbb{H}^d$ is a body of constant width.</description>

      <title>Intermediate dimensions of Bedford-McMullen carpets with applications to Lipschitz equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.05625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intermediate dimensions were recently introduced to provide a spectrum of dimensions interpolating between Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions for fractals where these differ. In particular, the self-affine Bedford-McMullen carpets are a natural case for investigation, but until now only very rough bounds for their intermediate dimensions have been found. In this paper, we determine a precise formula for the intermediate dimensions $\dim_{\, \theta}\Lambda$ of any Bedford-McMullen carpet $\Lambda$ for the whole spectrum of $\theta \in [0,1]$, in terms of a certain large deviations rate function. The intermediate dimensions exist and are strictly increasing in $\theta$, and the function $\theta\mapsto \dim_{\, \theta}\Lambda$ exhibits interesting features not witnessed on any previous example, such as having countably many phase transitions, between which it is analytic and strictly concave.
  We make an unexpected connection to multifractal analysis by showing that two carpets with non-uniform vertical fibres have equal intermediate dimensions if and only if the Hausdorff multifractal spectra of the uniform Bernoulli measures on the two carpets are equal. Since intermediate dimensions are bi-Lipschitz invariant, this shows that the equality of these multifractal spectra is a necessary condition for two such carpets to be Lipschitz equivalent.</description>

      <title>Existence theorem for sub-Lorentzian problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence theorem for longest paths in sub-Lorentzian problems, which generalizes the classical theorem for globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds. We specifically address the case of invariant structures on homogeneous spaces, as the conditions for the existence theorem in this case can be significantly simplified. In particular, it turns out that longest paths exist for any left-invariant sub-Lorentzian structures on Carnot groups.</description>
