      <title>PEPSI Investigation, Retrieval, and Atlas of Numerous Giant Atmospheres (PIRANGA). II. Phase-Resolved Cross-Correlation Transmission Spectroscopy of KELT-20b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KELT-20b is a well-studied exoplanet within the highly observable ultra hot Jupiter (UHJ) regime, yet its multidimensional atmospheric structure remains largely unconstrained. Recent advances in instrumentation and increased general circulation model (GCM) complexity have enabled observers to resolve the imprints of more intricate physical mechanisms in time-resolved data. We performed high-resolution cross-correlation transmission spectroscopy (HRCCTS) on a single transit time series of KELT-20b, observed with PEPSI on the LBT. We detect Fe I $(11.9\sigma)$ and Fe II $(23.7\sigma)$ and tentatively detect Na I $(3.4\sigma)$ and Cr I $(3.3\sigma)$ upon combining nineteen in-transit exposures. The full-transit velocity offsets of the strongest absorbers are $\Delta V_{\text{Fe I}} = -1.0 \pm 0.7$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\Delta V_{\text{Fe II}}= 0.0\pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$. These results are discrepant with other HRCCTS studies of KELT-20b, but these studies are largely inconsistent with each other due to multiple possible factors, including self-inconsistent treatment of systemic velocity. In response, we establish a stringent set of detection criteria to promote reproducibility in future works. We present phase-resolved absorption traces of species with high detection significance. Fe I and Fe II's absorption traces are both redshifted at ingress, cross to a blueshift after mid-transit, then settle at a net blueshift at egress; concurrently, SNR increases with phase. This behavior is consistent with absorption traces post-processed from an active magnetic drag GCM for another UHJ. However, the net blueshift during transit could also result from limb asymmetry drivers and/or longitudinally variable wind structure. This ambiguity motivates future theoretical work on KELT-20b.</description>

      <title>PEPSI Investigation, Retrieval, and Atlas of Numerous Giant Atmospheres (PIRANGA). III. Composition and winds in the atmosphere of TOI-1518 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) orbit close to their host stars and experience extreme conditions, making them important laboratories to explore atmospheric composition and dynamics. Transmission spectroscopy is a useful tool to reveal chemical species and their vertical and longitudinal distribution in the atmosphere. We use transmission spectra from the PEPSI spectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope to search for species and measure their time-resolved wind velocities in the atmosphere of TOI-1518 b. We detect Fe I at 7.8$\sigma$ and Fe II at 8.9$\sigma$, and tentatively detect Cr I at 4.4$\sigma$ and Ni I at 4.0$\sigma$. The time-resolved wind velocities of Fe I show a velocity pattern that is consistent with the velocity pattern of Fe II. TOI-1518 b joins a small sample of UHJs for which time-resolved wind velocities have been measured.</description>

      <title>Increasing Determinism of All-vs-all Orbital Evolution Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-vs-all orbital evolutionary simulations for the low Earth orbit (LEO) simulate the long term evolution of the LEO environment. Although these simulations typically offer the highest fidelity, they are also highly computationally intensive. One factor that effectively reduces the efficiency of the approach is that all-vs-all approaches are stochastic and the distribution of the output has large variance. This paper introduces a new, quasi-deterministic all-vs-all simulator, whose variance is greatly reduced compared to traditional methods. The proposed approach virtually simulates collisions happening everywhere and all the time; however, their effect is appropriately reduced to maintain an unbiased estimate of the mean. Additional techniques are used to augment the proposed approach and obtain very precise estimates of any number of standard deviations from the mean, for the evaluation of the Value at Risk (VaR) with a single, low-variance run. Depending on the settings, results show that the variance in total number of debris generated can be reduced by a factor that averages 1,500, while increasing the computational cost by a factor of less than 1.5. Variance can be reduced even more when computing the VaR, albeit a no longer negligible bias is introduced. Low-variance results enable several key applications, such as sensitivity analysis, sustainability assessment of small missions, and fast evaluation of collision risk induced by existing debris. Additionally, rapid computations of the VaR can improve the evaluation of policy robustness, and include confidence intervals in risk assessment.</description>

      <title>Four sub-Earth planets orbiting Barnard's Star from MAROON-X and ESPRESSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barnard's Star is an old, single M dwarf star that comprises the second-closest extrasolar system. It has a long history of claimed planet detections from both radial velocities and astrometry. However, none of these claimed detections have so far withstood further scrutiny. Continuing this story, extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) measurements from the ESPRESSO instrument have recently been used to identify four new sub-Earth-mass planet candidates around Barnard's Star. We present here 112 radial velocities of Barnard's Star from the MAROON-X instrument that were obtained independently to search for planets around this compelling object. The data have a typical precision of 30\,cm\,s$^{-1}$ and are contemporaneous with the published ESPRESSO measurements (2021 -- 2023). The MAROON-X data on their own confirm planet b ($P$\,=\,3.154\,d) and planet candidates c and d ($P$\,=\,4.124\,d and 2.340\,d, respectively). Furthermore, adding the MAROON-X data to the ESPRESSO data strengthens the evidence for planet candidate e ($P$\,=\,6.739\,d), thus leading to its confirmation. The signals from all four planets are $&lt;$50\,cm\,s$^{-1}$, the minimum masses of the planets range from 0.19 to 0.34\,$M_{\oplus}$, and the system is among the most compact known among late M dwarfs hosting low-mass planets. The current data rule out planets with masses $&gt;0.57\,M_{\oplus}$ (with a $99\%$ detection probability) in Barnard Star's habitable zone ($P$\,=\,10 -- 42\,d).</description>

      <title>Secondary impact debris in the Didymos system: what could be observed by Hera?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of low--velocity impacts of rocks and boulders, originally released after the DART impact, on the surface of Didymos and the dynamics of dust particles released by those impacts. We determine if any of those effects can be observed by the Hera mission. The iSALE-2D shock physics code was used to simulate the re-impacts of boulders on the surface of the asteroid. To model the dynamics of the boulders, we used a numerical model that includes the gravity of non-spherical Didymos and Dimorphos, the solar gravity, and the radiation pressure. The sesquinary impacts can result in small, shallow craters on the surface of Didymos. For the given low impact speeds, the ejected mass depends mostly on the boulder mass. Ejection speeds range from 10 \% to 80 \% of the impact speed. The majority of the ejected dust falls back covering a large area of the surface, mostly at low/medium latitudes. Less than 20 \% of the ejected dust is escaping the system after a few days. The space surrounding the asteroids becomes free from dust after 15-30 days following each sesquinary impact. Results.

      <title>Precise Parameters from Bayesian SED Fitting Indicate Thermally-Driven Mass Loss Likely Driver of Radius Valley</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several planet formation models have been proposed to explain the gap in the population of planets between $1.8$ $R_\oplus$ to $2.0$ $R_\oplus$ known as the Radius Valley. To apply these models to confirmed exoplanets, accurate and precise host star and planet parameters are required to ensure the observed measurements correctly match model predictions. Previous studies have emphasized the need for a larger, more precise sample to further confirm dominant formation processes. By enhancing standard SED (Spectral Energy Distribution) fitting using Bayesian methods we derived highly accurate and precise host star and planet parameters. Specifically, we achieved median fractional uncertainties for stellar and planet radii of 2.4% and 3.4%, respectively. We then produced the largest, most precise sample to date of 1923 planets when compared to previous studies. This full sample, as well as a sampled filtered for host stellar masses between $0.8$ and $1.2$ $M_\odot$, are then used to derive the slope and position of the radius valley as a function of orbital period, insolation flux and stellar mass to compare them to predictive models and previous observational results. Our results are consistent with thermally-driven mass loss with a planet radius vs. orbital period slope of $-0.142$ $\pm0.006$ for the full sample leaning toward core-powered mass loss. The planet radius vs. insolation flux slope of $0.136$ $\pm0.014$ for the filtered sample leaned toward photoevaporation. Also, the slope as a function of stellar mass for both samples appear more consistent with thermally driven processes when compared to models and previous studies.</description>

      <title>HADES RV Programme with HARPS-N at TNG. XVI. A super-Earth in the habitable zone of the GJ 3998 multi-planet system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low masses of M dwarfs create attractive opportunities for exoplanet radial-velocity (RV) detections. These stars, however, exhibit strong stellar activity that may attenuate or mimic planetary signals. We present a velocimetric analysis on one such M dwarf, GJ 3998 ($d=18.2\,\text{pc}$), with two published short-period super-Earths: GJ 3998 b and GJ 3998 c. We use additional data from the HARPS-N spectrograph to confirm these two planets and to look for more. We carry out joint modelling of: (i) RV planetary signals, (ii) stellar rotation in RV and activity indicators through Gaussian processes, (iii) long-term trends in RV and activity indicators. We constrain the rotational period of GJ 3998 to $P_\text{rot}=30.2\pm 0.3\,\text{d}$ and discover long-term sinusoidal imprints in RV and FWHM of period $P_\text{cyc}=316^{+14}_{-8}\,\text{d}$. We confirm GJ 3998 b and GJ 3998 c, and detect a third planet: GJ 3998 d, whose signal had been previously attributed to stellar activity. GJ 3998 d has an orbital period of $41.78\pm 0.05\,\text{d}$, a minimum mass of $6.07^{+1.00}_{-0.96}\,\text{M}_\oplus$ and a mean insolation flux of $1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\,\Phi_\oplus$. This makes it one of the few known planets receiving Earth-like insolation flux.</description>

      <title>The Case for Edge-On Binaries: An Avenue Toward Comparative Exoplanet Demographics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most Sun-like and higher-mass stars reside in systems that include one or more gravitationally bound stellar companions. These systems offer an important probe of planet formation in the most common stellar systems, while also providing key insights into how gravitational perturbations and irradiation differences from a companion star alter the outcomes of planet formation. Recent dynamical clues have begun to emerge that reveal systematic, non-random structure in the configurations of many planet-hosting binary systems: in close- to moderate-separation ($s &lt; 800$ au) binary star systems, the orbits of exoplanets around individual stellar components are preferentially aligned with the orbital plane of their host stellar binary. In this work, we flip this narrative and search for nearby, edge-on binary star systems that, due to this preferential alignment, are top candidates for radial velocity and transiting exoplanet searches. We present a sample of 591 moderate-separation, relatively bright ($G &lt; 14$) Gaia-resolved binary star systems in likely near-edge-on configurations. Using a simulated population of exoplanets drawn from transit survey occurrence rate constraints, we provide an overview of the expected planet yields from a targeted search in these systems. We describe the opportunities for comparative exoplanet demographics in the case that both stars can be inferred to host edge-on planetary systems - a configuration toward which the presented sample may be biased, given recent observations of orbit-orbit alignment in exoplanet-hosting binary systems.</description>

      <title>There's more to life in reflected light: Simulating the detectability of a range of molecules for high-contrast, high-resolution observations of non-transiting terrestrial exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming extremely large telescopes will provide the first opportunity to search for signs of habitability and life on non-transiting terrestrial exoplanets using high-contrast, high-resolution instrumentation. However, the suite of atmospheric gases in terrestrial exoplanet environments that are accessible to ground-based reflected light observations has not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we use an upgraded Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) detectability pipeline to simulate the detectability of gases that can serve as habitability markers, potential biosignatures, and false positive discriminants in the atmospheres of Earth-sized and sub-Neptune planets. We calculate molecular detectability for five photochemically self-consistent atmosphere types, including the modern and Archean Earth, uninhabited biosignature ``false positive'' environments, and a sub-Neptune, over a grid of observational configurations for non-transiting targets within 10pc of Earth. For the most accessible nearby target, Proxima Centauri b, our results suggest that we may be able to rule out a sub-Neptune atmosphere in as little as a single hour of observing, and two biosignature disequilibrium pairs (O$_2$/CH$_4$ and CO$_2$/CH$_4$) may be accessible in $\sim 10$ hours for the most optimistic scenario. It may also be possible to discriminate uninhabited worlds, and rule out biosignature false positives by identifying contextual indicators (CO and H$_2$O) of abiotic O$_2$ and/or CH$_4$ buildup on similar timescales. In the near term, ELT reflected light observations will likely allow us to characterize multiple nearby terrestrial atmospheres, and ultimately search for signs of habitability and life.</description>

      <title>In Search of the Potentially Hazardous Asteroids in the Taurid Resonant Swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Taurid Complex is a large interplanetary system that contains comet 2P/Encke, several meteoroid streams, and possibly a number of near-Earth asteroids. The size and nature of the system has led to the speculation that it was formed through a large-scale cometary breakup. Numerical investigations have suggested that planetary dynamics can create a resonant region with a large number of objects concentrated in a small segment of the orbit, known as the Taurid swarm, which approaches the Earth in certain years and provides favorable conditions to study the Taurid Complex. Recent meteor observations confirmed the existence of the swarm for mm- to m-sized objects. Here we present a dedicated telescopic search for potentially hazardous asteroids and other macroscopic objects in the Taurid swarm using the Zwicky Transient Facility survey. We determine from our non-detection that there are no more than 9--14 $H\leq24$ (equivalent to a diameter of $D\gtrsim100$~m) objects in the swarm, suggesting that the Encke--Taurid progenitor was $\sim10$~km in size. A progenitor of such a size is compatible with the prediction of state-of-the-art Solar System dynamical models, which expects $\sim0.1$ $D&gt;10$~km objects on Encke-like orbits at any given time.</description>

      <title>Effects of the Cosmic Neutrino Background Capture on Astrophysical Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-energy neutrinos from the cosmic background are captured by objects in the sky that contain material susceptible of single beta decay. Neutrons, which compose most of a neutron star, capture low-energy neutrinos from the cosmic neutrino background and release a high-energy electron in the MeV range. Also, planets contain unstable isotopes that capture the cosmic neutrinos. We show that this process is feasible and results in a non-negligible flux of electrons in the MeV range in neutron stars. We present a novel observable, the redshift evolution of the temperature of neutron stars due to neutrino capture, that could provide a route for detection of the cosmic neutrino background from future gravitational waves observatories. For planets the flux is significantly smaller and a measurement is not possible with currently envisioned technology. While the signature from neutron stars is small and challenging, it could result in a novel way to detect the cosmic neutrino background.</description>

PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.</description>

      <title>The Gaia Ultracool Dwarf Sample -- VI. Spectral Types and Properties of 51 Ultracool Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-infrared spectra from the IRTF/SpeX and Blanco/ARCoIRIS telescope/instrument combinations are used for spectroscopic classification, to measure radial velocities and for the inference of astrophysical properties of 51 Gaia-selected nearby ultracool dwarfs. In this sample, 44 are newly classified in the near infrared. All but one of the UCDs are within 100 pc, and 37 lie within 50 pc. We find a total of 26 M-types, 24 L-types and one T-type in our sample. The positions of the majority of the UCDs on colour-magnitude diagrams and with evolutionary cooling track plots indicate that they are largely old and stellar in nature. There are a few UCDs of particular interest which lie away from expected trends, highlighting potential young, binary and thick disc/subdwarf UCDs. From spectral and kinematic analyses, we identify UCDs of particular interest for further investigation, including seven potentially young UCDs, three thick disc UCDs, one subdwarf, six wide binaries, and six unresolved binaries.</description>

      <title>T CrA has a companion: First direct detection of T CrA B with VLTI/MATISSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: T CrA is a Herbig Ae-type young star in a complex circumstellar environment; it includes a circumstellar disk, accretion streamers, jets, and outflows. It has long been suspected to be a binary. However, until now, there has been no direct detection of a companion. Here we present new VLTI/MATISSE L- and N-band observations of T CrA taken between 2023 May and 2024 August with the aim of testing the binary nature of the system. We modeled the data with a geometric model using the Python tool oimodeler. We detected a companion (T CrA B) with a projected separation of $\Delta r = 153.2 \pm 1.2$ mas ($\approx 23$ au) toward the west direction at a position angle of $275.4 \pm 0.1^\circ$, in 2024 May-August. Our results support that the companion has a nearly edge-on orbit that is highly misaligned with respect to the circumprimary disk. Such a configuration could cause warping and tearing of the disk around the primary, which has been proposed by recent studies. In the L band the companion is extended, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) size of $\sim 1$ au, suggesting that the emission comes from a disk around the secondary star. The companion flux is 0.2-0.3 Jy in the L band, and 0.2-0.7 Jy in the N band, accounting for 4-20% of the total emission at those wavelengths. The SED of the companion is compatible with thermal radiation of warm dust (600-800 K).</description>

      <title>PEPSI Investigation, Retrieval, and Atlas of Numerous Giant Atmospheres (PIRANGA). I. The Ubiquity of Fe I Emission and Inversions in Ultra Hot Jupiter Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high-resolution optical emission spectroscopy observations of the ultra hot Jupiters (UHJs) TOI-1431 b and TOI-1518 b using the PEPSI spectrograph on the LBT. We detect emission lines from Fe I with a significance of 5.68 $\sigma$ and 7.68 $\sigma$ for TOI 1431 b and TOI-1518 b, respectively. We also tentatively detect Cr I emission from TOI-1431 b at $4.32\sigma$. For TOI-1518 b, we tentatively detect Ni I, Fe II, and Mg I at significance levels ranging from $3-4\sigma$. Detection of emission lines indicates that both planets possess temperature inversions in their atmospheres, providing further evidence of the ubiquity of stratospheres among UHJs. By analyzing the population of hot Jupiters, we compare models that predict the distribution of planets in the temperature-gravity space, and find a recent global circulation model suite from Roth et al. (2024) provides a reasonable match to the observed onset of inversions at $T_{\mathrm{eq}}\sim2000$ K. The ubiquity of strong Fe I emission lines among UHJs, together with the paucity of detections of TiO, suggest that atomic iron is the dominant optical opacity source in their atmospheres and can be responsible for the inversions.</description>

      <title>A Disintegrating Rocky Planet with Prominent Comet-like Tails Around a Bright Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of BD+05$\,$4868$\,$Ab, a transiting exoplanet orbiting a bright ($V=10.16$) K-dwarf (TIC 466376085) with a period of 1.27 days. Observations from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) reveal variable transit depths and asymmetric transit profiles that are characteristic of comet-like tails formed by dusty effluents emanating from a disintegrating planet. Unique to BD+05$\,$4868$\,$Ab is the presence of prominent dust tails in both the trailing and leading directions that contribute to the extinction of starlight from the host star. By fitting the observed transit profile and analytically modeling the drift of dust grains within both dust tails, we infer large grain sizes ($\sim1-10\,\mu$m) and a mass loss rate of $10\,M_{\rm \oplus}\,$Gyr$^{-1}$, suggestive of a lunar-mass object with a disintegration timescale of only several Myr. The host star is probably older than the Sun and is accompanied by an M-dwarf companion at a projected physical separation of 130 AU. The brightness of the host star, combined with the planet's relatively deep transits ($0.8-2.0\%$), presents BD+05$\,$4868$\,$Ab as a prime target for compositional studies of rocky exoplanets and investigations into the nature of catastrophically evaporating planets.</description>

      <title>Extension of the creep tide theory to exoplanet systems with high stellar obliquity. The dynamic tide of CoRoT-3b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the creep tide theory to exoplanetary systems with significant obliquities. The extended theory allows us to obtain the stellar and planetary hydrodynamic equilibrium tides and the evolution of the rotational state of the bodies. The dynamic ellipsoidal figure of equilibrium of the body is calculated taking into account that its reaction to external forces is delayed by its viscosity. The derived equations are used to determine the motion of the tidal bulge of the planetary companion CoRoT-3b (a brown dwarf) and its host star. We show how the tides deform the figure of the companion and how its tidal bulge moves close to the substellar meridian from one hemisphere to another. The stellar lag is mostly positive and is braking the star's rotation.</description>

      <title>Fluorescent Biomolecules Detectable in Near-Surface Ice on Europa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Europa, Jupiter's second Galilean moon, is believed to host a subsurface ocean in contact with a rocky mantle, where hydrothermal activity may drive the synthesis of organic molecules. Of these molecules, abiotic synthesis of aromatic amino acids is unlikely, and their detection on Europa could be considered a biosignature. Fluorescence from aromatic amino acids, with characteristic emissions in the 200-400 nanometer wavelength range, can be induced by a laser and may be detectable where ocean material has been relatively recently emplaced on Europa's surface, as indicated by geologically young terrain and surface features. However, surface bombardment by charged particles from the Jovian magnetosphere and solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation degrades organic molecules, limiting their longevity. We model radiolysis and photolysis of aromatic amino acids embedded in ice, showing dependencies on hemispheric and latitudinal patterns of charged particle bombardment and ice phase. We demonstrate that biosignatures contained within freshly deposited ice in high-latitude regions on the surface of Europa are detectable using laser-induced UV fluorescence, even from an orbiting spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Compilation of Technical Papers on ALMA Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02164v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is the world's leading instrument for high-resolution imaging of the 0.3 to 10 mm wavelength sky. This interferometer exemplifies successful international collaboration even down to its individual components, including its telescope dishes and receivers produced in global partnerships. Over the past roughly ten years of ALMA operation, these receivers have been responsible for nearly ten thousand publications, as carefully monitored by the online ALMA Science Archive. However, the citations of the relevant receiver papers have not managed to grow together with their use in the astronomical community, which points out an information gap among the astronomical community. To overcome this gap, this memo provides a comprehensive list of receiver references, which was created in direct contact with the receiver groups.</description>
