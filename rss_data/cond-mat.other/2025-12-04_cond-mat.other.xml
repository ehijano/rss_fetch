      <title>Novel phases in the Fe-Si-O system at terapascal pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fe-Si-O ternary system, central to modeling the interiors of terrestrial planets, remains poorly constrained at Terapascal (TPa) pressures characteristic of super-Earth mantles. Using a combination of crystal-structure prediction and ab initio calculations, we identify three ternary compounds stable near 1 TPa: P3 FeSiO4, P3 Fe4Si5O18, and P-3 FeSi2O6. The first two phases are thermodynamically stable at low temperatures, whereas P-3 FeSi2O6 becomes favored above approximately 2000 K. All three are metallic, paramagnetic, and adopt pseudo-binary arrangements derived from the FeO2 and SiO2 end-member structures. Their crystal structures emerge through substitutions of Fe for Si in Fe2P-type SiO2 or of Si for Fe in Pnma-type FeO2, the stable elemental oxides at ~1 TPa. This structural continuity suggests that Fe preferentially substitutes for Si in the canonical Mg-silicates expected at TPa pressures. Notably, these new pseudo-binaries accommodate Fe in six- and nine-fold coordination, in contrast to the eight-fold cubic coordination found in FeO at similar pressures. The thermodynamic conditions under which these phases form from FeO2 and SiO2 mixtures are clarified through quasi-harmonic free energy calculations. Their prevalence in super-Earth's mantles is found to depend on the abundance of FeO2, which may be generated by the dehydrogenation of FeOOH goethite as in the Earth's deep mantle. The existence of these phases implies a markedly different pattern of Fe incorporation in high-pressure Mg-silicates at TPa pressures, compared with the behavior inferred at the GPa pressures of the Earth's mantle.</description>

      <title>Widefield Quantum Sensor for Vector Magnetic Field Imaging of Micromagnetic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many spintronic, magnetic-memory, and neuromorphic devices rely on spatially varying magnetic fields. Quantitatively imaging these fields with full vector information over extended areas remains a major challenge. Existing probes either offer nanoscale resolution at the cost of slow scanning, or widefield imaging with limited vector sensitivity or material constraints. Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond promises to bridge this gap, but a practical camera-based vector magnetometry implementation on relevant microstructures has not been demonstrated. Here we adapt a commercial widefield microscope to implement a camera-compatible pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance protocol to reconstruct stray-field vectors from microscale devices. By resolving the Zeeman shifts of the four NV orientations, we reconstruct the stray-field vector generated by microfabricated permalloy structures that host multiple stable remanent states. Our implementation achieves a spatial resolution of $\approx 0.52 ~\mu\mathrm{m}$ across an $83~\mu\mathrm{m} \times 83~\mu\mathrm{m}$ field of view and a peak sensitivity of $ (828 \pm 142)~\mathrm{nT\,Hz^{-1}}$, with acquisition times of only a few minutes. These results establish pulsed widefield NV magnetometry on standard microscopes as a practical and scalable tool for routine vector-resolved imaging of complex magnetic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum chemistry for solids made simple on the Clifford torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general theory to treat periodic solids with quantum-chemistry methods. It relies on two main developments: 1) the modeling of a solid as a Clifford torus which is a torus that is both periodic and flat and 2) the introduction of a periodic gaussian basis set that is compatible with the topology of the Clifford torus. We illustrate our approach by calculating the ground-state energy of a periodic chain of hydrogen atoms within both Hartree-Fock and coupled cluster theory. We demonstrate that our approach yields the correct ground-state energy in the thermodynamic limit by comparing it to the ground-state energy of a ring of hydrogen atoms in the same limit. Since equivalent ring-like calculations for three-dimensional solids are impossible, our approach is an excellent alternative to perform quantum-chemistry calculations of solids. Our Clifford formalism can be seamlessly combined with current implementations of quantum-chemistry methods designed for atoms and molecules to make them applicable to solids.</description>
