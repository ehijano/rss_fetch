      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining the equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating, self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the classical challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating foundational theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that enhances the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method applies Lie group theory to vector flows and solves functional equations using the Neumann series. We extend Clairaut's classical linear perturbation theory into the nonlinear regime via Lie exponential mapping, yielding a system of nonlinear functional equations for gravitational potential and fluid density. These are analytically tractable using shift operators and Neumann series summation, enabling explicit characterization of density and gravitational perturbations. This leads to an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing equilibrium deformation without assuming slow rotation. We validate the framework through exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques for analyzing radial harmonics and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order nonlinear corrections efficiently. The framework includes boundary conditions for Legendre harmonics, supporting the derivation of nonlinear Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments. This work offers a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational and tidal deformations in astrophysical and planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Properties of Building Blocks Comprising Strongly Interacting Posts and Their Consideration in Advanced Coaxial Filter Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building blocks containing strongly coupled posts offer new possibilities for advanced coaxial (comb-line) filter designs. Equivalent circuits based on the individual resonances of the posts cannot be used to reliably describe the behavior of these structures because of the strong coupling between the posts. Instead, sets of electromagnetic (EM) resonances that satisfy the boundary conditions are used. The resulting equivalent circuit is either a fully transversal circuit or contains locally transversal sub-circuits depending on the strength of the coupling between the cascaded blocks. The validity of similarity transformations that result in topologies with unusual strong coupling coefficients is questionable despite the fact that they yield the correct frequency response. Such coupling matrices obscure the physics of the problem and fail to predict the correct behavior of filtering structures. However, topologies that match the layout of the posts can be used to optimize the filter in connection with a full-wave solver or measurement. Examples of dual-post and triple-post units are used to illustrate the key findings. The basic knowledge of the real functionality of these special resonator configurations allows their consideration in advanced filter implementations by well-established classic design methods, without limitation by the design approach. This is demonstrated by an example of a 2-order in-line filter implementation providing one transmission zero by using the combination of single and transverse dual-post resonators. This fundamental understanding of the special properties provides the pre-requisite for a variety of novel filter solutions.</description>

      <title>The effect of finite duration sources on modes and generalization of the d'Alembert solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of dispersive waves governed by linear wave equations, where a finite duration source is applied. The resulting wave may be viewed as the superposition of modes before the source is turned on and after it is turned off. We consider the problem of relating the modes after the source term is turned off to the modes before the source term was turned on. We obtain explicit formulas in both the wavenumber and position representations. A number of special cases are considered. Using the methods presented, we obtain a generalization of the d'Alembert solution which applies to linear wave equations with constant coefficients.</description>

      <title>Soft superconductivity in covalent bismuth dihydride BiH$_2$ under extreme conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong magnetic fields provide a unique environment for investigating the fundamental properties of superconducting materials, especially for hydride superconductors with large upper critical fields. Following this idea, we have investigated the effect of pulsed magnetic fields on covalent bismuth dihydride (BiH$_2$), successfully synthesized under pressure up to 211 GPa. The electrical resistance measurements indicate that the superconducting phase $P2_1/m$-BiH$_2$ exhibits the highest superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$) of 70 K among MH$_2$-type hydrides apart from H$_2$S.The electrical transport experiments under both pulsed (up to 50 T) and steady magnetic fields (up to 16 T) for $P2_1/m$- and $C2/m$-BiH$_2$ indicate that the upper critical fields $\mu_0 H_{c2}(0)$ = 12--16 T are unusually low, much lower than that of clathrate-like metal polyhydrides with similar $T_c$. This is due to the unexpectedly high Fermi velocity in BiH$_2$, about $1.1 \times 10^6$ m/s, which allows to classify BiH$_2$ as a 'soft' molecular superconducting hydride with relatively weak vortex pinning.Measurements of the current-voltage characteristics in the pulsed mode make it possible to experimentally establish the temperature dependence of the critical current density (the maximum $J_c(0) = 10$ kA/mm$^2$), which indicates the presence of two $s$-wave superconducting gaps in BiH$_2$ at 172--176 GPa: $\Delta_L(0) = 6.9 \pm 1.2$ meV and $\Delta_S(0) \sim 1.5$ meV.</description>
