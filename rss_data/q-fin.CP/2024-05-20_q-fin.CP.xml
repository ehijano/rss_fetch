      <title>Optimal Text-Based Time-Series Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach to construct text-based time-series indices in an optimal way--typically, indices that maximize the contemporaneous relation or the predictive performance with respect to a target variable, such as inflation. We illustrate our methodology with a corpus of news articles from the Wall Street Journal by optimizing text-based indices focusing on tracking the VIX index and inflation expectations. Our results highlight the superior performance of our approach compared to existing indices.</description>

      <title>Leave-one-out least squares Monte Carlo algorithm for pricing Bermudan options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02071</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.02071v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The least squares Monte Carlo (LSM) algorithm proposed by Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) is widely used for pricing Bermudan options. The LSM estimator contains undesirable look-ahead bias, and the conventional technique of avoiding it requires additional simulation paths. We present the leave-one-out LSM (LOOLSM) algorithm to eliminate look-ahead bias without doubling simulations. We also show that look-ahead bias is asymptotically proportional to the regressors-to-paths ratio. Our findings are demonstrated with several option examples in which the LSM algorithm overvalues the options. The LOOLSM method can be extended to other regression-based algorithms that improve the LSM method.</description>

      <title>The Measure Preserving Martingale Sinkhorn Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We contribute to the recent studies of the so-called Bass martingale. Backhoff-Veraguas et al. (2020) showed it is the solution to the martingale Benamou-Brenier (mBB) problem, i.e., among all martingales with prescribed initial and terminal distributions it is the one closest to the Brownian motion. We link it with semimartingale optimal transport and deduce an alternative way to derive the dual formulation recently obtained in Backhoff-Veraguas et al. (2023). We then consider computational methods to compute the Bass martingale. The dual formulation of the transport problem leads to an iterative scheme that mirrors to the celebrated Sinkhorn algorithm for entropic optimal transport. We call it the measure preserving martingale Sinkhorn (MPMS) algorithm. We prove that in any dimension, each step of the algorithm improves the value of the dual problem, which implies its convergence. Our MPMS algorithm is equivalent to the fixed-point method of Conze and Henry-Labordere (2021), studied in Acciaio et al. (2023), and performs very well on a range of examples, including real market data.</description>

      <title>Price predictability at ultra-high frequency: Entropy-based randomness test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the statistical properties of Shannon entropy estimator and Kullback-Leibler divergence to study the predictability of ultra-high frequency financial data. We develop a statistical test for the predictability of a sequence based on empirical frequencies. We show that the degree of randomness grows with the increase of aggregation level in transaction time. We also find that predictable days are usually characterized by high trading activity, i.e., days with unusually high trading volumes and the number of price changes. We find a group of stocks for which predictability is caused by a frequent change of price direction. We study stylized facts that cause price predictability such as persistence of order signs, autocorrelation of returns, and volatility clustering. We perform multiple testing for sub-intervals of days to identify whether there is predictability at a specific time period during the day.</description>
