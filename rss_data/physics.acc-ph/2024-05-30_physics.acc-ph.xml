      <title>Pressure Spike in The LBNF Absorber Core s Gun Drilled Cooling Channel from an Accident Beam Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LBNF Absorber consists of thirteen 6061-T6 aluminum core blocks. The core blocks are water cooled with de-ionized (DI) water which becomes radioactive during beam operations. The cooling water flows through gun-drilled channels in the core blocks. The cooling water is supplied by the LBNF Absorber Radioactive Water (RAW) cooling system which is designed as per ASME B31.3 Normal Fluid Service [1]. An uninhibited beam accident pulse striking the water channels was identified as a credible accident scenario. In this study, it is assumed that the beam pulse hits the Absorber directly without interacting with any of the other upstream beamline components. The beam parameters used for the LBNF beam are 120 GeV, 2.4 MW with a 1.2 s cycle time. The accident pulse lasts for 10 {\mu}s. The maximum energy is deposited in the 3rd aluminum core block. For the sake of simplicity, it is assumed that the accident pulse strikes the 1 in. ID water channel directly. The analysis here simulates the pressure rise in the water during and after the beam pulse and its effects on the aluminum piping components that deliver water to the core blocks. The weld strengths as determined by the Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRDF) and the Allowable Strength Design (ASD) are compared to the forces generated in the weld owing to the pressure spike. A transient structural analysis was used to determine the equivalent membrane, peak, and bending stresses and they were com-pared to allowable limits.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization scheme for the design of a nanofibrous high power target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High Power Targetry (HPT) R&amp;D is critical in the context of increasing beam intensity and energy for next generation accelerators. Many target concepts and novel materials are being developed and tested for their ability to withstand extreme beam environments; the HPT R&amp;D Group at Fermilab is developing an electrospun nanofiber material for this purpose. The performance of these nanofiber targets is sensitive to their construction parameters, such as the packing density of the fibers. Lowering the density improves the survival of the target, but reduces the secondary particle yield. Optimizing the lifetime and production efficiency of the target poses an interesting design problem, and in this paper we study the applicability of Bayesian optimization to its solution. We first describe how to encode the nanofiber target design problem as the optimization of an objective function, and how to evaluate that function with computer simulations. We then explain the optimization loop setup. Thereafter, we present the optimal design parameters suggested by the algorithm, and close with discussions of limitations and future refinements.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics Simulations of Thermal Shock Testing of Nanofibrous High Power Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increase of primary beam power for neutrino beam-lines leads to a reduced lifespan for production targets. New concepts for robust targets are emerging from the field of High Power Targetry (HPT); one idea being investigated by the HPT R&amp;D Group at Fermilab is an electrospun nanofiber target. As part of their evaluation, samples with different densities were sent to the HiRadMat facility at CERN for thermal shock tests. The samples with the higher density, irradiated under a high intensity beam pulse, exhibit major damage at the impact site whereas those with the lower density show no apparent damage. The exact cause of this failure was unclear at the time. In this paper, we present the results of multiphysics simulations of the thermal shock experienced by the nanofiber targets that suggest the failure originates from the reduced permeability of the high density sample to air flow. The air present in the porous target expands due to heating from the beam, but is unable to flow freely in the high density sample, resulting in a larger back pressure that blows apart the nanofiber mat. We close with a discussion on how to further validate this hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Space charge dominated momentum spread and compensation strategies in the post-linac section of Proton Improvement Plan-II at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming Proton Improvement Plan-II (PIP-II), designated for enhancements to the Fermilab accelerator complex, features a new 800 MeV superconducting linac and a Beam Transfer Line (BTL) to transport the beam to the existing Booster synchrotron. To mitigate the space charge tune shift associated with a high intensity accumulated beam, the low emittance linac beam is used to paint the ring phase space both transversely and longitudinally. To prevent losses caused by particles injected outside the rf separatrix while painting longitudinal phase space, the momentum spread of the incoming beam should not exceed 2.1 x 10^-4. Detailed simulations showed that due to space charge, the rms momentum spread increases to 4 x 10^-4 while it is transported in the BTL --about twice the allowable limit. In this paper, we outline a mitigation strategy involving a debuncher cavity. We discuss location, operating frequency, and gap voltage under both nominal and perturbed beam conditions, specifically accounting for momentum jitter. The impact of cavity misalignments is also assessed. The paper concludes by recommending an optimized configuration.</description>

      <title>The first superconducting final focus quadrupole prototype of the FCC-ee study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single aperture Canted-Cosine-Theta (CCT) quadrupole magnet, made of NbTi superconductors, has been developed for the final focus region of the FCC-ee study. The conductor layout is optimised to mitigate edge effects on one of the two sides of the magnet that typically lead to undesired higher-order multipoles. Experimental results of a prototype, including paraffin wax impregnation and cryogenic temperature measurements, are presented. The magnet exhibits no training behaviour, surpassing the nominal current during the initial ramp. Field quality is excellent, with higher-order multipoles below $1\times 10^{-4}$ units, consistent with simulations and room temperature tests. These findings confirm the potential of superconducting CCT magnets to offer compact solutions for applications demanding stringent field quality.</description>
