      <title>Union of Finitely Generated Congruences on Ground Term Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for any ground term equation systems $E$ and $F$, (1) the union of the generated congruences by $E$ and $F$ is a congruence on the ground term algebra if and only if there exists a ground term equation system $H$ such that the congruence generated by $H$ is equal to the union of the congruences generated by $E$ and $F$ if and only if the congruence generated by the union of $E $ and $F$ is equal to the union of the congruences generated by $E $ and $F$, and (2) it is decidable in square time whether the congruence generated by the union of $E$ and $F$ is equal to the union of the congruences generated by $E $ and $F$, where the size of the input is the number of occurrences of symbols in $E$ plus the number of occurrences of symbols in $F$.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for Computing the Leading Monomials of a Minimal Groebner Basis of Generic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient algorithm for computing the leading monomials of a minimal Groebner basis of a generic sequence of homogeneous polynomials. Our approach bypasses costly polynomial reductions by exploiting structural properties conjectured to hold for generic sequences-specifically, that their leading monomial ideals are weakly reverse lexicographic and that their Hilbert series follow a known closed-form expression. The algorithm incrementally constructs the set of leading monomials degree by degree by comparing Hilbert functions of monomial ideals with the expected Hilbert series of the input ideal. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce several optimization techniques that progressively narrow the search space and reduce the number of divisibility checks required at each step. We also refine the loop termination condition using degree bounds, thereby avoiding unnecessary recomputation of Hilbert series. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method substantially reduces both computation time and memory usage compared to conventional Groebner basis computations for computing the leading monomials of a minimal Groebner basis of generic sequences.</description>
