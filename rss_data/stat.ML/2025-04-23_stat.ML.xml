      <title>Transfer Learning for High-dimensional Reduced Rank Time Series Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of transfer learning is to enhance estimation and inference in a target data by leveraging knowledge gained from additional sources. Recent studies have explored transfer learning for independent observations in complex, high-dimensional models assuming sparsity, yet research on time series models remains limited. Our focus is on transfer learning for sequences of observations with temporal dependencies and a more intricate model parameter structure. Specifically, we investigate the vector autoregressive model (VAR), a widely recognized model for time series data, where the transition matrix can be deconstructed into a combination of a sparse matrix and a low-rank one. We propose a new transfer learning algorithm tailored for estimating high-dimensional VAR models characterized by low-rank and sparse structures. Additionally, we present a novel approach for selecting informative observations from auxiliary datasets. Theoretical guarantees are established, encompassing model parameter consistency, informative set selection, and the asymptotic distribution of estimators under mild conditions. The latter facilitates the construction of entry-wise confidence intervals for model parameters. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical efficacy of our methodologies through both simulated and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>From predictions to confidence intervals: an empirical study of conformal prediction methods for in-context learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have become a standard architecture in machine learning, demonstrating strong in-context learning (ICL) abilities that allow them to learn from the prompt at inference time. However, uncertainty quantification for ICL remains an open challenge, particularly in noisy regression tasks. This paper investigates whether ICL can be leveraged for distribution-free uncertainty estimation, proposing a method based on conformal prediction to construct prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage. While traditional conformal methods are computationally expensive due to repeated model fitting, we exploit ICL to efficiently generate confidence intervals in a single forward pass. Our empirical analysis compares this approach against ridge regression-based conformal methods, showing that conformal prediction with in-context learning (CP with ICL) achieves robust and scalable uncertainty estimates. Additionally, we evaluate its performance under distribution shifts and establish scaling laws to guide model training. These findings bridge ICL and conformal prediction, providing a theoretically grounded and new framework for uncertainty quantification in transformer-based models.</description>

      <title>How Private is Your Attention? Bridging Privacy with In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL)-the ability of transformer-based models to perform new tasks from examples provided at inference time-has emerged as a hallmark of modern language models. While recent works have investigated the mechanisms underlying ICL, its feasibility under formal privacy constraints remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a differentially private pretraining algorithm for linear attention heads and present the first theoretical analysis of the privacy-accuracy trade-off for ICL in linear regression. Our results characterize the fundamental tension between optimization and privacy-induced noise, formally capturing behaviors observed in private training via iterative methods. Additionally, we show that our method is robust to adversarial perturbations of training prompts, unlike standard ridge regression. All theoretical findings are supported by extensive simulations across diverse settings.</description>

      <title>Explainable Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Random Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the use of an unsupervised Random Forest for similarity learning and improved unsupervised anomaly detection. By training a Random Forest to discriminate between real data and synthetic data sampled from a uniform distribution over the real data bounds, a distance measure is obtained that anisometrically transforms the data, expanding distances at the boundary of the data manifold. We show that using distances recovered from this transformation improves the accuracy of unsupervised anomaly detection, compared to other commonly used detectors, demonstrated over a large number of benchmark datasets. As well as improved performance, this method has advantages over other unsupervised anomaly detection methods, including minimal requirements for data preprocessing, native handling of missing data, and potential for visualizations. By relating outlier scores to partitions of the Random Forest, we develop a method for locally explainable anomaly predictions in terms of feature importance.</description>

      <title>Significativity Indices for Agreement Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agreement measures, such as Cohen's kappa or intraclass correlation, gauge the matching between two or more classifiers. They are used in a wide range of contexts from medicine, where they evaluate the effectiveness of medical treatments and clinical trials, to artificial intelligence, where they can quantify the approximation due to the reduction of a classifier. The consistency of different classifiers to a golden standard can be compared simply by using the order induced by their agreement measure with respect to the golden standard itself. Nevertheless, labelling an approach as good or bad exclusively by using the value of an agreement measure requires a scale or a significativity index. Some quality scales have been proposed in the literature for Cohen's kappa, but they are mainly naive, and their boundaries are arbitrary. This work proposes a general approach to evaluate the significativity of any agreement value between two classifiers and introduces two significativity indices: one dealing with finite data sets, the other one handling classification probability distributions. Moreover, this manuscript considers the computational issues of evaluating such indices and identifies some efficient algorithms to evaluate them.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Federated Learning for Continual Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL) enables uncertainty quantification and robust adaptation in distributed learning. In contrast to the frequentist approach, it estimates the posterior distribution of a global model, offering insights into model reliability. However, current BFL methods neglect continual learning challenges in dynamic environments where data distributions shift over time. We propose a continual BFL framework applied to human sensing with radar data collected over several days. Using Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD), our approach sequentially updates the model, leveraging past posteriors to construct the prior for the new tasks. We assess the accuracy, the expected calibration error (ECE) and the convergence speed of our approach against several baselines. Results highlight the effectiveness of continual Bayesian updates in preserving knowledge and adapting to evolving data.</description>

      <title>Assessing Surrogate Heterogeneity in Real World Data Using Meta-Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surrogate markers are most commonly studied within the context of randomized clinical trials. However, the need for alternative outcomes extends beyond these settings and may be more pronounced in real-world public health and social science research, where randomized trials are often impractical. Research on identifying surrogates in real-world non-randomized data is scarce, as available statistical approaches for evaluating surrogate markers tend to rely on the assumption that treatment is randomized. While the few methods that allow for non-randomized treatment/exposure appropriately handle confounding individual characteristics, they do not offer a way to examine surrogate heterogeneity with respect to patient characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework to assess surrogate heterogeneity in real-world, i.e., non-randomized, data and implement this framework using various meta-learners. Our approach allows us to quantify heterogeneity in surrogate strength with respect to patient characteristics while accommodating confounders through the use of flexible, off-the-shelf machine learning methods. In addition, we use our framework to identify individuals for whom the surrogate is a valid replacement of the primary outcome. We examine the performance of our methods via a simulation study and application to examine heterogeneity in the surrogacy of hemoglobin A1c as a surrogate for fasting plasma glucose.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of multivariate nonparametric regression with missing covariates, we propose Pattern Embedded Neural Networks (PENNs), which can be applied in conjunction with any existing imputation technique. In addition to a neural network trained on the imputed data, PENNs pass the vectors of observation indicators through a second neural network to provide a compact representation. The outputs are then combined in a third neural network to produce final predictions. Our main theoretical result exploits an assumption that the observation patterns can be partitioned into cells on which the Bayes regression function behaves similarly, and belongs to a compositional H\"older class. It provides a finite-sample excess risk bound that holds for an arbitrary missingness mechanism, and in combination with a complementary minimax lower bound, demonstrates that our PENN estimator attains in typical cases the minimax rate of convergence as if the cells of the partition were known in advance, up to a poly-logarithmic factor in the sample size. Numerical experiments on simulated, semi-synthetic and real data confirm that the PENN estimator consistently improves, often dramatically, on standard neural networks without pattern embedding. Code to reproduce our experiments, as well as a tutorial on how to apply our method, is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Bayesian information theoretic model-averaging stochastic item selection for computer adaptive testing: compromise-free item exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) is to reliably estimate an individual's ability as modeled by an item response theory (IRT) instrument using only a subset of the instrument's items. A secondary goal is to vary the items presented across different testing sessions so that the sequence of items does not become overly stereotypical -- we want all items to have an exposure rate sufficiently far from zero. We formulate the optimization problem for CAT in terms of Bayesian information theory, where one chooses the item at each step based on the criterion of the ability model discrepancy -- the statistical distance between the ability estimate at the next step and the full-test ability estimate. This viewpoint of CAT naturally motivates a stochastic selection procedure that equates choosing the next item to sampling from a model-averaging ensemble ability model. Using the NIH Work Disability Functional Assessment Battery (WD-FAB), we evaluate our new methods in comparison to pre-existing methods found in the literature. We find that our stochastic selector has superior properties in terms of both item exposure and test accuracy/efficiency.</description>

      <title>Smooth Calibration and Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calibration requires predictor outputs to be consistent with their Bayesian posteriors. For machine learning predictors that do not distinguish between small perturbations, calibration errors are continuous in predictions, e.g., smooth calibration error (Foster and Hart, 2018), Distance to Calibration (Blasiok et al., 2023a). On the contrary, decision-makers who use predictions make optimal decisions discontinuously in probabilistic space, experiencing loss from miscalibration discontinuously. Calibration errors for decision-making are thus discontinuous, e.g., Expected Calibration Error (Foster and Vohra, 1997), and Calibration Decision Loss (Hu and Wu, 2024). Thus, predictors with a low calibration error for machine learning may suffer a high calibration error for decision-making, i.e., they may not be trustworthy for decision-makers optimizing assuming their predictions are correct. It is natural to ask if post-processing a predictor with a low calibration error for machine learning is without loss to achieve a low calibration error for decision-making. In our paper, we show that post-processing an online predictor with $\epsilon$ distance to calibration achieves $O(\sqrt{\epsilon})$ ECE and CDL, which is asymptotically optimal. The post-processing algorithm adds noise to make predictions differentially private. The optimal bound from low distance to calibration predictors from post-processing is non-optimal compared with existing online calibration algorithms that directly optimize for ECE and CDL.</description>

      <title>Dimension-Free Decision Calibration for Nonlinear Loss Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When model predictions inform downstream decision making, a natural question is under what conditions can the decision-makers simply respond to the predictions as if they were the true outcomes. Calibration suffices to guarantee that simple best-response to predictions is optimal. However, calibration for high-dimensional prediction outcome spaces requires exponential computational and statistical complexity. The recent relaxation known as decision calibration ensures the optimality of the simple best-response rule while requiring only polynomial sample complexity in the dimension of outcomes. However, known results on calibration and decision calibration crucially rely on linear loss functions for establishing best-response optimality. A natural approach to handle nonlinear losses is to map outcomes $y$ into a feature space $\phi(y)$ of dimension $m$, then approximate losses with linear functions of $\phi(y)$. Unfortunately, even simple classes of nonlinear functions can demand exponentially large or infinite feature dimensions $m$. A key open problem is whether it is possible to achieve decision calibration with sample complexity independent of~$m$. We begin with a negative result: even verifying decision calibration under standard deterministic best response inherently requires sample complexity polynomial in~$m$. Motivated by this lower bound, we investigate a smooth version of decision calibration in which decision-makers follow a smooth best-response. This smooth relaxation enables dimension-free decision calibration algorithms. We introduce algorithms that, given $\mathrm{poly}(|A|,1/\epsilon)$ samples and any initial predictor~$p$, can efficiently post-process it to satisfy decision calibration without worsening accuracy. Our algorithms apply broadly to function classes that can be well-approximated by bounded-norm functions in (possibly infinite-dimensional) separable RKHS.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Neural Geodesic Interpolant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic interpolants are efficient generative models that bridge two arbitrary probability density functions in finite time, enabling flexible generation from the source to the target distribution or vice versa. These models are primarily developed in Euclidean space, and are therefore limited in their application to many distribution learning problems defined on Riemannian manifolds in real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce the Riemannian Neural Geodesic Interpolant (RNGI) model, which interpolates between two probability densities on a Riemannian manifold along the stochastic geodesics, and then samples from one endpoint as the final state using the continuous flow originating from the other endpoint. We prove that the temporal marginal density of RNGI solves a transport equation on the Riemannian manifold. After training the model's the neural velocity and score fields, we propose the Embedding Stochastic Differential Equation (E-SDE) algorithm for stochastic sampling of RNGI. E-SDE significantly improves the sampling quality by reducing the accumulated error caused by the excessive intrinsic discretization of Riemannian Brownian motion in the classical Geodesic Random Walk (GRW) algorithm. We also provide theoretical bounds on the generative bias measured in terms of KL-divergence. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RNGI and E-SDE through experiments conducted on both collected and synthetic distributions on S2 and SO(3).</description>

      <title>Consistent Causal Inference of Group Effects in Non-Targeted Trials with Finitely Many Effect Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A treatment may be appropriate for some group (the ``sick" group) on whom it has a positive effect, but it can also have a detrimental effect on subjects from another group (the ``healthy" group). In a non-targeted trial both sick and healthy subjects may be treated, producing heterogeneous effects within the treated group. Inferring the correct treatment effect on the sick population is then difficult, because the effects on the different groups get tangled. We propose an efficient nonparametric approach to estimating the group effects, called {\bf PCM} (pre-cluster and merge). We prove its asymptotic consistency in a general setting and show, on synthetic data, more than a 10x improvement in accuracy over existing state-of-the-art. Our approach applies more generally to consistent estimation of functions with a finite range.</description>

      <title>Achieving Distributive Justice in Federated Learning via Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Client-level fairness metrics for federated learning are used to ensure that all clients in a federation either: a) have similar final performance on their local data distributions (i.e., client parity), or b) obtain final performance on their local data distributions relative to their contribution to the federated learning process (i.e., contribution fairness). While a handful of works that propose either client-parity or contribution-based fairness metrics ground their definitions and decisions in social theories of equality -- such as distributive justice -- most works arbitrarily choose what notion of fairness to align with which makes it difficult for practitioners to choose which fairness metric aligns best with their fairness ethics. In this work, we propose UDJ-FL (Uncertainty-based Distributive Justice for Federated Learning), a flexible federated learning framework that can achieve multiple distributive justice-based client-level fairness metrics. Namely, by utilizing techniques inspired by fair resource allocation, in conjunction with performing aleatoric uncertainty-based client weighing, our UDJ-FL framework is able to achieve egalitarian, utilitarian, Rawls' difference principle, or desert-based client-level fairness. We empirically show the ability of UDJ-FL to achieve all four defined distributive justice-based client-level fairness metrics in addition to providing fairness equivalent to (or surpassing) other popular fair federated learning works. Further, we provide justification for why aleatoric uncertainty weighing is necessary to the construction of our UDJ-FL framework as well as derive theoretical guarantees for the generalization bounds of UDJ-FL. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/alycia-noel/UDJ-FL.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation with Softmax Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that with linear transformations, both (i) two-layer self-attention and (ii) one-layer self-attention followed by a softmax function are universal approximators for continuous sequence-to-sequence functions on compact domains. Our main technique is a new interpolation-based method for analyzing attention's internal mechanism. This leads to our key insight: self-attention is able to approximate a generalized version of ReLU to arbitrary precision, and hence subsumes many known universal approximators. Building on these, we show that two-layer multi-head attention alone suffices as a sequence-to-sequence universal approximator. In contrast, prior works rely on feed-forward networks to establish universal approximation in Transformers. Furthermore, we extend our techniques to show that, (softmax-)attention-only layers are capable of approximating various statistical models in-context. We believe these techniques hold independent interest.</description>

      <title>CAPO: Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by solving a wide range of tasks simply guided by a prompt. Yet their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. While automated prompt optimization addresses this challenge by finding optimal prompts, current methods require a substantial number of LLM calls and input tokens, making prompt optimization expensive. We introduce CAPO (Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization), an algorithm that enhances prompt optimization efficiency by integrating AutoML techniques. CAPO is an evolutionary approach with LLMs as operators, incorporating racing to save evaluations and multi-objective optimization to balance performance with prompt length. It jointly optimizes instructions and few-shot examples while leveraging task descriptions for improved robustness. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that CAPO outperforms state-of-the-art discrete prompt optimization methods in 11/15 cases with improvements up to 21%p. Our algorithm achieves better performances already with smaller budgets, saves evaluations through racing, and decreases average prompt length via a length penalty, making it both cost-efficient and cost-aware. Even without few-shot examples, CAPO outperforms its competitors and generally remains robust to initial prompts. CAPO represents an important step toward making prompt optimization more powerful and accessible by improving cost-efficiency.</description>

      <title>AlphaGrad: Non-Linear Gradient Normalization Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce AlphaGrad, a memory-efficient, conditionally stateless optimizer addressing the memory overhead and hyperparameter complexity of adaptive methods like Adam. AlphaGrad enforces scale invariance via tensor-wise L2 gradient normalization followed by a smooth hyperbolic tangent transformation, $g' = \tanh(\alpha \cdot \tilde{g})$, controlled by a single steepness parameter $\alpha$. Our contributions include: (1) the AlphaGrad algorithm formulation; (2) a formal non-convex convergence analysis guaranteeing stationarity; (3) extensive empirical evaluation on diverse RL benchmarks (DQN, TD3, PPO). Compared to Adam, AlphaGrad demonstrates a highly context-dependent performance profile. While exhibiting instability in off-policy DQN, it provides enhanced training stability with competitive results in TD3 (requiring careful $\alpha$ tuning) and achieves substantially superior performance in on-policy PPO. These results underscore the critical importance of empirical $\alpha$ selection, revealing strong interactions between the optimizer's dynamics and the underlying RL algorithm. AlphaGrad presents a compelling alternative optimizer for memory-constrained scenarios and shows significant promise for on-policy learning regimes where its stability and efficiency advantages can be particularly impactful.</description>

      <title>PCL-Indexability and Whittle Index for Restless Bandits with General Observation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a general observation model for restless multi-armed bandit problems. The operation of the player needs to be based on certain feedback mechanism that is error-prone due to resource constraints or environmental or intrinsic noises. By establishing a general probabilistic model for dynamics of feedback/observation, we formulate the problem as a restless bandit with a countable belief state space starting from an arbitrary initial belief (a priori information). We apply the achievable region method with partial conservation law (PCL) to the infinite-state problem and analyze its indexability and priority index (Whittle index). Finally, we propose an approximation process to transform the problem into which the AG algorithm of Ni\~no-Mora and Bertsimas for finite-state problems can be applied to. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm has an excellent performance.</description>

      <title>Benign overfitting in Fixed Dimension via Physics-Informed Learning with Smooth Inductive Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have inspired a surge of research into reconstructing specific quantities of interest from measurements that comply with certain physical laws. These efforts focus on inverse problems that are governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we develop an asymptotic Sobolev norm learning curve for kernel ridge(less) regression when addressing (elliptical) linear inverse problems. Our results show that the PDE operators in the inverse problem can stabilize the variance and even behave benign overfitting for fixed-dimensional problems, exhibiting different behaviors from regression problems. Besides, our investigation also demonstrates the impact of various inductive biases introduced by minimizing different Sobolev norms as a form of implicit regularization. For the regularized least squares estimator, we find that all considered inductive biases can achieve the optimal convergence rate, provided the regularization parameter is appropriately chosen. The convergence rate is actually independent to the choice of (smooth enough) inductive bias for both ridge and ridgeless regression. Surprisingly, our smoothness requirement recovered the condition found in Bayesian setting and extend the conclusion to the minimum norm interpolation estimators.</description>

      <title>When resampling/reweighting improves feature learning in imbalanced classification?: A toy-model study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A toy model of binary classification is studied with the aim of clarifying the class-wise resampling/reweighting effect on the feature learning performance under the presence of class imbalance. In the analysis, a high-dimensional limit of the input space is taken while keeping the ratio of the dataset size against the input dimension finite and the non-rigorous replica method from statistical mechanics is employed. The result shows that there exists a case in which the no resampling/reweighting situation gives the best feature learning performance irrespectively of the choice of losses or classifiers, supporting recent findings in Cao et al. (2019); Kang et al. (2019). It is also revealed that the key of the result is the symmetry of the loss and the problem setting. Inspired by this, we propose a further simplified model exhibiting the same property in the multiclass setting. These clarify when the class-wise resampling/reweighting becomes effective in imbalanced classification.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Student's t-distribution with method of moments moving estimator for nonstationary time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03069v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The real life time series are usually nonstationary, bringing a difficult question of model adaptation. Classical approaches like ARMA-ARCH assume arbitrary type of dependence. To avoid their bias, we will focus on recently proposed agnostic philosophy of moving estimator: in time $t$ finding parameters optimizing e.g. $F_t=\sum_{\tau&lt;t} (1-\eta)^{t-\tau} \ln(\rho_\theta (x_\tau))$ moving log-likelihood, evolving in time. It allows for example to estimate parameters using inexpensive exponential moving averages (EMA), like absolute central moments $m_p=E[|x-\mu|^p]$ evolving for one or multiple powers $p\in\mathbb{R}^+$ using $m_{p,t+1} = m_{p,t} + \eta (|x_t-\mu_t|^p-m_{p,t})$. Application of such general adaptive methods of moments will be presented on Student's t-distribution, popular especially in economical applications, here applied to log-returns of DJIA companies. While standard ARMA-ARCH approaches provide evolution of $\mu$ and $\sigma$, here we also get evolution of $\nu$ describing $\rho(x)\sim |x|^{-\nu-1}$ tail shape, probability of extreme events - which might turn out catastrophic, destabilizing the market.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference for Genomic Data with Multiple Heterogeneous Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09119v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the evolution of single-cell RNA sequencing techniques into a standard approach in genomics, it has become possible to conduct cohort-level causal inferences based on single-cell-level measurements. However, the individual gene expression levels of interest are not directly observable; instead, only repeated proxy measurements from each individual's cells are available, providing a derived outcome to estimate the underlying outcome for each of many genes. In this paper, we propose a generic semiparametric inference framework for doubly robust estimation with multiple derived outcomes, which also encompasses the usual setting of multiple outcomes when the response of each unit is available. To reliably quantify the causal effects of heterogeneous outcomes, we specialize the analysis to standardized average treatment effects and quantile treatment effects. Through this, we demonstrate the use of the semiparametric inferential results for doubly robust estimators derived from both Von Mises expansions and estimating equations. A multiple testing procedure based on Gaussian multiplier bootstrap is tailored for doubly robust estimators to control the false discovery exceedance rate. Applications in single-cell CRISPR perturbation analysis and individual-level differential expression analysis demonstrate the utility of the proposed methods and offer insights into the usage of different estimands for causal inference in genomics.</description>

      <title>A Scoping Review of Earth Observation and Machine Learning for Causal Inference: Implications for the Geography of Poverty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02584v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earth observation (EO) data such as satellite imagery can have far-reaching impacts on our understanding of the geography of poverty, especially when coupled with machine learning (ML) and computer vision. Early research used computer vision to predict living conditions in areas with limited data, but recent studies increasingly focus on causal analysis. Despite this shift, the use of EO-ML methods for causal inference lacks thorough documentation, and best practices are still developing. Through a comprehensive scoping review, we catalog the current literature on EO-ML methods in causal analysis. We synthesize five principal approaches to incorporating EO data in causal workflows: (1) outcome imputation for downstream causal analysis, (2) EO image deconfounding, (3) EO-based treatment effect heterogeneity, (4) EO-based transportability analysis, and (5) image-informed causal discovery. Building on these findings, we provide a detailed protocol guiding researchers in integrating EO data into causal analysis -- covering data requirements, computer vision model selection, and evaluation metrics. While our focus centers on health and living conditions outcomes, our protocol is adaptable to other sustainable development domains utilizing EO data.</description>

      <title>Sparse L0-norm based Kernel-free Quadratic Surface Support Vector Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel-free quadratic surface support vector machine (SVM) models have gained significant attention in machine learning. However, introducing a quadratic classifier increases the model's complexity by quadratically expanding the number of parameters relative to the dimensionality of the data, exacerbating overfitting. Hence, we propose sparse $\ell_0$-norm based Kernel-free quadratic surface SVMs, designed to mitigate overfitting and enhance interpretability. Given the intractable nature of these models, we present a penalty decomposition algorithm to obtain first-order optimality points efficiently. We demonstrate that the subproblems in our framework either admit closed-form solutions or can leverage duality theory to improve computational efficiency. Through empirical evaluations on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our approach, showcasing its potential to advance Kernel-free quadratic surface SVMs in practical applications while addressing overfitting concerns. All the implemented models and experiment codes are available at https://github.com/raminzandvakili/L0-QSVM.</description>

      <title>Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader Approaches Best-of-Both-Worlds for the m-Set Semi-Bandit Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a common case of the combinatorial semi-bandit problem, the $m$-set semi-bandit, where the learner exactly selects $m$ arms from the total $d$ arms. In the adversarial setting, the best regret bound, known to be $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{nmd})$ for time horizon $n$, is achieved by the well-known Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) policy. However, this requires to explicitly compute the arm-selection probabilities via optimizing problems at each time step and sample according to them. This problem can be avoided by the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) policy, which simply pulls the $m$ arms that rank among the $m$ smallest (estimated) loss with random perturbation. In this paper, we show that FTPL with a Fr\'echet perturbation also enjoys the near optimal regret bound $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{nmd\log(d)})$ in the adversarial setting and approaches best-of-both-world regret bounds, i.e., achieves a logarithmic regret for the stochastic setting.</description>

      <title>Why Ask One When You Can Ask $k$? Two-Stage Learning-to-Defer to the Top-$k$ Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables decision-making systems to improve reliability by selectively deferring uncertain predictions to more competent agents. However, most existing approaches focus exclusively on single-agent deferral, which is often inadequate in high-stakes scenarios that require collective expertise. We propose Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer, a generalization of the classical two-stage L2D framework that allocates each query to the $k$ most confident agents instead of a single one. To further enhance flexibility and cost-efficiency, we introduce Top-$k(x)$ Learning-to-Defer, an adaptive extension that learns the optimal number of agents to consult for each query, based on input complexity, agent competency distributions, and consultation costs. For both settings, we derive a novel surrogate loss and prove that it is Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$-consistent, ensuring convergence to the Bayes-optimal allocation. Notably, we show that the well-established model cascades paradigm arises as a restricted instance of our Top-$k$ and Top-$k(x)$ formulations. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on both classification and regression tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient algorithms for the Hadamard decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hadamard decomposition is a powerful technique for data analysis and matrix compression, which decomposes a given matrix into the element-wise product of two or more low-rank matrices. In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, leveraging an alternating optimization approach that decomposes the global non-convex problem into a series of convex sub-problems. To improve performance, we explore advanced initialization strategies inspired by the singular value decomposition (SVD) and incorporate acceleration techniques by introducing momentum-based updates. Beyond optimizing the two-matrix case, we also extend the Hadamard decomposition framework to support more than two low-rank matrices, enabling approximations with higher effective ranks while preserving computational efficiency. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to compare our method with the existing gradient descent-based approaches for the Hadamard decomposition and with traditional low-rank approximation techniques. The results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed method across diverse datasets.</description>
