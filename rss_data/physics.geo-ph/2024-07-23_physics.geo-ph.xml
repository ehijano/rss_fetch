      <title>Heterogeneous Seismic Waves Pattern Recognition in Oil Exploration with Spectrum Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of seismic waves to explore the subsurface underlying the ground is a widely used method in the oil industry, since different kinds of the rocks and mediums have different reflection rate of the seismic waves, so the amplitude of the reflected waves can unraveling the geological structure and lithologic character of a certain area under the ground, but the management and processing of seismic wave data often affects the efficiency of oil exploration and development. Different kinds of the seismic data bulk are always mixed and hard to be classified manually. This paper presents a classification model for four main types of seismic data, and proposed a classification method based on Mel-spectrum. An accuracy of 98.32% was achieved using pre-trained ResNet34 with transfer learning method. The accuracy is further improved compared with the pure fourier transformation method widely used in previous studies. Meanwhile, the transfer learning method and fine-tune strategy to train the neural network by training the first N-1 layers of the network separately and then train the fully connected layers further improves the training efficiency. Our model can also be seen as an efficient data quality control scheme for oil exploration and development. Meanwhile, our method is future-proofed, for further improvement of the seismic data processing quality control system, according to the spectrum characteristics, this model can be further extended into a error data classification model, reduces the workload of the bulk data management.</description>

      <title>Spinel-Bearing Spherules Condensed from the Chicxulub Impact-Vapor Plume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formation of the giant Chicxulub crater off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula coincided with deposition of the global Ir-rich Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) stratigraphic boundary layer at ca. 65 Ma. The boundary is marked most sharply by abundant spherules containing unaltered grains of magnesioferrite spinel. Here we predict for the first time the sequential condensation of solids and liquids from the plume of vaporized rock expected from oblique K-T impacts. We predict highly oxidizing plumes that condense silicate liquid droplets bearing spinel grains whose compositions closely match those marking the actual boundary. Systematic global variations in spinel composition are consistent with higher condensation temperatures for spinels found at Atlantic and European sites than for those in the Pacific.</description>

      <title>Learning Physics for Unveiling Hidden Earthquake Ground Motions via Conditional Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting high-fidelity ground motions for future earthquakes is crucial for seismic hazard assessment and infrastructure resilience. Conventional empirical simulations suffer from sparse sensor distribution and geographically localized earthquake locations, while physics-based methods are computationally intensive and require accurate representations of Earth structures and earthquake sources. We propose a novel artificial intelligence (AI) simulator, Conditional Generative Modeling for Ground Motion (CGM-GM), to synthesize high-frequency and spatially continuous earthquake ground motion waveforms. CGM-GM leverages earthquake magnitudes and geographic coordinates of earthquakes and sensors as inputs, learning complex wave physics and Earth heterogeneities, without explicit physics constraints. This is achieved through a probabilistic autoencoder that captures latent distributions in the time-frequency domain and variational sequential models for prior and posterior distributions. We evaluate the performance of CGM-GM using small-magnitude earthquake records from the San Francisco Bay Area, a region with high seismic risks. CGM-GM demonstrates a strong potential for outperforming a state-of-the-art non-ergodic empirical ground motion model and shows great promise in seismology and beyond.</description>

      <title>Assessing the climate benefits of afforestation: phenomenology, processes, methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14617v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Afforestation greatly influences several earth system processes, making it essential to understand these effects to accurately assess its potential for climate change mitigation. Although our understanding of forest-climate interactions has improved, significant knowledge gaps remain, preventing definitive assessments of afforestation's net climate benefits. In this review, focusing on the Canadian boreal, we identify these gaps and synthesize existing knowledge. The review highlights regional realities, Earth's climatic history, uncertainties in biogeochemical (BGC) and biogeophysical (BGP) changes following afforestation, and limitations in current assessment methodologies, emphasizing the need to reconcile these uncertainties before drawing firm conclusions about the climate benefits of afforestation. We hope that the identified gaps will drive the development of a more informed decision-making framework for Canadian afforestation policy, one that considers regional and future climatic contexts. Although we use the Canadian boreal as an example, most arguments in this review are applicable across the globe, particularly for the circumpolar nations.</description>

      <title>Accretion regions of meteorite parent bodies inferred from a two-endmember isotopic mixing model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diverse isotopic anomalies of meteorites demonstrate that the protoplanetary disk was composed of components from different stellar sources, which mixed in the disk and formed the planetary bodies. However, the origin of the accretion materials of different planetary bodies and the cosmochemical relationship between these bodies remain ambiguous. The noncarbonaceous (NC) planetary bodies originate from the inner solar system and have isotopic compositions distinct from those of the carbonaceous (CC) bodies. We combined Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Mo, and Ru isotopic anomalies to develop a quantitative two-endmember mixing model of the NC bodies. Correlations of the isotopic anomalies of different elements with different cosmochemical behaviors originate from the mixing of two common endmembers. Using this mixing model, we calculated the isotopic anomalies of NC bodies for all the considered isotopes, including the isotopic anomalies that are difficult to measure or have been altered by spallation processes. The mixing proportion between the two endmembers in each NC body has been calculated as a cosmochemical parameter, which represents the compositional relationship of the accretion materials between the NC bodies. Using the calculated mixing proportions, the feeding zones of the NC bodies could be estimated. The estimated feeding zones of NC bodies indicate a large population of interlopers in the main asteroid belt and an indigenous origin of Vesta. The feeding zones estimated in different planet formation scenarios indicate that the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn during formation of terrestrial planets were likely to be more circular than their current ones.</description>

      <title>Crystalline forsterite to 160 GPa: the striking metastability of one of Universe's most abundant minerals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among Universe's most consequential events are large impacts generating rapidly-evolving extreme pressures and temperatures. Crystalline and amorphous forms of (Mg, Fe)2SiO4 are abundant and widespread, within planets and in space. The behavior of these minerals is expected to deviate form thermodynamic equilibrium in many of the processes that are critical to the formation and evolution of planets, particularly shock events. To further the understanding of the behavior of the silicate under extreme conditions, we statically compressed a crystal of forsterite up to 160.5 GPa, far beyond the compound's stability field, and probed its long-range ordering with synchrotron microdiffraction. We found that forsterite retains long-range ordering up to the highest pressure reached. Forsterite III, emerging at about 58 GPa, persists in compression to 160.5 GPa and in decompression down to about 13 GPa, for a rare combined occurrence of a metastable phase of nearly 150 GPa. These observations dispute earlier reports of pressure-induced amorphization and are a unique testimony of the resilience of the crystalline state in quasi hydrostatic compression. We confirm that highly disordered forsterite can be obtained from the decompression of forsterite III as suggested from the substantial loss of long-range ordering observed at 7 GPa after further decompression. Such kinetic pathway may explain how synthetic olivine glass have been obtained in shock experiments and could be a mechanism of generation of amorphous forsterite in cosmic dust. The 120 GPa Hugoniot discontinuity finds no correspondence in our data, marking a departure from the parallelism between static "cold compression" and dynamic compression.</description>

      <title>Distributed network of optically pumped magnetometers for space weather monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial variation in the intensity of magnetospheric and ionospheric fluctuation during solar storms creates ground-induced currents, of importance in both infrastructure engineering and geophysical science. This activity is currently measured using a network of ground-based magnetometers, typically consisting of extensive installations at established observatory sites. We show that this network can be enhanced by the addition of remote quantum magnetometers which combine high sensitivity with intrinsic calibration. These nodes utilize scalable hardware and run independently of wired communication and power networks. We demonstrate that optically pumped magnetometers, utilizing mass-produced and miniaturized components, offer a single scalable sensor with the sensitivity and stability required for space weather observation. We describe the development and deployment of an off-grid magnetic sensing node, powered by a solar panel, present observed data from periods of low and high geomagnetic activity, and compare it to existing geomagnetic observatories.</description>
