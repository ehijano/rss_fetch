      <title>Weak convergence rates for central limit theorems of multiscale McKean-Vlasov stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a class of multiscale McKean-Vlasov stochastic systems, where the entire system depends on the distributions of both fast and slow components. We establish a central limit theorem for these systems and derive the weak convergence rate using the Poisson equation technique and the regularity properties of the associated Cauchy problem.</description>

      <title>Multiple radial SLE($\kappa$) and quantum Calogero-Sutherland system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this first of two articles, we study the multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems with parameter $\kappa &gt; 0$ -- a family of random multi-curve systems in a simply-connected domain $\Omega$, with marked boundary points $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \partial \Omega$ and a marked interior point $q$. As a consequence of the domain Markov property and conformal invariance, we show that such systems are characterized by equivalence classes of partition functions, which are not necessarily conformally covariant. Nevertheless, within each equivalence class, one can always choose a conformally covariant representative. When the marked interior point $q$ is set at the origin, we demonstrate that the partition function satisfies a system of second-order PDEs, known as the null vector equations, with a null vector constant $h$ and a rotation equation involving a constant $\omega$. Motivated by the Coulomb gas formalism in conformal field theory, we construct four families of solutions to the null vector equations, which are naturally classified according to topological link patterns. For $\kappa &gt; 0$, the partition functions of multiple radial SLE($\kappa$) systems correspond to eigenstates of the quantum Calogero-Sutherland (CS) Hamiltonian beyond the states built upon the fermionic states.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the critical long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}$, where an edge connects $i$ and $j$ independently with probability $1-\exp\{-\beta\int_i^{i+1}\int_j^{j+1}|u-v|^{-2}d ud v\}$ for $|i-j|&gt;1$ for some fixed $\beta&gt;0$ and with probability 1 for $|i-j|=1$. We prove that both the quenched and annealed spectral dimensions of the associated simple random walk are $2/(1+\delta)$, where $\delta\in (0,1)$ is the exponent of the effective resistance in the LRP model, as derived in [10, Theorem 1.1].</description>

      <title>Exponential moments for Hawkes processes under minimal assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the number of points of a stationary linear Hawkes process lying in any bounded subset of the real line has exponential moments, without any other assumption than the one needed for existence of such stationary process, namely the spectral radius of the matrix of L1 norms of interaction functions is smaller than one. The proof relies on a mass transport principle argument. We also specify the dependence of the bounds with respect to the base rates and the matrix of L1 norms of interaction functions defining the Hawkes process and give a functional version of the result.</description>

      <title>How thin does random interlacement have to be so that a random walk can see through it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random interlacements $\mathscr{I}(u)$ at level $u$ has been introduced by Sznitman, as a Poissonian collection of independent simple random walk trajectories on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 3$, with intensity $u&gt;0$. Since then, several works investigated the properties of the random interlacements intersected with large sets of~$\mathbb{Z}^d$.
  In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the capacity of $\mathscr{I}(u) \cap D_N$, where $D_N$ is the blow up of a compact set $D$, with typical size $N$. We determine the correct window $(u_N)_{N\geq 1}$ of the intensity parameter for which the capacity $\mathrm{cap}(\mathscr{I}(u_N)\cap D_N)$ starts to become negligible compared to $\mathrm{cap}(D_N)$; this roughly means that a random walk starting from far away starts to see through $\mathscr{I}(u_N)\cap D_N$.
  In the same spirit, we investigate the capacity of the simple random walk conditioned to stay in a large Euclidean ball up to time $t_N$, and find similar asymptotics by taking $t_N = u_N N^d$.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Probability Distributions via Divide-and-Conquer: Convergence and Error Propagation under Distributional Arithmetic Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies a general divide-and-conquer algorithm for approximating continuous one-dimensional probability distributions with finite mean. The article presents a numerical study that compares pre-existing approximation schemes with a special focus on the stability of the discrete approximations when they undergo arithmetic operations. The main results are a simple upper bound of the approximation error in terms of the Wasserstein-1 distance that is valid for all continuous distributions with finite mean. In many use-cases, the studied method achieve optimal rate of convergence, and numerical experiments show that the algorithm is more stable than pre-existing approximation schemes in the context of arithmetic operations.</description>

      <title>A conditional coalescent for diploid exchangeable population models given the pedigree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study coalescent processes conditional on the population pedigree under the exchangeable diploid bi-parental population model of \citet{BirknerEtAl2018}. While classical coalescent models average over all reproductive histories, thereby marginalizing the pedigree, our work analyzes the genealogical structure embedded within a fixed pedigree generated by the diploid Cannings model. In the large-population limit, we show that these conditional coalescent processes differ significantly from their marginal counterparts when the marginal coalescent process includes multiple mergers. We characterize the limiting process as an inhomogeneous $(\Psi,c)$-coalescent, where $\Psi$ encodes the timing and scale of multiple mergers caused by generations with large individual progeny (GLIPs), and $c$ is a constant rate governing binary mergers.
  Our results reveal fundamental distinctions between quenched (conditional) and annealed (classical) genealogical models, demonstrate how the fixed pedigree structure impacts multi-locus statistics such as the site-frequency spectrum, and have implications for interpreting patterns of genetic variation among unlinked loci in the genomes of sampled individuals. They significantly extend the results of \citet{DiamantidisEtAl2024}, which considered a sample of size two under a specific Wright-Fisher model with a highly reproductive couple, and those of \citet{TyukinThesis2015}, where Kingman coalescent was the limiting process. Our proofs adapt coupling techniques from the theory of random walks in random environments.</description>

      <title>Milstein-type methods for strong approximation of systems of SDEs with a discontinuous drift coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study strong approximation of $d$-dimensional stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with a discontinuous drift coefficient driven by a $d$-dimensional
  Brownian motion $W$.
  More precisely, we essentially assume that the drift coefficient $\mu$ is piecewise Lipschitz continuous with an exceptional set $\Theta\subset \mathbb{R}^d$
  that is an orientable $C^5$-hypersurface of positive reach, the diffusion coefficient $\sigma$ is assumed to be
  Lipschitz continuous and, in a neighborhood of $\Theta$, both coefficients are bounded and $\sigma$ is non-degenerate.
  Furthermore, both $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are assumed to be $C^{1}$ with intrinsic Lipschitz continuous derivative on $\mathbb{R}^{d}\setminus \Theta$.
  We introduce, for the first time in literature, a Milstein-type method which can be used to approximate SDEs of this type for general $d \in \mathbb{N}$ and prove
  that this Milstein-type scheme achieves an $L_{p}$-error rate of order at least $3/4-$ in terms of the number of steps. This method depends, in addition to evaluations of $W$ on a fixed grid, also on iterated integrals w.r.t. components of $W$, which can in general not be represented as functionals of $W$ evaluated at finitely many time points. We additionally prove that our suggested Milstein-type method is only dependent on evaluations of $W$ on a finite, fixed grid if $\sigma$ is additionally commutative.
  To obtain our main result we prove that a quasi-Milstein scheme achieves an $L_{p}$-error rate of order at least $3/4-$ in our setting if $\mu$ is additionally continuous, which is of interest in itself.</description>

      <title>Regularity and Convergence Properties of Finite Free Convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite free convolutions, $\boxplus_d$ and $\boxtimes_d$, are binary operations on polynomials of degree $d$ that are central to finite free probability, a developing field at the intersection of free probability and the geometry of polynomials. Motivated by established regularities in free probability, this paper investigates analogous regularities for finite free convolutions. Key findings include triangle inequalities for these convolutions and necessary and sufficient conditions regarding atoms of probability measures. Applications of these results include proving the weak convergence of $\boxplus_d$ and $\boxtimes_d$ to their infinite counterparts $\boxplus$ and $\boxtimes$ as $d \to \infty$, without compactness assumptions. Furthermore, this weak convergence is strengthened to convergence in Kolmogorov distance.</description>

      <title>Functional Central Limit Theorem and SPDE for stochastic epidemic model with memory of the last infections and waning immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of a stochastic epidemic model with memory of the last infections, varying infectivity, and waning immunity, as introduced in Guerin and Zotsa-Ngoufack:arXiv preprint arXiv:2505.00601. The dynamics of the epidemic model are described by a measure-valued process with respect to infection age and individual traits. The Functional Law of Large Numbers (FLLN) is formulated as an integral equation, which is solved by a deterministic measure. In this article, we establish the Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT), capturing the fluctuations of the stochastic model around its deterministic limit. The limit of the FCLT is given by a nonlinear stochastic integral equation which is solved by a random signed-measure. We further derive the weak solution in the form of a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) and propose an alternative representation of the FCLT, as fluctuations in the average total force of infection and average susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Permutons from Demazure Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and analyze several new families of permutons arising from random processes involving the Demazure product on the symmetric group. First, we consider Demazure products associated to random pipe dreams, generalizing the Grothendieck permutons introduced by Morales, Panova, Petrov, and Yeliussizov by replacing staircase shapes with arbitrary order-convex shapes. Using the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) with geometric jumps, we prove precise scaling limit and fluctuation results for the associated height functions, showing that these models belong to the Kardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) universality class. We then consider permutons obtained by applying deterministic sequences of bubble-sort operators to random initial permutations. We again provide precise descriptions of the limiting permutons. In a special case, we deduce the exact forms of the standard bubble-sort permutons, the supports of which were computed by DiFranco.
  A crucial tool in our analysis is a formulation, due to Chan and Pflueger, of the Demazure product as matrix multiplication in the min-plus tropical semiring. This allows us to define a Demazure product on the set of permutons. We discuss further applications of this product. For instance, we show that the number of inversions of the Demazure product of two independent uniformly random permutations of size $n$ is $\binom{n}{2}(1-o(1))$.</description>

      <title>Time reversal of Brownian motion with Poissonian resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study reflecting Brownian motion with Poissonian resetting. After providing a probabilistic description of the phenomenon using jump diffusions and semigroups, we analyze the time-reversed process starting from the stationary measure. We prove that the time-reversed process is a Brownian motion with a negative drift and non-local boundary conditions at zero. Moreover, we further study the time-reversed process between two consecutive resetting points and show that, within this time window, it behaves as the same reflecting Brownian motion with a negative drift, where both the jump sizes and the time spent at zero coincide with those of the process obtained under the stationary measure. We characterize the dynamics of both processes, their local times, and finally investigate elliptic problems on positive half-spaces, showing that the two processes leave the same traces at the boundary.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of Young diagrams for symplectic groups and semiclassical orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider an $n\times k$ matrix of i.i.d. Bernoulli random numbers with $p=1/2$. Dual RSK algorithm gives a bijection of this matrix to a pair of Young tableaux of conjugate shape, which is manifestation of skew Howe $GL_{n}\times GL_{k}$-duality. Thus the probability measure on zero-ones matrix leads to the probability measure on Young diagrams proportional to the ratio of the dimension of $GL_{n}\times GL_{k}$-representation and the dimension of the exterior algebra $\bigwedge\left(\mathbb{C}^{n}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{k}\right)$.
  Similarly, by applying Proctor's algorithm based on Berele's modification of the Schensted insertion, we get skew Howe duality for the pairs of groups $Sp_{2n}\times Sp_{2k}$. In the limit when $n,k\to\infty$ $GL$-case is relatively easily studied by use of free-fermionic representation for the correlation kernel. But for the symplectic groups there is no convenient free-fermionic representation. We use Christoffel transformation to obtain the semiclassical orthogonal polynomials for $Sp_{2n}\times Sp_{2k}$ from Krawtchouk polynomials that describe $GL_{2n}\times GL_{2k}$ case. We derive an integral representation for semiclassical polynomials. The study of the asymptotic of this integral representation gives us the description of the limit shapes and fluctuations of the random Young diagrams for symplectic groups.</description>

      <title>Rapid phase ordering for Ising and Potts dynamics on random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Ising, and more generally, $q$-state Potts Glauber dynamics on random $d$-regular graphs on $n$ vertices at low temperatures $\beta \gtrsim \frac{\log d}{d}$. The mixing time is exponential in $n$ due to a bottleneck between $q$ dominant phases consisting of configurations in which the majority of vertices are in the same state. We prove that for any $d\ge 7$, from biased initializations with $\epsilon_d n$ more vertices in state-$1$ than in other states, the Glauber dynamics quasi-equilibrates to the stationary distribution conditioned on having plurality in state-$1$ in optimal $O(\log n)$ time. Moreover, the requisite initial bias $\epsilon_d$ can be taken to zero as $d \to \infty$. Even for the $q=2$ Ising case, where the states are naturally identified with $\pm 1$, proving such a result requires a new approach in order to control negative information spread in spacetime despite the model being in low temperature and exhibiting strong local correlations. For this purpose, we introduce a coupled non-Markovian rigid dynamics for which a delicate temporal recursion on probability mass functions of minus spacetime cluster sizes establishes their subcriticality.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04173v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the forecast of the FIFA World Cup 2022 via nested zero-inflated generalized Poisson regression. Our regression model incorporates the Elo points of the participating teams, the location of the matches and the of team-specific skills in attack and defense as covariates. The proposed model allows predictions in terms of probabilities in order to quantify the chances for each team to reach a certain stage of the tournament. We use Monte Carlo simulations for estimating the outcome of each single match of the tournament, from which we are able to simulate the whole tournament itself. The model is fitted on all football games of the participating teams since 2016 weighted by date and importance. Validation with previous tournaments and comparison with other Poisson models are given.</description>

      <title>Singular Perturbation in Multiscale Stochastic Control Problems with Domain Restriction in the Slow Variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates multiscale stochastic optimal control problems that arise from the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources into the Brazilian power system. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-constrained control problems and establish foundational results using the theory of viscosity solutions for degenerate Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations with Neumann-type boundary conditions. A singular perturbation framework is developed to analyze the convergence of multiscale value functions in infinite-horizon settings. Two examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical contributions of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Restricted Spectral Gap Decomposition for Simulated Tempering Targeting Mixture Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulated tempering is a widely used strategy for sampling from multimodal distributions. In this paper, we consider simulated tempering combined with an arbitrary local Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler and present a new decomposition theorem that provides a lower bound on the restricted spectral gap of the algorithm for sampling from mixture distributions. By working with the restricted spectral gap, the applicability of our results is extended to broader settings such as when the usual spectral gap is difficult to bound or becomes degenerate. We demonstrate the application of our theoretical results by analyzing simulated tempering combined with random walk Metropolis--Hastings for sampling from mixtures of Gaussian distributions. We show that in fixed-dimensional settings, the algorithm's complexity scales polynomially with the separation between modes and logarithmically with $1/\varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy in total variation distance.</description>

      <title>On Discounted Infinite-Time Mean Field Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the infinite-time mean field games with discounting, establishing an equilibrium where individual optimal strategies collectively regenerate the mean-field distribution. To solve this problem, we partition all agents into a representative player and the social equilibrium. When the optimal strategy of the representative player shares the same feedback form with the strategy of the social equilibrium, we say the system achieves a Nash equilibrium.
  We construct a Nash equilibrium using the stochastic maximum principle and infinite-time forward-backward stochastic differential equations. By employing the elliptic master equation, we provide a representation for the Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Neural Conditional Transport Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a neural framework for learning conditional optimal transport (OT) maps between probability distributions. Our approach introduces a conditioning mechanism capable of processing both categorical and continuous conditioning variables simultaneously. At the core of our method lies a hypernetwork that generates transport layer parameters based on these inputs, creating adaptive mappings that outperform simpler conditioning methods. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the superior performance of our method over baseline configurations. Furthermore, we showcase an application to global sensitivity analysis, offering high performance in computing OT-based sensitivity indices. This work advances the state-of-the-art in conditional optimal transport, enabling broader application of optimal transport principles to complex, high-dimensional domains such as generative modeling and black-box model explainability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09163v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $B=\{ B_{t}\} _{t\ge 0}$ be a one-dimensional standard Brownian motion. As an application of a recent result of ours on exponential functionals of Brownian motion, we show in this paper that, for every fixed $t&gt;0$, the process given by \begin{align*}
  B_{s}-B_{t}-\Bigl|
  B_{t}+\max _{0\le u\le s}B_{u}-\max _{s\le u\le t}B_{u}
  \Bigr|
  +\Bigl|
  \max _{0\le u\le s}B_{u}-\max _{s\le u\le t}B_{u}
  \Bigr| ,\quad 0\le s\le t, \end{align*} is a Brownian motion. The path transformation that describes the above process is proven to be an involution, commute with time reversal, and preserve Pitman's transformation. A connection with Pitman's $2M-X$ theorem is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Potts and random cluster measures on locally regular-tree-like graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fixing $\beta \ge 0$ and an integer $q \ge 2$, consider the ferromagnetic $q$-Potts measures $\mu_n^{\beta,B}$ on finite graphs ${\sf G}_n$ on $n$ vertices, with external field strength $B \ge 0$ and the corresponding random cluster measures $\varphi^{q,\beta,B}_{n}$. Suppose that as $n \to \infty$ the uniformly sparse graphs ${\sf G}_n$ converge locally to an infinite $d$-regular tree ${\sf T}_{d}$, $d \ge 3$. We show that the convergence of the Potts free energy density to its Bethe replica symmetric prediction (which has been proved in case $d$ is even, or when $B=0$), yields the local weak convergence of $\varphi^{q,\beta,B}_n$ and $\mu_n^{\beta,B}$ to the corresponding free or wired random cluster measure, Potts measure, respectively, on ${\sf T}_{d}$. The choice of free versus wired limit is according to which has the larger Potts Bethe functional value, with mixtures of these two appearing {as limit points on} the critical line $\beta_c(q,B)$ where these two values of the Bethe functional coincide. For $B=0$ and $\beta&gt;\beta_c$, we further establish a pure-state decomposition by showing that conditionally on the same dominant color $1 \le k \le q$, the $q$-Potts measures on such edge-expander graphs ${\sf G}_n$ converge locally to the $q$-Potts measure on ${\sf T}_{d}$ with a boundary wired at color $k$.</description>

      <title>A confined random walk locally looks like tilted random interlacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d \geq 3$, conditioned to stay in a large domain $D_N$ of typical diameter $N$. Considering the range up to time $t_N \geq N^{2+\delta}$ for some $\delta &gt; 0$, we establish a coupling with what Teixeira (2009) and Li &amp; Sznitman (2014) defined as "tilted random interlacements". This tilted interlacement can be described as random interlacements but with trajectories given by random walks on conductances $c_N(x,y) = \phi_N(x) \phi_N(y)$, where $\phi_N$ is the first eigenvector of the discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator on $D_N$. The coupling follows the methodology of the soft local times, introduced by Popov &amp; Teixeira (2015) and used by \v{C}ern\'y &amp; Teixeira (2016) to prove the well-known coupling between the simple random walk on the torus and the random interlacements.</description>

      <title>Some properties of the principal Dirichlet eigenfunction in Lipschitz domains, via probabilistic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a discrete and continuous version of the spectral Dirichlet problem in an open bounded connected set $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, in dimension $d\geq 2$. More precisely, consider the simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ killed upon exiting the (large) bounded domain $\Omega_N = (N\Omega)\cap \mathbb{Z}^d$. We let $P_N$ its transition matrix and we study the properties of its ($L^2$-normalized) principal eigenvector $\phi_N$, also known as ground state. Under mild assumptions on $\Omega$, we give regularity estimates on $\phi_N$, namely on its $k$-th order differences, with a uniform control inside $\Omega_N$. We provide a completely probabilistic proof of these estimates: our starting point is a Feynman--Kac representation of $\phi_N$, combined with gambler's ruin estimates and a new ``multi-mirror'' coupling, which may be of independent interest. We also obtain the same type of estimates for the first eigenfunction $\varphi_1$ of the corresponding continuous spectral Dirichlet problem, in relation with a Brownian motion killed upon exiting $\Omega$. Finally, we take the opportunity to review (and slightly extend) some of the literature on the $L^2$ and uniform convergence of $\phi_N$ to $\varphi_1$ in Lipschitz bounded domains of $\mathbb{R}^d$, which can be derived thanks to our estimates.</description>

      <title>Growing conditioned BGW trees with log-concave offspring distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that given a log-concave offspring distribution, the corresponding sequence of Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson trees conditioned to have $n\geq 1$ vertices admits a realization as a Markov process $(T_n)_{n\geq1}$ which adds a new ``right-leaning'' leaf at each step. This applies for instance to offspring distributions which are Poisson, binomial, geometric, or any convolution of those. By a negative result of Janson, the log-concavity condition is optimal in the restricted case of offspring distributions supported in $\{0,1,2\}$. We then prove a generalization to the case of an offspring distribution supported on an arithmetic progression, if we assume log-concavity along that progression.
  As an application, we deduce the existence of increasing couplings in an inhomogeneous model of random subtrees of the Ulam--Harris tree. This is equivalent to the statement that, in a corresponding inhomogeneous Bernouilli percolation model on a regular tree, the root cluster is stochastically increasing in its size.
  These results generalize a construction of Luczak and Winkler which applies to uniformly sampled subtrees with $n$ vertices of the infinite complete $d$-ary trees. Our proofs are elementary and we tried to make them as self-contained as possible.</description>

Abstract: We extend the classical regularity theory of optimal transport to non-optimal transport maps generated by heat flow for perturbations of Gaussian measures. Considering probability measures of the form $d\mu(x) = \exp\left(-\frac{|x|^2}{2} + a(x)\right)dx$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ where $a$ has H\"older regularity $C^\beta$ with $\beta\geq 0$; we show that the Langevin map transporting the $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution onto $\mu$ achieves H\"older regularity $C^{\beta + 1}$, up to a logarithmic factor. We additionally present applications of this result to functional inequalities and generative modelling.</description>

Abstract: Consider an $ N \times N$ Hermitian one-dimensional random band matrix with band width $W &gt; N^{1 / 2 + \frak c} $ for any $ {\frak c} &gt; 0$. In the bulk of the spectrum and in the large $ N $ limit, we obtain the following results: (i) The semicircle law holds up to the scale $ N^{-1 + \varepsilon} $ for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0 $. (ii) All $ L^2 $- normalized eigenvectors are delocalized, meaning their $ L^\infty$ norms are simultaneously bounded by $ N^{-\frac{1}{2} + \varepsilon} $ with overwhelming probability, for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0 $. (iii) Quantum unique ergodicity holds in the sense that the local $ L^2 $ mass of eigenvectors becomes equidistributed with high probability. (iv) Universality of eigenvalue statistics holds, i.e., the local eigenvalue statistics of these band matrices are given by those of Gaussian unitary ensembles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the general solvability of anticipated backward stochastic differential equations with quadratic growth by relaxing the assumptions made by Hu, Li, and Wen \cite[Journal of Differential Equations, 270 (2021), 1298--1311]{hu2021anticipated} from the one-dimensional case with bounded terminal values to the multi-dimensional situation with bounded/unbounded terminal values. Three new results regarding the existence and uniqueness of local and global solutions are established. More precisely, for the local solution with bounded terminal values, the generator $f(t, Y_t, Z_t, Y_{t+\delta_t},Z_{t+\zeta_t})$ is of general growth with respect to $Y_t$ and $Y_{t+\delta_{t}}$. For the global solution with bounded terminal values, the generator $f(t, Y_t, Z_t, Y_{t+\delta_t},Z_{t+\zeta_t})$ is of skew sub-quadratic but also ``strictly and diagonally" quadratic growth in $Z_t$. For the global solution with unbounded terminal values, the generator $f(t, Y_t, Z_t, Y_{t+\delta_t})$ is of diagonal quadratic growth in $Z_t$ in the first case; and in the second case, the generator $f(t, Z_t)$+$E[g(t, Y_t,Z_t, Y_{t+\delta_t},Z_{t+\zeta_t})]$ is of diagonal quadratic growth in $Z_t$ and linear growth in $Z_{t+\zeta_t}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the strong($H^1$) well-posedness of the two dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with multiplicative noise on moving domains. Due to the nonlocality effect, this equation exhibits a ``piecewise" variational setting. Namely the global well-posedness of this equation is decomposed into the well-posedness of a family of stochastic partial differential equations(SPDEs) in the variational setting on each small time-interval. We first examine the well-posedness on each time interval, which does not have (nonhomogeneous) coercivity. Subsequently, we give an estimate of lower bound of length of the time-interval, which enables us to achieve the global well-posedness.</description>

Abstract: For a probability measure preserving dynamical system $(\mathcal{X},f,\mu)$, the Poincar\'e Recurrence Theorem asserts that $\mu$-almost every orbit is recurrent with respect to its initial condition. This motivates study of the statistics of the process $X_n(x)=\text{dist}(f^n(x),x))$, and real-valued functions thereof. For a wide class of non-uniformly expanding dynamical systems, we show that the time-$n$ counting process $R_n(x)$ associated to the number recurrences below a certain radii sequence $r_n(\tau)$ follows an \emph{averaged} Poisson distribution $G(\tau)$. Furthermore, we obtain quantitative results on almost sure rates for the recurrence statistics of the process $X_n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classic result of Brooks, Smith, Stone and Tutte associates to any finite planar network with distinguished source and sink vertices, a tiling of a rectangle by smaller subrectangles whose aspect ratios are given by the conductances of corresponding edges in the network. This tiling can be viewed as a discrete analogue of the uniformizing conformal map that maps a simply connected domain with four distinguished prime ends to a rectangle, so that the four prime ends are mapped to the four corners of the rectangle. \\ \\ We make this intuition precise by showing that if $\Omega$ is a simply connected domain with four distinguished prime ends $A,B,C,D$ in counterclockwise order and $(\Omega_{n})_{n\geq{1}}$ is a sequence of orthodiagonal maps with distinguished boundary vertices $A_{n}, B_{n}, C_{n}, D_{n}$ in counterclockwise order, that are finer and finer approximations of $\Omega$ with its distinguished boundary points $A,B,C,D$, then the corresponding ``rectangle tiling maps" converge uniformly on compacts to the aforementioned conformal map on $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Khintchine dichotomy for self-similar measures</title>

Abstract: We establish the analogue of Khintchine's theorem for all self-similar probability measures on the real line. When specified to the case of the Hausdorff measure on the middle-thirds Cantor set, the result is already new and provides an answer to an old question of Mahler. The proof consists in showing effective equidistribution in law of expanding upper-triangular random walks on $\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{R})/\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$, a result of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Asynchronous Federated Learning: A~Delicate Trade-Off Between Model-Parameter Staleness and Update Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronous federated learning (FL) scales poorly with the number of clients due to the straggler effect. Algorithms like FedAsync and GeneralizedFedAsync address this limitation by enabling asynchronous communication between clients and the central server. In this work, we rely on stochastic modeling and analysis to better understand the impact of design choices in asynchronous FL algorithms, such as the concurrency level and routing probabilities, and we leverage this knowledge to optimize loss. Compared to most existing studies, we account for the joint impact of heterogeneous and variable service speeds and heterogeneous datasets at the clients. We characterize in particular a fundamental trade-off for optimizing asynchronous FL: minimizing gradient estimation errors by avoiding model parameter staleness, while also speeding up the system by increasing the throughput of model updates. Our two main contributions can be summarized as follows. First, we prove a discrete variant of Little's law to derive a closed-form expression for relative delay, a metric that quantifies staleness. This allows us to efficiently minimize the average loss per model update, which has been the gold standard in literature to date. Second, we observe that naively optimizing this metric leads us to slow down the system drastically by overemphazing staleness at the detriment of throughput. This motivates us to introduce an alternative metric that also takes system speed into account, for which we derive a tractable upper-bound that can be minimized numerically. Extensive numerical results show that these optimizations enhance accuracy by 10% to 30%.</description>
