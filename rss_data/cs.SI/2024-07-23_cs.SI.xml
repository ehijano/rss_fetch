      <title>Political Elites in the Attention Economy: Visibility Over Civility and Credibility?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elected officials have privileged roles in public communication. In contrast to national politicians, whose posting content is more likely to be closely scrutinized by a robust ecosystem of nationally focused media outlets, sub-national politicians are more likely to openly disseminate harmful content with limited media scrutiny. In this paper, we analyze the factors that explain the online visibility of over 6.5K unique state legislators in the US and how their visibility might be impacted by posting low-credibility or uncivil content. We conducted a study of posting on Twitter and Facebook (FB) during 2020-21 to analyze how legislators engage with users on these platforms. The results indicate that distributing content with low-credibility information attracts greater attention from users on FB and Twitter for Republicans. Conversely, posting content that is considered uncivil on Twitter receives less attention. A noticeable scarcity of posts containing uncivil content was observed on FB, which may be attributed to the different communication patterns of legislators on these platforms. In most cases, the effect is more pronounced among the most ideologically extreme legislators. Our research explores the influence exerted by state legislators on online political conversations, with Twitter and FB serving as case studies. Furthermore, it sheds light on the differences in the conduct of political actors on these platforms. This study contributes to a better understanding of the role that political figures play in shaping online political discourse.</description>

      <title>ElectionRumors2022: A Dataset of Election Rumors on Twitter During the 2022 US Midterms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the spread of online rumors is a pressing societal challenge and an active area of research across domains. In the context of the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, one influential social media platform for sharing information -- including rumors that may be false, misleading, or unsubstantiated -- was Twitter (now renamed X). To increase understanding of the dynamics of online rumors about elections, we present and analyze a dataset of 1.81 million Twitter posts corresponding to 135 distinct rumors which spread online during the midterm election season (September 5 to December 1, 2022). We describe how this data was collected, compiled, and supplemented, and provide a series of exploratory analyses along with comparisons to a previously-published dataset on 2020 election rumors. We also conduct a mixed-methods analysis of three distinct rumors about the election in Arizona, a particularly prominent focus of 2022 election rumoring. Finally, we provide a set of potential future directions for how this dataset could be used to facilitate future research into online rumors, misinformation, and disinformation.</description>

      <title>Discovering overlapping communities in multi-layer directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the challenging problem of detecting overlapping communities in multi-layer directed networks. Our goal is to understand the underlying asymmetric overlapping community structure by analyzing the mixed memberships of nodes. We introduce a new model, the multi-layer mixed membership stochastic co-block model (multi-layer MM-ScBM), to model multi-layer directed networks in which nodes can belong to multiple communities. We develop a spectral procedure to estimate nodes' memberships in both sending and receiving patterns. Our method uses a successive projection algorithm on a few leading eigenvectors of two debiased aggregation matrices. To our knowledge, this is the first work to detect asymmetric overlapping communities in multi-layer directed networks. We demonstrate the consistent estimation properties of our method by providing per-node error rates under the multi-layer MM-ScBM framework. Our theoretical analysis reveals that increasing the overall sparsity, the number of nodes, or the number of layers can improve the accuracy of overlapping community detection. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate these theoretical findings. We also apply our method to one real-world multi-layer directed network, gaining insightful results.</description>

      <title>Future of Home-living: Designing Smart Spaces for Modern Domestic Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of smart home technologies, particularly agentic ones such as conversational agents, robots, and virtual avatars, is reshaping our understanding of home and domestic life. This shift highlights the complexities of modern domestic life, with the household landscape now featuring diverse cohabiting units like co-housing and communal living arrangements. These agentic technologies present specific design challenges and opportunities as they become integrated into everyday routines and activities. Our workshop envisions smart homes as dynamic, user-shaped spaces, focusing on the integration of these technologies into daily life. We aim to explore how these technologies transform household dynamics, especially through boundary fluidity, by uniting researchers and practitioners from fields such as design, sociology, and ethnography. Together, we will develop a taxonomy of challenges and opportunities, providing a structured perspective on the integration of agentic technologies and their impact on contemporary living arrangements.</description>

      <title>GenRec: A Flexible Data Generator for Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scarcity of realistic datasets poses a significant challenge in benchmarking recommender systems and social network analysis methods and techniques. A common and effective solution is to generate synthetic data that simulates realistic interactions. However, although various methods have been proposed, the existing literature still lacks generators that are fully adaptable and allow easy manipulation of the underlying data distributions and structural properties. To address this issue, the present work introduces GenRec, a novel framework for generating synthetic user-item interactions that exhibit realistic and well-known properties observed in recommendation scenarios. The framework is based on a stochastic generative process based on latent factor modeling. Here, the latent factors can be exploited to yield long-tailed preference distributions, and at the same time they characterize subpopulations of users and topic-based item clusters. Notably, the proposed framework is highly flexible and offers a wide range of hyper-parameters for customizing the generation of user-item interactions. The code used to perform the experiments is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GenRec-DED3.</description>

      <title>A Large-scale Benchmark Dataset for Commuting Origin-destination Matrix Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The commuting origin-destination~(OD) matrix is a critical input for urban planning and transportation, providing crucial information about the population residing in one region and working in another within an interested area. Despite its importance, obtaining and updating the matrix is challenging due to high costs and privacy concerns. This has spurred research into generating commuting OD matrices for areas lacking historical data, utilizing readily available information via computational models. In this regard, existing research is primarily restricted to only a single or few large cities, preventing these models from being applied effectively in other areas with distinct characteristics, particularly in towns and rural areas where such data is urgently needed. To address this, we propose a large-scale dataset comprising commuting OD matrices for 3,233 diverse areas around the U.S. For each area, we provide the commuting OD matrix, combined with regional attributes including demographics and point-of-interests of each region in that area. We believe this comprehensive dataset will facilitate the development of more generalizable commuting OD matrix generation models, which can capture various patterns of distinct areas. Additionally, we use this dataset to benchmark a set of commuting OD generation models, including physical models, element-wise predictive models, and matrix-wise generative models. Surprisingly, we find a new paradigm, which considers the whole area combined with its commuting OD matrix as an attributed directed weighted graph and generates the weighted edges based on the node attributes, can achieve the optimal. This may inspire a new research direction from graph learning in this field.</description>

      <title>Highly engaging events reveal semantic and temporal compression in online community discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People nowadays express their opinions in online spaces, using different forms of interactions such as posting, sharing and discussing with one another. How do these digital traces change in response to events happening in the real world? We leverage Reddit conversation data, exploiting its community-based structure, to elucidate how offline events influence online user interactions and behavior. Online conversations, as posts and comments, are analysed along their temporal and semantic dimensions. Conversations tend to become repetitive with a more limited vocabulary, develop at a faster pace and feature heightened emotions. As the event approaches, the shifts occurring in conversations are reflected in the users' dynamics. Users become more active and they exchange information with a growing audience, despite using a less rich vocabulary and repetitive messages. The recurring patterns we discovered are persistent across a wide range of events and several contexts, representing a fingerprint of how online dynamics change in response to real-world occurrences.</description>

      <title>Position: AI/ML Influencers Have a Place in the Academic Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the number of accepted papers at AI and ML conferences reaches into the thousands, it has become unclear how researchers access and read research publications. In this paper, we investigate the role of social media influencers in enhancing the visibility of machine learning research, particularly the citation counts of papers they share. We have compiled a comprehensive dataset of over 8,000 papers, spanning tweets from December 2018 to October 2023, alongside controls precisely matched by 9 key covariates. Our statistical and causal inference analysis reveals a significant increase in citations for papers endorsed by these influencers, with median citation counts 2-3 times higher than those of the control group. Additionally, the study delves into the geographic, gender, and institutional diversity of highlighted authors. Given these findings, we advocate for a responsible approach to curation, encouraging influencers to uphold the journalistic standard that includes showcasing diverse research topics, authors, and institutions.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of the Reddit collective action leading to the GameStop short squeeze</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14999v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In early 2021, the stock prices of GameStop, AMC, Nokia, and BlackBerry experienced dramatic increases, triggered by short squeeze operations that have been largely attributed to Reddit's retail investors. These events showcased, for the first time, the potential of online social networks to catalyze financial collective action. How, when and to what extent Reddit users played a role in driving up these prices, however, remains unclear. We address these questions by statistical analysis of time series with high temporal resolution, about social activity on Reddit and Twitter as well as stock trading volumes. We find that increasing Reddit discussions anticipated high trading volume before the GameStop short squeeze, with their predictive power being particularly strong on hourly time scales. This effect emerged abruptly a few weeks before the event, but waned once the community of investors gained widespread visibility through Twitter. Meanwhile, the collective investment of the Reddit community, quantified through each user's financial position on GameStop, closely mirrored the market capitalization of the stock. These evidences suggest a coordinated action by Reddit users in developing a shared financial strategy through social media. Towards the end of January, users talking about GameStop contributed to raise the popularity of BlackBerry, AMC and Nokia, which emerged as the most popular stocks as the community gained global recognition. Overall, our results shed light on the dynamics behind the first large-scale financial collective action driven by social media users.</description>

      <title>Deep-Graph-Sprints: Accelerated Representation Learning in Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDGs) are essential for modeling interconnected, evolving systems. Traditional methods for extracting knowledge from these graphs often depend on feature engineering or deep learning. Feature engineering is limited by the manual and time-intensive nature of crafting features, while deep learning approaches suffer from high inference latency, making them impractical for real-time applications. This paper introduces Deep-Graph-Sprints (DGS), a novel deep learning architecture designed for efficient representation learning on CTDGs with low-latency inference requirements. We benchmark DGS against state-of-the-art feature engineering and graph neural network methods using five diverse datasets. The results indicate that DGS achieves competitive performance while improving inference speed up to 12x compared to other deep learning approaches on our tested benchmarks. Our method effectively bridges the gap between deep representation learning and low-latency application requirements for CTDGs.</description>
