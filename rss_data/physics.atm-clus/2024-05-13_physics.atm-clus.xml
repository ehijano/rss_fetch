      <title>Time-resolved Interparticle Coulombic Decay spectra including nuclear degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.06040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of chemistry, where nuclear motion has traditionally been a focal point, we now explore the ultra-rapid electronic motion spanning attoseconds to femtoseconds, demonstrating that it is equally integral and relevant to the discipline. The advent of ultrashort attosecond pulse technology has revolutionized our ability to directly observe electronic rearrangements in atoms and molecules, offering a time-resolved insight into these swift processes. Prominent examples include Auger-Meitner decay and Interparticle Coulombic Decay (ICD). However, the real challenge lies in interpreting these observations, where theoretical models are indispensable.
  Building upon the analytical framework introduced in Phys. Rev. A 101, 043414 (2020), which analyzed the spectra of electrons emitted during electronic decay processes from a purely electronic perspective, our paper represents a significant advancement. We extend this theoretical base to include nuclear dynamics, utilizing the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to deepen our understanding of the intricate interaction between electronic and nuclear motion in these processes.
  We illustrate the impact of incorporating nuclear degrees of freedom in several theoretical cases characterized by different numbers of vibrational bound states in both the electronic resonance and the electronic final state. This approach not only clarifies complex spectral features and unusual peak shapes but also demonstrates a method for extracting the energy differences between multiple vibrational resonance states through their distinctive interference patterns.</description>

      <title>Trapping polar molecules by surface acoustic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to trap polar molecules with the electrical force induced by the surface acoustic wave (SAW) on piezoelectric materials. In this approach, the electrical force is perpendicular to the moving direction of the polar molecules, and is used to control the positions of trapped polar molecules in the direction orthogonal to the acoustic transmission. By virtue of an external electrical force, the SAW-induced electrical field can trap the polar molecules into single-layer or multi-layer lattices. The arrangement of molecules can affect the binding energy and localization of the molecule array. Then the one- or two-dimensional trapped polar molecule arrays can be used to construct the Bose-Hubbard (BH) model, whose energy and dynamics are affected by the localizations of the trapped molecules. We find that the phase transitions between the superfluid and Mott insulator based on trapped polar molecule BH model can be modulated by the SAW induced electrical potential.</description>
