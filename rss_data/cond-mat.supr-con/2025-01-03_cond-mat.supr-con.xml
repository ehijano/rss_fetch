      <title>Magneto-optical response of Dynes superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the terahertz conductivity of conventional superconductors in Voigt and Faraday magneto-optical configurations. In the Voigt geometry, an ultrathin superconducting film is fully penetrated by the magnetic field which interacts with the spin, thus modifying the magnitudes of the optical gap and of the density of the condensate. We provide an alternative interpretation of the recent experiments showing the gapless conductivity of a Nb film measured by Lee et al. [1] which describes better their data for magnetic field above 1 T. In the Faraday geometry, we analyze the terahertz conductivity of three NbN films with varying thicknesses using the Maxwell-Garnett model, treating vortices as normal-state inclusions within a superconducting matrix. Moreover, we effectively account for ubiquitous pair-conserving and magnetic-field-dependent pair-breaking disorder scattering processes using the model of Herman and Hlubina [2].</description>

      <title>Majorana Flat Bands in the Vortex Line of Superconducting Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find that there exist Majorana flat bands (MFBs) in the vortex line of superconducting (SC) Weyl semimetals which break time reversal symmetry. Since a Weyl semimetal can be regarded as Chern insulators stacked along one (z) direction, so we decompose the vortex bound states of SC Weyl semimetals into the vortex bound states of SC Chern insulators labelled by kz. After calculating the topological phase diagram of the SC Chern insulators both analytically and numerically, we can explain the appearance of MFBs and determine the exact boundaries of them in SC Weyl semimetals. What's more, tuning the chemical potential or the pairing strength can result in the MFBs along the whole kz axis. Based on the above understanding, we propose a kz-dependent Z2 Chern-Simons invariant to characterize the MFBs. Finally, if we further consider an attractive Hubbard interaction, the aforementioned SC Weyl semimetal and MFBs can be realized under appropriate parameters.</description>

      <title>Observation of superconductivity in a nontrivial $\mathcal{Z}_2$ approximant quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity and nontrivial topology are highly sought-after phenomena in quantum materials. While many topological crystalline materials have been found to exhibit superconductivity, their presence in quasicrystals - materials with a unique aperiodic yet ordered structure - has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we report the discovery of superconductivity in a monoclinic approximant to the decagonal quasicrystal Al$_{13}$Os$_{4}$, that exhibits a high superconducting transition temperature and a nontrivial electronic structure. The resistivity, magnetization, specific heat, and $\mu$SR measurements confirm superconductivity with a critical temperature of $\sim5.47$ K. Detailed electronic structure and symmetry analysis reveal nontrivial state with $\mathcal{Z}_{2}=1$ and spin-polarized conducting surface states. Importantly, we identify three-dimensional saddle point van Hove singularities with substantial flat energy dispersion at the Fermi level, which can enhance superconductivity. Our results highlight a rich interplay between superconductivity and nontrivial electronic states in Al$_{13}$Os$_{4}$, demonstrating it as a unique platform for exploring unconventional superconducting states in quasicrystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Coherence Peak in Cuprate Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hebel-Slichter coherence peak, observed in the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ just below the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$, serves as a crucial experimental validation of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer pairing symmetry in conventional superconductors. However, no coherence peak in $1/T_1$ has been observed in unconventional superconductors like cuprates. In this study, an unconventional coherence peak is identified for the first time using nuclear quadrupole resonance on YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$, pointing to a distinctive pairing symmetry. The spin-lattice relaxation rate in nuclear quadrupole resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance with nuclear spin $I&gt;1/2$ comprises the magnetic relaxation rate $1/T_{1}^{\rm mag}$, which probes magnetic fluctuations, and the quadrupole relaxation rate $1/T_{1}^{\rm quad}$, which probes charge fluctuations. By utilizing $^{63}$Cu and $^{65}$Cu isotopes, we successfully distinguish $1/T_{1}^{\rm mag}$ and $1/T_{1 }^{\rm quad}$ of YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ and reveal the presence of the coherence peak in $1/T_{1 }^{\rm quad}$ but not in $1/T_{1}^{\rm mag}$, in contrast to conventional superconductors. Our finding demonstrates that unconventional superconductors do not exhibit a coherence peak in $1/T_{1}$ when the relaxation is due to fluctuations of the hyperfine field. Conversely, a coherence peak is expected when the relaxation is caused by electric field gradient fluctuations, due to the different coherence factors between charge and magnetic fluctuations. Our successful measurements of $1/T_{1}$ for the chains of YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ suggest that, should the conditions for predominant quadrupole relaxation be satisfied, this phenomenon could provide a novel approach to exploring the unconventional nature of the pairing mechanism in other superconductors.</description>

      <title>Sputtering Current Driven Growth &amp; Transport Characteristics of Superconducting Ti40V60 Alloy Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The room temperature growth, characterization, and electrical transport properties of magnetron sputtered superconducting Ti40V60 alloy thin films are presented. The films exhibit low surface roughness and tunable transport properties. As the sputtering current increases, the superconducting transition move towards higher temperatures. Rietveld refinement of two dimensional XRD (2D XRD) pattern reveals the presence of stress in the films, which shifts from tensile to compressive as the sputtering current increases. Additionally, the crystallite size of the films increases with higher sputtering currents. The films exhibit a strong preferential orientation, contributing to their texturing. The crystallite size and texturing are found to be correlated with the superconducting transition temperature (TC) of the films. As the crystallite size and texturing increase, the TC of the films also rises.</description>

      <title>Current-induced re-entrant superconductivity and extreme nonreciprocal superconducting diode effect in valley-polarized systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) refers to the nonreciprocity of superconducting critical currents for the metal-superconductor transition. Generally, the SDE has a positive and a negative critical current $j_{c\pm}$ corresponding to two opposite directions whose amplitudes are unequal. It is demonstrated that an extreme nonreciprocity where two critical currents can become both positive (or negative) has been observed in a recent experiment. In this work, we theoretically propose a possible mechanism to realize an extreme nonreciprocal SDE. Based on a microscopic theory and a simple valley-polarized model, we demonstrate that depairing currents required to dissolve Cooper pairs can be remodulated under the interplay between the valley polarization and the applied current. Near the disappearance of the superconductivity, the remodulation is shown to induce the extreme nonreciprocity and also the current-induced re-entrant superconductivity where the system has two different critical current intervals. Our study may provide new horizons for understanding the coexistence of superconductivity and spontaneous ferromagnetism and pave a new way to designing the SDE with 100% efficiency.</description>

      <title>Optical signatures of Euler superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optical manifestations of multigap band topology in multiband superconductors with a non-trivial topological Euler class. We introduce a set of lattice models for non-Abelian superconductors with the Euler invariant signified by a non-trivial quantum geometry. We then demonstrate that the topological Bogoliubov excitations realized in these models provide for a characteristic first-order optical response distinct from those of the other known topological superconductors. We find that the spectral distribution of the optical conductivity universally admits a topologically quantized jump and naturally differs from the features induced by the quantum geometry in the non-interacting bands without pairing terms. Further to uncovering observable signatures in first-order optical conductivities, we showcase that the higher-order nonlinear optical responses of the non-Abelian Euler superconductor can result in enhanced steady dc currents that fingerprint the exotic topological invariant. Finally, by employing a diagrammatic approach, we generalize our findings beyond the specific models of Euler superconductors.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Impurity Induced In-gap Bound States In Unconventional Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study revisits the effects of single impurity scattering in unconventional superconductors, with a specific emphasis on intralayer $d$-wave pairing and interlayer $s$-wave pairing. We reveal that in the context of a square lattice near half-filling doping, there exists an intrinsic connection between the $d$-wave pairing symmetry and the appearance of mid-gap states. This relationship is determined by the $C_4$ rotational symmetry of both the $d$-wave gap amplitude and the square lattice itself. Furthermore, we identify an intrinsic link between the in-gap states and the sign change of the order parameter. In systems with interlayer pairing, strong resonant peaks are observed, despite the absence of sign-reversal characteristics in the pairing order parameter. By utilizing the $T$-matrix approach, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying these impurity-induced states. Our theoretical framework is pertinent to the analysis of newly discovered nickel-based high-temperature superconductors, providing a powerful tool for distinguishing their pairing properties. The results of this study shed light on the complex interplay between pairing symmetries and impurity effects in unconventional superconductors, paving the way for future investigations into the unique properties of these emerging materials.</description>

      <title>Theory of superconducting proximity effect in hole-based hybrid semiconductor-superconductor devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor systems have received a great deal of attention in the last few years because of their potential for quantum engineering, including novel qubits and topological devices. The proximity effect, the process by which the semiconductor inherits superconducting correlations, is an essential physical mechanism of such hybrids. Recent experiments have demonstrated the proximity effect in hole-based semiconductors, but, in contrast to electrons, the precise mechanism by which the hole bands acquire superconducting correlations remains an open question. In addition, hole spins exhibit a complex strong spin-orbit interaction, with largely anisotropic responses to electric and magnetic fields, further motivating the importance of understanding the interplay between such effects and the proximity effect. In this work, we analyze this physics with focus on germanium-based two-dimensional gases. Specifically, we develop an effective theory supported by full numerics, allowing us to extract various analytical expressions and predict different types of superconducting correlations including non-standard forms of singlet and triplet pairing mechanisms with non-trivial momentum dependence; as well as different Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit contributions. This, together with their precise dependence on electric and magnetic fields, allows us to make specific experimental predictions, including the emergence of f-type superconductivity, Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, and gapless regimes caused by large in-plane magnetic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry, characterized by the quantum geometric tensor, is pivotal in diverse physical phenomena in quantum materials. In condensed matter systems, quantum geometry refers to the geoemtric properties of Bloch states in the Brillouin zone. This pedagogical review provides an accessible introduction to the concept of quantum geometry, emphasizing its extensive implications across multiple domains. Specifically, we discuss the role of quantum geometry in optical responses, Landau levels, and fractional Chern insulators, as well as its influence on superfluid weight, spin stiffness, exciton condensates, electron-phonon coupling, etc. By integrating these topics, we underscore the pervasive significance of quantum geometry in understanding emergent behaviors in quantum materials. Finally, we present an outlook on open questions and potential future directions, highlighting the need for continued exploration in this rapidly developing field.</description>

      <title>Universal Wilson loop Bound of Quantum Geometry: $Z_2$ Bound and Physical Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the absolute Wilson loop winding and prove that it bounds the quantum metric from below. This Wilson loop lower bound naturally reproduces the known Chern and Euler bounds of the quantum metric, and provides an explicit lower bound of the quantum metric due to the time-reversal protected $Z_2$ index, answering a hitherto open question. In general, the Wilson loop lower bound can be applied to any other topological invariants characterized by Wilson loop winding, such as the particle-hole $Z_2$ index. As physical consequences of the $Z_2$ bound, we show that the time-reversal $Z_2$ index bounds superfluid weight and optical conductivity from below, and bounds the direct gap of a band insulator from above.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is a promising converter technology for various highvoltage high-power applications. The reason to that is low-distortion output quantities can be achieved with low average switching frequencies per switch and without output filters. Modular multilevel converter pulse width modulation based control approaches are evaluated. The multicarrier PWM techniques such as Phase disposition PWM (PDPWM), Phase opposition disposition PWM (PODPWM), Alternate phase opposition disposition PWM (APODPWM) is employed and a comparative study is done based on the quality of the load voltage and load current output. This paper presents the simulation of single phase modular multilevel converter based on Half-Bridge sub module topology. Simulation has been carried out for various modulation techniques using MATLAB/Simulink and the results are observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Almost a century on from the culmination of the first revolution in quantum physics, we are poised for another. Even as we engage in the creation of impactful quantum technologies, it is imperative for us to face the challenges in understanding the phenomenology of various emergent forms of quantum matter. This will involve building on decades of progress in quantum condensed matter physics, and going beyond the well-established Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson paradigm for quantum matter. We outline and discuss several outstanding challenges, including the need to explore and identify the organisational principles that can guide the development of theories, key experimental phenomenologies that continue to confound, and the formulation of methods that enable progress. These efforts will enable the prediction of new quantum materials whose properties facilitate the creation of next generation technologies.</description>

      <title>Measurable Improvement in Multi-Qubit Readout Using a Kinetic Inductance Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasing the size and complexity of quantum information systems requires highly-multiplexed readout architectures, as well as amplifier chains operating near the quantum limit (QL) of added noise. While documented prior efforts in KITWPA integration in quantum systems are scarce, in this work we demonstrate integration of a KI-TWPA with a multiplexed-qubit device. To quantify the system noise improvement we perform an ac Stark shift calibration to precisely determine noise power levels on-chip (at each cavity's reference plane) and the total system gain. We then characterize the qubit state measurement fidelity and the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To conduct the most faithful measurement of the benefits offered by the KI-TWPA we perform these measurements for readout chains where the high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier is the first-stage amplifier (FSA) - with none of the external hardware required to operate the KI-TWPA - and with the KI-TWPA as the FSA. While some readout cavities fall outside the KI-TWPA bandwidth, for those inside the bandwidth we demonstrate a maximum improvement in the state measurement SNR by a factor of 1.45, and increase the fidelity from 96.2% to 97.8%. These measurements demonstrate a system noise below 5 quanta referenced on-chip and we bound the KI-TWPA excess noise to be below 4 quanta for the six cavities inside its bandwidth. These results show a promising path forward for realizing quantum-limited readout chains in large qubit systems using a single parametric amplifier.</description>

      <title>Electron Interactions in Rashba Materials</title>

Abstract: We present a bunch of novel phenomena stemming from the pair spin-orbit interaction (PSOI), which does not rely on structure inversion asymmetry but instead arises from Coulomb fields of interacting electrons in materials with a strong Rashba effect. First, PSOI can induce $p-$wave superconducting order without the need for any mediators of attraction. Depending on the sign and strength of the PSOI coupling, two distinct superconducting phases emerge in 3D systems, analogous to the A and B phases observed in superfluid $^3\mathrm{He}$. In contrast, 2D systems exhibit $p^x\pm i p^y$ order parameter, leading to the time-reversal-invariant topological superconductivity. Second, a sufficiently strong PSOI can induce ferromagnetic ordering. It is associated with a deformation of the Fermi surface, which eventually leads to a Lifshitz transition from a spherical to a toroidal Fermi surface, with a number of experimentally observable signatures. Finally, in sufficiently clean Rashba materials, ferromagnetism and $p-$wave superconductivity may coexist. This state resembles the $\mathrm{A}_1$ phase of $^3\mathrm{He}$, yet it may avoid nodal points due to the toroidal shape of the Fermi surface.</description>

      <title>Optical and transport properties of NbN thin films revisited</title>

Abstract: Highly disordered NbN thin films exhibit promising superconducting and optical properties. Despite extensive study, discrepancies in its basic electronic properties persist. Analysis of the optical conductivity of disordered ultra-thin NbN films, obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry by standard Drude-Lorentz model, provides inconsistent parameters. We argue that this discrepancy arise from neglecting the presence of quantum corrections to conductivity in the IR range. To resolve this matter, we propose a modification to the Drude-Lorentz model, incorporating quantum corrections. The parameters obtained from the modified model are consistent not only with transport and superconducting measurements but also with ab initio calculations. The revisited values describing conduction electrons, which differ significantly from commonly adopted ones, are the electron relaxation rate $\Gamma\approx1.8~\textrm{eV}/\hbar$, the Fermi velocity $v_F \approx 0.7 \times 10^{6}~\textrm{ms}^{-1}$ and the electron density of states $N(E_F)=2~$states of both spins/eV/$V_{\textrm{f.u.}}$.</description>

      <title>Flat-band FFLO State from Quantum Geometric Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new scheme for the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) Cooper pairing states within ultraflat bands. Central to our approach is the concept of "quantum geometric discrepancy" (QGD), which characterizes the discrepancy in the quantum geometry of paired electrons, giving rise to the flat-band FFLO instability. Remarkably, we find that this instability is directly related to a new quantum geometric quantity we term "anomalous quantum distance", which formally captures QGD. To model both QGD and the anomalous quantum distance, we examine a flat-band electronic Hamiltonian with tunable spin-dependent quantum metrics. Utilizing the band-projection method, we analyze the QGD-induced FFLO instability from pair susceptibility near the superconducting critical temperature. Furthermore, we perform self-consistent mean-field calculations to obtain the phase diagram of the BCS-FFLO transition driven by QGD, which aligns well with our analytical results. We emphasize that QGD serves as a distinctive protocol for stabilizing the flat-band FFLO phase.</description>

      <title>Predicting topological invariants and unconventional superconducting pairing from density of states and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Competition between magnetism and superconductivity can lead to unconventional and topological superconductivity. However, the experimental confirmation of the presence of Majorana edge states and unconventional pairing currently poses a major challenge. Here we consider a two-dimensional lattice model for a superconductor with spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling to randomly distributed magnetic impurities. Depending on parameters of the model, this system may display topologically trivial or nontrivial edge states. We map out the phase diagram by computing the Bott index, a topological invariant defined in real space. We then use machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the Bott index from the local density of states (LDOS) at zero energy, obtaining high-accuracy results. We also train ML models to predict the amplitude of odd-frequency pairing in the anomalous Green's function at zero energy. Once the ML models are trained using the LDOS, which is experimentally accessible via scanning tunneling spectroscopy, our method could be applied to predict the number of Majorana edge states and to estimate the magnitude of odd-frequency pairing in real materials.</description>

      <title>Hund's Rule, Interorbital Hybridization, and High-$T_c$ Superconductivity in the Bilayer Nickelate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the pairing mechanism in bilayer nickelate superconductors constitutes a fascinating quest. Using density matrix renormalization group for $T=0$ and thermal tensor networks for $T&gt;0$ properties, along with density functional theory calculations, we investigate the intriguing interplay between the Hund's rule coupling and interorbital hybridization that explains the pressure-dependent high-$T_c$ superconductivity in bilayer nickelates. By studying a two-orbital model, we identify three distinct superconductive (SC) regimes: hybridization dominant, Hund's rule dominant, and the hybrid-Hund synergistic SC regimes. In these SC regimes, both $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals exhibit algebraic pairing correlations with similar Luttinger parameters $K_{\rm SC}$. In particular, the former always exhibits a much stronger amplitude than the latter, with a distinctly higher SC characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Below this temperature, the pairing susceptibility diverges as $\chi_{\rm SC}(T) \sim 1/T^{2-K_{\rm SC}}$. With realistic model parameters, we find the pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ falls into the Hund's rule dominated SC regime. As hybridization further enhances under pressure, it leads to significant interorbital frustration and in turn suppresses the SC correlations, explaining the rise and fall of high-$T_c$ superconductivity under high pressure [J. Li, et al., arXiv:2404.11369 (2024)]. Our results offer a comprehensive understanding of the interlayer pairing in superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Tuned Metal-Insulator Transition in LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ Nanowire Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wide family of two dimensional (2D) systems, including stripe-phase superconductors, sliding Luttinger liquids, and anisotropic 2D materials, can be modeled by an array of coupled one-dimensional (1D) electron channels or nanowire arrays. Here we report experiments in arrays of conducting nanowires with gate and field tunable interwire coupling, that are programmed at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. We find a magnetically-tuned metal-to-insulator transition in which the transverse resistance of the nanowire array increases by up to four orders of magnitude. To explain this behavior, we develop a minimal model of a coupled two-wire system which agrees well with observed phenomena. These nanowire arrays can serve as a model systems to understand the origin of exotic behavior in correlated materials via analog quantum simulation.</description>
