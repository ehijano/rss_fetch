      <title>Symmetric Poisson geometry, totally geodesic foliations and Jacobi-Jordan algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce symmetric Poisson structures as pairs consisting of a symmetric bivector field and a torsion-free connection satisfying an integrability condition analogous to that in usual Poisson geometry. Equivalent conditions in Poisson geometry have inequivalent analogues in symmetric Poisson geometry and we distinguish between symmetric and strong symmetric Poisson structures. We prove that symmetric Poisson structures correspond to locally geodesically invariant distributions together with a characteristic metric, whereas strong symmetric Poisson structures correspond to totally geodesic foliations together with a leaf metric and a leaf connection. We introduce, using the Patterson-Walker metric, a dynamics on the cotangent bundle and show its connection to symmetric Poisson geometry, the parallel transport equation and the Newtonian equation for conservative systems. Finally, we prove that linear symmetric Poisson structures are in correspondence with Jacobi-Jordan algebras, whereas strong symmetric correspond to those that are moreover associative.</description>

      <title>Perturbation and Pruning of Nondegenerate $\mathbb{Z}/2$ Harmonic 1-forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any nondegenerate $\mathbb{Z}/2$ harmonic $1$-form, there exists a metric perturbation producing a new nondegenerate $\mathbb{Z}/2$ harmonic $1$-form whose ordinary zero set is discrete. As an application, we show that for generic smooth nondegenerate $\mathbb{Z}/2$ harmonic $1$-forms, the leaf spaces are $\mathbb{Z}$-trees. Moreover, we show that if a $3$-dimensional rational homology sphere admits a smooth nondegenerate $\mathbb{Z}/2$-harmonic $1$-form, then there exists another nondegenerate $\mathbb{Z}/2$-harmonic $1$-form whose singular locus has exactly two connected components.</description>

      <title>Curvature at the infinity of asymptotically flat Einstein manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct coordinates at the infinity of an asymptotically flat end of a Ricci-flat manifold $(M_m, g)$ as long as the $L^{m/2}$ norm of the curvature is finite in this end. As applications, we can define a Weyl tensor at the infinity of $M$ and a version of renormalized volume following Biquard and Hein to ALE Ricci-flat manifolds/orbifolds of any dimension.</description>

      <title>Negatively curved K\"ahler metrics on total spaces of a class of vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show an abundance of complete K\"ahler metrics with negative holomorphic bisectional curvature on total spaces of certain vector bundles. Assume that such total spaces are endowed with a wider class of nonpositively curved K\"ahler metrics. We prove dimension estimates on holomorphic functions on these manifolds, as well as Liouville theorems for holomorphic mappings between them.</description>

      <title>Geodesic nets via eigenvalue optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a connection between geodesic nets and quantum graphs optimising certain functionals from spectral theory. For surfaces, critical metrics for the normalised $k^{\mathrm{th}}$ eigenvalue of the Laplacian give rise to isometric minimal immersions to a unit sphere. In this spirit we obtain geodesic nets from optimal quantum graphs, and obstructions to the existence of critical metrics.</description>

      <title>Rigid models for 2-gerbes I: Chern-Simons geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the problem of constructing explicit geometric string structures, we give a rigid model for bundle 2-gerbes, and define connective structures thereon. This model is designed to make explicit calculations easier in applications to physics. To compare to the existing definition, we give a functorial construction of a bundle 2-gerbe as in the literature from our rigid model, including with connections. As an example we prove that the Chern--Simons bundle 2-gerbe from the literature, with its connective structure, can be rigidified -- it arises, up to isomorphism in the strongest possible sense, from a rigid bundle 2-gerbe with connective structure via this construction. Further, our rigid version of 2-gerbe trivialisation (with connections) gives rise to trivialisations (with connections) of bundle 2-gerbes in the usual sense, and as such can be used to describe geometric string structures.</description>

      <title>Generalized Yamabe Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a family of conformal flows generalizing the classical Yamabe flow. We prove that for a large class of such flows long-time existence holds, and the arguments are in fact simpler than in the classical case. Moreover, we establish convergence for the case of negative scalar curvature and expect a similar statement for the positive and the flat cases as well.</description>

      <title>Affine vector fields on compact pseudo-K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that a Killing field on a compact pseudo-K\"ahler manifold is necessarily (real) holomorphic, as long as the manifold satisfies some relatively mild additional conditions. We provide two further proofs of this fact and discuss the natural open question whether the same conclusion holds for affine -- rather than Killing -- vector fields. The question cannot be settled by invoking the Killing case: Boubel and Mounoud [Trans.Amer. Math. Soc. 368, 2016, 2223--2262] constructed examples of non-Killing affine vector fields on compact pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. We show that an affine vector field v is necessarily symplectic, and establish some algebraic and differential properties of the Lie derivative of the metric along v, such as its being parallel, antilinear and nilpotent as an endomorphism of the tangent bundle. As a consequence, the answer to the above question turns out to be `yes' whenever the underlying manifold admits no nontrivial holomorphic quadratic differentials, which includes the case of compact almost homogeneous complex manifolds with nonzero Euler characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an application of a Huisken monotonicity-type formula for the mean curvature flow in a compact smooth manifold with a Riemannian metric that evolves by a shrinking self-similar solution of the extended Ricci flow. Our investigation builds on previous articles by Huisken and the third author as we apply their techniques to establish new results in this geometric setting. Moreover, under some natural geometric assumptions, the noncompact case is also solved</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.06917v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Canonical bundle formula due to Kawamata and others has played fundamental roles in algebraic geometry. We show that the canonical bundle formula has analytic characterization in terms of fiberwise integration, which confirms a folklore conjecture. The proof uses $L^2$ metrics and the valuative equivalence of plurisubharmonic singularities. As an application, we identify the singularity of the Ohsawa measure in a general $L^2$ extension theorem of Demailly for log canonical pairs. As another consequence, we give a partial answer to a question of Berndtsson on semipositivity theorems.</description>

      <title>The essential regularity of singular connections in Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we accomplish three things: (i) We discover the geometric (true) regularity of affine connections, their essential (highest possible) regularity, a geometric property independent of starting atlas. (ii) We give a checkable necessary and sufficient condition for determining whether or not connections are at their essential regularity, based on the relative regularity of the connection and its Riemann curvature. (iii) We introduce a computable procedure for lifting any $L^p$ affine connection in an atlas ($p&gt;n$), to a new atlas in which the connection exhibits its essential regularity. To accomplish this, we prove that the RT-equations, originally designed by the authors to locally lift the regularity of singular connections by just one derivative, surprisingly, also induce an implicit hidden regularization of the Riemann curvature tensor, together with a global regularization of transition maps between regularizing coordinate charts. From this we deduce a multi-step regularization of the connection, and construct a new atlas in which the connection exhibits its essential regularity. The present paper is a culmination of the theory of the RT-equations which provides a definitive theory for determining whether or not singularities in an $L^p$ affine connection ($p&gt;n$) are essential or removable by coordinate transformation, together with an explicit procedure for lifting removable singularities to their essential regularity, both locally and globally. This includes GR shock wave singularities and cusp singularities (continuous metrics with infinite gradients), both obstacles to numerical simulation. We propose the essential regularity of a connection to be the point where an intrinsic level of regularity enters the subject of Geometry.</description>

      <title>Differentiable groupoid objects and their abstract Lie algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The infinitesimal counterpart of a Lie groupoid is its Lie algebroid. As a vector bundle, it is given by the source vertical tangent bundle restricted to the identity bisection. Its sections can be identified with the invariant vector fields on the groupoid, which are closed under the Lie bracket. We generalize this differentiation procedure to groupoid objects in any category with an abstract tangent structure in the sense of Rosick\'{y} and a scalar multiplication by a ring object that plays the role of the real numbers. We identify the categorical conditions that the groupoid object must satisfy to admit a natural notion of invariant vector fields. Then we show that invariant vector fields are closed under the Lie bracket defined by Rosick\'{y} and satisfy the Leibniz rule with respect to ring-valued morphisms on the base of the groupoid. The result is what we define axiomatically as an abstract Lie algebroid, by generalizing the underlying vector bundle to a module object in the slice category over its base. Examples include diffeomorphism groups, bisection groups of Lie groupoids, the diffeological symmetry groupoids of general relativity (Blohmann/Fernandes/Weinstein), symmetry groupoids in Lagrangian Field Theory, holonomy groupoids of singular foliations, elastic diffeological groupoids, groupoid objects in differentiable stacks, and affine groupoid schemes.</description>
