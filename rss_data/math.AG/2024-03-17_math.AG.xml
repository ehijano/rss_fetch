      <title>A Resolution of the Diagonal for Smooth Toric Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beilinson gave a resolution of the diagonal for complex projective spaces which Bayer-Popescu-Sturmfels generalized to what they refer to as unimodular toric varieties. Here, we generalize the resolution of the diagonal due to Bayer-Popescu-Sturmfels to smooth toric varieties.</description>

      <title>Hypertangency of plane curves and the algebraic exceptional set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate plane curves intersecting in at most two unibranched points to study the algebraic exceptional set appearing in standard conjectures of diophantine and hyperbolic geometry. Our first result compares the local geometry of two hypertangent curves, i.e. curves having maximal contact at one unibranched point. This is applied to fully describe the exceptional set and, more generally, the hyper-bitangency set, of a plane curve with three components.</description>

      <title>Symmetric products of Galois-Maximal varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main result of this paper is the proof that all the symmetric products of a finite Galois-Maximal space are Galois-Maximal spaces. This applies to the special case of real algebraic varieties, solving the problem first stated by Biswas and D'Mello in \cite{biswas&amp;d'mello:symmetric_products_M-curves} about symmetric products of Maximal curves. We also give characterisations of these spaces and state a new definition that generalises to a larger class of spaces. Then, we extend the characterisation in terms of the Borel cohomology given in \cite{us} to the new family. Finally, we introduce the notion of cohomological stability and cohomological splitting, provide a systematic treatment and relate them with the properties of being a Maximal or Galois-Maximal space. These cohomological properties play an important role in the proof of our main theorem.</description>

      <title>Cox rings of nef anticanonical rational surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the problem of computing a generating set for the Cox ring $R(X)$ of a smooth projective rational surface $X$ with nef anticanonical class. In case $R(X)$ is finitely generated, we show that the degrees of its generators are either classes of negative curves, elements of the Hilbert basis of the nef cone or certain ample classes of anticanonical degree one, which only appear when $X$ is a rational elliptic surface of Halphen index $m&gt;2$. Moreover, we partially characterize which elements of the Hilbert basis of the nef cone are irredundant for generating $R(X)$. We apply this result to compute explicit minimal generating sets for Cox rings of some rational elliptic surfaces of Halphen index $&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Poset polytopes and pipe dreams: toric degenerations and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate how pipe dreams can be applied to the theory of poset polytopes to produce toric degenerations of flag varieties. Specifically, we present such constructions for marked chain-order polytopes of Dynkin types A and C. These toric degenerations also give rise to further algebraic and geometric objects such as PBW-monomial bases and Newton--Okounkov bodies. We discuss a construction of the former in the type A case and of the latter in type C.</description>

      <title>Birational maps to Grassmannians, representations and poset polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the closure of the graph of the birational map from a projective space to a Grassmannian. We provide explicit description of the graph closure and compute the fibers of the natural projection to the Grassmannian. We construct embeddings of the graph closure to the projectivizations of certain cyclic representations of a degenerate special linear Lie algebra and study algebraic and combinatorial properties of these representations. In particular, we describe monomial bases, generalizing the FFLV bases. The proof relies on combinatorial properties of a new family of poset polytopes, which are of independent interest. As a consequence we obtain flat toric degenerations of the graph closure studied by Borovik, Sturmfels and Sverrisd\'ottir.</description>

      <title>On the functoriality of refined unramified cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalise the construction of the functorial pullback of refined unramified cohomology between smooth schemes, by following the ideas of Fulton's intersection theory and Rost's cycle modules. We also define standard actions of algebraic cycles on the refined unramified cohomology groups of smooth proper schemes avoiding Chow's moving lemma, which coincide with Schreieder's constructions for smooth projective schemes. As applications, we prove the projective bundle and blow-up formulas for refined unramified cohomology groups and we reduce the Rost nilpotence principle in characteristic zero to a statement concerning certain refined unramified cohomology groups. Moreover, we compute the refined unramified cohomology for smooth proper linear varieties and show that Rost's nilpotence principle holds for these varieties in characteristic zero.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the infinite half-spin representations are topologically Noetherian with respect to the infinite spin group. As a consequence we obtain that half-spin varieties, which we introduce, are defined by the pullback of equations at a finite level. The main example for such varieties is the infinite isotropic Grassmannian in its spinor embedding, for which we explicitly determine its defining equations.</description>

      <title>Fano fibrations and DK conjecture for relative Grassmann flips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a vector bundle $\mathcal E$ on a smooth projective variety $B$, the flag bundle $\mathcal F l(1,2,\mathcal E)$ admits two projective bundle structures over the Grassmann bundles $\mathcal G r(1, \mathcal E)$ and $G r(2, \mathcal E)$. The data of a general section of a suitably defined line bundle on $\mathcal F l(1,2,\mathcal E)$ defines two varieties: a cover $X_1$ of $B$ and a fibration $X_2$ on $B$ with general fiber isomorphic to a smooth Fano variety. We construct a semiorthogonal decomposition of the derived category of $X_2$ which consists of a list of exceptional objects and a subcategory equivalent to the derived category of $X_1$. As a byproduct, we obtain a new full exceptional collection for the Fano fourfold of degree $12$ and genus $7$. Any birational map of smooth projective varieties which is resolved by blowups with exceptional divisor $\mathcal F l(1, 2, \mathcal E)$ is an instance of a so-called Grassmann flip: we prove that the DK conjecture of Bondal-Orlov and Kawamata holds for such flips. This generalizes a previous result of Leung and Xie to a relative setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05514v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building sets were introduced in the study of wonderful compactifications of hyperplane arrangement complements and were later generalized to finite meet-semilattices. Convex geometries, the duals of antimatroids, offer a robust combinatorial abstraction of convexity. Supersolvable convex geometries and antimatroids appear in the study of poset closure operators, Coxeter groups, and matroid activities. We prove that the building sets on a finite meet-semilattice form a supersolvable convex geometry.</description>

      <title>Toric ranks and component groups of Jacobians of modular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p\neq{2,3}$ be a prime number and let $\Gamma \subset \mathrm{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ be a congruence subgroup with modular curve $X_{\Gamma}/K$ and Jacobian $J(X_{\Gamma})$. In this paper we give an explicit group-theoretic description of the semistable toric rank and component group of $J(X_{\Gamma})$ at the finite places of $K$ lying over $p$. We first produce a suitable deformation retract of the minimal Berkovich skeleton of $X_{H}$ in terms of Hecke-Iwahori double coset spaces. We call this deformation retract the pruned skeleton of the curve. Our description of this skeleton includes a group-theoretic formula for the edge lengths, allowing us to give the component group of the modular curve as the quotient of a lattice using the monodromy pairing. For $X_{0}(N)$, $X_{1}(N)$, $X_{sp}(N)$ and $X_{sp}^{+}(N)$, we explicitly determine the pruned skeleta using a set of coset schemes over $\mathbb{Z}$. This in particular recovers results by Deligne-Rapoport, Edixhoven, Coleman-McMurdy and Tsushima on the semistable reduction type of $X_{0}(p^{n})$ for $n\leq{4}$. Finally, we determine the geometric Tamagawa number and the prime-to-$2$ structure of the component group of $X_{0}(N)$ over the extension given by Krir's theorem.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of quadratic differentials: Abel-Jacobi map and deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the moduli space of quadratic differentials with prescribed singularities parameterized by a decorated marked surface with punctures (DMSp), where simple zeros, double poles and higher order poles respectively correspond to decorations, punctures and boundary components. We show that the fundamental group of this space equals the kernel of the Abel-Jacobi map from the mapping class group of DMSp to the first homology group of the marked surface (without decorations/punctures). Moreover, a universal cover of this space is given by the space of stability conditions on the associated 3-Calabi-Yau category.
  Furthermore, when we partial compactify (and orbifold) the moduli space by allowing the collision of simple zeros and some of the double poles, the resulting moduli space is isomorphic to a quotient of the space of stability conditions on the deformed (with respect to those collidable double poles) 3-Calabi-Yau category.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.00802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G_{n,2n}$ be the Grassmannian parameterizing the $n$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^{2n}.$ The Picard group of $G_{n,2n}$ is generated by a unique ample line bundle $\mathcal{O}(1).$ Let $T$ be a maximal torus of $SL(2n,\mathbb{C})$ which acts on $G_{n,2n}$ and $\mathcal{O}(1).$ By \cite[Theorem 3.10, p.764]{Kum}, $2$ is the minimal integer $k$ such that $\mathcal{O}(k)$ descends to the GIT quotient. In this article, we prove that the GIT quotient of $G_{n,2n}$ ($n\ge 3$) by $T$ with respect to $\mathcal{O}(2)=\mathcal{O}(1)^{\otimes 2}$ is not projectively normal when polarized with the descent of $\mathcal{O}(2).$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a description of the cohomology groups of the structure sheaf on smooth compactifications $\overline{X}(w)$ of Deligne--Lusztig varieties $X(w)$ for ${\rm GL}_n$, for all elements $w$ in the Weyl group. As a consequence, we obtain the ${\rm mod}\ p^m$ and integral $p$-adic \'{e}tale cohomology of $\overline{X}(w)$. Moreover, using our result for $\overline{X}(w)$ and a spectral sequence associated to a stratification of $\overline{X}(w)$, we deduce the ${\rm mod}\ p^m$ and integral $p$-adic \'{e}tale cohomology with compact support of $X(w)$.
  In our proof of the main theorem, in addition to considering the Demazure--Hansen smooth compactifications of $X(w)$, we show that a similar class of constructions provide smooth compactifications of $X(w)$ in the case of ${\rm GL}_n$. Furthermore, we show in the appendix that the Zariski closure of $X(w)$, for any connected reductive group $G$ and any $w$, has pseudo-rational singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02288v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the construction of the stable homotopy category by Khan-Ravi to calculate the integral $T$-equivariant $K$-theory spectrum of a flag variety over an affine scheme, where $T$ is a split torus associated to the flag variety. More precisely, we show that the $T$-equivariant $K$-theory ring spectrum of a flag variety is decomposed into a direct sum of $K$-theory spectra of the classifying stack $\text{B}T$ indexed by the associated Weyl group. We also explain how to relate these results to the motivic world and deduce classical results for $T$-equivariant intersection theory and $K$-theory of flag varieties.\par For this purpose, we analyze the motive of schemes stratified by affine spaces with group action, that preserves these stratifications. We work with cohomology theories, that satisfy certain vanishing conditions, which are satisfied for example by motivic cohomology and $K$-Theory.</description>

      <title>Construction of Arithmetic Teichmuller Spaces III: A `Rosetta Stone' and a proof of Mochizuki's Corollary 3.12</title>

Abstract: This is a continuation of my work on Arithmetic Teichmuller Spaces (arXiv:2106.11452, arXiv:2210.11635, arXiv:2303.01662, arXiv:2305.10398). This paper establishes a number of important results including (1) a proof Mochizuki's Corollary 3.12 (2) establishes a `Rosetta Stone' for a parallel reading of Mochizuki's Inter-Universal Teichmuller Theory and my Theory of Arithmetic Teichmuller Spaces, and (3) a proof that Mochizuki's gluing of Hodge-Theaters, Frobenioids along prime-strips as described in his theory is naturally provided by the existence of Arithmetic Teichmuller Spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Intersection of Two Conics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding the intersection of two conics is a commonly occurring problem. For example, it occurs when identifying patterns of craters on the lunar surface, detecting the orientation of a face from a single image, or estimating the attitude of a camera from 2D-to-3D point correspondences. Regardless of the application, the study of this classical problem presents a number of delightful geometric results.
  In most of the cases, the intersection points are computed by finding the degenerate conic consisting of two lines passing through the common points. Once a linear combination of the two conic matrices has been constructed, the solution of an eigenvalue problem provides four possible degenerate conics, of which only one coincides with the sought pair of lines. Then, the method proceeds by finding the intersection between one of the conics and the two lines. Other approaches make use of different methods, such as Gr\"obner bases or geometric algebra.
  Conic intersection, however, may be solved more intuitively with a convenient change of coordinates. In this work, we will consider two such coordinate changes. In the first approach, one of the conics is transformed into a parabola, which reduces the intersection problem to finding the solution of a quartic. In the second approach, we instead use the concept of self-polar triangles - which, amazingly, reduces the conic intersection problem to the solution of a simple quadratic equation.</description>
