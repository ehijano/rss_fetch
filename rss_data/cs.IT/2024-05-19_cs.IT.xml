      <title>Codes for Limited-Magnitude Probability Error in DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA, with remarkable properties of high density, durability, and replicability, is one of the most appealing storage media. Emerging DNA storage technologies use composite DNA letters, where information is represented by probability vectors, leading to higher information density and lower synthesizing costs than regular DNA letters. However, it faces the problem of inevitable noise and information corruption. This paper explores the channel of composite DNA letters in DNA-based storage systems and introduces block codes for limited-magnitude probability errors on probability vectors. First, outer and inner bounds for limited-magnitude probability error correction codes are provided. Moreover, code constructions are proposed where the number of errors is bounded by t, the error magnitudes are bounded by l, and the probability resolution is fixed as k. These constructions focus on leveraging the properties of limited-magnitude probability errors in DNA-based storage systems, leading to improved performance in terms of complexity and redundancy. In addition, the asymptotic optimality for one of the proposed constructions is established. Finally, systematic codes based on one of the proposed constructions are presented, which enable efficient information extraction for practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Information Theory for Holographic MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) utilizes a compact antenna array to form a nearly continuous aperture, thereby enhancing higher capacity and more flexible configurations compared with conventional MIMO systems, making it attractive in current scientific research. Key questions naturally arise regarding the potential of HMIMO to surpass Shannon's theoretical limits and how far its capabilities can be extended. However, the traditional Shannon information theory falls short in addressing these inquiries because it only focuses on the information itself while neglecting the underlying carrier, electromagnetic (EM) waves, and environmental interactions. To fill up the gap between the theoretical analysis and the practical application for HMIMO systems, we introduce electromagnetic information theory (EIT) in this paper. This paper begins by laying the foundation for HMIMO-oriented EIT, encompassing EM wave equations and communication regions. In the context of HMIMO systems, the resultant physical limitations are presented, involving Chu's limit, Harrington's limit, Hannan's limit, and the evaluation of coupling effects. Field sampling and HMIMO-assisted oversampling are also discussed to guide the optimal HMIMO design within the EIT framework. To comprehensively depict the EM-compliant propagation process, we present the approximate and exact channel modeling approaches in near-/far-field zones. Furthermore, we discuss both traditional Shannon's information theory, employing the probabilistic method, and Kolmogorov information theory, utilizing the functional analysis, for HMIMO-oriented EIT systems.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Performance Analysis of Multi-Functional RIS-Assisted NOMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can improve the secrecy communication performance of wireless users, it still faces challenges such as limited coverage and double-fading effect. To address these issues, in this paper, we utilize a novel multi-functional RIS (MF-RIS) to enhance the secrecy performance of wireless users, and investigate the physical layer secrecy problem in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and secrecy throughput of users in the MF-RIS-assisted NOMA networks with external and internal eavesdroppers. The asymptotic expressions for SOP and secrecy diversity order are also analyzed under high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additionally, we examine the impact of receiver hardware limitations and error transmission-induced imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) on the secrecy performance. Numerical results indicate that: i) under the same power budget, the secrecy performance achieved by MF-RIS significantly outperforms active RIS and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS; ii) with increasing power budget, residual interference caused by imperfect SIC surpasses thermal noise as the primary factor affecting secrecy capacity; and iii) deploying additional elements at the MF-RIS brings significant secrecy enhancements for the external eavesdropping scenario, in contrast to the internal eavesdropping case.</description>

      <title>On the Design of Super Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, which demand ultra high data rates, this study introduces the concept of super constellation communications. Also, we present super amplitude phase shift keying (SAPSK), an innovative modulation technique designed to achieve these ultra high data rate demands. SAPSK is complemented by the generalized polar distance detector (GPD-D), which approximates the optimal maximum likelihood detector in channels with Gaussian phase noise (GPN). By leveraging the decision regions formulated by GPD-D, a tight closed-form approximation for the symbol error probability (SEP) of SAPSK constellations is derived, while a detection algorithm with O(1) time complexity is developed to ensure fast and efficient SAPSK symbol detection. Finally, the theoretical performance of SAPSK and the efficiency of the proposed O(1) algorithm are validated by numerical simulations, highlighting both its superiority in terms of SEP compared to various constellations and its practical advantages in terms of fast and accurate symbol detection.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Symbol Detection for Intersymbol Interference Channels with Bursty Impulsive Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed machine learning approaches for data-driven trellis-based soft symbol detection in coded transmission over intersymbol interference (ISI) channels in presence of bursty impulsive noise (IN), for example encountered in wireless digital broadcasting systems and vehicular communications. This enabled us to obtain optimized detectors based on the Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm while circumventing the use of full channel state information (CSI) for computing likelihoods and trellis state transition probabilities. First, we extended the application of the neural network (NN)-aided BCJR, recently proposed for ISI channels with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Although suitable for estimating likelihoods via labeling of transmission sequences, the BCJR-NN method does not provide a framework for learning the trellis state transitions. In addition to detection over the joint ISI and IN states we also focused on another scenario where trellis transitions are not trivial: detection for the ISI channel with AWGN with inaccurate knowledge of the channel memory at the receiver. Without access to the accurate state transition matrix, the BCJR- NN performance significantly degrades in both settings. To this end, we devised an alternative approach for data-driven BCJR detection based on the unsupervised learning of a hidden Markov model (HMM). The BCJR-HMM allowed us to optimize both the likelihood function and the state transition matrix without labeling. Moreover, we demonstrated the viability of a hybrid NN and HMM BCJR detection where NN is used for learning the likelihoods, while the state transitions are optimized via HMM. While reducing the required prior channel knowledge, the examined data-driven detectors with learned trellis state transitions achieve bit error rates close to the optimal full CSI-based BCJR, significantly outperforming detection with inaccurate CSI.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Machine Learning-powered Combinatorial Auction Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to machine learning-powered combinatorial auctions, which is based on the principles of Differential Privacy. Our methodology guarantees that the auction mechanism is truthful, meaning that rational bidders have the incentive to reveal their true valuation functions. We achieve this by inducing truthfulness in the auction dynamics, ensuring that bidders consistently provide accurate information about their valuation functions.
  Our method not only ensures truthfulness but also preserves the efficiency of the original auction. This means that if the initial auction outputs an allocation with high social welfare, our modified truthful version of the auction will also achieve high social welfare. We use techniques from Differential Privacy, such as the Exponential Mechanism, to achieve these results. Additionally, we examine the application of differential privacy in auctions across both asymptotic and non-asymptotic regimes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Service Placement, Request Routing and CPU Sizing in Cooperative Mobile Edge Computing Networks for Delay-Sensitive Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study joint optimization of service placement, request routing, and CPU sizing in a cooperative MEC system. The problem is considered from the perspective of the service provider (SP), which delivers heterogeneous MEC-enabled delay-sensitive services, and needs to pay for the used resources to the mobile network operators and the cloud provider, while earning revenue from the served requests. We formulate the problem of maximizing the SP's total profit subject to the computation, storage, and communication constraints of each edge node and end-to-end delay requirements of the services as a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem, and prove it to be NP-hard.
  To tackle the challenges in solving the problem, we first introduce a design trade-off parameter for different delay requirements of each service, which maintains flexibility in prioritizing them, and transform the original optimization problem by the new delay constraints. Then, by exploiting a hidden convexity, we reformulate the delay constraints into an equivalent form. Next, to handle the challenge of the complicating (integer) variables, using primal decomposition, we decompose the problem into an equivalent form of master and inner sub-problems over the mixed and real variables, respectively. We then employ a cutting-plane approach for building up adequate representations of the extremal value of the inner problem as a function of the complicating variables and the set of values of the complicating variables for which the inner problem is feasible. Finally, we propose a solution strategy based on generalized Benders decomposition and prove its convergence to the optimal solution within a limited number of iterations. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the existing mechanisms in terms of the SP's profit, cache hit ratio, running time, and end-to-end delay.</description>

      <title>Stable Phase Retrieval with Mirror Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to reconstruct an n-dimensional real vector from m phaseless measurements corrupted by an additive noise. We extend the noiseless framework developed in [15], based on mirror descent (or Bregman gradient descent), to deal with noisy measurements and prove that the procedure is stable to (small enough) additive noise. In the deterministic case, we show that mirror descent converges to a critical point of the phase retrieval problem, and if the algorithm is well initialized and the noise is small enough, the critical point is near the true vector up to a global sign change. When the measurements are i.i.d Gaussian and the signal-to-noise ratio is large enough, we provide global convergence guarantees that ensure that with high probability, mirror descent converges to a global minimizer near the true vector (up to a global sign change), as soon as the number of measurements m is large enough. The sample complexity bound can be improved if a spectral method is used to provide a good initial guess. We complement our theoretical study with several numerical results showing that mirror descent is both a computationally and statistically efficient scheme to solve the phase retrieval problem.</description>

      <title>Restless Linear Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A more general formulation of the linear bandit problem is considered to allow for dependencies over time. Specifically, it is assumed that there exists an unknown $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued stationary $\varphi$-mixing sequence of parameters $(\theta_t,~t \in \mathbb{N})$ which gives rise to pay-offs. This instance of the problem can be viewed as a generalization of both the classical linear bandits with iid noise, and the finite-armed restless bandits. In light of the well-known computational hardness of optimal policies for restless bandits, an approximation is proposed whose error is shown to be controlled by the $\varphi$-dependence between consecutive $\theta_t$. An optimistic algorithm, called LinMix-UCB, is proposed for the case where $\theta_t$ has an exponential mixing rate. The proposed algorithm is shown to incur a sub-linear regret of $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{d n\mathrm{polylog}(n) }\right)$ with respect to an oracle that always plays a multiple of $\mathbb{E}\theta_t$. The main challenge in this setting is to ensure that the exploration-exploitation strategy is robust against long-range dependencies. The proposed method relies on Berbee's coupling lemma to carefully select near-independent samples and construct confidence ellipsoids around empirical estimates of $\mathbb{E}\theta_t$.</description>

      <title>Submodular Information Selection for Hypothesis Testing with Misclassification Penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of selecting an optimal subset of information sources for a hypothesis testing/classification task where the goal is to identify the true state of the world from a finite set of hypotheses, based on finite observation samples from the sources. In order to characterize the learning performance, we propose a misclassification penalty framework, which enables non-uniform treatment of different misclassification errors. In a centralized Bayesian learning setting, we study two variants of the subset selection problem: (i) selecting a minimum cost information set to ensure that the maximum penalty of misclassifying the true hypothesis remains bounded and (ii) selecting an optimal information set under a limited budget to minimize the maximum penalty of misclassifying the true hypothesis. Under mild assumptions, we prove that the objective (or constraints) of these combinatorial optimization problems are weak (or approximate) submodular, and establish high-probability performance guarantees for greedy algorithms. Further, we propose an alternate metric for information set selection which is based on the total penalty of misclassification. We prove that this metric is submodular and establish near-optimal guarantees for the greedy algorithms for both the information set selection problems. Finally, we present numerical simulations to validate our theoretical results over several randomly generated instances.</description>

Abstract: Linear codes are the most important family of codes in cryptography and coding theory. Some codes have only a few weights and are widely used in many areas, such as authentication codes, secret sharing schemes and strongly regular graphs. By setting $ p\equiv 1 \pmod 4 $, we construct an infinite family of linear codes using two distinct weakly regular unbalanced (and balanced) plateaued functions with index $ (p-1)/2 $. Their weight distributions are completely determined by applying exponential sums and Walsh transform. As a result, most of our constructed codes have a few nonzero weights and are minimal.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sampling for Uncertainty-of-Information Minimization in a Remote Monitoring System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a remote monitoring system where a receiver observes a remote binary Markov source and decides whether to sample and transmit the state through a randomly delayed channel. We adopt uncertainty of information (UoI), defined as the entropy conditional on past observations at the receiver, as a metric of value of information, in contrast to the traditional state-agnostic nonlinear age of information (AoI) penalty functions. To address the limitations of prior UoI research that assumes one-time-slot delays, we extend our analysis to scenarios with random delays. We model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) problem and simplify it to a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) by introducing the belief state. We propose two algorithms: A globally optimal bisection relative value iteration (bisec-RVI) algorithm and a computationally efficient sub-optimal index-based threshold algorithm to solve the long-term average UoI minimization problem. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our sampling policies surpass traditional zero wait and AoI-optimal policies, particularly under conditions of large delay, with the sub-optimal policy nearly matching the performance of the optimal one.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming with Gradient-based Liquid Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication with the advanced beamforming technologies is a key enabler to meet the growing demands of future mobile communication. However, the dynamic nature of cellular channels in large-scale urban mmWave MIMO communication scenarios brings substantial challenges, particularly in terms of complexity and robustness. To address these issues, we propose a robust gradient-based liquid neural network (GLNN) framework that utilizes ordinary differential equation-based liquid neurons to solve the beamforming problem. Specifically, our proposed GLNN framework takes gradients of the optimization objective function as inputs to extract the high-order channel feature information, and then introduces a residual connection to mitigate the training burden. Furthermore, we use the manifold learning technique to compress the search space of the beamforming problem. These designs enable the GLNN to effectively maintain low complexity while ensuring strong robustness to noisy and highly dynamic channels. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the GLNN can achieve 4.15% higher spectral efficiency than that of typical iterative algorithms, and reduce the time consumption to only 1.61% that of conventional methods.</description>

      <title>ScionFL: Efficient and Robust Secure Quantized Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Secure aggregation is commonly used in federated learning (FL) to alleviate privacy concerns related to the central aggregator seeing all parameter updates in the clear. Unfortunately, most existing secure aggregation schemes ignore two critical orthogonal research directions that aim to (i) significantly reduce client-server communication and (ii) mitigate the impact of malicious clients. However, both of these additional properties are essential to facilitate cross-device FL with thousands or even millions of (mobile) participants.
  In this paper, we unite both research directions by introducing ScionFL, the first secure aggregation framework for FL that operates efficiently on quantized inputs and simultaneously provides robustness against malicious clients. Our framework leverages (novel) multi-party computation (MPC) techniques and supports multiple linear (1-bit) quantization schemes, including ones that utilize the randomized Hadamard transform and Kashin's representation.
  Our theoretical results are supported by extensive evaluations. We show that with no overhead for clients and moderate overhead for the server compared to transferring and processing quantized updates in plaintext, we obtain comparable accuracy for standard FL benchmarks. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of our framework against state-of-the-art poisoning attacks.</description>

Abstract: Network alignment (NA) is the task of discovering node correspondences across multiple networks. Although NA methods have achieved remarkable success in a myriad of scenarios, their effectiveness is not without additional information such as prior anchor links and/or node features, which may not always be available due to privacy concerns or access restrictions. To tackle this challenge, we propose Grad-Align+, a novel NA method built upon a recent state-of-the-art NA method, the so-called Grad-Align, that gradually discovers a part of node pairs until all node pairs are found. In designing Grad-Align+, we account for how to augment node features in the sense of performing the NA task and how to design our NA method by maximally exploiting the augmented node features. To achieve this goal, Grad-Align+ consists of three key components: 1) centrality-based node feature augmentation (CNFA), 2) graph neural network (GNN)-aided embedding similarity calculation alongside the augmented node features, and 3) gradual NA with similarity calculation using aligned cross-network neighbor-pairs (ACNs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that Grad-Align+ exhibits (a) the superiority over benchmark NA methods, (b) empirical validations as well as our theoretical findings to see the effectiveness of CNFA, (c) the influence of each component, (d) the robustness to network noises, and (e) the computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Relative Fractional Independence Number and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06155v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the relative fractional independence number of a graph $G$ with respect to another graph $H$, as $$\alpha^*(G|H)=\max_{W}\frac{\alpha(G\boxtimes W)}{\alpha(H\boxtimes W)},$$ where the maximum is taken over all graphs $W$, $G\boxtimes W$ is the strong product of $G$ and $W$, and $\alpha$ denotes the independence number. We give a non-trivial linear program to compute $\alpha^*(G|H)$ and discuss some of its properties. We show that $\alpha^*(G|H)\geq \frac{X(G)}{X(H)} \geq \frac{1}{\alpha^*(H|G)},$ where $X(G)$ can be the independence number, the zero-error Shannon capacity, the fractional independence number, the Lov\'{a}sz number, or the Schrijver's or Szegedy's variants of the Lov\'{a}sz number of a graph $G$. This inequality is the first explicit non-trivial upper bound on the ratio of the invariants of two arbitrary graphs, as mentioned earlier, which can also be used to obtain upper or lower bounds for these invariants. As explicit applications, we present new upper bounds for the ratio of the zero-error Shannon capacity of two Cayley graphs and compute new lower bounds on the Shannon capacity of certain Johnson graphs (yielding the exact value of their Haemers number). Moreover, we show that $\alpha^*(G|H)$ can be used to present a stronger version of the well-known No-Homomorphism Lemma.</description>

      <title>Efficient Construction of Long Orientable Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An orientable sequence of order $n$ is a cyclic binary sequence such that each length-$n$ substring appears at most once \emph{in either direction}. Maximal length orientable sequences are known only for $n\leq 7$, and a trivial upper bound on their length is $2^{n-1} - 2^{\lfloor(n-1)/2\rfloor}$. This paper presents the first efficient algorithm to construct orientable sequences with asymptotically optimal length; more specifically, our algorithm constructs orientable sequences via cycle-joining and a successor-rule approach requiring $O(n)$ time per symbol and $O(n)$ space. This answers a longstanding open question from Dai, Martin, Robshaw, Wild [Cryptography and Coding III (1993)]. Our sequences are applied to find new longest-known orientable sequences for $n\leq 20$.</description>

      <title>Underdetermined DOA Estimation of Off-Grid Sources Based on the Generalized Double Pareto Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate a new generalized double Pareto based on off-grid sparse Bayesian learning (GDPOGSBL) approach to improve the performance of direction of arrival (DOA) estimation in underdetermined scenarios. The method aims to enhance the sparsity of source signal by utilizing the generalized double Pareto (GDP) prior. Firstly, we employ a first-order linear Taylor expansion to model the real array manifold matrix, and Bayesian inference is utilized to calculate the off-grid error, which mitigates the grid dictionary mismatch problem in underdetermined scenarios. Secondly, an innovative grid refinement method is introduced, treating grid points as iterative parameters to minimize the modeling error between the source and grid points. The numerical simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed strategy, especially when dealing with a coarse grid and few snapshots.</description>
