      <title>Asymptotic-preserving semi-implicit finite volume scheme for Extended Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Finite Volume (FV) scheme is developed for solving the extended magnetohydrodynamic (XMHD) equations, yielding accurate results in the ideal, resistive, and Hall MHD limits. This is accomplished by first re-writing the XMHD equations such that it allows the algorithm to retain the use of ideal MHD Riemann solvers and the constrained transport method to preserve divergence-free magnetic fields. Incorporation of electron inertia and displacement current introduces additional numerical stiffness which motivates a semi-implicit FV scheme that re-formulates the XMHD model as a relaxation system. The equations are then advanced in time using an explicit 2nd-order Runge-Kutta scheme with operator splitting applied to the implicit source term updates at each sub-stage. For additional numerical stability, density-dependent slope limiter is implemented to increase flux diffusivity at low density where non-ideal effects become significant. The algorithm is subsequently implemented on Artemis, a multifluid radiation hydrodynamics code built on Parthenon framework for high-performance computing (HPC) and adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) support. As the new algorithm retains many aspects of the ideal MHD formulations, it asymptotes naturally to the ideal MHD limit. Moreover, it shows promising results at the resistive and Hall MHD limits. This is verified against published test problems for ideal, resistive and Hall MHD.</description>

      <title>Effects of Multi-scale Coupling on Particle Acceleration and Energy Partition in Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between kinetic and macroscopic scales during magnetic reconnection is investigated using particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic island coalescence in the strongly-magnetized, relativistic pair plasma regime. For large system sizes, secondary current sheet formation and downstream turbulence driven by the reconnection outflows dominate the global energy dissipation so that it is causally connected, but spatially and temporally de-coupled from the primary reconnecting current sheet. When compared to simulations of an isolated, force-free current sheet, these dynamics activate additional particle acceleration channels which are responsible for a significant population of the non-thermal particles, modifying the particle energy spectra.</description>

      <title>Algorithms and optimizations for global non-linear hybrid fluid-kinetic finite element stellarator simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive modeling of stellarator plasmas is crucial for advancing nuclear fusion energy, yet it faces unique computational difficulties. One of the main challenges is accurately simulating the dynamics of specific particle species that are not well captured by fluid models, which necessitates the use of hybrid fluid-kinetic models. The non-axisymmetric geometry of stellarators fundamentally couples the toroidal Fourier modes, in contrast to what happens in tokamaks, requiring different numerical and computational treatment.
  This work presents a novel, globally coupled projection scheme inside the JOREK finite element framework. The approach ensures a self-consistent and physically accurate transfer of kinetic markers to the fluid grid, effectively handling the complex 3D mesh by constructing and solving a unified linear system that encompasses all toroidal harmonics simultaneously. To manage the computational complexity of this coupling, the construction of the system's matrix is significantly accelerated using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The efficient localization of millions of particles is made possible by implementing a 3D R-Tree spatial index, which supports this projection and ensures computational tractability at scale.
  On realistic Wendelstein 7-X stellarator geometries, the fidelity of the framework is rigorously shown. In sharp contrast to the uncoupled approaches' poor performance, quantitative convergence tests verify that the coupled scheme attains the theoretically anticipated spectral convergence.
  This study offers a crucial capability for the predictive analysis and optimization of next-generation stellarator designs by developing a validated, high-fidelity computational tool.</description>

      <title>On the interpretation of XRISM X-ray measurements of turbulence in the intracluster medium: a comparison with cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the properties of turbulent gas motions recently measured via X-ray spectroscopy in the Coma cluster of galaxies by XRISM are in tension with the turbulent picture established by current numerical cosmological simulations. We use a high-resolution simulation of a Coma-like cluster and show that the simulation yields velocity structure functions and X-ray line-widths that are compatible with those measured by the XRISM observations of Coma. In particular, it has been previously suggested that a much steeper turbulence spectrum than the Kolmogorov would be needed to explain the XRISM observations under a homogeneous, cluster volume-filling turbulence model. Our results show that this tension is overcome thanks to the more complicated turbulent picture in cosmological simulations, that indeed shows a patchy distribution of turbulent regions in galaxy clusters, with a spectrum that is generally consistent with a Kolmogorov power-law over a fairly wide range of scales. More generally, our study highlights the fact that the interpretation of XRISM data of galaxy clusters depends on the turbulence model used and the importance of combining data and advanced simulations in the future steps.</description>
