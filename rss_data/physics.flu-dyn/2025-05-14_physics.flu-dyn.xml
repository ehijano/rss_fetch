      <title>Micro-swimmer locomotion and hydrodynamics in Brinkman Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-swimmer locomotion in heterogeneous media is increasingly relevant in biological physics due to the prevalence of microorganisms in complex environments. A model for such porous media is the Brinkman fluid which accounts for a sparse matrix of stationary obstacles via a linear resistance term in the momentum equation. We investigate two models for the locomotion and the flow field generated by a swimmer in such a medium. First, we analyze a dumbbell swimmer composed of two spring-connected spheres and driven by a flagellar force and derive its exact swimming velocity as a function of the Brinkman medium resistance, showing that the swimmer monotonically slows down as the medium drag monotonically increases. In the limit of no resistance the model reduces to the classical Stokes dipole swimmer, while finite resistance introduces hydrodynamic screening that attenuates long-range interactions. Additionally, we derive an analytical expression for the far-field flow generated by a Brinkmanlet force-dipole, which can be used for propulsive point-dipole swimmer models. Remarkably, this approximation reproduces the dumbbell swimmer's flow field in the far-field regime with high accuracy. These results provide new analytical tools for understanding locomotion in complex fluids and offer foundational insights for future studies on collective behavior in active and passive suspensions within porous or structured environments.</description>

      <title>Resonance phenomena of thermo-bioconvection generated by chemotactic bacteria under unsteady heat condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bioconvection is a phenomenon caused by microorganisms with tactic properties. To effectively utilize bioconvection for industrial purposes, it is necessary to find a way to control it. In this study, we performed a three-dimensional numerical analysis of thermo-bioconvection generated by a suspension of chemotactic bacteria under unsteady heating conditions at the bottom. Under unsteady heating conditions, thermal convection and bioconvection coexist, and unsteady thermo-bioconvection occurs around plumes. When the frequency of the temperature fluctuation is low, thermo-bioconvection follows the temperature fluctuation. However, as the frequency increases, the ability of thermo-bioconvection to follow the temperature fluctuation deteriorates. A resonance phenomenon occurs at the frequency where the instability of the suspension owing to the density difference between the bacteria and water is maintained and where thermo-bioconvection can follow temperature fluctuations. At the resonance frequency, the transport characteristics of bacteria and oxygen throughout the entire region within the suspension improve significantly. As the amplitude of temperature fluctuations and thermal Rayleigh number increase, the interference between thermal convection and bioconvection intensifies, leading to a noticeable improvement in transport characteristics owing to the resonance phenomenon. At this time, the amplitude of temperature fluctuations and thermal Rayleigh number do not almost affect the resonance frequency. This study demonstrated the possibility of thermal control of transport properties in bioconvection.</description>

      <title>Linear instability in planar viscoelastic Taylor-Couette flow with and without explicit polymer diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic turbulence has been found in computations of planar viscoelastic Taylor-Couette flow using the Oldroyd-B model, apparently generated by a linear instability (van Buel et al. Europhys. Lett., 124, 14001, 2018). We demonstrate that no such linear instability exists in the governing equations used unless some diffusion is added to the polymer conformation tensor equation, as might occur through a diffusive numerical scheme. With this addition, the polymer diffusive instability (PDI) (Beneitez et al. (Phys. Rev. Fluids, 8, L101901, 2023)) exists and leads to chaotic flows resembling those found by van Buel et al. (2018). We show how finite volume or finite-difference discretisations of the governing equations can naturally introduce diffusive errors near boundaries which are sufficient to trigger PDI. This suggests that PDI could well be important in numerical solutions of wall-bounded viscoelastic flows modelled using Oldroyd-B and FENE-P even with no polymer stress diffusion explicitly included.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of a novel liquid metal plasma facing component with pre-filled microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regarding the plasma facing components (PFCs) in nuclear fusion, liquid metal PFCs with stable free surface flow on PFC surface are considered a promising alternative. However, due to the poor wettability of liquid metal on most solid substrates and the complex magnetohydrodynamic (MHD), the realization of stable free surface flow on PFCs surface is challenging. In the present study, using the 3D printed methods, we developed a novel liquid metal PFC surface with MIcrostructures pre-FIlled by Liquid Metal (MIFILM) to realize a stable free liquid metal surface flow. The experimental results demonstrated that due to the existence of MIFILM, the apparent contact angle (ACA) of liquid metal changes from 140$^{\circ}$ to approximately 20$^{\circ}$, indicating a transition from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. When the liquid metal flows on the MIFILM substrate, it is found that the liquid metal can completely spread on the surface with a stable and orderly free surface, even at a low flow rate. Moreover, the liquid metal could exhibit sustained spreading properties on the MIFILM substrate under a strong transverse magnetic field (up to 1.6 T). Results indicate that the magnetic field induces limited MHD drag but also accelerates the flow via two-dimensional effects. When the Stuart number $N&lt;1$, the flow accelerates and the film thickness decreases. For $N&gt;1$, both flow velocity and film thickness gradually stabilize. Therefore, the present novel MIFILM can offer a good choice for liquid metal PFC substrates in nuclear fusion.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of weakly elastic sphere translating parallel to a rigid wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the dynamics of a weakly elastic spherical particle translating parallel to a rigid wall in a quiescent Newtonian fluid in the Stokes limit. The particle motion is constrained parallel to the wall by applying a point force and a point torque at the centre of its undeformed shape. The particle is modelled using the Navier elasticity equations. The series solutions to the Navier and the Stokes equations are utilised to obtain the displacement and velocity fields in the solid and fluid, respectively. The point force and the point torque are calculated as series in small parameters $\alpha$ and $1/H$, using the domain perturbation method and the method of reflections. Here, $\alpha$ is the ratio of viscous fluid stress to elastic solid stress, and $H$ is the non-dimensional gap width, defined as the ratio of the distance of the particle centre from the wall to its radius. The results are presented up to $\textit{O}(1/H^3)$ and $\textit{O}(1/H^2)$, assuming $\alpha \sim 1/H$, for cases where gravity is aligned and non-aligned with the particle velocity, respectively. The deformed shape of the particle is determined by the force distribution acting on it. %In both cases, the particle experiences a hydrodynamic drag due to elastic effects at \textit{O}($\alpha^2/H$). The hydrodynamic lift due to elastic effects (acting away from the wall) appears at $\textit{O}(\alpha/H^2)$, in the former case. In an unbounded domain, the elastic effects in the latter case generate a hydrodynamic torque at \textit{O}($\alpha$) and a drag at \textit{O}($\alpha^2$). Conversely, in the former case, the torque is zero, while the drag still appears at \textit{O}($\alpha^2$).</description>

      <title>Self-scalings of bubble pinch-off and inner jet emitting in a tapered co-flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the formation mechanisms and scaling laws governing sub-millimeter bubble-jet generation in convergent coaxial microchannels. Experimental observations reveal four distinct evolutionary stages in monodisperse bubble formation: growth, necking, detachment, and stabilization. Through necking rupture dynamics modeling, we demonstrate that the coupled effects of nozzle insertion length ($x$) and convergence angle ($\alpha$) dominate neck width evolution, exhibiting universal power-law scaling across geometric configurations. Crucially, the spatiotemporal evolution of necking interfaces under shear demonstrates self-similarity: temporal evolution follows a power-law decay with respect to remaining time ($T-t$), while spatial scaling correlates with characteristic dimension $W_\text{local}$ through power-law relationships. Multi-stage mathematical models successfully describe this self-similar interfacial behavior, confirming their predictive validity. Furthermore, we identify the core mechanism of bubble-jet formation as dynamic modulation through convergent zone flow fields characterized by front-end stretching and rear-end squeezing interactions. Experimental validation shows consistent jet velocity evolution across flow regimes under multiphysics coupling, establishing geometric similarity principles governing flow structures and dynamic behaviors in convergent microchannel architectures.</description>

      <title>Experimental study on the relationship between extensional and shear rheology of low-viscosity power-law fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between extensional and shear viscosity of low-viscosity power-law fluids. We show the first experimental evidence of the conditions satisfying the same power exponents for extensional and shear viscosity, as indicated by the Carreau model. The extensional and shear viscosity are respectively measured by capillary breakup extensional rheometry dripping-onto-substrate (CaBER-DoS) and by a shear rheometer for various Ohnesorge number Oh. The viscosity ranges measured are about O(10^0) to O(104) mPas for shear viscosity and O(10^1) to O(10^3) mPas for apparent extensional viscosity. Our experimental results show that, at least for the range of Oh &gt; 1, the power-law expression for the liquid filament radius, apparent extensional viscosity, and shear viscosity holds, even for low-viscosity fluids under our experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Liu and Katz (2006) and Zigunov and Charonko (2024b): on the Equivalence of the Omnidirectional Integration and the Pressure Poisson Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate the equivalency of the Rotating Parallel Ray Omnidirectional Integration (RPR-ODI) and the Pressure Poisson Equation (PPE) for pressure field reconstruction from corrupted image velocimetry data (dubbed 'ODI $\equiv$ PPE'). Building on the work by Zigunov and Charonko (2024b), we show that performing the ODI is equivalent to pursuing the minimum norm least squares (MNLS) or minimum norm (MN) solution to a Poisson equation with all Neumann boundary conditions. By looking through the lens of linear algebra, regression, optimization, and the well-posedness of the Poisson equation, we provide a comprehensive and integrated framework to analyze ODI/PPE-based pressure field reconstruction methods. The new comprehensions on ODI $\equiv$ PPE provides theoretical and computational insights valuable to experimentalists beyond reducing the high computational cost of ODI to that of PPE. More importantly, we i) provide a comprehensive guideline for robust pressure reconstruction, and ii) unveil the shared strengths and limitations of ODI and PPE, which are elaborated in remarks and notes throughout this work. Some remarks suggest simple regularization strategies that serve as 'minimal reproducible examples' and provide a foundation for further refinement. This work paves the way for further improvements in ODI/PPE-based pressure field reconstruction by utilizing the extensive literature on fast and robust elliptic solvers as well as their associated regularization methods. Numerical experiments are presented to support and illustrate these arguments.</description>

      <title>Shock-capturing particle hydrodynamics with reproducing kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and explore a new shock-capturing particle hydrodynamics approach. Our starting point is a commonly used discretization of smoothed particle hydrodynamics. We enhance this discretization with Roe's approximate Riemann solver, we identify its dissipative terms, and in these terms, we use slope-limited linear reconstruction. All gradients needed for our method are calculated with linearly reproducing kernels that are constructed to enforce the two lowest-order consistency relations. We scrutinize our reproducing kernel implementation carefully on a "glass-like" particle distribution, and we find that constant and linear functions are recovered to machine precision. We probe our method in a series of challenging 3D benchmark problems ranging from shocks over instabilities to Schulz-Rinne-type vorticity-creating shocks. All of our simulations show excellent agreement with analytic/reference solutions.</description>

      <title>Full-domain POD modes from PIV asynchronous patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method is proposed to obtain full-domain spatial modes based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements performed at different (overlapping) spatial locations. This situation occurs when large domains are covered by multiple non-simultaneous measurements and yet the large-scale flow field organization is to be captured. The proposed methodology leverages the definition of POD spatial modes as eigenvectors of the spatial correlation matrix, where local measurements, even when not obtained simultaneously, provide each a portion of the latter, which is then analyzed to synthesize the full-domain spatial modes. The measurement domain coverage is found to require regions overlapping by 50-75% to yield a smooth distribution of the modes. The procedure identifies structures twice as large as each measurement patch. The technique, referred to as Patch POD, is applied to planar PIV data of a submerged jet flow where the effect of patching is simulated by splitting the original PIV data. Patch POD is then extended to 3D robotic measurement around a wall-mounted cube. The results show that the patching technique enables global modal analysis over a domain covered with a multitude of non-simultaneous measurements.</description>

      <title>Vortex Dynamics in Tubular Fluid Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11206v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin cylindrical membranes arise in a wide variety of biological systems ranging from tubular structures on and within cell membranes to in-vitro experiments on artificial vesicles. Motor proteins embedded in such fluidic membranes often induce vortex-like flows. In this work, we construct a class of 2D vortex flow in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to 3D external embedding fluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in the flow field, consistent with Poincar\'e Index Theorem. In this setup, the incompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of a multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian, This Hamiltonian also incorporates the specific couplings of the 2D membrane flow with the 3D external fluids. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex dynamics, such as orbit pinching, For a two-vortex system of same circulation, we observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time, unlike flat and spherical fluid membranes, where the separation remains constant. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along helical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol 455 (1999), now extended to tubular geometries. We also explore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and demonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be interesting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as experimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610 (2011).</description>
