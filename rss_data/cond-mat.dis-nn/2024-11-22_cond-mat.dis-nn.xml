      <title>On the geometry of topological defects in glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies point out far-reaching connections between the topological characteristics of structural glasses and their material properties, paralleling results in quantum physics that highlight the relevance of the nature of the wavefunction. However, the structural arrangement of the topological defects in glasses has so far remained elusive. Here we investigate numerically the geometry and statistical properties of the topological defects related to the vibrational eigenmodes of a prototypical three-dimensional glass. We find that at low-frequencies these defects form scale-invariant, quasi-linear structures and dictate the plastic events morphology when the system is subjected to a quasi-static shear, i.e., the eigenmode geometry shapes plastic behavior in 3D glasses. Our results indicate the existence of a deep link between the topology of eigenmodes and plastic energy dissipation in disordered materials, thus generalizing the known connection identified in crystalline materials. This link is expected to have consequences also for the relaxation dynamics in the liquid state, thus opening the door for a novel approach to describe this dynamics.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology for Structural Characterization in Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework based on persistent homology (PH) to characterize both local and global structures in disordered systems. It can simultaneously generate local and global descriptors using the same algorithm and data structure, and has shown to be highly effective and interpretable in predicting particle rearrangements and classifying global phases. Based on this framework, we define a non-parametric metric, the Separation Index (SI), which not only outperforms traditional bond-orientational order parameters in phase classification tasks but also establishes a connection between particle environments and the global phase structure. Our methods provide an effective framework for understanding and analyzing the properties of disordered materials, with broad potential applications in materials science and even wider studies of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Predicting interacting Green's functions with neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly correlated materials exhibit complex electronic phenomena that are challenging to capture with traditional theoretical methods, yet understanding these systems is crucial for discovering new quantum materials. Addressing the computational bottlenecks in studying such systems, we present a proof-of-concept machine learning-based approach to accelerate Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) calculations. Our method predicts interacting Green's functions on arbitrary two-dimensional lattices using a two-step ML framework. First, an autoencoder-based network learns and generates physically plausible band structures of materials, providing diverse training data. Next, a dense neural network predicts interacting Green's functions of these physically-possible band structures, expressed in the basis of Legendre polynomials. We demonstrate that this architecture can serve as a substitute for the computationally demanding quantum impurity solver in DMFT, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy. This approach offers a scalable pathway to accelerate simulations of strongly correlated systems and lays the groundwork for future extensions to multi-band systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement growth in the dark intervals of a locally monitored free-fermion chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a free fermionic chain with monitoring of the particle density on a single site of the chain and study the entanglement dynamics of quantum jump trajectories. We show that the entanglement entropy grows in time towards a stationary state which display volume law scaling of the entropy, in stark contrast with both the unitary dynamics after a local quench and the no-click limit corresponding to full post-selection. We explain the extensive entanglement growth as a consequence of the peculiar distribution of quantum jumps in time, which display superpoissonian waiting time distribution characterised by a bunching of quantum jumps followed by long dark intervals where no-clicks are detected, akin to the distribution of fluorescence light in a driven atom. We show that the presence of dark intervals is the key feature to explain the effect and that by increasing the number of sites which are monitored the volume law scaling gives away to the Zeno effect and its associated area law.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous replica-symmetry breaking for vector spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider mean-field vector spin glasses with possibly non-convex interactions. Up to a small perturbation of the parameters defining the model, the asymptotic behavior of the Gibbs measure is described in terms of a critical point of an explicit functional. In this paper, we study some properties of these critical points. Under modest assumptions ensuring that different types of spins interact, we show that the replica-symmetry-breaking structures of the different types of spins are in one-to-one correspondence with one another. For instance, if some type of spins displays one level of replica-symmetry breaking, then so do all the other types of spins. This extends the recent results of [Electronic Journal of Probability, 27:1-75, 2022] and [Comm. Math. Phys., 394(3):1101-1152, 2022] that were obtained in the case of multi-species spherical spin glasses with convex interactions.</description>

      <title>Superconducting $p$-wave pairing effects on one-dimensional non-Hermitian quasicrystals with power law hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of superconducting $p$-wave pairing on the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with power-law hopping. For the case of short-range hopping, weak pairing leads to oscillating quasi-Majorana zero modes, turning to edge-localized Majorana zero modes as pairing strength increases. For the case of long-range hopping, we observe the emergence of massive Dirac modes having oscillatory behavior, similar to Majorana modes with weak pairing. The massive Dirac modes localize at the edges as the pairing strength grows. The superconducting pairing spoils the plateaus observed in the fractal dimension of all the energy eigenstates of the Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with power-law hopping. The number of plateaus decreases with the increasing pairing strength for the weak non-Hermiticity in the system. The phase diagram of the system reveals that real and complex energy spectrums correlate differently with the localization properties of the eigenstates depending on the strength of pairing and hopping range.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Readout Problem in Quantum Differential Equation Algorithms with Quantum Scientific Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum differential equation solvers aim to prepare solutions as $n$-qubit quantum states over a fine grid of $O(2^n)$ points, surpassing the linear scaling of classical solvers. However, unlike classically stored vectors of solutions, the readout of exact quantum states poses a bottleneck due to the complexity of tomography. Here, we show that the readout problem can be addressed with quantum learning tools where we focus on distilling the relevant features. Treating outputs of quantum differential equation solvers as quantum data, we demonstrate that low-dimensional output can be extracted using a measurement operator adapted to detect relevant features. We apply this quantum scientific machine learning approach to classify solutions for shock wave detection and turbulence modeling in scenarios where data samples come directly from quantum differential equation solvers. We show that the basis chosen for performing analysis greatly impacts classification accuracy. Our work opens up the area of research where quantum machine learning for quantum datasets is inherently required.</description>

      <title>Anomalous transport in U(1)-symmetric quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate discrete-time transport in a generic U(1)-symmetric disordered model tuned across an array of different dynamical regimes. We develop an aggregate quantity, a circular statistical moment, which is a simple function of the magnetization profile and which elegantly captures transport properties of the system. From this quantity we extract transport exponents, revealing behaviors across the phase diagram consistent with localized, diffusive, and - most interestingly for a disordered system - superdiffusive regimes. Investigation of this superdiffusive regime reveals the existence of a prethermal "swappy" regime unique to discrete-time systems in which excitations propagate coherently; even in the presence of strong disorder.</description>

      <title>Nadaraya-Watson kernel smoothing as a random energy model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise asymptotics have revealed many surprises in high-dimensional regression. These advances, however, have not extended to perhaps the simplest estimator: direct Nadaraya-Watson (NW) kernel smoothing. Here, we describe how one can use ideas from the analysis of the random energy model (REM) in statistical physics to compute sharp asymptotics for the NW estimator when the sample size is exponential in the dimension. As a simple starting point for investigation, we focus on the case in which one aims to estimate a single-index target function using a radial basis function kernel on the sphere. Our main result is a pointwise asymptotic for the NW predictor, showing that it re-scales the argument of the true link function. Our work provides a first step towards a detailed understanding of kernel smoothing in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Critical states exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical states of disordered systems are intriguing subjects within the realm of condensed matter physics and complex systems. These states manifest in materials where disorder plays a significant role, and are distinguished by their multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, accurately characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge. In this study, we argue that critical states exhibit a certain invariance in both position and momentum spaces, leading to their delocalization in both domains. More specifically, it is expected that typical physical quantities characterizing critical states, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, should exhibit invariance in both position space and momentum space. Subsequent numerical simulations validate the correctness of this invariance, thereby establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.</description>

      <title>Ductile and brittle yielding of athermal amorphous solids: a mean-field paradigm beyond the random field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing a unified theory describing both ductile and brittle yielding constitutes a fundamental challenge of non-equilibrium statistical physics. Recently, it has been proposed that the nature of the yielding transition is controlled by physics akin to that of the quasistatically driven Random field Ising model (RFIM), which has served as the paradigm for understanding the effect of quenched disorder in slowly driven systems with short-ranged interactions. However, this theoretical picture neglects both the dynamics of, and the elasticity-induced long-ranged interactions between, the mesoscopic material constituents. Here, we address these two aspects and provide a unified theory building on the H\'ebraud-Lequeux elastoplastic description. The first aspect is crucial to understanding the competition between the imposed deformation rate and the finite timescale of plastic rearrangements: we provide a dynamical description of the macroscopic stress drop and predictions for the divergence of the peak susceptibility with inverse shear rate. The second is essential in order to capture properly the behaviour in the limit of quasistatic driving, where avalanches of plasticity diverge with system size at any value of the strain. We fully characterise the avalanche behaviour, which is radically different to that of the RFIM. In the quasistatic, infinite size limit, we find that both models have mean-field Landau exponents, obscuring the effect of the interactions. We show, however, that the latter profoundly affect the behaviour of finite systems approaching the spinodal-like brittle yield point, where we recover qualitatively the finite-size trends found in particle simulations, and modify the nature of the random critical point separating ductile and brittle yielding, where we predict critical behaviour on top of the marginality present at any value of the strain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin glasses are quintessential examples of complex matter. Although much about their order remains uncertain, abstract models of them inform, e.g., the classification of combinatorial optimization problems, the magnetic ordering in metals with impurities, and artificial intelligence -- where they form a mathematical basis for neural network computing and brain modeling. We demonstrate the ability of an active quantum gas microscope to realize a spin glass of a novel driven-dissipative and vector form. By microscopically visualizing its glassy spin states, the technique allows us to directly measure replica symmetry breaking and the resulting ultrametric hierarchical structure. Ultrametricity is known to be emergent in models of evolution, protein folding, climate change, and infinite-range equilibrium spin glasses; this work shows it to be directly observable in a physically realized system.</description>

Abstract: While graph convolutional networks show great practical promises, the theoretical understanding of their generalization properties as a function of the number of samples is still in its infancy compared to the more broadly studied case of supervised fully connected neural networks. In this article, we predict the performances of a single-layer graph convolutional network (GCN) trained on data produced by attributed stochastic block models (SBMs) in the high-dimensional limit. Previously, only ridge regression on contextual-SBM (CSBM) has been considered in Shi et al. 2022; we generalize the analysis to arbitrary convex loss and regularization for the CSBM and add the analysis for another data model, the neural-prior SBM. We also study the high signal-to-noise ratio limit, detail the convergence rates of the GCN and show that, while consistent, it does not reach the Bayes-optimal rate for any of the considered cases.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization in aperiodically driven classical spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven classical many-body systems can host a rich zoo of prethermal dynamical phases. In this work, we extend the paradigm of classical prethermalization to aperiodically driven systems. We establish the existence of a long-lived prethermal regime in spin systems subjected to random multipolar drives (RMDs). We demonstrate that the thermalization time scales as $(1/T)^{2n+2}$, where $n$ is the multipolar order and $T$ is the intrinsic time-scale associated with the drive. In the $n \rightarrow \infty$ limit, the drive becomes quasi-periodic and the thermalization time becomes exponentially long ($\sim \exp(\beta/T)$). We further establish the robustness of prethermalization by demonstrating that these thermalization time scaling laws hold for a wide range of initial state energy densities. Intriguingly, the thermalization process in these classical systems is parametrically slower than their quantum counterparts, thereby highlighting important differences between classical and quantum prethermalization. Finally, we propose a protocol to harness this classical prethermalization to realize time rondeau crystals.</description>

Abstract: A single-photon entangled state (or single-particle entangled state (SPES) in general) can offer a more secure way of encoding and processing quantum information than their multi-photon (or multi-particle) counterparts. The SPES generated via a 2D alternate quantum-walk setup from initially separable states can be either 3-way or 2-way entangled. This letter shows that the generated genuine three-way and nonlocal two-way SPES can be used as cryptographic keys to securely encode two distinct messages simultaneously. We detail the message encryption-decryption steps and show the resilience of the 3-way and 2-way SPES-based cryptographic protocols against eavesdropper attacks like intercept-and-resend and man-in-the-middle. We also detail the experimental realization of these protocols using a single photon, with the three degrees of freedom being OAM, path, and polarization. We have proved that the protocols have unconditional security for quantum communication tasks. The ability to simultaneously encode two distinct messages using the generated SPES showcases the versatility and efficiency of the proposed cryptographic protocol. This capability could significantly improve the throughput of quantum communication systems.</description>

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) share important similarities with structural glasses. Both have many degrees of freedom, and their dynamics are governed by a high-dimensional, non-convex landscape representing either the loss or energy, respectively. Furthermore, both experience gradient descent dynamics subject to noise. In this work we investigate, by performing quantitative measurements on realistic networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the extent to which this qualitative similarity gives rise to glass-like dynamics in neural networks. We demonstrate the existence of a Topology Trivialisation Transition as well as the previously studied under-to-overparameterised transition analogous to jamming. By training DNNs with overdamped Langevin dynamics in the resulting disordered phases, we do not observe diverging relaxation times at non-zero temperature, nor do we observe any caging effects, in contrast to glass phenomenology. However, the weight overlap function follows a power law in time, with exponent $\approx -0.5$, in agreement with the Mode-Coupling Theory of structural glasses. In addition, the DNN dynamics obey a form of time-temperature superposition. Finally, dynamic heterogeneity and ageing are observed at low temperatures. These results highlight important and surprising points of both difference and agreement between the behaviour of DNNs and structural glasses.</description>

      <title>Simulating the two-dimensional $t-J$ model at finite doping with neural quantum states</title>

Abstract: Simulating large, strongly interacting fermionic systems remains a major challenge for existing numerical methods. In this work, we present, for the first time, the application of neural quantum states - specifically, hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) - to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t-J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $8 \times 8$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</description>
