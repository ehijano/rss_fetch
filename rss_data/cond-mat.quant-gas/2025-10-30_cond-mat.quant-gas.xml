      <title>Thermal Casimir effect in the spin-orbit coupled Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermal Casimir effect in ideal Bose gases with spin-orbit (S-O) coupling of Rashba type below the critical temperature for Bose-Einstein condensation. In contrast to the standard situation involving no S-O coupling, the system exhibits long-ranged Casimir forces both in two and three dimensions ($d=2$ and $d=3$). We identify the relevant scaling variable involving the ratio $D/\nu$ of the separation between the confining walls $D$ and the S-O coupling magnitude $\nu$. We derive and discuss the corresponding scaling functions for the Casimir energy. In all the considered cases the resulting Casimir force is attractive and the S-O coupling $\nu$ has impact on its magnitude. In $d=3$ the exponent governing the decay of the Casimir force becomes modified by the presence of the S-O coupling, and its value depends on the orientation of the confining walls relative to the plane defined by the Rashba coupling. In $d=2$ the obtained Casimir force displays singular behavior in the limit of vanishing $\nu$</description>

      <title>Ultrafast many-body dynamics of dense Rydberg gases and ultracold plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within femtoseconds the strong light field of an ultrashort laser pulse can excite and ionize a few thousand atoms in an ultracold quantum gas. Here we investigate the rich many-body dynamics unfolding in a $^{87}$Rb Bose-Einstein condensate after exposure to a single femtosecond laser pulse. By tuning the laser wavelength over the two-photon ionization threshold, we adjust the initial energy of the electrons and can thus investigate the transition from an ultracold plasma to a dense Rydberg gas.
  Our experimental setup provides access to the kinetic energy of the released electrons, which allows us to distinguish between bound, free and plasma electrons. The large bandwidth of the ultrashort laser pulse makes it possible to overcome the Rydberg blockade which fundamentally limits the density in excitation schemes with narrow-band lasers.
  To understand the many-body dynamics at the microscopic level, we employ molecular dynamics simulations where the electrons are modeled as individual particles including collisional ionization and recombination processes. We find that the ultrafast dynamics within the first few nanoseconds is responsible for the final distribution of free, bound and plasma electrons and agrees well with the experimental observation. We find distinctly different dynamics compared to the expected transition from an ultracold neutral plasma to a dense Rydberg gas.</description>

      <title>Controlled acoustic-driven vortex transport in coupled superfluid rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomtronic quantum sensors based on trapped superfluids offer a promising platform for high-precision inertial measurements where the dynamics of quantized vortices can serve as sensitive probes of external forces. We analytically investigate persistent current oscillations between two density-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate rings and show that the vortex dynamics is governed by low-energy acoustic excitations circulating through the condensate bulk. The oscillation frequency and damping rate are quantitatively predicted by a simplified hydrodynamic model, in agreement with Bogoliubov-de Gennes analysis and Gross-Pitaevskii simulations. We identify the critical dissipation separating persistent oscillations from overdamped vortex localization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that periodic modulation of the inter-ring barrier at resonant frequencies enables controlled vortex transfer even when the condensates are well separated in density. These results clarify the role of collective hydrodynamic modes in circulation transfer and establish a framework for employing vortex dynamics in atomtronic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Single-fluid model for rotating annular supersolids and its experimental implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous two-fluid model of finite-temperature superfluids has been recently extended to de- scribe the mixed classical-superfluid dynamics of the newly discovered supersolid phase of matter. We show that for rigidly rotating supersolids one can derive a more appropriate single-fluid model, in which the seemingly classical and superfluid contributions to the motion emerge from a spatially varying phase of the global wavefunction. That allows to design experimental protocols to excite and detect the peculiar rotation dynamics of annular supersolids, including partially quantized supercurrents, in which each atom brings less than $\hbar$ unit of angular momentum. Our results are valid for a more general class of density-modulated superfluids.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of large spins in static and rotating magnetic fields: Entanglement resonances and kinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the quantum dynamics of a large spin in the presence of static and rotating magnetic fields. By mapping the system onto a gas of non-interacting spin-1/2 particles, we derive exact analytical results for the dynamics with different initial states. The dynamics exhibit periodic oscillations between two maximally stretched states, irrespective of how large the spin is. Further, we observe periodic transitions between sublevels with magnetic quantum numbers of opposite signs. Additionally, the dynamics features the periodic transfer of the spin to the maximally stretched state starting from a superposition state. The evolution of the dipole moment is also explored in each case, and as expected, it is precessing about the instantaneous, resultant magnetic field. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to a pair of spins, taking into account the dipole-dipole interactions between them. We analyze how the ground state entanglement between the spins depends on the external fields. The quantum dynamics of the two spins reveal entanglement resonances and kinks, which can be identified from the energy spectrum when weak transverse field strengths are considered. Finally, we discuss the regime in which the dipolar interactions are relatively weak.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit coupled spin-boson model : A variational analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-boson (SB) model is a standard prototype for quantum dissipation, which we generalize in this work, to explore the dissipative effects on a one-dimensional spin-orbit (SO) coupled particle in the presence of a sub-ohmic bath. We analyze this model by extending the well-known variational polaron approach, revealing a localization transition accompanied by an intriguing change in the spectrum, for which the doubly degenerate minima evolves to a single minimum at zero momentum as the system-bath coupling increases. For translational invariant system with conserved momentum, a continuous magnetization transition occurs, whereas the ground state changes discontinuously. We further investigate the transition of the ground state in the presence of harmonic confinement, which effectively models a quantum dot-like nanostructure under the influence of the environment. In both the scenarios, the entanglement entropy of the spin-sector can serve as a marker for these transitions. Interestingly, for the trapped system, a cat-like superposition state corresponds to maximum entanglement entropy below the transition, highlighting the relevance of the present model for studying the effect of decoherence on intra-particle entanglement in the context of quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>An introduction to Markovian open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a concise, pedagogical introduction to the dynamic field of open quantum systems governed by Markovian master equations. We focus on the mathematical and physical origins of the Lindblad equation, its unraveling in terms of pure-state trajectories, the structure of steady states with emphasis on the role of symmetry and conservation laws, and a sampling of the novel physical phenomena that arise from nonunitary dynamics (dissipation and measurements). This is far from a comprehensive summary of the field. Rather, the objective is to provide a conceptual foundation and physically illuminating examples that are useful to graduate students and researchers entering this subject. There are exercise problems and references for further reading throughout the notes.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Curvature and Transverse Atomic Motion in Time-Resolved Atom Interferometry: Impact and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved atom interferometry, as employed in applications such as gravitational wave detection and searches for ultra-light dark matter, requires precise control over systematic effects. In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.</description>

      <title>Reply to the Comment on "Shell-Shaped Quantum Droplet in a Three-Component Ultracold Bose Gas"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our Letter (Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 043402 (2025)), we proposed a self-bound shell-shaped BEC in a three-component ($1,2,3$) Bose gas, where $(2,3)$ and $(1,2)$ droplets are linked as core-shell structure. A recent Comment (Ancilotto, 2505.16554) argued that a ``dimer" configuration should be instead the ground state, where $(2,3)$ and $(1,2)$ stay side-by-side. Moreover, Ancilotto also explored the state formation, finding that a naive trap-release protocol was unable to produce the core-shell structure. In this reply we show that our core-shell structure is an excited state for finite-size systems, while it becomes energetically degenerate with dimer configuration in thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we find the core-shell structure is locally stable under external perturbations, and if one pays careful attention to mode-matching, a trap-release protocol can well produce this structure.</description>

      <title>Impurity immersed in a two-component few-fermion mixture in a one-dimensional harmonic trap</title>

Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional three-component few-fermion mixture confined in a parabolic external trap, where one component contains a single particle acting as an impurity. Focusing on the many-body ground state, we analyze how the interactions between the impurity and the other components influence the system's structure. For fixed interaction strengths within the mixture, we identify a critical interaction strength with the impurity for which the system undergoes a structural transition characterized by a substantial change in its spatial features. We explore this transition from the point of view of correlations and ground-state susceptibility. We remarkably find that this transition exhibits unique universality features not previously observed in other systems, highlighting novel many-body properties existing in multi-component fermionic mixtures.</description>

      <title>Transport in a System with a Tower of Quantum Many-Body Scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of unconventional transport phenomena in a spin-1 model that supports a tower of quantum many-body scars, and we discuss their properties uncovering their peculiar nature. In quantum many-body systems, the late-time dynamics of local observables are typically governed by conserved operators with local densities, such as energy and magnetization. In the model under investigation, however, there is an additional dynamical symmetry restricted to the subspace of the Hilbert space spanned by the quantum many-body scars. The latter significantly slows the decay of autocorrelation functions of certain coherent states of quantum many-body scars and is responsible for the unconventional form of transport that we detect numerically. We show that excited states with energy close to that of the quantum many-body scars play a crucial role in sustaining the transport. Finally, we propose a generalized eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to describe specific properties of states with energy close to the scars.</description>

      <title>Topological crystals and soliton lattices in a Gross-Neveu model with Hilbert-space fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the finite-density phase diagram of the single-flavour Gross-Neveu-Wilson (GNW) model using matrix product state (MPS) simulations. At zero temperature and along the symmetry line of the phase diagram, we find a sequence of inhomogeneous ground states that arise through a real-space version of the mechanism of Hilbert-space fragmentation. For weak interactions, doping the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of the GNW model leads to localized charges or holes at periodic arrangements of immobile topological defects separating the fragmented subchains: a topological crystal. Increasing the interactions, we observe a transition into a parity-broken phase with a pseudoscalar condensate displaying a modulated periodic pattern. This soliton lattice is a sequence of topological charges corresponding to anti-kinks, which also bind the doped fermions at their respective centers. Out of this symmetry line, we show that quasi-spiral profiles appear with a characteristic wavevector set by the density $k = 2{\pi}{\rho}$, providing non-perturbative evidence for chiral spirals beyond the large-N limit. These results demonstrate that various exotic inhomogeneous phases can arise in lattice field theories, and motivate the use of quantum simulators to confirm such QCD-inspired phenomena in future experiments.</description>
