      <title>How to Resolve Envy by Adding Goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of resolving the envy of a given initial allocation by adding elements from a pool of goods. We give a characterization of the instances where envy can be resolved by adding an arbitrary number of copies of the items in the pool. From this characterization, we derive a polynomial-time algorithm returning a respective solution if it exists. If the number of copies or the total number of added items are bounded, the problem becomes computationally intractable even in various restricted cases. We perform a parameterized complexity analysis, focusing on the number of agents and the pool size as parameters. Notably, although not every instance admits an envy-free solution, our approach allows us to efficiently determine, in polynomial time, whether a solution exists-an aspect that is both theoretically interesting and far from trivial.</description>

      <title>A Brief Introduction to Quantum Query Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum query complexity is a fundamental model for analyzing the computational power of quantum algorithms. It has played a key role in characterizing quantum speedups, from early breakthroughs such as Grover's and Simon's algorithms to more recent developments in quantum cryptography and complexity theory. This document provides a structured introduction to quantum query lower bounds, focusing on four major techniques: the hybrid method, the polynomial method, the recording method, and the adversary method. Each method is developed from first principles and illustrated through canonical problems. Additionally, the document discusses how the adversary method can be used to derive upper bounds, highlighting its dual role in quantum query complexity. The goal is to offer a self-contained exposition accessible to readers with a basic background in quantum computing, while also serving as an entry point for researchers interested in the study of quantum lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Testing and Magic Entropy via Quantum Fourier Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Fourier analysis is an important topic in mathematical physics. We introduce a systematic protocol for testing and measuring ``magic'' in quantum states and gates, using a quantum Fourier approach. Magic, as a quantum resource, is necessary to achieve a quantum advantage in computation. Our protocols are based on quantum convolutions and swap tests, implemented via quantum circuits. We describe this for both qubit and qudit systems. Our quantum Fourier approach offers a unified method to quantify magic, in stabilizer circuits, as well as in matchgate and bosonic Gaussian circuits.</description>

      <title>Classically estimating observables of noiseless quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a classical algorithm based on Pauli propagation for estimating expectation values of arbitrary observables on random unstructured quantum circuits across all circuit architectures and depths, including those with all-to-all connectivity. We prove that for any architecture where each circuit layer is randomly sampled from a distribution invariant under single-qubit rotations, our algorithm achieves a small error $\varepsilon$ on all circuits except for a small fraction $\delta$. The computational time is polynomial in qubit count and circuit depth for any small constant $\varepsilon, \delta$, and quasi-polynomial for inverse-polynomially small $\varepsilon, \delta$. Our results show that estimating observables of quantum circuits exhibiting chaotic and locally scrambling behavior is classically tractable across all geometries. We further conduct numerical experiments beyond our average-case assumptions, demonstrating the potential utility of Pauli propagation methods for simulating real-time dynamics and finding low-energy states of physical Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Depth Decomposition of Approximate Multi-Controlled Single-Qubit Gates Without Ancilla Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The synthesis of quantum operators involves decomposing general quantum gates into the gate set supported by a given quantum device. Multi-controlled gates are essential components in this process. In this work, we present an improved decomposition of multi-controlled NOT gates with logarithmic depth using a single ancilla qubit while reducing the ancillary resource requirements compared to previous work. We further introduce a relative-phase multi-controlled NOT gate that eliminates the need for ancillas. Building on these results, we optimize a previously proposed decomposition of multi-target, multi-controlled special unitary SU(2) gates by identifying the presence of a conditionally clean qubit. Additionally, we introduce the best-known decomposition of multi-controlled approximate unitary U(2) gates, which do not require ancilla qubits. This approach significantly reduces the overall circuit depth and CNOT count while preserving an adjustable error parameter, yielding a more efficient and scalable solution for synthesizing large controlled-unitary gates. Our method is particularly suitable for both NISQ and fault-tolerant quantum architectures. All software developed in this project is freely available.</description>
