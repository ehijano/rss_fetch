      <title>Proximality, stability, and central limit theorem for random maps on an interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic dynamical systems consisting of non-invertible continuous maps on an interval are studied. It is proved that if they satisfy the recently introduced so-called $\mu$-injectivity and some mild assumptions, then proximality, asymptotic stability and a central limit theorem hold.</description>

      <title>Nilpotent Feed Forward Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the normal form of fully inhomogeneous feed forward network dynamical systems, characterized by a nilpotent linear component. We introduce a new normal form method, termed the triangular $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-style, to categorize this normal form. We aim to establish a comprehensive normal form theory, extending to quadratic terms across all dimensions. To accomplish this, we leverage mathematical tools including Hermite reciprocity, transvectants, and insights derived from the well-known $3$-dimensional normal form related to Sylvester's work on generating functions for quadratic covariants. Furthermore, we formulate the orbital normal form in a general Lie algebraic context as the result of an outer transformation and expand it into block-triangular outer normal form. This extended framework is subsequently employed in both $2$D and $3$D scenarios, leading to noteworthy simplifications that prepare these systems for the study of bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Active vibration control of nonlinear flexible structures via reduction on spectral submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large amplitude vibrations can cause hazards and failure to engineering structures. Active control has been an effective strategy to suppress vibrations, but it faces great challenges in the real-time control of nonlinear flexible structures. Here, we present a control design framework using reductions on aperiodic spectral submanifolds (SSMs) to address the challenges. We formulate high-dimensional nonlinear optimal control problems to suppress the vibrations and then use the SSM-based reductions to transform the original optimal control problems into low-dimensional linear optimal control problems. We further establish extended linear quadratic regulators to solve the reduced optimal control problems, paving the road for real-time active control of nonlinear flexible structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our control design framework via a suite of examples with increasing complexity, including a finite element model of an aircraft wing with more than 130,000 degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Quasi-invariant measures concentrating on countable structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Countable $\mathcal{L}$-structures $\mathcal{N}$ whose isomorphism class supports a permutation invariant probability measure in the logic action have been characterized by Ackerman-Freer-Patel to be precisely those $\mathcal{N}$ which have no algebraicity. Here we characterize those countable $\mathcal{L}$-structure $\mathcal{N}$ whose isomorphism class supports a quasi-invariant probability measure. These turn out to be precisely those $\mathcal{N}$ which are not "highly algebraic" -- we say that $\mathcal{N}$ is highly algebraic if outside of every finite $F$ there is some $b$ and a tuple $\bar{a}$ disjoint from $b$ so that $b$ has a finite orbit under the pointwise stabilizer of $\bar{a}$ in $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal{N})$. As a bi-product of our proof we show that whenever the isomorphism class of $\mathcal{N}$ admits a quasi-invariant measure, then it admits one with continuous Radon--Nikodym cocycles.</description>

      <title>Front propagation in hybrid reaction-diffusion epidemic models with spatial heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a two-species reaction-diffusion system in one space dimension that is derived from an epidemiological model in a spatially periodic environment with two types of pathogens: the wild type and the mutant. The system is of a hybrid nature, partly cooperative and partly competitive, but neither of these entirely. We study under what conditions the spreading of infection occurs when the pathogen are localized initially. We show that there is a well-defined spreading speed and that it coincides with the minimal speed of the traveling waves. Next, we study the homogenization limit of the traveling waves when the spatial period of the coefficients tends to zero. Finally, we give an example of the coefficients for which the right-bound and left-bound traveling waves have different speeds, via an analysis of a certain singular limit problem. Note that such an example never exists in scalar reaction-diffusion equations even with non-symmetric spatial heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Quadratic-time computations for pseudo-Anosov mapping classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a quadratic-time algorithm to compute the stretch factor and the invariant measured foliations for a pseudo-Anosov element of the mapping class group. As input, the algorithm accepts a word (in any given finite generating set for the mapping class group) representing a pseudo-Anosov mapping class, and the length of the word is our measure of complexity for the input. The output is a train track and an integer matrix where the stretch factor is the largest real eigenvalue and the unstable foliation is given by the corresponding eigenvector. This is the first algorithm to compute stretch factors and measured foliations that is known to terminate in sub-exponential time.</description>

Abstract: We study an extreme value distribution for the unipotent flow on the modular surface $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})/\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. Using tools from homogenous dynamics and geometry of numbers we prove the existence of a continuous distribution function $F(r)$ for the normalized deepest cusp excursions of the unipotent flow. We find closed analytic formulas for $F(r)$ for $r \in [-\frac{1}{2} \log 2, \infty)$, and establish asymptotic behavior of $F(r)$ as $r \to -\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose we have two finitely supported, admissible, probability measures on a hyperbolic group $\Gamma$. In this article we prove that the corresponding two Green metrics satisfy a counting central limit theorem when we order the elements of $\Gamma$ according to one of the metrics. Our results also apply to various other metrics including length functions associated to Anosov representations and to group actions on hyperbolic metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Transcendence and normality of complex numbers via Hurwitz continued fractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topological, dynamical, and descriptive set theoretic properties of Hurwitz continued fractions. Hurwitz continued fractions associate an infinite sequence of Gaussian integers to every complex number which is not a Gaussian rational. The resulting space of sequences of Gaussian integers $\Omega$ is not closed. By means of an algorithm, we show that $\Omega$ contains a natural subset whose closure $\overline{\mathsf{R}}$ encodes continued fraction expansions of complex numbers which are not Gaussian rationals. We prove that $(\overline{\mathsf{R}}, \sigma)$ is a subshift with a feeble specification property. As an application, we determine the rank in the Borel hierarchy of the set of Hurwitz normal numbers with respect to the complex Gauss measure. We also construct a family of complex transcendental numbers with bounded partial quotients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A geometric study is given for the 4-dimensional Garnier system. By the resolution of indeterminacy, the group of its B\"aklund transformations is lifted to a group of pseudo-isomorphisms between rational varieties obtained from ${\mathbb P}^2 \times {\mathbb P}^2$ by 10 or 21 blow-ups. The root basis is discussed in the N\'eron-Severi bilattices for the space with 10 blow-ups.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hydrodynamics for the Volterra lattice: Ballistic and nonballistic behavior of correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, a lot of effort has been put in describing the hydrodynamic behavior of integrable systems. In this paper, we describe such picture for the Volterra lattice. Specifically, we are able to explicitly compute the susceptibility matrix and the current-field correlation matrix in terms of the density of states of the Volterra lattice endowed with a Generalized Gibbs ensemble. Furthermore, we apply the theory of linear Generalized Hydrodynamics to describe the Euler scale behavior of the correlation functions. We anticipate that the solution to the Generalized Hydrodynamics equations develops shocks at $\xi_0=\frac{x}{t}$; so this linear approximation does not fully describe the behavior of correlation functions. Intrigued but this fact, we performed several numerical investigations which show that, exactly when the solution to the hydrodynamic equations develops shock, the correlation functions show an highly oscillatory behavior. In view of this empirical observation, we believe that at this point $\xi_0$ the diffusive contribution are not sub-leading corrections to the ballistic transport, but they are of the same order.</description>

      <title>Studying knots in covers of the modular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a combinatorial tool to help study some topological properties of modular knots. We construct templates for the infinitely many Anosov flows on the trefoil complement, which are lifts of the geodesic flow on the modular surface, by lifting Ghys' modular template using self-covering of the trefoil complement of order $6k+1$, for $k\in \mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}$. This allows to study the knot properties of closed geodesics in these flows, and an explicit construction of an infinite family of links of two components with one of them being the trefoil, all commensurable to one another.</description>
