      <title>Biquaternion representation of the spin one half and its application on the relativistic one electron atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we represent the $1/2$ Spin particles with complex quaternions using a transformation to 2x2 matrices in order to obtain the Pauli matrices. With this representation we determine the states, rotation operators and the total angular momentum function in the complex quaternion space. Using this representation we work the solution for the relativistic hydrogen atom.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional Cyclic Quantum Teleportation of Arbitrary Schrodinger Cat Coherent-states via Bell Coherent-States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploiting the cluster of three Bell coherent-states as quantum channel, we presented a scheme wherein quantum-informations encoded in three arbitrary superposed coherent states, i.e., Schrodinger Cat coherent-states are simultaneously transmitted in unidirectional cyclic sequence among three parties by invoking usage of linear optical gadgets such as ideal beam-splitters, phase shifters and photon-number-resolving detectors. Proposed simultaneous unidirectional Cyclic Quantum Teleportation is faithful with one-eighth probability of success. Furthermore, it is seen that not every detection-events provides faithful scheme and, hence, fidelity and probability of success of near-faithful Cyclic Quantum Teleportation is evaluated and numerically interpreted.</description>

      <title>Guarantees on the structure of experimental quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks connect and supply a large number of nodes with multi-party quantum resources for secure communication, networked quantum computing and distributed sensing. As these networks grow in size, certification tools will be required to answer questions regarding their properties. In this work we demonstrate a general method to guarantee that certain correlations cannot be generated in a given quantum network. We apply quantum inflation methods to data obtained in quantum group encryption experiments, guaranteeing the impossibility of producing the observed results in networks with fewer optical elements. Our results pave the way for scalable methods of obtaining device-independent guarantees on the network structure underlying multipartite quantum protocols.</description>

      <title>Bell correlations of a thermal fully-connected spin chain in a vicinity of a quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell correlations are among the most exotic phenomena through which quantum mechanics manifests itself. Their presence signals that the system can violate the postulates of local realism, once believed to be the nonnegotiable property of the physical world. The importance of Bell correlations from this fundamental point of view is even straightened by their applications -- ranging from quantum cryptography through quantum metrology to quantum computing. Hence it is of growing interest to characterize the ``Bell content'' of complex, scalable many-body systems. Here we perform the detailed analysis of the character and strength of many-body Bell correlations in interacting multi-qubit systems with particle-exchange symmetry. Such configuration can be mapped onto an effective Schr\"odinger-like equation, which allows for precise analytical predictions. We show that in the vicinity of the quantum critical point, these correlations quickly become so strong that only a fraction of qubits remains uncorrelated. We also identify the threshold temperature, which, once overpassed, empowers thermal fluctuations that destroy Bell correlations in the system. We hope that the approach presented here, due to its universality, could be useful for the upcoming research on genuinely nonclassical Bell-correlated complex systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Frequential Computing: a quadratic run time advantage for all algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of computer called a quantum frequential computer. They harness quantum properties in a different way to conventional quantum computers to generate a quadratic computational run time advantage for all algorithms as a function of the power consumed. They come in two variants: type 1 can process classical algorithms only while type 2 can also process quantum ones. In a type-1 quantum frequential computer, only the control is quantum, while in a type 2 the logical space is also quantum. We also prove that a quantum frequential computer only requires a classical data bus to function. This is useful, because it means that only a relatively small part of the overall architecture of the computer needs to be quantum in a type-1 quantum frequential computer in order to achieve a quadratic run time advantage. As with classical and conventional quantum computers, quantum frequential computers also generate heat and require cooling. We also characterise these requirements.</description>

      <title>End-to-end variational quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing quantum correlations can enable sensing beyond the classical limits of precision, with the realization of such sensors poised for transformative impacts across science and engineering. Real devices, however, face the accumulated impacts of noise effects, architecture constraints, and finite sampling rates, making the design and success of practical quantum sensors challenging. Numerical and theoretical frameworks that support the optimization and analysis of imperfections from one end of a sensing protocol through to the other (i.e., from probe state preparation through to parameter estimation) are thus crucial for translating quantum advantage into widespread practice. Here, we present an end-to-end variational framework for quantum sensing protocols, where parameterized quantum circuits and neural networks form trainable, adaptive models for quantum sensor dynamics and estimation, respectively. The framework is general and can be adapted towards arbitrary qubit architectures, as we demonstrate with experimentally-relevant ans\"atze for trapped-ion and photonic systems, and enables to directly quantify the impacts that noisy state preparation/measurement and finite data sampling have on parameter estimation. End-to-end variational frameworks can thus underpin powerful design and analysis tools for realizing quantum advantage in practical, robust sensors.</description>

      <title>Logical Gates and Read-Out of Superconducting Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code is an exciting route to fault-tolerant quantum computing since Gaussian resources and GKP Pauli-eigenstate preparation are sufficient to achieve universal quantum computing. In this work, we provide a practical proposal to perform Clifford gates and state read-out in GKP codes implemented with active error correction in superconducting circuits. We present a method of performing Clifford circuits without physically implementing any single-qubit gates, reducing the potential for them to spread errors in the system. In superconducting circuits, all the required two-qubit gates can be implemented with a single piece of hardware. We analyze the error-spreading properties of GKP Clifford gates and describe how a modification in the decoder following the implementation of each gate can reduce the gate infidelity by multiple orders of magnitude. Moreover, we develop a simple analytical technique to estimate the effect of loss and dephasing on GKP codes that matches well with numerics. Finally, we consider the effect of homodyne measurement inefficiencies on logical state read-out and present a scheme that implements a measurement with a $0.1\%$ error rate in $630$ ns assuming an efficiency of just~$75\%$.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative cavity quantum electrodynamics: is the Jaynes-Cummings model still relevant?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this tutorial review, we briefly discuss the role that the Jaynes-Cummings model occupies in present-day research in cavity quantum electrodynamics with a particular focus on the so-called ultrastrong coupling regime. We start by critically analyzing the various approximations required to distill such a simple model from standard quantum electrodynamics. We then discuss how many of those approximations can, and often have been broken in recent experiments. The consequence of these failures has been the need to abandon the Jaynes-Cummings model for more complex models. In this, the quantum Rabi model has the most prominent role and we will rapidly survey its rich and peculiar phenomenology. We conclude the paper by showing how the Jaynes-Cummings model still plays a crucial role even in non-perturbative light-matter coupling regimes.</description>

      <title>Classification of the Fashion-MNIST Dataset on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential impact of quantum machine learning algorithms on industrial applications remains an exciting open question. Conventional methods for encoding classical data into quantum computers are not only too costly for a potential quantum advantage in the algorithms but also severely limit the scale of feasible experiments on current hardware. Therefore, recent works, despite claiming the near-term suitability of their algorithms, do not provide experimental benchmarking on standard machine learning datasets. We attempt to solve the data encoding problem by improving a recently proposed variational algorithm [1] that approximately prepares the encoded data, using asymptotically shallow circuits that fit the native gate set and topology of currently available quantum computers. We apply the improved algorithm to encode the Fashion-MNIST dataset [2], which can be directly used in future empirical studies of quantum machine learning algorithms. We deploy simple quantum variational classifiers trained on the encoded dataset on a current quantum computer ibmq-kolkata [3] and achieve moderate accuracies, providing a proof of concept for the near-term usability of our data encoding method.</description>

      <title>Successive quasienergy collapse and the driven Dicke phase transition in the few-emitter limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergent behavior that arises in many-body systems of increasing size follows universal laws that become apparent in order-to-disorder transitions. While this behavior has been traditionally explored for large numbers of emitters, recent progress allows for the exploration of the few-emitter limit, where correlations can be measured and connected to microscopic models to gain further insight into order-to-disorder transitions. We explore this few-body limit in the driven and damped Tavis--Cummings model, which describes a collection of atoms interacting with a driven and damped cavity mode. Our exploration revolves around the dressed states of the atomic ensemble and field, whose energies are shown to collapse as the driving field is increased to mark the onset of a dissipative quantum phase transition. The collapse occurs in stages and is an effect of light-matter correlations that are overlooked for single atoms and neglected in mean-field models. The implications of these correlations over the macroscopic observables of the system are presented. We encounter a shift in the expected transition point and an increased number of parity-broken states to choose from once the ordered phase is reached.</description>

      <title>Unifying uncertainties for rotor-like quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum rotor represents the second simplest model after the harmonic oscillator with profound interdisciplinary but yet unexplored implications. It overreaches its mechanical meaning with significant consequences and promising applications in, e.g., singular optics, super-conductive circuits with Josephson junction or optimal pulse shaping in time frequency domains at ultimate quantum limit. Quantification of complementarity between angular momentum and angular variable is essential for exploitation of this canonical pair in quantum metrology. Whereas the natural measures for position and momentum are variances, the uncertainty associated with angular variable can be linked to moments of inertia of the unit ring about axes passing through its center of mass. This interpretation provides variants for saturable uncertainty relations which can be further used in quantum metrology of the quantum rotor and explains ambiguities in choice of possible uncertainty measures associated with sine and cosine functions of angular variable. Special attention will be payed to uncertainty products which are exactly or approximately minimised by von Mises states, which play the role of squeezed states for quantum rotor and allow optimal detection of quantum states at the ultimate limits.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum programming with PennyLane Lightning on HPC platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PennyLane's Lightning suite, a collection of high-performance state-vector simulators targeting CPU, GPU, and HPC-native architectures and workloads. Quantum applications such as QAOA, VQE, and synthetic workloads are implemented to demonstrate the supported classical computing architectures and showcase the scale of problems that can be simulated using our tooling. We benchmark the performance of Lightning with backends supporting CPUs, as well as NVidia and AMD GPUs, and compare the results to other commonly used high-performance simulator packages, demonstrating where Lightning's implementations give performance leads. We show improved CPU performance by employing explicit SIMD intrinsics and multi-threading, batched task-based execution across multiple GPUs, and distributed forward and gradient-based quantum circuit executions across multiple nodes. Our data shows we can comfortably simulate a variety of circuits, giving examples with up to 30 qubits on a single device or node, and up to 41 qubits using multiple nodes.</description>

      <title>Advancing Quantum Networking: Some Tools and Protocols for Ideal and Noisy Photonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networking at many scales will be critical to future quantum technologies and experiments on quantum systems. Photonic links enable quantum networking. They will connect co-located quantum processors to enable large-scale quantum computers, provide links between distant quantum computers to support distributed, delegated, and blind quantum computing, and will link distant nodes in space enabling new tests of fundamental physics. Here, we discuss recent work advancing photonic tools and protocols that support quantum networking. We provide analytical results and numerics for the effect of distinguishability errors on key photonic circuits; we considered a variety of error models and developed new metrics for benchmarking the quality of generated photonic states. We review a distillation protocol by one of the authors that mitigates distinguishability errors. We also review recent results by a subset of the authors on the efficient simulation of photonic circuits via approximation by coherent states. We study some interactions between the theory of universal sets, unitary t-designs, and photonics: while many of the results we state in this direction may be known to experts, we aim to bring them to the attention of the broader quantum information science community and to phrase them in ways that are more familiar to this community. We prove, translating a result from representation theory, that there are no non-universal infinite closed $2$-designs in $U(V)$ when $\dim V \geq 2$. As a consequence, we observe that linear optical unitaries form a $1$-design but not a 2-design. Finally, we apply a result of Oszmaniec and Zimbor\'{a}s to prove that augmenting the linear optical unitaries with any nontrivial SNAP gate is sufficient to achieve universality.</description>

      <title>Position operators in terms of converging finite-dimensional matrices: Exploring their interplay with geometry, transport, and gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Position operator $\hat{r}$ appears as $i{\partial_p}$ in wave mechanics, while its matrix form is well known diverging in diagonals, causing serious difficulties in basis transformation, observable yielding, etc. We aim to find a convergent $r$-matrix (CRM) to improve the existing divergent $r$-matrix (DRM), and investigate its influence at both the conceptual and the application levels. Unlike the spin matrix, which affords a Lie algebra representation as the solution of $[s_i,s_j]={\epsilon}_{i,j,k}s_k$, the $r$-matrix cannot be a solution for $[\hat{r},p]=i\hbar$, namely Weyl algebra. Indeed: matrix representations of Weyl algebras prove not existing; thus, neither CRM nor DRM would afford a representation. Instead, the CRM should be viewed as a procedure of encoding $\hat{r}$ using matrices of arbitrary finite dimensions. Deriving CRM recognizes that the limited understanding about Weyl algebra has led to the divergence. A key modification is increasing the 1-st Weyl algebra (the familiar substitution $\hat{r}{\rightarrow}i{\partial_p}$) to the $N$-th Weyl algebra. Resolving the divergence makes $r$-matrix rigorously defined, and we are able to show $r$-matrix is distinct from a spin matrix in terms of its defining principles, transformation behavior, and the observable it yields. At the conceptual level, the CRM fills the logical gap between the $r$-matrix and the Berry connection; and helps to show that Bloch space $\mathcal{H}_B$ is incomplete for $\hat{r}$. At the application level, we focus on transport, and discover that the Hermitian matrix is not identical with the associative Hermitian operator, i.e., $r_{m,n}=r_{n,m}^*{\nLeftrightarrow}\hat{r}=\hat{r}^{\dagger}$. We also discuss how such a non-representation CRM can contribute to building a unified transport theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that QMA where the verifier may also make a single non-collapsing measurement is equal to NEXP, resolving an open question of Aaronson. We show this is a corollary to a modified proof of QMA+ = NEXP [arXiv:2306.13247]. At the core of many results inspired by Blier and Tapp [arXiv:0709.0738] is an unphysical property testing problem deciding whether a quantum state is close to an element of a fixed basis.</description>

      <title>PDQMA = DQMA = NEXP: QMA With Hidden Variables and Non-collapsing Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study a variant of QMA (Quantum Merlin Arthur) in which Arthur can make multiple non-collapsing measurements to Merlin's witness state, in addition to ordinary collapsing measurements. By analogy to the class PDQP defined by Aaronson, Bouland, Fitzsimons, and Lee (2014), we call this class PDQMA. Our main result is that PDQMA = NEXP; this result builds on the MIP = NEXP Theorem and complements the result of Aaronson (2018) that PDQP/qpoly = ALL. While the result has little to do with quantum mechanics, we also show a more "quantum" result: namely, that QMA with the ability to inspect the entire history of a hidden variable is equal to NEXP, under mild assumptions on the hidden-variable theory. We also observe that a quantum computer, augmented with quantum advice and the ability to inspect the history of a hidden variable, can solve any decision problem in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>High-Rate 16-node quantum access network based on passive optical network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution can provide information-theoretical secure communication, which is now heading towards building the quantum secure network for real-world applications. In most built quantum secure networks, point-to-multipoint (PTMP) topology is one of the most popular schemes, especially for quantum access networks. However, due to the lack of custom protocols with high secret key rate and compatible with classical optical networks for PTMP scheme, there is still no efficient way for a high-performance quantum access network with a multitude of users. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of a high-rate 16-nodes quantum access network based on passive optical network, where a high-efficient coherent-state PTMP protocol is novelly designed to allow independent secret key generation between one transmitter and multiple receivers concurrently. Such accomplishment is attributed to a well-designed real-time shot-noise calibration method, a series of advanced digital signal processing algorithms and a flexible post-processing strategy with high success probability. Finally, the experimental results show that the average secret key rate is around 2.086 Mbps between the transmitter and each user, which is two orders of magnitude higher than previous demonstrations. With the advantages of low cost, excellent compatibility, and wide bandwidth, our work paves the way for building practical PTMP quantum access networks, thus constituting an important step towards scalable quantum secure networks.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of diverse methodologies for portfolio optimization leveraging quantum annealing techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization (PO) is extensively employed in financial services to assist in achieving investment objectives. By providing an optimal asset allocation, PO effectively balances the risk and returns associated with investments. However, it is important to note that as the number of involved assets and constraints increases, the portfolio optimization problem can become increasingly difficult to solve, falling into the category of NP-hard problems. In such scenarios, classical algorithms, such as the Monte Carlo method, exhibit limitations in addressing this challenge when the number of stocks in the portfolio grows. Quantum annealing algorithm holds promise for solving complex portfolio optimization problems in the NISQ era. Many studies have demonstrated the advantages of various quantum annealing algorithm variations over the standard quantum annealing approach. In this work, we conduct a numerical investigation of randomly generated unconstrained single-period discrete mean-variance portfolio optimization instances. We explore the application of a variety of unconventional quantum annealing algorithms, employing both forward annealing and reverse annealing schedules. By comparing the time-to-solution(TTS) and success probabilities of diverse approaches, we show that certain methods exhibit advantages in enhancing the success probability when utilizing conventional forward annealing schedules. Furthermore, we find that the implementation of reverse annealing schedules can significantly improve the performance of select unconventional quantum annealing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Generation of True Quantum Random Numbers with On-Demand Probability Distributions via Single-Photon Quantum Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random numbers are at the heart of diverse fields, ranging from simulations of stochastic processes to classical and quantum cryptography. The requirement for true randomness in these applications has motivated various proposals for generating random numbers based on the inherent randomness of quantum systems. The generation of true random numbers with arbitrarily defined probability distributions is highly desirable for applications, but it is very challenging. Here we show that single-photon quantum walks can generate multi-bit random numbers with on-demand probability distributions, when the required ``coin'' parameters are found with the gradient descent (GD) algorithm. Our theoretical and experimental results exhibit high fidelity for various selected distributions. This GD-enhanced single-photon system provides a convenient way for building flexible and reliable quantum random number generators. Multi-bit random numbers are a necessary resource for high-dimensional quantum key distribution.</description>

      <title>Greedy receiver for photon-efficient optical communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In optical communication the transmitter encodes information into a set of light states defined by the modulation format, selected to accommodate specific channel conditions and to remain sufficiently distinguishable at the output. Various receiver architectures have been designed to improve the demodulation performance, ultimately limited by quantum theory. In this work I introduce a new receiver based on a locally optimal greedy algorithm and apply it to pulse position modulation. The receiver reduces the error probabilities of previously proposed strategies in all signal strength regimes and achieves results comparable with those obtained by numerical optimization of the detection process. In contrast, however, it is conceptually simple and therefore can be scaled to arbitrarily high modulation orders for which numerical methods become intractable. In the photon-starved regime characteristic of deep space optical communication, the greedy receiver approaches the quantum-optimal Helstrom bound on state discrimination error probability. In the regime of few-photon pulses, the error reduction offered over the other methods grows up to an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Hardware requirements for trapped-ion based verifiable blind quantum computing with a measurement-only client</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In blind quantum computing, a user with a simple client device can perform a quantum computation on a remote quantum server such that the server cannot gain knowledge about the computation. Here, we numerically investigate hardware requirements for verifiable blind quantum computing using an ion trap as server and a distant measurement-only client. While the client has no direct access to quantum-computing resources, it can remotely execute quantum programs on the server by measuring photons emitted by the trapped ion. We introduce a numerical model for trapped-ion quantum devices in NetSquid, a discrete-event simulator for quantum networks. Using this, we determine the minimal hardware requirements on a per-parameter basis to perform the verifiable blind quantum computing protocol. We benchmark these for a five-qubit linear graph state, with which any single-qubit rotation can be performed, where client and server are separated by 50 km. Current state-of-the-art ion traps satisfy the minimal requirements on a per-parameter basis, but all current imperfections combined make it impossible to perform the blind computation securely over 50 km using existing technology. Using a genetic algorithm, we determine the set of hardware parameters that minimises the total improvements required, finding directions along which to improve hardware to reach our threshold error probability that would enable experimental demonstration. In this way, we lay a path for the near-term experimental progress required to realise the implementation of verifiable blind quantum computing over a 50 km distance.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage: A Single Qubit's Experimental Edge in Classical Data Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement an experiment on a photonic quantum processor establishing efficacy of an elementary quantum system in classical information storage. The advantage is established by considering a class of simple bipartite games played with the communication resource qubit and classical bit (c-bit), respectively. Conventional wisdom, as articulated by the no-go theorems of Holevo and Frenkel-Weiner, suggests that such a quantum advantage is unattainable in scenarios wherein sender and receiver possess shared randomness or classical correlation between them. Notably, the advantage we report is demonstrated in a scenario where participating players lack any form of shared randomness. Our experiment involves the development of a variational triangular polarimeter, enabling the realization of positive operator value measurements crucial for establishing the targeted quantum advantage. In addition to demonstrating a robust communication advantage of a single qubit our experiment also opens avenues for immediate applications in near-term quantum technologies. Furthermore, it constitutes a semi-device-independent non-classicality certification scheme for the quantum encoding-decoding apparatus, underscoring the broader implications of our work beyond its immediate technological applications.</description>

      <title>Passive and active suppression of transduced noise in silicon spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing and mitigating decoherence sources plays an essential role in the development of a scalable quantum computing system, which requires low gate errors to be consistently maintained throughout the circuit execution. While nuclear spin-free materials, such as isotopically purified silicon, exhibit intrinsically promising coherence properties for electron spin qubits, the omnipresent charge noise, when converted to magnetic noise under a strong magnetic field gradient, often hinders stable qubit operation within a time frame comparable to the data acquisition time. Here, we demonstrate both open- and closed-loop suppression techniques for the transduced noise in silicon spin qubits, resulting in a more than two-fold (ten-fold) improvement of the inhomogeneous coherence time (Rabi oscillation quality) that leads to a single-qubit gate fidelity of over 99.6% even in the presence of a strong decoherence field gradient. Utilizing gate set tomography, we show that adaptive qubit control also reduces the non-Markovian noise in the system, which validates the stability of the gate fidelity. The technique can be used to learn multiple Hamiltonian parameters and is useful for the intermittent calibration of the circuit parameters with affordable experimental overhead, providing a useful subroutine during the repeated execution of general quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of the echo state property in quantum reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The echo state property (ESP) represents a fundamental concept in the reservoir computing (RC) framework that ensures output-only training of reservoir networks by being agnostic to the initial states and far past inputs. However, the traditional definition of ESP does not describe possible non-stationary systems in which statistical properties evolve. To address this issue, we introduce two new categories of ESP: \textit{non-stationary ESP}, designed for potentially non-stationary systems, and \textit{subspace/subset ESP}, designed for systems whose subsystems have ESP. Following the definitions, we numerically demonstrate the correspondence between non-stationary ESP in the quantum reservoir computer (QRC) framework with typical Hamiltonian dynamics and input encoding methods using non-linear autoregressive moving-average (NARMA) tasks. We also confirm the correspondence by computing linear/non-linear memory capacities that quantify input-dependent components within reservoir states. Our study presents a new understanding of the practical design of QRC and other possibly non-stationary RC systems in which non-stationary systems and subsystems are exploited.</description>

      <title>Tsirelson bounds for quantum correlations with indefinite causal order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum theory is in principle compatible with processes that violate causal inequalities, an analogue of Bell inequalities that constrain the correlations observed by a set of parties operating in a definite order. Since the introduction of causal inequalities, determining their maximum quantum violation, analogue to Tsirelson's bound, has remained an open problem. Here we provide a general method for bounding the violation of causal inequalities by arbitrary quantum processes with indefinite causal order. We prove that the maximum violation is generally smaller than the algebraic maximum, and determine a Tsirelson-like bound for the paradigmatic example of the Oreshkov-Brukner-Costa causal inequality. Surprisingly, we find that the algebraic maximum of arbitrary causal inequalities can be achieved by a new type of processes that allow for information to flow in an indefinite direction within the parties' laboratories. In the classification of the possible correlations, these processes play a similar role as the no-signalling processes in Bell scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are promising candidates for delivering practical quantum advantage on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, optimizing the noisy cost functions associated with these algorithms is challenging for system sizes relevant to quantum advantage. In this work, we investigate the effect of noise on optimization by studying a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm calculating the ground state of a spin chain model, and we observe an abrupt transition induced by noise to the optimal solutions. We will present numerical simulations, a demonstration using an IBM quantum processor unit (QPU), and a theoretical analysis indicating the origin of this transition. Our findings suggest that careful analysis is crucial to avoid misinterpreting the noise-induced features as genuine algorithm results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of logical quantum processors marks the beginning of the early stages of error-corrected quantum computation. As a bridge between the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era and the fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) era, these devices and their successors have the potential to revolutionize the solution of classically challenging problems. An important application of quantum computers is to calculate observables of quantum systems. This problem is crucial for solving quantum many-body and optimization problems. However, due to limited error correction capabilities, this new era are still susceptible to noise, thereby necessitating new quantum algorithms with polynomial complexity as well as noisy-resilency. This paper proposes a new noise-resilient and ansatz-free algorithm, called Quantum Zeno Monte Carlo. It utilizes the quantum Zeno effect and Monte Carlo integration for multi-step adiabatic transitions to the target eigenstates. It can efficiently find static as well as dynamic physical properties such as ground state energy, excited state energies, and Green's function without the use of variational parameters. This algorithm offers a polynomial computational cost and quantum circuit depth that is significantly lower than the quantum phase estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum computing has increasingly highlighted its potential in the realm of machine learning, particularly in the context of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Quantum machine learning (QML) leverages the unique capabilities of quantum computing to offer novel perspectives and methodologies for complex data processing and pattern recognition challenges. This paper introduces a novel Quantum Mixed-State Attention Network (QMSAN), which integrates the principles of quantum computing with classical machine learning algorithms, especially self-attention networks, to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness in handling NLP tasks. QMSAN model employs a quantum attention mechanism based on mixed states, enabling efficient direct estimation of similarity between queries and keys within the quantum domain, leading to more effective attention weight acquisition. Additionally, we propose an innovative quantum positional encoding scheme, implemented through fixed quantum gates within the quantum circuit, to enhance the model's accuracy. Experimental validation on various datasets demonstrates that QMSAN model outperforms existing quantum and classical models in text classification, achieving significant performance improvements. QMSAN model not only significantly reduces the number of parameters but also exceeds classical self-attention networks in performance, showcasing its strong capability in data representation and information extraction. Furthermore, our study investigates the model's robustness in different quantum noise environments, showing that QMSAN possesses commendable robustness to low noise.</description>

      <title>SIC-POVMs from Stark Units: Dimensions n^2+3=4p, p prime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence problem for maximal sets of equiangular lines (or SICs) in complex Hilbert space of dimension $d$ remains largely open. In a previous publication (arXiv:2112.05552) we gave a conjectural algorithm for how to construct a SIC if $d = n^2+3 = p$, a prime number. Perhaps the most surprising number-theoretical aspect of that algorithm is the appearance of Stark units in a key role: a single Stark unit from a ray class field extension of a real quadratic field serves as a seed from which the SIC is constructed. The algorithm can be modified to apply to all dimensions $d = n^2+3$. Here we focus on the case when $d= n^2+3 = 4p$, $p$ prime, for two reasons. First, special measures have to be taken on the Hilbert space side of the problem when the dimension is even. Second, the degrees of the relevant ray class fields are `smooth' in a sense that facilitates exact calculations. As a result the algorithm becomes easier to explain. We give solutions for seventeen different dimensions of this form, reaching $d = 39604$. Several improvements relative to our previous publication are reported, but we cannot offer a proof that the algorithm works for any dimensions where it has not been tested.</description>

Abstract: The real Hilbert space formalism developed within the quaternionic quantum mechanics ($\mathbb H$QM) is fully applied to the simple model of the autonomous particle. This framework permits novel insights within the usual description of the complex autonomous particle, particulaly concening the energy of a non-stationary motion. Through the appraisal of the physical role played by a fully quaternionic scalar potential, a original self-interaction within the quaternionic autonomous particle has been determined as well. Scattering processes are considered to illustrate these novel features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers are expected to revolutionize our ability to process information. The advancement from classical to quantum computing is a product of our advancement from classical to quantum physics -- the more our understanding of the universe grows, so does our ability to use it for computation. A natural question that arises is, what will physics allow in the future? Can more advanced theories of physics increase our computational power, beyond quantum computing?
  An active field of research in physics studies theoretical phenomena outside the scope of explainable quantum mechanics, that form when attempting to combine Quantum Mechanics (QM) with General Relativity (GR) into a unified theory of Quantum Gravity (QG). QG is known to present the possibility of a quantum superposition of causal structure and event orderings. In the literature of quantum information theory, this translates to a superposition of unitary evolution orders.
  In this work we show a first example of a natural computational model based on QG, that provides an exponential speedup over standard quantum computation (under standard hardness assumptions). We define a model and complexity measure for a quantum computer that has the ability to generate a superposition of unitary evolution orders, and show that such computer is able to solve in polynomial time two of the fundamental problems in computer science: The Graph Isomorphism Problem ($\mathsf{GI}$) and the Gap Closest Vector Problem ($\mathsf{GapCVP}$), with gap $O\left( n^{2} \right)$. These problems are believed by experts to be hard to solve for a regular quantum computer. Interestingly, our model does not seem overpowered, and we found no obvious way to solve entire complexity classes that are considered hard in computer science, like the classes $\mathbf{NP}$ and $\mathbf{SZK}$.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Property Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locality is a fundamental feature of many physical time evolutions. Assumptions on locality and related structural properties also underlie recently proposed procedures for learning an unknown Hamiltonian from access to the induced time evolution. However, no protocols to rigorously test whether an unknown Hamiltonian is local were known. We investigate Hamiltonian locality testing as a property testing problem, where the task is to determine whether an unknown $n$-qubit Hamiltonian $H$ is $k$-local or $\varepsilon$-far from all $k$-local Hamiltonians, given access to the time evolution along $H$. First, we emphasize the importance of the chosen distance measure: With respect to the operator norm, a worst-case distance measure, incoherent quantum locality testers require $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n)$ many time evolution queries and an expected total evolution time of $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n / \varepsilon)$, and even coherent testers need $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ many queries and $\Omega(2^{n/2}/\varepsilon)$ total evolution time. In contrast, when distances are measured according to the normalized Frobenius norm, corresponding to an average-case distance, we give a sample-, time-, and computationally efficient incoherent Hamiltonian locality testing algorithm based on randomized measurements. In fact, our procedure can be used to simultaneously test a wide class of Hamiltonian properties beyond locality. Finally, we prove that learning a general Hamiltonian remains exponentially hard with this average-case distance, thereby establishing an exponential separation between Hamiltonian testing and learning. Our work initiates the study of property testing for quantum Hamiltonians, demonstrating that a broad class of Hamiltonian properties is efficiently testable even with limited quantum capabilities, and positioning Hamiltonian testing as an independent area of research alongside Hamiltonian learning.</description>

      <title>Operational Nonclassicality in Quantum Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To quantify quantum advantage in communication networks, we apply an operational framework for witnessing quantum nonclassicality. Following previous approaches in the field, this framework first computes linear constraints on the input/output probabilities that arise in classical networks when the amount of communication is bounded. We then apply variational quantum algorithms to optimize these probabilities when quantum communication resources are introduced. Any violation of the classical constraints indicates that extra classical communication is needed to simulate the comparable quantum network, thereby demonstrating an explicit quantum advantage. We demonstrate nonclassicality in many basic networks such as entanglement-assisted point-to-point and multi-point channels. In all examples, we find that equipping classical or quantum channels with entanglement leads to nonclassicality, whereas networks having multiple senders do not require entanglement to achieve nonclassicality. Finally, we discuss how our approaches could be implemented on quantum networking hardware and used to automatically establish certain protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical scattering force is used to reduce the loading time of single atoms to a cavity mode. Releasing a cold atomic ensemble above the resonator, we apply a push beam along the direction of gravity, offering fast atomic transport with narrow velocity distribution. We also observe in real time that, when the push beam is illuminated against gravity, single atoms slow down and even turn around in the mode, through the cavity-transmission measurement. Our method can be employed to make atom-cavity experiments more efficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying chemical reactions, particularly in the gas phase, relies heavily on computing scattering matrix elements. These elements are essential for characterizing molecular reactions and accurately determining reaction probabilities. However, the intricate nature of quantum interactions poses challenges, necessitating the use of advanced mathematical models and computational approaches to tackle the inherent complexities. In this study, we develop and apply a quantum algorithm for the calculation of scattering matrix elements. In our approach, we employ the time-dependent method based on the M\"oller operator formulation where the S-matrix element between the respective reactant and product channels is determined through the time correlation function of the reactant and product M\"oller wavepackets. We successfully apply our quantum algorithm to calculate scattering matrix elements for 1D semi-infinite square well potential and on the co-linear hydrogen exchange reaction. As we navigate the complexities of quantum interactions, this quantum algorithm is general and emerges as a promising avenue, shedding light on new possibilities for simulating chemical reactions on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Enhancing single-atom loading in tightly confined dipole traps with ancillary dipole beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single atoms trapped in tightly focused optical dipole traps provide an excellent experimental platform for quantum computing, precision measurement, and fundamental physics research. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a novel approach to enhancing the loading of single atoms by introducing a weak ancillary dipole beam. The loading rate of single atoms in a dipole trap can be significantly improved by only a few tens of microwatts of counter-propagating beam. It was also demonstrated that multiple atoms could be loaded with the assistance of a counter-propagating beam. By reducing the power requirements for trapping single atoms and enabling the trapping of multiple atoms, our method facilitates the extension of single-atom arrays and the investigation of collective light-atom interactions.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating efficient and robust bosonic state reconstruction via optimized excitation counting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state reconstruction is an essential element in quantum information processing. However, efficient and reliable reconstruction of non-trivial quantum states in the presence of hardware imperfections can be challenging. This task is particularly demanding for high-dimensional states encoded in continuous-variable (CV) systems, as many error-prone measurements are needed to cover the relevant degrees of freedom of the system in phase space. In this work, we introduce an efficient and robust technique for optimized reconstruction based on excitation number sampling (ORENS). We use a standard bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) setup to experimentally demonstrate the robustness of ORENS and show that it outperforms the existing cQED reconstruction techniques such as Wigner tomography and Husimi Q-function. Our investigation highlights that ORENS is naturally free of parasitic system dynamics and resilient to decoherence effects in the hardware. Finally, ORENS relies only on the ability to accurately measure the excitation number of the state, making it a versatile and accessible tool for a wide range of CV platforms and readily scalable to multimode systems. Thus, our work provides a crucial and valuable primitive for practical quantum information processing using bosonic modes.</description>

      <title>Bounding speedup of quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling tasks are a natural class of problems for quantum computers due to the probabilistic nature of the Born rule. Sampling from useful distributions on noisy quantum hardware remains a challenging problem. A recent paper [Layden, D. et al. Nature 619, 282-287 (2023)] proposed a quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm where moves are generated by a quantum device and accepted or rejected by a classical algorithm. While this procedure is robust to noise and control imperfections, its potential for quantum advantage is unclear. Here we show that there is no speedup over classical sampling on a worst-case unstructured sampling problem. We present an upper bound to the Markov gap that rules out a speedup for any unital quantum proposal.</description>

Abstract: Quantum sensors based on the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond are rapidly advancing from scientific exploration towards the first generation of commercial applications. While significant progress has been made in developing suitable methods for the manipulation of the NV centre spin state, the detection of the defect luminescence has so far limited the performance of miniaturized sensor architectures. The recent development of photoelectric detection of the NV centre's spin state offers a path to circumvent these limitations, but has to-date required research-grade low current amplifiers to detect the picoampere-scale currents obtained from these systems. Here we report on the photoelectric detection of magnetic resonance (PDMR) with NV ensembles using a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) device. The integrated circuit delivers a digitized output of the diamond sensor with low noise and 50 femtoampere resolution. This integration provides the last missing component on the path to a compact, diamond-based quantum sensor. The device is suited for continuous wave (CW) as well as pulsed operation. We demonstrate its functionality with DC and AC magnetometry up to several megahertz, coherent spin rotation and multi-axial decoupling sequences for quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Solving non-native combinatorial optimization problems using hybrid quantum-classical algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization is a challenging problem applicable in a wide range of fields from logistics to finance. Recently, quantum computing has been used to attempt to solve these problems using a range of algorithms, including parameterized quantum circuits, adiabatic protocols, and quantum annealing. These solutions typically have several challenges: 1) there is little to no performance gain over classical methods, 2) not all constraints and objectives may be efficiently encoded in the quantum ansatz, and 3) the solution domain of the objective function may not be the same as the bit strings of measurement outcomes. This work presents "non-native hybrid algorithms" (NNHA): a framework to overcome these challenges by integrating quantum and classical resources with a hybrid approach. By designing non-native quantum variational ansatzes that inherit some but not all problem structure, measurement outcomes from the quantum computer can act as a resource to be used by classical routines to indirectly compute optimal solutions, partially overcoming the challenges of contemporary quantum optimization approaches. These methods are demonstrated using a publicly available neutral-atom quantum computer on two simple problems of Max $k$-Cut and maximum independent set. We find improvements in solution quality when comparing the hybrid algorithm to its ``no quantum" version, a demonstration of a "comparative advantage".</description>

      <title>Realistic photon-number resolution in Gaussian Boson Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) is the model of non-universal quantum computation that has already demonstrated quantum supremacy in experiments. This model entails sampling photocounting events from a multimode Gaussian state at the outputs of a linear interferometer. In this scheme, collision events -- those with more than one photon for each mode -- are infrequent. However, they are still used for validation purposes. Therefore, the limitation of realistic detectors to perfectly resolve adjacent photon numbers becomes pivotal. We have derived the photocounting probability distribution in the GBS schemes, which is applicable for use with general detectors and photocounting techniques. This probability distribution is expressed in terms of functionals of the field-quadrature covariance matrix -- e.g., Hafnian and Torontonian in the well-known special cases of photon-number resolving and on-off detectors, respectively. Based on our results, we have considered a GBS validation technique involving detectors with realistic photon-number resolution.</description>

      <title>Operator Learning Renormalization Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general framework for quantum many-body simulations called the operator learning renormalization group (OLRG). Inspired by machine learning perspectives, OLRG is a generalization of Wilson's numerical renormalization group and White's density matrix renormalization group, which recursively builds a simulatable system to approximate a target system of the same number of sites via operator maps. OLRG uses a loss function to minimize the error of a target property directly by learning the operator map in lieu of a state ansatz. This loss function is designed by a scaling consistency condition that also provides a provable bound for real-time evolution. We implement two versions of the operator maps for classical and quantum simulations. The former, which we call the Operator Matrix Map, can be implemented via neural networks on classical computers. The latter, which we call the Hamiltonian Expression Map, generates device pulse sequences to leverage the capabilities of quantum computing hardware. We illustrate the performance of both maps for calculating time-dependent quantities in the quantum Ising model Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of many-body quantum systems using Rydberg-atom platforms has become of extreme interest in the last years. The possibility to realize spin Hamiltonians and the accurate control at the single atom level paved the way for the study of quantum phases of matter and dynamics. Here, we propose a quantum optimal control protocol based on the GRAPE algorithm to engineer quantum current states. Besides current states characterized by a single winding number, our approach allow to access superposition of quantum current states. The single current states are eigenstates of the current operator that therefore can define an observable that remains persistent at any time. In particular, the features of the excitations dynamics reflects the nature of current states, a fact that in principle can be used to characterize the nature of the flow experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While photon catalyzed two mode squeezed vacuum state has been considered in context of quantum teleportation, similar studies have not been yet conducted for photon catalyzed two-mode squeezed thermal (TMST) state. This can be attributed to challenges involved in the evaluation of teleportation fidelity for photon catalyzed TMST state. In this article, we consider a practical scheme for the implementation of non-Gaussian operation, viz., photon subtraction, photon addition, and photon catalysis, on TMST state. The generated states are employed as resources in continuous-variable quantum teleportation. The results show that the three non-Gaussian operations can enhance the teleportation fidelity. Considering the success probability of the non-Gaussian operations, we identify single-photon catalysis and single photon subtraction to be optimal for teleporting input coherent states, at low and intermediate squeezing levels.</description>

      <title>Relational bulk reconstruction from modular flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement wedge reconstruction paradigm in AdS/CFT states that for a bulk qudit within the entanglement wedge of a boundary subregion $\bar{A}$, operators acting on the bulk qudit can be reconstructed as CFT operators on $\bar{A}$. This naturally fits within the framework of quantum error correction, with the CFT states containing the bulk qudit forming a code protected against the erasure of the boundary subregion $A$. In this paper, we set up and study a framework for relational bulk reconstruction in holography: given two code subspaces both protected against erasure of the boundary region $A$, the goal is to relate the operator reconstructions between the two spaces. To accomplish this, we assume that the two code subspaces are smoothly connected by a one-parameter family of codes all protected against the erasure of $A$, and that the maximally-entangled states on these codes are all full-rank. We argue that such code subspaces can naturally be constructed in holography in a "measurement-based" setting. In this setting, we derive a flow equation for the operator reconstruction of a fixed code subspace operator using modular theory which can, in principle, be integrated to relate the reconstructed operators all along the flow. We observe a striking resemblance between our formulas for relational bulk reconstruction and the infinite-time limit of Connes cocycle flow, and take some steps towards making this connection more rigorous. We also provide alternative derivations of our reconstruction formulas in terms of a canonical reconstruction map we call the modular reflection operator.</description>

      <title>Enhanced many-body quantum scars from the non-Hermitian Fock skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast with extended Bloch waves, a single particle can become spatially localized due to the so-called skin effect originating from non-Hermitian pumping. Here we show that in a wide class of kinetically constrained many-body systems, the skin effect can instead manifest as dynamical amplification within the Fock space, beyond the intuitively expected and previously studied particle localization and clustering. We exemplify this non-Hermitian Fock skin effect in an asymmetric version of the PXP model and show that it gives rise to ergodicity-breaking eigenstates, the non-Hermitian analogs of quantum many-body scars. A distinguishing feature of these non-Hermitian scars is their enhanced robustness against external disorders. We propose an experimental realization of the non-Hermitian scar enhancement in a tilted Bose-Hubbard optical lattice with laser-induced loss. Our results show that the Fock skin effect provides a powerful tool for creating robust non-ergodic states in generic open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum criticality and pseudocriticality across the fixed-point annihilation in the anisotropic spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-boson models are simple examples of quantum dissipative systems, but also serve as effective models in quantum magnetism and exhibit nontrivial quantum criticality. Recently, they have been established as a platform to study the nontrivial renormalization-group (RG) scenario of fixed-point annihilation, in which two intermediate-coupling RG fixed points collide and generate an extremely slow RG flow near the collision. For the Bose Kondo model, a single $S=1/2$ spin where each spin component couples to an independent bosonic bath with power-law spectrum $\propto \omega^s$ via dissipation strengths $\alpha_i$, $i\in\{x,y,z\}$, such phenomena occur sequentially for the U(1)-symmetric model at $\alpha_z=0$ and the SU(2)-symmetric case at $\alpha_z = \alpha_{xy}$, as the bath exponent $s&lt;1$ is tuned. Here we use an exact wormhole quantum Monte Carlo method to show how fixed-point annihilations within symmetry-enhanced parameter manifolds affect the anisotropy-driven criticality across them. We find a tunable transition between two long-range-ordered localized phases that can be continuous or strongly first-order, and even becomes weakly first-order in an extended regime close to the fixed-point collision. We extract critical exponents at the continuous transition, but also find scaling behavior at the symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, for which the inverse correlation-length exponent is given by the bath exponent $s$. In particular, we provide direct numerical evidence for pseudocritical scaling on both sides of the fixed-point collision, which manifests in an extremely slow drift of the correlation-length exponent. In addition, we also study the crossover behavior away from the SU(2)-symmetric case and determine the phase boundary of an extended U(1)-symmetric critical phase for $\alpha_z &lt; \alpha_{xy}$.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Dynamic Majorana Hybridization for Universal Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qubits built out of Majorana zero modes have long been theorized as a potential pathway toward fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Almost unavoidable in these processes is Majorana wavefunction overlap, known as hybridization, which arise throughout the process when Majorana modes get close to each other. This breaks the ground state degeneracy, leading to qubit errors in the braiding process. This work presents an accessible method to track transitions within the low-energy subspace and predict the output of braids with hybridized Majorana modes. As an application, we characterize Pauli qubit-errors, as demonstrated on an X-gate, critical for the successful operation of any quantum computer. Further, we perform numerical simulations to demonstrate how to utilize the hybridization to implement arbitrary rotations, along with a two-qubit controlled magic gate, thus providing a demonstration of universal quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: The last few years have seen rapid progress in transitioning quantum computing from lab to industry. In healthcare and life sciences, more than 40 proof-of-concept experiments and studies have been conducted; an increasing number of these are even run on real quantum hardware. Major investments have been made with hundreds of millions of dollars already allocated towards quantum applications and hardware in medicine. In addition to pharmaceutical and life sciences uses, clinical and medical applications are now increasingly coming into the picture. This chapter focuses on three key use case areas associated with (precision) medicine, including genomics and clinical research, diagnostics, and treatments and interventions. Examples of organizations and the use cases they have been researching are given; ideas how the development of practical quantum computing applications can be further accelerated are described.</description>

      <title>A numerical algorithm for solving the coupled Schr\"odinger equations using inverse power method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inverse power method is a numerical algorithm to obtain the eigenvectors of a matrix. In this work, we develop an iteration algorithm, based on the inverse power method, to numerically solve the Schr\"odinger equation that couples an arbitrary number of components. Such an algorithm can also be applied to the multi-body systems. To show the power and accuracy of this method, we also present an example of solving the Dirac equation under the presence of an external scalar potential and a constant magnetic field, with source code publicly available.</description>

      <title>Quantum for Good and the Societal Impact of Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises to help humanity solve problems that would otherwise be intractable on classical computers. Unlike today's machines, quantum computers use a novel computing process that leverages the foundational quantum mechanical laws of nature. This unlocks unparalleled compute power for certain applications and promises to help solve some of our generation's gravest challenges, including the climate crisis, food insecurity, and widespread disease. No one entity will be able to realize this end state alone. Developing a fault-tolerant quantum supercomputer and a vibrant ecosystem around it will require deep partnerships between industry, governments, and academia. It will also require collective action to enable and promote positive applications of quantum computing and ensure that the safe and responsible use of the technology is at the center of its development and deployment. Achieving these objectives will require focusing on three priorities:
  1. Impact. Ensure quantum computing benefits all of humankind by developing quantum solutions to solve critical, global problems.
  2. Use. Protect against malicious use by accelerating the deployment of quantum-safe cryptography and developing governance processes and controls for the responsible use of quantum machines.
  3. Access. Democratize the potential for economic growth across all of society through skilling, workforce and ecosystem development, and digital infrastructure.
  This paper discusses each in turn.</description>

      <title>Generalized Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau oscillator under Aharonov-Bohm flux in topological defects backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the generalized Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) oscillator under the influence of quantum flux field in the topological defects produced by a cosmic string space-time and point-like global monopole. The generalized DKP oscillator will be investigated through a non-minimal substitution of the momentum operator $\vec{p} \to \left(\vec{p}+i\,M\,\omega\,\eta^0\,f(r)\,\hat{r}\right)$ in the relativistic DKP equation. We solve this generalized DKP oscillator in a cosmic string space-time background and obtain the energy levels and wave function of the oscillator field using the parametric Nikiforov-Uvarov method. Afterwards, we solve the generalized DKP-oscillator in a point-like global monopole space-time and obtain the energy levels and wave functions following the same method. In fact, it is shown there that the energy eigenvalues are influenced by the topological defect of cosmic string and point-like global monopole and gets modified compared to flat space results, and breaks the degeneracy of the energy levels. Furthermore, we observe that the eigenvalue solutions depends on the quantum flux field that shows the gravitational analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm effect and also gives us a persistent currents</description>

      <title>Resolving chiral transitions in Rydberg arrays with quantum Kibble-Zurek mechanism and finite-time scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimental realization of the quantum Kibble-Zurek mechanism in arrays of trapped Rydberg atoms has brought the problem of commensurate-incommensurate transition back into the focus of active research. Relying on equilibrium simulations of finite intervals, direct chiral transitions at the boundary of the period-3 and period-4 phases have been predicted. Here, we study how these chiral transitions can be diagnosed experimentally with critical dynamics. We demonstrate that chiral transitions can be distinguished from the floating phases by comparing Kibble-Zurek dynamics on arrays with different numbers of atoms. Furthermore, by sweeping in the opposite direction and keeping track of the order parameter, we identify the location of conformal points. Finally, combining forward and backward sweeps, we extract all critical exponents characterizing the transition.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of a Scalar Field in a Squeezed State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy within a spherical region for a free scalar field in a squeezed state in 3+1 dimensions. We show that, even for small squeezing, a volume term appears, whose coefficient is essentially independent of the field mass. This is in line with Page's argument that the entanglement entropy in an arbitrary quantum state is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom of the smaller subsystem. It follows that squeezed states can be considered as arbitrary quantum states, in contrast to the ground or coherent states that give rise to entanglement entropy that is dominated by a term proportional to the area of the entangling surface.</description>

      <title>Remote sensing of soil moisture using Rydberg atoms and satellite signals of opportunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spaceborne radar remote sensing of the earth system is essential to study natural and man-made changes in the ecosystem, water and energy cycles, weather and air quality, sea level, and surface dynamics. A major challenge with current approaches is the lack of broad spectrum tunability due to narrow band microwave electronics, that limit systems to specific science variable retrievals. This results in a significant limitation in studying dynamic coupled earth system processes such as surface and subsurface hydrology, where broad spectrum radar remote sensing is needed to sense multiple variables simultaneously. Rydberg atomic sensors are highly sensitive broad-spectrum quantum detectors that can be dynamically tuned to cover micro-to-millimeter waves with no requirement for band-specific electronics. Rydberg atomic sensors can use existing transmitted signals such as navigation and communication satellites to enable remote sensing. We demonstrate remote sensing of soil moisture, an important earth system variable, via ground-based radar reflectometry with Rydberg atomic systems. To do this, we sensitize the atoms to XM satellite radio signals and use signal correlations to demonstrate use of these satellite signals for remote sensing of soil moisture. Our approach provides a step towards satellite-based broad-spectrum Rydberg atomic remote sensing.</description>

      <title>Quantum 2D Liouville Path-Integral Is a Sum over Geometries in AdS$_3$ Einstein Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a renowned solution of the modular bootstrap that defines the UV complete quantum Liouville theory. We triangulate the path-integral of this Liouville CFT on any 2D surface $\mathcal{M}$, by proposing a shrinkable boundary condition for this special CFT that allows small holes to close, analogous to the proposal in rational CFTs [1-3]. This is essentially a tensor network that admits an interpretation of a state-sum of a 3D topological theory constructed with quantum 6j symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, and it reduces to a sum over 3D geometries weighted by the Einstein-Hilbert action to leading order in large $c$. The boundary conditions of quantum Liouville theory specifies a very special sum over bulk geometries to faithfully reproduce the CFT path-integral. The triangulation coincides with producing a network of geodesics in the AdS bulk, which can be changed making use of the pentagon identity and orthogonality condition satisfied by the 6j symbols, and arranged into a precise holographic tensor network.</description>

Abstract: Amplitudes of quantum transitions containing time zigzags are considered. The discussion is carried out in the framework of the Minkowski metric and standard quantum mechanics without adding new postulates. It is shown that the wave function is singular at the instant of the time zigzag. Nevertheless, we argue that time zigzags are not suppressed at the quantum level, but their contribution to the amplitude is zero. The result is valid for a single particle and a non-interacting scalar field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general statistical learning theory for processes that take as input a classical random variable and output a quantum state. Our setting is motivated by the practical situation in which one desires to learn a quantum process governed by classical parameters that are out of one's control. This framework is applicable, for example, to the study of astronomical phenomena, disordered systems and biological processes not controlled by the observer. We provide an algorithm for learning with high probability in this setting with a finite amount of samples, even if the concept class is infinite. To do this, we review and adapt existing algorithms for shadow tomography and hypothesis selection, and combine their guarantees with the uniform convergence on the data of the loss functions of interest. As a by-product we obtain sufficient conditions for performing shadow tomography of classical-quantum states with a number of copies which depends on the dimension of the quantum register, but not on the dimension of the classical one. We give concrete examples of processes that can be learned in this manner, based on quantum circuits or physically motivated classes, such as systems governed by Hamiltonians with random perturbations or data-dependent phase-shifts.</description>

Abstract: Sensing and metrology play an important role in fundamental science and applications by fulfilling the ever-present need for more precise data sets and by allowing researchers to make more reliable conclusions on the validity of theoretical models. Sensors are ubiquitous. They are used in applications across a diverse range of fields including gravity imaging, geology, navigation, security, timekeeping, spectroscopy, chemistry, magnetometry, healthcare, and medicine. Current progress in quantum technologies has inevitably triggered the exploration of the use of quantum systems as sensors with new and improved capabilities. This article describes the optimization of the quantum-enhanced sensing of external magnetic fluxes with a Kitaev phase estimation algorithm based on a sensor with tunable transmon qubits. It provides the optimal flux biasing point for sensors with different maximal qubit transition frequencies. An estimation of decoherence rates is made for a given design. The use of $2-$ and $3-$qubit entangled states for sensing are compared in simulation with the single qubit case. The flux sensing accuracy reaches $10^{-8}\cdot\Phi_0$ and scales with time as $\sim\ 1/t$ which proves the speed-up of sensing with high ultimate accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11337v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling is a unitary process that destroys local correlations and spreads information throughout the system, effectively hiding it in nonlocal degrees of freedom. In principle, unscrambling this information is possible with perfect knowledge of the unitary dynamics [B. Yoshida and A. Kitaev, arXiv:1710.03363.]. However, this Letter demonstrates that even without previous knowledge of the internal dynamics, information can be efficiently decoded from an unknown scrambler by monitoring the outgoing information of a local subsystem. Surprisingly, we show that scramblers with unknown internal dynamics, which are rapidly mixing but not fully chaotic, can be decoded using Clifford decoders. The essential properties of a scrambling unitary can be efficiently recovered, even if the process is exponentially complex. Specifically, we establish that a unitary operator composed of $t$ non-Clifford gates admits a Clifford decoder up to $t\le n$.</description>

      <title>Learning efficient decoders for quasi-chaotic quantum scramblers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11338v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scrambling of quantum information is an important feature at the root of randomization and benchmarking protocols, the onset of quantum chaos, and black-hole physics. Unscrambling this information is possible given perfect knowledge of the scrambler [arXiv:1710.03363.]. We show that one can retrieve the scrambled information even without any previous knowledge of the scrambler, by a learning algorithm that allows the building of an efficient decoder. Remarkably, the decoder is classical in the sense that it can be efficiently represented on a classical computer as a Clifford operator. It is striking that a classical decoder can retrieve with fidelity one all the information scrambled by a random unitary that cannot be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, as long as there is no full-fledged quantum chaos. This result shows that one can learn the salient properties of quantum unitaries in a classical form, and sheds a new light on the meaning of quantum chaos. Furthermore, we obtain results concerning the algebraic structure of $t$-doped Clifford circuits, i.e., Clifford circuits containing t non-Clifford gates, their gate complexity, and learnability that are of independent interest. In particular, we show that a $t$-doped Clifford circuit $U_t$ can be decomposed into two Clifford circuits $U_{0},U^{\prime}_0$ that sandwich a local unitary operator $u_t$, i.e., $U_t=U_{0} u_{t}U_{0}^{\prime}$. The local unitary operator $u_t$ contains $t$ non-Clifford gates and acts nontrivially on at most $t$ qubits. As simple corollaries, the gate complexity of the $t$-doped Clifford circuit $U_t$ is $O(n^2+t^3)$, and it admits a efficient process tomography using $\mathrm{poly}(n,2^t)$ resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shortcuts to adiabaticity provide fast protocols for quantum state preparation in which the use of auxiliary counterdiabatic controls circumvents the requirement of slow driving in adiabatic strategies. While their development is well established in simple systems, their engineering and implementation are challenging in many-body quantum systems with many degrees of freedom. We show that the equation for the counterdiabatic term, equivalently the adiabatic gauge potential, is solved by introducing a Krylov basis. The Krylov basis spans the minimal operator subspace in which the dynamics unfolds and provides an efficient way to construct the counterdiabatic term. We apply our strategy to paradigmatic single- and many-particle models. The properties of the counterdiabatic term are reflected in the Lanczos coefficients obtained in the course of the construction of the Krylov basis by an algorithmic method. We examine how the expansion in the Krylov basis incorporates many-body interactions in the counterdiabatic term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stabilizer Entropy (SE) quantifies the spread of a state in the basis of Pauli operators. It is a computationally tractable measure of non-stabilizerness and thus a useful resource for quantum computation. SE can be moved around a quantum system, effectively purifying a subsystem from its complex features. We show that there is a phase transition in the residual subsystem SE as a function of the density of non-Clifford resources. This phase transition has important operational consequences: it marks the onset of a subsystem purity estimation protocol that requires $poly(n)exp(t)$ many queries to a circuit containing $t$ non-Clifford gates that prepares the state from a stabilizer state. Then, for $t=O(\log_2 n)$, it estimates the purity with polynomial resources and, for highly entangled states, attains an exponential speed-up over the known state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to find all $k$ marked elements in a list of size $N$ using the optimal number $O(\sqrt{N k})$ of quantum queries and only a polylogarithmic overhead in the gate complexity, in the setting where one has a small quantum memory. Previous algorithms either incurred a factor $k$ overhead in the gate complexity, or had an extra factor $\log(k)$ in the query complexity.
  We then consider the problem of finding a multiplicative $\delta$-approximation of $s = \sum_{i=1}^N v_i$ where $v=(v_i) \in [0,1]^N$, given quantum query access to a binary description of $v$. We give an algorithm that does so, with probability at least $1-\rho$, using $O(\sqrt{N \log(1/\rho) / \delta})$ quantum queries (under mild assumptions on $\rho$). This quadratically improves the dependence on $1/\delta$ and $\log(1/\rho)$ compared to a straightforward application of amplitude estimation. To obtain the improved $\log(1/\rho)$ dependence we use the first result.</description>

      <title>Finite-size subthermal regime in disordered SU(N)-symmetric Heisenberg chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SU(N) symmetry is incompatible with the many-body localized (MBL) phase, even when strong disorder is present. However, recent studies have shown that finite-size SU(2) systems exhibit non-ergodic, subthermal behavior, characterized by the breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and by the excited eigenstates entanglement entropy that is intermediate between area and volume law. In this work, we extend previous studies of the SU(2)-symmetric disordered Heisenberg model to larger systems, using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) method. We simulate quench dynamics from weakly entangled initial states up to long times, finding robust subthermal behavior at stronger disorder. Although we find an increased tendency towards thermalization at larger system sizes, the subthermal regime persists at intermediate time scales, nevertheless, and therefore should be accessible experimentally. At weaker disorder, we observe signatures of thermalization, however, entanglement entropy exhibits slow sublinear growth, in contrast to conventional thermalizing systems. Furthermore, we study dynamics of the SU(3)-symmetric disordered Heisenberg model. Similarly, strong disorder drives the system into subthermal regime, albeit thermalizing phase is broader compared to the SU(2) case. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of the subthermal regime in spin chains with non-Abelian continuous symmetry, and are consistent with eventual thermalization at large system sizes and long time scales, suggested by previous works.</description>

      <title>Competition of decoherence and quantum speed limits for quantum-gate fidelity in the Jaynes-Cummings model</title>

Abstract: Quantum computers are operated by external driving fields, such as lasers, microwaves or transmission lines, that execute logical operations on multi-qubit registers, leaving the system in a pure state. However, the drive and the logical system might become correlated in such a way that, after tracing out the degrees of freedom of the driving field, the output state will not be pure. Previous works have pointed out that the resulting error scales inversely with the energy of the drive, thus imposing a limit on the energy-efficiency of quantum computing. In this study, focusing on the Jaynes-Cummings model, we show how the same scaling can be seen as a consequence of two competing phenomena: the entanglement-induced error, which grows with time, and a minimal time for computation imposed by quantum speed limits. This evidence is made possible by quantifying, at any time, the computation error via the spectral radius associated to the density operator of the logical qubit. Moreover, we also prove that, in order to attain a given target state at a chosen fidelity, it is energetically more efficient to perform a single driven evolution of the logical qubits rather than to split the computation in sub-routines, each operated by a dedicated pulse.</description>

      <title>The Vector-Model Wavefunction: spatial description and wavepacket formation of quantum-mechanical angular momenta</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, spatial wavefunctions describe distributions of a particle's position or momentum, but not of angular momentum $j$. In contrast, here we show that a spatial wavefunction, $j_m (\phi,\theta,\chi)=~e^{i m \phi} \delta (\theta - \theta_m) ~e^{i(j+1/2)\chi}$, which treats $j$ in the $|jm&gt;$ state as a three-dimensional entity, is an asymptotic eigenfunction of angular-momentum operators; $\phi$, $\theta$, $\chi$ are the Euler angles, and $cos \theta_m=(m/|j|)$ is the Vector-Model polar angle. The $j_m (\phi,\theta,\chi)$ gives a computationally simple description of particle and orbital-angular-momentum wavepackets (constructed from Gaussian distributions in $j$ and $m$) which predicts the effective wavepacket angular uncertainty relations for $\Delta m \Delta \phi $, $\Delta j \Delta \chi$, and $\Delta\phi\Delta\theta$, and the position of the particle-wavepacket angular motion on the orbital plane. The particle-wavepacket rotation can be experimentally probed through continuous and non-destructive $j$-rotation measurements. We also use the $j_m (\phi,\theta,\chi)$ to determine well-known asymptotic expressions for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, Wigner d-functions, the gyromagnetic ratio of elementary particles, $g=2$, and the m-state-correlation matrix elements, $&lt;j_3 m_3|j_{1X} j_{2X}|j_3 m_3&gt;$. Interestingly, for low j, even down to $j=1/2$, these expressions are either exact (the last two) or excellent approximations (the first two), showing that $j_m (\phi,\theta,\chi)$ gives a useful spatial description of quantum-mechanical angular momentum, and provides a smooth connection with classical angular momentum.</description>

Abstract: Thin-film nanostructures with embedded M\"ossbauer nuclei have been successfully used for x-ray quantum optical applications with hard x-rays coupling in grazing incidence. Here we address theoretically a new geometry, in which hard x-rays are coupled in forward incidence (front coupling), setting the stage for waveguide QED with nuclear x-ray resonances. We present in a self-contained manner a general model based on the Green's function formalism of the field-nucleus interaction in one dimensional waveguides, and show that it combines aspects of both nuclear forward scattering, visible as dynamical beating in the spatio-temporal response, and the resonance structure from grazing incidence, visible in the spectrum of guided modes. The interference of multiple modes is shown to play an important role, resulting in beats with wavelengths on the order of tens of microns, on the scale of practical photolithography. This allows for the design of special sample geometries to explore the resonant response or micro-striped waveguides, opening a new toolbox of geometrical design for hard X-ray quantum optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advent of quantum computing, hybrid quantum-classical machine learning has shown promising computational advantages in many key fields. Quantum reinforcement learning, as one of the most challenging tasks, has recently demonstrated its ability to solve standard benchmark environments with formally provable theoretical advantages over classical counterparts. However, despite the progress of quantum processors and the emergence of quantum computing clouds in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, algorithms based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are rarely conducted on NISQ devices. In this work, we take the first step towards executing benchmark quantum reinforcement problems on various real devices equipped with at most 136 qubits on BAQIS Quafu quantum computing cloud. The experimental results demonstrate that the Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are capable of achieving goals that are slightly relaxed both during the training and inference stages. Moreover, we meticulously design hardware-efficient PQC architectures in the quantum model using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and develop a learning algorithm that is adaptable to Quafu. We hope that the Quafu-RL be a guiding example to show how to realize machine learning task by taking advantage of quantum computers on the quantum cloud platform.</description>

      <title>Solving Differential-Algebraic Equations in Power System Dynamic Analysis with Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power system dynamics are generally modeled by high dimensional nonlinear differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) given a large number of components forming the network. These DAEs' complexity can grow exponentially due to the increasing penetration of distributed energy resources, whereas their computation time becomes sensitive due to the increasing interconnection of the power grid with other energy systems. This paper demonstrates the use of quantum computing algorithms to solve DAEs for power system dynamic analysis. We leverage a symbolic programming framework to equivalently convert the power system's DAEs into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using index reduction methods and then encode their data into qubits using amplitude encoding. The system nonlinearity is captured by Hamiltonian simulation with truncated Taylor expansion so that state variables can be updated by a quantum linear equation solver. Our results show that quantum computing can solve the power system's DAEs accurately with a computational complexity polynomial in the logarithm of the system dimension. We also illustrate the use of recent advanced tools in scientific machine learning for implementing complex computing concepts, i.e. Taylor expansion, DAEs/ODEs transformation, and quantum computing solver with abstract representation for power engineering applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How much information a fermionic state contains? To address this fundamental question, we define the complexity of a particle-conserving many-fermion state as the entropy of its Fock space probability distribution, minimized over all Fock representations. The complexity characterizes the minimum computational and physical resources required to represent the state and store the information obtained from it by measurements. Alternatively, the complexity can be regarded a Fock space entanglement measure describing the intrinsic many-particle entanglement in the state. We establish universal lower bound for the complexity in terms of the single-particle correlation matrix eigenvalues and formulate a finite-size complexity scaling hypothesis. Remarkably, numerical studies on interacting lattice models suggest a general model-independent complexity hierarchy: ground states are exponentially less complex than average excited states which, in turn, are exponentially less complex than generic states in the Fock space. Our work has fundamental implications on how much information is encoded in fermionic states.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandom unitaries are neither real nor sparse nor noise-robust</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pseudorandom quantum states (PRSs) and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) possess the dual nature of being efficiently constructible while appearing completely random to any efficient quantum algorithm. In this study, we establish fundamental bounds on pseudorandomness. We show that PRSs and PRUs exist only when the probability that an error occurs is negligible, ruling out their generation on noisy intermediate-scale and early fault-tolerant quantum computers. Further, we show that PRUs need imaginarity while PRS do not have this restriction. This implies that quantum randomness requires in general a complex-valued formalism of quantum mechanics, while for random quantum states real numbers suffice. Additionally, we derive lower bounds on the coherence of PRSs and PRUs, ruling out the existence of sparse PRUs and PRSs. We also show that the notions of PRS, PRUs and pseudorandom scramblers (PRSSs) are distinct in terms of resource requirements. We introduce the concept of pseudoresources, where states which contain a low amount of a given resource masquerade as high-resource states. We define pseudocoherence, pseudopurity and pseudoimaginarity, and identify three distinct types of pseudoresources in terms of their masquerading capabilities. Our work also establishes rigorous bounds on the efficiency of property testing, demonstrating the exponential complexity in distinguishing real quantum states from imaginary ones, in contrast to the efficient measurability of unitary imaginarity. Lastly, we show that the transformation from a complex to a real model of quantum computation is inefficient, in contrast to the reverse process, which is efficient. Our results establish fundamental limits on property testing and provide valuable insights into quantum pseudorandomness.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transitions in the toric code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how distinct phases of matter can be generated by performing random single-qubit measurements on a subsystem of toric code. Using a parton construction, such measurements map to random Gaussian tensor networks, and in particular, random Pauli measurements map to a classical loop model in which watermelon correlators precisely determine measurement-induced entanglement. Measuring all but a 1d boundary of qubits realizes hybrid circuits involving unitary gates and projective measurements in 1+1 dimensions. We find that varying the probabilities of different Pauli measurements can drive transitions in the un-measured boundary between phases with different orders and entanglement scaling, corresponding to short and long loop phases in the classical model. Furthermore, by utilizing single-site boundary unitaries conditioned on the bulk measurement outcomes, we generate mixed state ordered phases and transitions that can be experimentally diagnosed via linear observables. This demonstrates how parton constructions provide a natural framework for measurement-based quantum computing setups to produce and manipulate phases of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically analyse an autonomous clock comprising a nanoelectromechanical system, which undergoes self-oscillations driven by electron tunnelling. The periodic mechanical motion behaves as the clockwork, similar to the swinging of a pendulum, while induced oscillations in the electrical current can be used to read out the ticks. We simulate the dynamics of the system in the quasi-adiabatic limit of slow mechanical motion, allowing us to infer statistical properties of the clock's ticks from the current auto-correlation function. The distribution of individual ticks exhibits a tradeoff between accuracy, resolution, and dissipation, as expected from previous literature. Going beyond the distribution of individual ticks, we investigate how clock accuracy varies over different integration times by computing the Allan variance. We observe non-monotonic features in the Allan variance as a function of time and applied voltage, which can be explained by the presence of temporal correlations between ticks. These correlations are shown to yield a precision advantage for timekeeping over the timescales that the correlations persist. Our results illustrate the non-trivial features of the tick series produced by nanoscale clocks, and pave the way for experimental investigation of clock thermodynamics using nanoelectromechanical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-qubit entangling interactions arise naturally in several quantum computing platforms and promise advantages over traditional two-qubit gates. In particular, a fixed multi-qubit Ising-type interaction together with single-qubit X-gates can be used to synthesize global ZZ-gates (GZZ gates). In this work, we first show that the synthesis of such quantum gates that are time-optimal is NP-hard. Second, we provide explicit constructions of special time-optimal multi-qubit gates. They have constant gate times and can be implemented with linearly many X-gate layers. Third, we develop a heuristic algorithm with polynomial runtime for synthesizing fast multi-qubit gates. Fourth, we derive lower and upper bounds on the optimal GZZ gate-time. Based on explicit constructions of GZZ gates and numerical studies, we conjecture that any GZZ gate can be executed in a time O(n) for n qubits. Our heuristic synthesis algorithm leads to GZZ gate-times with a similar scaling, which is optimal in this sense. We expect that our efficient synthesis of fast multi-qubit gates allows for faster and, hence, also more error-robust execution of quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Hardness results for decoding the surface code with Pauli noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real quantum computers will be subject to complicated, qubit-dependent noise, instead of simple noise such as depolarizing noise with the same strength for all qubits. We can do quantum error correction more effectively if our decoding algorithms take into account this prior information about the specific noise present. This motivates us to consider the complexity of surface code decoding where the input to the decoding problem is not only the syndrome-measurement results, but also a noise model in the form of probabilities of single-qubit Pauli errors for every qubit.
  In this setting, we show that quantum maximum likelihood decoding (QMLD) and degenerate quantum maximum likelihood decoding (DQMLD) for the surface code are NP-hard and #P-hard, respectively. We reduce directly from SAT for QMLD, and from #SAT for DQMLD, by showing how to transform a boolean formula into a qubit-dependent Pauli noise model and set of syndromes that encode the satisfiability properties of the formula. We also give hardness of approximation results for QMLD and DQMLD. These are worst-case hardness results that do not contradict the empirical fact that many efficient surface code decoders are correct in the average case (i.e., for most sets of syndromes and for most reasonable noise models). These hardness results are nicely analogous with the known hardness results for QMLD and DQMLD for arbitrary stabilizer codes with independent $X$ and $Z$ noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient transport and harvesting of excitation energy under low light conditions is an important process in nature and quantum technologies alike. Here we formulate a quantum optics perspective to excitation energy transport in configurations of two-level quantum emitters with a particular emphasis on efficiency and robustness against disorder. We study a periodic geometry of emitter rings with subwavelength spacing, where collective electronic states emerge due to near-field dipole-dipole interactions. The system gives rise to collective subradiant states that are particularly suited to excitation transport and are protected from energy disorder and radiative decoherence. Comparing ring geometries with other configurations shows that that the former are more efficient in absorbing, transporting, and trapping incident light. Because our findings are agnostic as to the specific choice of quantum emitters, they indicate general design principles for quantum technologies with superior photon transport properties and may elucidate potential mechanisms resulting in the highly efficient energy transport efficiencies in natural light-harvesting systems.</description>

Abstract: The surface code is a quantum error-correcting code for one logical qubit, protected by spatially localized parity checks in two dimensions. Due to fundamental constraints from spatial locality, storing more logical qubits requires either sacrificing the robustness of the surface code against errors or increasing the number of physical qubits. We bound the minimal number of spatially nonlocal parity checks necessary to add logical qubits to a surface code while maintaining, or improving, robustness to errors. We asymptotically saturate this bound using a family of hypergraph product codes, interpolating between the surface code and constant-rate low-density parity-check codes. Fault-tolerant protocols for logical gates in the quantum code can be inherited from its classical parent codes. We provide near-term practical implementations of this code for hardware based on trapped ions or neutral atoms in mobile optical tweezers. Long-range-enhanced surface codes outperform conventional surface codes using hundreds of physical qubits and represent a practical strategy to enhance the robustness of logical qubits to errors in near-term devices.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we show that the well-known Bell test called Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) does not only exhibit non-locality but also the KCBS-type contextuality. For this purpose, we investigate the symmetric subgroup of two-qubit states corresponding to qutrit states (three-level quantum states), which exhibit the KCBS-type (non-)contextuality. Later, we apply the CHSH test to them and find a new non-contextuality bound for this test. This shows us that the CHSH inequality can be modified by changing the limit to use it as a KCBS-type contextuality test. Also, the number of measurements required is four, less than the number of measurements in the KCBS test (That is five).</description>

Abstract: The future quantum internet will leverage existing communication infrastructures, including deployed optical fibre networks, to enable novel applications that outperform current information technology. In this scenario, we perform a feasibility study of quantum communications over an industrial 224 km submarine optical fibre link deployed between Southport in the United Kingdom (UK) and Portrane in the Republic of Ireland (IE). With a characterisation of phase drift, polarisation stability and arrival time of entangled photons, we demonstrate the suitability of the link to enable international UK-IE quantum communications for the first time.</description>

      <title>Certifying ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05844v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A ubiquitous problem in quantum physics is to understand the ground-state properties of many-body systems. Confronted with the fact that exact diagonalisation quickly becomes impossible when increasing the system size, variational approaches are typically employed as a scalable alternative: energy is minimised over a subset of all possible states and then different physical quantities are computed over the solution state. Despite remarkable success, rigorously speaking, all what variational methods offer are upper bounds on the ground-state energy. On the other hand, so-called relaxations of the ground-state problem based on semidefinite programming represent a complementary approach, providing lower bounds to the ground-state energy. However, in their current implementation, neither variational nor relaxation methods offer provable bound on other observables in the ground state beyond the energy. In this work, we show that the combination of the two classes of approaches can be used to derive certifiable bounds on the value of any observable in the ground state, such as correlation functions of arbitrary order, structure factors, or order parameters. We illustrate the power of this approach in paradigmatic examples of 1D and 2D spin-one-half Heisenberg models. To improve the scalability of the method, we exploit the symmetries and sparsity of the considered systems to reach sizes of hundreds of particles at much higher precision than previous works. Our analysis therefore shows how to obtain certifiable bounds on many-body ground-state properties beyond energy in a scalable way.</description>

Abstract: Large quantum photonic systems hold promise for surpassing classical computational limits, yet their state preparation remains a challenge. We propose an alternative approach to study multiparticle dynamics by mapping the excitation mode of these systems to physical properties of the Laguerre-Gauss modes. We construct coherent states establishing a direct link between excitation number dynamics and the evolution of the Laguerre-Gauss mode. This highlights the photon transverse spatial degree of freedom as a versatile platform for testing fundamental aspects of quantum multiparticle systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum teleportation implies symmetry-protected topological order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constrain a broad class of teleportation protocols using insights from locality. In the "standard" teleportation protocols we consider, all outcome-dependent unitaries are Pauli operators conditioned on linear functions of the measurement outcomes. We find that all such protocols involve preparing a "resource state" exhibiting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order with Abelian protecting symmetry $\mathcal{G}_{k}= (\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)^k$. The $k$ logical states are teleported between the edges of the chain by measuring the corresponding $2k$ string order parameters in the bulk and applying outcome-dependent Paulis. Hence, this single class of nontrivial SPT states is both necessary and sufficient for the standard teleportation of $k$ qubits. We illustrate this result with several examples, including the cluster state, variants thereof, and a nonstabilizer hypergraph state.</description>

Abstract: The Toffoli gate is the essential ingredient for reversible computing, an energy efficient classical computational paradigm that evades the energy dissipation resulting from Landauer's principle. In this paper we analyze different setups to realize a magnetic implementation of the Toffoli gate using three interacting classical spins, each one embodying one of the three bits needed for the Toffoli gate. In our scheme, different control-spins configurations produce an effective field capable of conditionally flipping the target spin. We study what are the experimental requirements for the realization of our scheme, focusing on the degree of local control, the ability to dynamically switch the spin-spin interactions, and the required single-spin anisotropies to make the classical spin stable, showing that these are compatible with current technology.</description>

      <title>Seeding Gaussian boson samplers with single photons for enhanced state generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian quantum states are crucial to fault-tolerant quantum computation with continuous-variable systems. Usually, generation of such states involves trade-offs between success probability and quality of the resultant state. For example, injecting squeezed light into a multimode interferometer and postselecting on certain patterns of photon-number outputs in all but one mode, a fundamentally probabilistic task, can herald the creation of cat states, Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states, and more. We consider the addition of a non-Gaussian resource state, particularly single photons, to this configuration and show how it improves the qualities and generation probabilities of desired states. With only two modes, adding a single photon source improves GKP-state fidelity from 0.68 to 0.95 and adding a second then increases the success probability eightfold; for cat states with a fixed target fidelity, the probability of success can be improved by factors of up to 4 by adding single-photon sources. These demonstrate the usefulness of additional commonplace non-Gaussian resources for generating desirable states of light.</description>

Abstract: Liouville theorem (LT) reveals robust incompressibility of distribution function in phase space, given arbitrary potentials. However, its quantum generalization, Wigner flow, is compressible, i.e., LT is only conditionally true (e.g., for perfect Harmonic potential). We develop quantum Liouville theorem (rigorous incompressibility) for arbitrary potentials (interacting or not) in Hamiltonians. Haar measure, instead of symplectic measure dp^dq used in Wigner's scheme, plays a central role. The argument is based on general measure theory, independent of specific spaces or coordinates. Comparison of classical and quantum is made: for instance, we address why Haar measure and metric preservation do not work in the classical case. Applications of theorems in statistics, topological phase transition, ergodic theory, etc. are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method for determining the three-dimensional location of single atoms in a quantum gas microscopy system using a phase-only spatial light modulator to modify the point-spread function of the high-resolution imaging system. Here, the typical diffracted spot generated by a single atom as a point source is modified to a double spot that rotates as a function of the atom's distance from the focal plane of the imaging system. We present and numerically validate a simple model linking the rotation angle of the point-spread function with the distance to the focal plane. We show that, when aberrations in the system are carefully calibrated and compensated for, this method can be used to determine an atom's position to within a single lattice site in a single experimental image, extending quantum simulation with microscopy systems further into the regime of three dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a consistent formalism to describe the dynamics of hybrid systems with mixed classical and quantum degrees of freedom. The probability function of the system, which, in general, will be a combination of the classical distribution function and the quantum density matrix, is described in terms of its corresponding moments. We then define a hybrid Poisson bracket, such that the dynamics of the moments is ruled by an effective Hamiltonian. In particular, a closed formula for the Poisson brackets between any two moments for an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom is presented, which corrects previous expressions derived in the literature for the purely quantum case. This formula is of special relevance for practical applications of the formalism. Finally, we study the dynamics of a particular hybrid system given by two coupled oscillators, one being quantum and the other classical. Due to the coupling, specific quantum and classical properties are transferred between different sectors. In particular, the quantum sector is allowed to violate the uncertainty relation, though we explicitly show that there exists a minimum positive bound of the total uncertainty of the hybrid system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certification of quantum computing components can be crucial for quantum hardware improvements and the calibration of quantum algorithms. In this work, we propose an efficient method for certifying single-qubit quantum computation in a black-box scenario under the dimension assumption. The method is based on testing deterministic outcomes of quantum computation for predetermined gate sequences. Quantum gates are certified based on input-output correlations, with no auxiliary systems required. We prove that the sample complexity grows as O$(\varepsilon^{-1})$ with respect to the average gate infidelity $\varepsilon$ for the certification of a single-qubit phase shift gate. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method can be used to certify a gate set universal for single-qubit quantum computation. Our approach takes a first step in bridging the gap between strong notions of certification from self-testing and practically highly relevant approaches from quantum system characterization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the emergence of confinement in the transverse field Ising model on a decorated hexagonal lattice. Using an infinite tensor network state optimised with belief propagation we show how a quench from a broken symmetry state leads to striking nonthermal behaviour underpinned by persistent oscillations and saturation of the entanglement entropy. We explain this phenomenon by constructing a minimal model based on the confinement of elementary excitations, which take the form of various flavors of hadronic quasiparticles due to the unique structure of the lattice. Our model is in excellent agreement with our numerical results. For quenches to larger values of the transverse field and/or from non-symmetry broken states, our numerical results displays the expected signatures of thermalisation: a linear growth of entanglement entropy in time, propagation of correlations and the saturation of observables to their thermal averages. These results provide a physical explanation for the unexpected simulability of a recent large scale quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: We present a framework for quantifying information flow within general quantum processes. For this purpose, we introduce the signaling power of quantum channels and discuss its relevant operational properties. This function supports extensions to higher order maps, enabling the evaluation of information flow in general quantum causal networks and also processes with indefinite causal order. Furthermore, our results offer a rigorous approach to information dynamics in open systems that applies also in the presence of initial system-environment correlations, and allows for the distinction between classical and quantum information backflow.</description>

      <title>The noisy Landau-Streater or the Werner-Holevo channel in arbitrary dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two important classes of quantum channels, namly the Werner-Holevo and the Landau-Streater channels are known to be related only in three dimensions, i.e. when acting on qutrits. In this work, the definition of the Landau-Streater channel is extended in such a way which retains its equivalence to the Werner-Holevo channel in all dimensions. This channel is then modified to be representable as a model of noise acting on qudits. We then investigate propeties of the resulting noisy channel and determine the conditions under which it cannot be the result of a Markovian evolution. Furthermore, we investigate its different capacities for transmitting classical and quantum information with or without entanglement. In particular, while the pure (or high noise) Landau-Streater or the Werner-Holevo channel is entanglement breaking and hence has zero capacity, by finding a lower bound for the quantum capacity, we show that when the level of noise is lower than a critical value the quantum capacity will be non-zero. Surprizingly this value turns out to be approximately equal to $0.4$ in all dimensions. Finally we show that, in even dimensions, this channel has a decomposition in terms of unitary operations. This is in contrast with the three dimensional case where it has been proved that such a decomposition is possible is impossible, even in terms of other quantum maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECCs) are pivotal in advancing quantum computing by protecting quantum states against the adverse effects of noise and errors. With a variety of QECCs developed, including new developments and modifications of existing ones, selecting an appropriate QECC tailored to specific conditions is crucial. Despite significant improvements in the field of QECCs, a unified methodology for evaluating them on a consistent basis has remained elusive. Addressing this gap, this paper presents the first benchmarking framework for QECCs, introducing a set of universal parameters. By evaluating eight prominent QECCs, we propose a comprehensive suite of eight parameters for their analysis. Our methodology establishes a universal benchmarking approach and highlights the complexity of quantum error correction, indicating that the choice of a QECC depends on the unique requirements and limitations of each scenario. Furthermore, we develop a systematic strategy for selecting QECCs that adapts to the specific requirements of a given scenario, facilitating a tailored approach to quantum error correction. Additionally, we introduce a novel QECC recommendation tool that assesses the characteristics of a given scenario provided by the user, subsequently recommending a spectrum of QECCs from most to least suitable, along with the maximum achievable distance for each code. This tool is designed to be adaptable, allowing for the inclusion of new QECCs and the modification of their parameters with minimal effort, ensuring its relevance in the evolving landscape of quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge in realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers is circuit optimization. Focusing on the most expensive gates in fault-tolerant quantum computation (namely, the T gates), we address the problem of T-count optimization, i.e., minimizing the number of T gates that are needed to implement a given circuit. To achieve this, we develop AlphaTensor-Quantum, a method based on deep reinforcement learning that exploits the relationship between optimizing T-count and tensor decomposition. Unlike existing methods for T-count optimization, AlphaTensor-Quantum can incorporate domain-specific knowledge about quantum computation and leverage gadgets, which significantly reduces the T-count of the optimized circuits. AlphaTensor-Quantum outperforms the existing methods for T-count optimization on a set of arithmetic benchmarks (even when compared without making use of gadgets). Remarkably, it discovers an efficient algorithm akin to Karatsuba's method for multiplication in finite fields. AlphaTensor-Quantum also finds the best human-designed solutions for relevant arithmetic computations used in Shor's algorithm and for quantum chemistry simulation, thus demonstrating it can save hundreds of hours of research by optimizing relevant quantum circuits in a fully automated way.</description>

      <title>Microwave-to-optics conversion using magnetostatic modes and a tunable optical cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing, quantum communication and quantum networks rely on hybrid quantum systems operating in different frequency ranges. For instance, the superconducting qubits work in the gigahertz range, while the optical photons used in communication are in the range of hundreds of terahertz. Due to the large frequency mismatch, achieving the direct coupling and information exchange between different information carriers is generally difficult. Accordingly, a quantum interface is demanded, which serves as a bridge to establish information linkage between different quantum systems operating at distinct frequencies. Recently, the magnon mode in ferromagnetic spin systems has received significant attention. While the inherent weak optomagnonic coupling strength restricts the microwave-to-optical photon conversion efficiency using magnons, the versatility of the magnon modes, together with their readily achievable strong coupling with other quantum systems, endow them with many distinct advantages. Here, we realize the magnon-based microwave-light interface by adopting an optical cavity with adjustable free spectrum range and different kinds of magnetostatic modes in two microwave cavity configurations. By optimizing the parameters, an internal conversion efficiency of $1.28 \times 10^{-7}$ is achieved. We analyze the impact of various parameters on the microwave-to-optics conversion. The study provides useful guidance and insights to further enhancing the microwave-to-optics conversion efficiency using magnons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Squeezing the quadrature noise of a harmonic oscillator used as a sensor can enhance its sensitivity in certain measurment schemes. The canonical approach, based on parametric modulation of the oscillation frequency, is usually limited to a squeezing of at most 3 dB. However, this can be overcome by additional stabilization of the anti-squeezed quadrature. Here, we apply this approach to highly-stressed silicon nitride membrane resonators, with effective masses of the order few nanograms and quality factors routinely exceeding 108, which hold promise for sensing applications in both the classical and quantum regimes. We benchmark their performance using either piezo or capacitive parametric modulation. We observe maximum thermomechanical squeezing by record-high 17 dB and 21 dB, respectively, and we argue that even larger values can be attained with minimal changes to the device design. Finally, we provide a full quantum theory of a combination of this approach with quantum-limited motion measurement and conclude that quantum squeezing is attainable at moderate cryogenic temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Dimensionality plays a crucial role in long-range dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs). We demonstrate that a resonant nanophotonic structure modifies the apparent dimensionality in an interacting ensemble of emitters, as revealed by population decay dynamics. Our measurements on a dense ensemble of interacting quantum emitters in a resonant nanophotonic structure with long-range DDIs reveal an effective dimensionality reduction to $\bar{d} = 2.20 (12)$, despite the emitters being distributed in 3D. This contrasts the homogeneous environment, where the apparent dimension is $\bar{d} = 3.00$. Our work presents a promising avenue to manipulate dimensionality in an ensemble of interacting emitters.</description>

      <title>Proposal for simulating quantum spin models with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction using Rydberg atoms, and construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05591</link>

Abstract: We propose a method to realize tunable quantum spin models with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in Rydberg atom quantum simulators. Our scheme uses a two-photon Raman transition and transformation to the spin-rotating frame. We investigate the properties of the model including only the DMI and Zeeman energy, which can be experimentally realized in our scheme. We show that the model accommodates exact and asymptotic quantum many-body scars exhibiting nonergodic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Decoherence and entropy generation at one loop in the inflationary de Sitter spacetime for Yukawa interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decoherence mechanism is believed to be possibly connected to the quantum to classical transition of the primordial cosmological perturbations in the early universe. In this paper, we extend our previous analysis on decoherence in a fermion and scalar quantum field theory coupled via the Yukawa interaction in the Minkowski spacetime, to the inflationary de Sitter background. We treat the scalar field as the system and the fermions as the environment, and both the fields are taken to be massless. We utilise a non-equilibrium effective field theory formalism, suitable for open quantum systems such as this. We assume that an observer measures only the Gaussian 2-point correlator for the scalar field, as the simplest realistic scenario. In order to compute the von Neumann entropy generated at late times as a measure of the decoherence, we construct the one loop renormalised Kadanoff-Baym equation, which is the equation of motion satisfied by the 2-point correlators in the closed time path Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. These equations account to the self energy corrections. Using this, we next construct the one loop corrected statistical propagator for the scalar, which is related to its phase space area, to compute the von Neumann entropy. We also compute the variation of the von Neumann entropy with respect to relevant parameters. We note the qualitative similarity between our findings and the scenario where both the system and the environment are scalars. Our result is also qualitatively similar to an earlier one found by using the influence functional technique for a massive Yukawa theory.</description>

Abstract: Williamson's normal form is well known for symmetric positive-definite linear automorphisms on a symplectic vector space. In this paper, we consider when two symmetric positive-definite linear automorphisms on a symplectic vector space can simultaneously admit a normal form under a common symplectic linear automorphism.</description>

      <title>Integrability is attractive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between quantum chaos and integrability has been extensively studied in the past decades. We approach this topic from the point of view of geometry encoded in the quantum geometric tensor, which describes the complexity of adiabatic transformations. In particular, we consider two generic models of spin chains that are parameterized by two independent couplings. In one, the integrability breaking perturbation is global while, in the other, integrability is broken only at the boundary. In both cases, the shortest paths in the coupling space lead towards integrable regions and we argue that this behavior is generic. These regions thus act as attractors of adiabatic flows similar to river basins in nature. Physically, the directions towards integrable regions are characterized by faster relaxation dynamics than those parallel to integrability, and the anisotropy between them diverges in the thermodynamic limit as the system approaches the integrable point. We also provide evidence that the transition from integrable to chaotic behavior is universal for both models, similar to continuous phase transitions, and that the model with local integrability breaking quickly becomes chaotic but avoids ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect in axion electrodynamics with lattice regularizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Casimir effect is induced by the interplay between photon fields and boundary conditions, and in particular, photon fields modified in axion electrodynamics may lead to the sign-flipping of the Casimir energy. We propose a theoretical approach to derive the Casimir effect in axion electrodynamics. This approach is based on a lattice regularization and enables us to discuss the dependence on the lattice spacing for the Casimir energy. With this approach, the sign-flipping behavior of the Casimir energy is correctly reproduced. By taking the continuum limit of physical quantity calculated on the lattice, we can obtain the results consistent with the continuum theory. This approach can also be applied to the Casimir effect at nonzero temperature.</description>

      <title>Effective models for dense vortex lattices in the Kitaev honeycomb model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce low-energy effective models for dense configurations of vortices in the Kitaev honeycomb model. Specifically, we consider configurations of vortices in which vortex-free plaquettes form triangular lattices against a vortex-full background. Depending on the vortex density, these "dual" configurations belong to either one of two families classified by translation and inversion symmetry. As a function of a time-reversal symmetry breaking term, one family exhibits gapped phases with even Chern numbers separated by extended gapless phases, while the other exhibits gapped phases with even or odd Chern numbers, separated by critical points. We construct an effective model for each family, determine the parameters of these models by fitting the integrated density of states, and reproduce energy spectra and Chern numbers of the Kitaev honeycomb model. We also derive phase diagrams and determine these models' validity.</description>

      <title>The Causal Axioms of Algebraic Quantum Field Theory: A Diagnostic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) puts forward three "causal axioms" that aim to characterize the theory as one that implements relativistic causation: the spectrum condition, microcausality, and primitive causality. In this paper, I aim to show, in a minimally technical way, that none of them fully explains the notion of causation appropriate for AQFT because they only capture some of the desiderata for relativistic causation I state or because it is often unclear how each axiom implements its respective desideratum. After this diagnostic, I will show that a fourth condition, local primitive causality (LPC), fully characterizes relativistic causation in the sense of fulfilling all the relevant desiderata. However, it only encompasses the virtues of the other axioms because it is implied by them, as I will show from a construction by Haag and Schroer (1962). Since the conjunction of the three causal axioms implies LPC and other important results in QFT that LPC does not imply, and since LPC helps clarify some of the shortcomings of the three axioms, I advocate for a holistic interpretation of how the axioms characterize the causal structure of AQFT against the strategy in the literature to rivalize the axioms and privilege one among them.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage in zero-error function computation with side information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of zero-error function computation with side information. Alice has a source $X$ and Bob has correlated source $Y$ and they can communicate via either classical or a quantum channel. Bob wants to calculate $f(X,Y)$ with zero error. We aim to characterize the minimum amount of information that Alice needs to send to Bob for this to happen with zero-error. In the classical setting, this quantity depends on the asymptotic growth of $\chi(G^{(m)})$, the chromatic number of an appropriately defined $m$-instance "confusion graph". In this work we present structural characterizations of $G^{(m)}$ and demonstrate two function computation scenarios that have the same single-instance confusion graph. However, in one case there a strict advantage in using quantum transmission as against classical transmission, whereas there is no such advantage in the other case.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian skin effects and fragmented condensates in an integrable dissipative Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly interacting non-equilibrium systems are of great fundamental interest, yet their inherent complexity make then notoriously hard to analyze. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model, which by itself evades solvability, can be solved exactly at any interaction strength in the presence of loss tuned to a rate matching the hopping amplitude. Remarkably, the full solvability of the corresponding Liouvillian, and the integrability of the pertinent effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, survives the addition of disorder and generic boundary conditions. By analyzing the Bethe ansatz solutions we find that even weak interactions change the qualitative features of the system, leading to an intricate dynamical phase diagram featuring non-Hermitian Mott-skin effects, disorder induced localization, highly degenerate exceptional points, and a Bose glass-like phase of fragmented condensates. We discuss realistic implementations of this model with cold atoms.</description>
