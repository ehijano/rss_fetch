      <title>Simulating Time Dependent and Nonlinear Classical Oscillators through Nonlinear Schr\"odingerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present quantum algorithms for simulating the dynamics of a broad class of classical oscillator systems containing $2^n$ coupled oscillators (Eg: $2^n$ masses coupled by springs), including those with time-dependent forces, time-varying stiffness matrices, and weak nonlinear interactions. This generalization of the Harmonic oscillator simulation algorithm is achieved through an approach that we call ``Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dingerization'', which involves reduction of the dynamical system to a nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation and then reduced to a time-independent Schrodinger Equation through perturbative techniques. The linearization of the equation is performed using an approach that allows the dynamics of a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation to be approximated as a linear Schr\"odinger equation in a higher dimensional space. This allows Hamiltonian Simulation algorithms to be applied to simulate the dynamics of resulting system. When the properties of the classical dynamical systems can be efficiently queried, and when the initial state can be efficiently prepared, the complexity of our quantum algorithm is polynomial in $n$, and almost linear in evolution time for most dynamical systems. Our work extends the applicability of quantum algorithms to simulate the dynamics of non-conservative and nonlinear classical systems, addressing key limitations in previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Lindblad evolution as gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a simple argument that, for a large class of jump operators, the Lindblad evolution can be written as a gradient flow in the space of density operators acting on a Hilbert space of dimension $D$. We give explicit expressions for the (matrix-valued) eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Lindblad evolution using this formalism. We argue that in many cases the interpretation of the evolution is simplified by passing from the $D^2$-dimensional space of density operators to the $D^2-1$-dimensional space of Bloch vectors. When jump operators are non-Hermitian the evolution is not in general gradient flow, but we show that it nevertheless resembles gradient flow in two particular ways. Importantly, the steady states of Lindbladian evolution are still determined by the potential in all cases.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba effect without global symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect, where a system initially farther from equilibrium relaxes faster than one closer to equilibrium, has been extensively studied in classical systems and recently explored in quantum settings. While previous studies of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) have largely focused on isolated systems with global symmetries, we argue that the QME is ubiquitous in generic, non-integrable many-body systems lacking such symmetries, including U(1) charge conservation, spatial symmetries, and even energy conservation. Using paradigmatic models such as the quantum Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields, we show that the QME can be understood through the energy density of initial states and their inverse participation ratio in the energy eigenbasis. Our findings provide a unified framework for the QME, linking it with classical thermal relaxation and phenomena such as prethermalization and weak ergodicity breaking.</description>

      <title>Role of Nonstabilizerness in Quantum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimization has emerged as a promising approach for tackling complicated classical optimization problems using quantum devices. However, the extent to which such algorithms harness genuine quantum resources and the role of these resources in their success remain open questions. In this work, we investigate the resource requirements of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) through the lens of the resource theory of nonstabilizerness. We demonstrate that the nonstabilizerness in QAOA increases with circuit depth before it reaches a maximum, to fall again during the approach to the final solution state -- creating a barrier that limits the algorithm's capability for shallow circuits. We find curves corresponding to different depths to collapse under a simple rescaling, and we reveal a nontrivial relationship between the final nonstabilizerness and the success probability. Finally, we identify a similar nonstabilizerness barrier also in adiabatic quantum annealing. Our results provide deeper insights into how quantum resources influence quantum optimization.</description>

      <title>Circuit structure-preserving error mitigation for High-Fidelity Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing methods to accurately characterize and mitigate the impact of noise is crucial for enhancing the fidelity of quantum simulations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we present a circuit structure-preserving error mitigation framework for parameterized quantum circuits. A key advantage of our approach lies in its ability to retain the original circuit architecture while effectively characterizing and mitigating gate errors, enabling robust and high-fidelity simulations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we perform variational quantum simulations of a non-Hermitian ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising chain on IBM Quantum processors. The mitigated result shows excellent agreement with exact theoretical predictions across a range of noise levels. Our strategy offers a practical solution for addressing gate-induced errors and significantly broadens the scope of feasible quantum simulations on current quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Security of deterministic key distribution with higher-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the security aspects of the two-way quantum key distribution protocol designed by M. Lucamarini and S. Mancini in 2005 (in short, the LM05 protocol) by employing arbitrary finite-dimensional systems against both individual and collective attacks by the eavesdropper. We explicitly delineate the constituent steps in higher dimensions using the Heisenberg-Weyl operators for the encoding and the measurement operations. For individual attacks, we consider cloning operations by the eavesdropper and demonstrate a dimensional advantage where secret keys can be generated for greater strengths of interception. To analyze security under collective attacks, we employ a purification scheme and derive the key rate using entropic uncertainty relations. Further, we exhibit how the protocol is more robust against eavesdropping with increasing dimension of the systems used, and compare the performance with that of the entangled two-way secure dense coding protocol when affected by correlated and uncorrelated noise, which models the presence of the eavesdropper.</description>

      <title>A high-resolution molecular spin-photon interface at telecommunications wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically addressable electronic spins in polyatomic molecules are a promising platform for quantum information science with the potential to enable scalable qubit design and integration through atomistic tunability and nanoscale localization. However, optical state- and site-selection are an open challenge. Here we introduce an organo-erbium spin qubit in which narrow (MHz-scale) optical and spin transitions couple to provide high-resolution access to spin degrees of freedom with telecommunications frequency light. This spin-photon interface enables demonstration of optical spin polarization and readout that distinguishes between spin states and magnetically inequivalent sites in a molecular crystal. Operation at frequencies compatible with mature photonic and microwave devices opens a path for engineering scalable, integrated molecular spin-optical quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Kostka Numbers Constrain Particle Exchange Statistics beyond Fermions and Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17361v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing theoretical explorations of intermediate statistics beyond bosons and fermions have followed three routes: (1) a statistical-mechanics route that modifies microstate counting rules; (2) a quantum-mechanics route that generalizes wavefunction exchange symmetry via group representations; and (3) a quantum-field-theory route that deforms the creation-annihilation algebra. While each route has advanced individually, a unified formulation remains elusive. Recently, consistency between routes (2) and (3) was demonstrated (Nature 637, 314 (2025)). Here, employing combinatorial arguments with Kostka numbers, we establish the microstate uniqueness theorem (MUT). It demonstrates that statistical-mechanics counting constraints (route 1) and symmetric-group-based quantum-mechanical exchange symmetry (a restricted subset of route 2, excluding braid-group generalizations) are mathematically incompatible under indistinguishability. Consequently, intermediate statistics based on higher-dimensional irreducible representations of the symmetric group or on modified microstate-counting rules are mathematically ruled out for indistinguishable particles. The MUT relies solely on the indistinguishability principle, without invoking Lorentz symmetry or any field-theoretic assumptions.</description>

      <title>Parametric excitations in a harmonically trapped binary Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate parametric excitation and pattern formation in a harmonically trapped two-component Bose-Einstein condensate. Near the miscible-immiscible phase transition, the excitations of total density and spin density are decoupled. By periodically modulating the atomic scattering lengths, spin-dependent Faraday patterns can be generated with the two components exhibiting an out-of-phase density oscillation. In an elongated condensate, the density pattern along the longitudinal direction corresponds to a one-dimensional spin Faraday pattern, where the modulation frequency and the spatial oscillation period are related to the velocity of the spin sound. After the spin pattern is fully developed, the system quickly enters a nonlinear destabilization regime. For a pancake-shaped condensate, a two-dimensional Faraday pattern is generated with an interesting l-fold rotational symmetry. The number of nodes along the radial and angular directions increases with larger modulation frequencies. We also compare the growth rates of spin Faraday patterns generated with different modulation protocols, which are accessible to current experiments.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Quantum-Secure Communications in a Nuclear Reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD), one of the latest cryptographic techniques, founded on the laws of quantum mechanics rather than mathematical complexity, promises for the first time unconditional secure remote communications. Integrating this technology into the next generation nuclear systems - designed for universal data collection and real-time sharing as well as cutting-edge instrumentation and increased dependency on digital technologies - could provide significant benefits enabling secure, unattended, and autonomous operation in remote areas, e.g., microreactors and fission batteries. However, any practical implementation on a critical reactor system must meet strict requirements on latency, control system compatibility, stability, and performance under operational transients. Here, we report the complete end-to-end demonstration of a phase-encoding decoy-state BB84 protocol QKD system under prototypic conditions on Purdue's fully digital nuclear reactor, PUR-1. The system was installed in PUR-1 successfully executing real-time encryption and decryption of 2,000 signals over optic fiber distances up to 82 km using OTP-based encryption and up to 140 km with AES-based encryption. For a core of 68 signals, OTP-secure communication was achieved for up to 130 km. The QKD system maintained a stable secret key rate of 320 kbps and a quantum bit error of 3.8% at 54 km. Our results demonstrate that OTP-based encryption introduces minimal latency while the more key-efficient AES and ASCON encryption schemes can significantly increase the number of signals encrypted without latency penalties. Additionally, implementation of a dynamic key pool ensures several hours of secure key availability during potential system downtimes. This work shows the potential of quantum-based secure remote communications for future digitally driven nuclear reactor technologies.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Incompatibility Constraints for Maximal Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general method to certify maximal quantum randomness without relying on Bell inequalities, applicable to arbitrary multi-user scenarios. By analyzing probability distributions directly, we identify a class of quantum states and projective measurements that achieve maximal randomness. We establish a constraint among users' measurement incompatibilities. Surprisingly, we find that sufficiently big incompatibility on one party's measurements relaxes the requirements on the others', which can even be arbitrarily weak. The method is demonstrated in both bipartite and tripartite systems, providing a versatile framework for device-independent randomness generation in quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Drone- and Vehicle-Based Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution is a point-to-point communication protocol that leverages quantum mechanics to enable secure information exchange. Commonly, the transmitter and receiver stations are at fixed locations, and the single-photon quantum states are transmitted over fiber or free space. Here, we describe a modular, platform-agnostic, quantum key distribution transmitter and receiver with reduced size, weight, and power consumption to realize a mobile quantum communication system. We deploy the system on different moving platforms, demonstrating drone-to-drone, drone-to-vehicle, and vehicle-to-vehicle quantum communication, achieving secure key rates in the finite-key regime in the range of 1.6 - 20 kbps. To prove the security of the system, we develop advanced physics models of the devices that account for non-ideal behaviors that are of greater importance in mobile platforms. The modular system can be easily upgraded to include sources of entangled photonic quantum states, which will find application in future quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Improving quantum walk metrology with split-step quantum walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new estimation scheme based on the split-step quantum walk (SSQW) revealed that by just setting a single parameter, SSQW can potentially achieve quantum Crame\'r-Rao bound in multiparameter estimation. This parameter even does not involve the parameterization but the initial state and unlike ordinary Quantum walk (OQW) there is no necessity for an entangled initial states or even a parameter dependent initial state. The rigorous analytic equations derived in this study revealed that SSQW surpasses OQW in achievable precision of multiparameter estimation in almost all possible scenarios. Furthermore, in single parameter estimation, the extra parameter can be used to tune the dynamics of the walk in such a way to enhance the precision of the estimation through maximizing the elements of quantum Fisher information matrix. The results of this study indicate that SSQW can remarkably improve the estimation schemes through its rich topological properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of energy storage at the nanoscale, exploring the notion of \textit{quantum advantage} implies walking on the thin line at the boundary between quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, which underpins our conventional understanding of battery devices. With no classical analogue, the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model has emerged in the last years as a promising platform to boost charging and storage efficiency thanks to its highly-entangling dynamics. Here, we explore how the robustness of this setup by considering the sparse version of the SYK model, showing that, as long as chaos is not completely broken, reducing its complexity may lead to more efficient quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>Optimizing State Preparation for Variational Quantum Regression on NISQ Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The execution of quantum algorithms on modern hardware is often constrained by noise and qubit decoherence, limiting the circuit depth and the number of gates that can be executed. Circuit optimization techniques help mitigate these limitations, enhancing algorithm feasibility. In this work, we implement, optimize, and execute a variational quantum regression algorithm using a novel state preparation method. By leveraging ZX-calculus-based optimization techniques, such as Pauli pushing, phase folding, and Hadamard pushing, we achieve a more efficient circuit design. Our results demonstrate that these optimizations enable the successful execution of the quantum regression algorithm on current hardware. Furthermore, the techniques presented are broadly applicable to other quantum circuits requiring arbitrary real-valued state preparation, advancing the practical implementation of quantum algorithms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tailoring quantum error correction codes (QECC) to biased noise has demonstrated significant benefits. However, most of the prior research on this topic has focused on code capacity noise models. Furthermore, a no-go theorem prevents the construction of CNOT gates for two-level qubits in a bias preserving manner which may, in principle, imply that noise bias cannot be leveraged in such systems. In this work, we show that a residual bias up to $\eta\sim$5 can be maintained in CNOT gates under certain conditions. Moreover, we employ controlled-phase (CZ) gates in syndrome extraction circuits and show how to natively implement these in a bias-preserving manner for a broad class of qubit platforms. This motivates the introduction of what we call a hybrid biased-depolarizing (HBD) circuit-level noise model which captures these features. We numerically study the performance of the XZZX surface code and observe that bias-preserving CZ gates are critical for leveraging biased noise. Accounting for the residual bias present in the CNOT gates, we observe an increase in the code threshold up to a $1.27\%$ physical error rate, representing a $90\%$ improvement. Additionally, we find that the required qubit footprint can be reduced by up to a $75\%$ at relevant physical error rates.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of multiple-shot unitary channels discrimination using the IBM Q computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tasks involving black boxes appear frequently in quantum computer science. An example that has been deeply studied is quantum channel discrimination. In this work, we study the discrimination between two quantum unitary channels in the multiple-shot scenario. We challenge the theoretical results concerning the probability of correct discrimination with the results collected from experiments performed on the IBM Quantum processor Brisbane. Our analysis shows that neither too deep quantum circuits nor circuits that create too much entanglement are suitable for the discrimination task. We conclude that circuit architectures which minimize entanglement overhead while preserving discrimination power are significantly more resilient to hardware noise if their depth does not overpass threshold value.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Phase Estimation with a Rydberg-Superconducting Qubit Hybrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC) is crucial for high-volume quantum processing in the NISQ era. Many different technologies are utilized to implement a quantum computer, each with a different advantages and disadvantages. Various research is performed on how to implement DQC within a certain technology, but research on DQC between different technologies is rather limited. In this work, we contribute to this latter research line, by implementing the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm on a superconducting-resonator-atom hybrid system. This system combines a Rydberg atom qubit, as well as a superconducting flux qubit system to perform the algorithm. In addition, Hamiltonian dynamics are studied to analyze noise sources, after which quantum optimal control (GRAPE) is used to optimize gate construction. The results show tradeoffs between GRAPE step size, iterations and noise level.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Assisted Fermionic Compression Encoding: A Lossy-QSCI Framework for Scalable Quantum Chemistry Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises to revolutionize many-body simulations for quantum chemistry, but its potential is constrained by limited qubits and noise in current devices. In this work, we introduce the Lossy Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (Lossy-QSCI) framework, which combines a lossy subspace Hamiltonian preparation pipeline with a generic QSCI selection process. This framework integrates a chemistry-inspired lossy Random Linear Encoder (Chemical-RLE) with a neural network-assisted Fermionic Expectation Decoder (NN-FED). The RLE leverages fermionic number conservation to compress quantum states, reducing qubit requirements to O(N log M) for M spin orbitals and N electrons, while preserving crucial ground state information and enabling self-consistent configuration recovery. NN-FED, powered by a neural network trained with minimal data, efficiently decodes these compressed states, overcoming the measurement challenges common in the approaches of the traditional QSCI and its variants. Through iterative quantum sampling and classical post-processing, our hybrid method refines ground state estimates with high efficiency. Demonstrated on the C2 and LiH molecules, our framework achieves chemical accuracy with fewer qubits and basis states, paving a scalable pathway for quantum chemistry simulations on both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Tracking phase entanglement during propagation of downconverted photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional entanglement in the form of transverse spatial correlation between a pair of photons generated via spontaneous parametric downconversion is not only a valuable resource in many academic and real-life applications but also provides access to several intriguing quantum phenomena. One such non-intuitive phenomenon is phase entanglement, in which the biphoton state is correlated in the complex phase of its wavefunction. This state, which emerges during the propagation of the biphoton wavefunction, exhibits neither position nor momentum correlation, yet retains full entanglement. In this work, we experimentally explore this state in two distinct ways. The first is by tracking the vanishing spatial photon number correlation over propagation distances lying in $\left[0,\infty\right)$, folded into a finite range using single-lens imaging. These observations show excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions based on the Double Gaussian (DG) approximation of the biphoton state. The second approach involves performing a two-photon interference experiment using a double slit and this state, which reveals the correlated phase front. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that the observed two-photon interference structure is markedly different from that produced by position-correlated photons, as confirmed by computing the joint probability distribution of photons (JPD) and related metrics. Such interference using phase-entangled light has not been attempted before and opens avenues for advanced experiments and applications in the field of spatial entanglement.</description>

      <title>Isospectrality and non-locality of generalized Dirac combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of Dirac's comb model, describing a non-relativistic particle moving in a periodic array of generalized point interactions. The latter represent the most general point interactions rendering the kinetic-energy operator self-adjoint, and form a four-parameters family that includes the $\delta$-potential and the $\delta'$-potential as particular cases. We study the parameter dependence of the spectral properties of this system, finding a rich isospectrality structure. We systematically classify a large class of isospectral relations, determining which Hamiltonians are spectrally unique, and which are instead related by a unitary or anti-unitary transformation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing QAOA circuit transpilation with parity twine and SWAP network encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) circuits with non-trivial connectivity in fixed-layout quantum platforms such as superconducting-based quantum processing units (QPUs) requires a process of transpilation to match the quantum circuit on the given layout. This step is critical for reducing error rates when running on noisy QPUs. Two methodologies that improve the resource required to do such transpilation are the SWAP network and parity twine chains (PTC). These approaches reduce the two-qubit gate count and depth needed to represent fully connected circuits. In this work, a simulated annealing-based method is introduced that reduces the PTC and SWAP network encoding requirements in QAOA circuits with non-fully connected two-qubit gates. This method is benchmarked against various transpilers and demonstrates that, beyond specific connectivity thresholds, it achieves significant reductions in both two-qubit gate count and circuit depth, surpassing the performance of Qiskit transpiler at its highest optimization level. For example, for a 120-qubit QAOA instance with 25% connectivity, our method achieves an 85% reduction in depth and a 28% reduction in two-qubit gates. Finally, the practical impact of PTC encoding is validated by benchmarking QAOA on the ibm_fez device, showing improved performance up to 20 qubits, compared to a 15-qubit limit when using SWAP networks.</description>

      <title>A variational quantum eigensolver tailored to multi-band tight-binding simulations of electronic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a cost-efficient measurement scheme of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) for atomistic simulations of electronic structures based on a tight-binding (TB) theory. Leveraging the lattice geometry of a material domain, the sparse TB Hamiltonian is constructed in a bottom-up manner and is represented as a linear combination of the standard-basis (SB) operators. The cost function is evaluated with an extended version of the Bell measurement circuit that can simultaneously measure multiple SB operators and therefore reduces the number of circuits required bythe evaluation process. The proposed VQE scheme is applied to find band-gap energies of metal-halide-perovskite supercells that have finite dimensions with closed boundaries and are described with a sp3 TB model. Experimental results confirm that the proposed scheme gives solutions that follow well the accurate ones, but, more importantly, has the computing efficiency that is obviously superior to the commutativity-based Pauli grouping methods. Extending the application scope of VQE to three-dimensional confined atomic structures, this work can serve as a practical guideline for handling TB simulations in the noise-intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed multipartite quantum repeater rates in the stationary regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite quantum repeaters play an important role in quantum communication networks enabling the transmission of quantum information over larger distances. To increase the rates for multipartite entanglement distribution, multiplexing of quantum memories is included. Understanding the limitations of achievable rates in the stationary regime for different network sizes is a fundamental step to comprehend scalability of quantum networks. This work investigates the behavior of the multipartite quantum repeater rate (i.e., the number of GHZ states generated per round and per memory) in the stationary regime in multipartite star graphs with a single central multipartite quantum repeater including multiplexing using Markov chains. We derive a closed-form expression for the stationary rate depending on the network size. We support our results with numerical simulations. Further, we show that the rate saturates for large number of memories. On an abstract level, the mathematical description is equivalent to quantum repeater chains between two parties. Therefore, our results also apply to those setups.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of derivatives using approximate generalized parameter shift rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter shift rules are instrumental for derivatives estimation in a wide range of quantum algorithms, especially in the context of Quantum Machine Learning. Application of single-gap parameter shift rule is often not possible in algorithms running on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware due to noise effects and interaction between device qubits. In such cases, generalized parameter shift rules must be applied yet are computationally expensive for larger systems. In this paper we present the approximate generalized parameter rule (aGPSR) that can handle arbitrary device Hamiltonians and provides an accurate derivative estimation while significantly reducing the computational requirements. When applying aGPSR for a variational quantum eigensolver test case ranging from 3 to 6 qubits, the number of expectation calls is reduced by a factor ranging from 7 to 504 while reaching the exact same target energy, demonstrating its huge computational savings capabilities.</description>

      <title>Joint Encryption and Error Correction for Secure Quantum Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18133v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure quantum networks are a bedrock requirement for developing a future quantum internet. However, quantum channels are susceptible to channel noise that introduce errors in the transmitted data. The traditional approach to providing error correction typically encapsulates the message in an error correction code after encryption. Such separate processes incur overhead that must be avoided when possible. We, consequently, provide a single integrated process that allows for encryption as well as error correction. This is a first attempt to do so for secure quantum communication and combines the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code with the three-stage secure quantum communication protocol. Lastly, it allows for arbitrary qubits to be transmitted from sender to receiver making the proposed protocol general purpose.</description>

      <title>Statistical Localization in a Rydberg Simulator of $U(1)$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide a framework for describing dynamical systems ranging from nuclei to materials. LGTs that host concatenated conservation laws can exhibit Hilbert space fragmentation, where each subspace may be labeled by a conserved quantity with nonlocal operator support. It is expected that nonlocal conservation laws will not impede thermalization locally. However, this expectation has recently been challenged by the notion of statistical localization, wherein particular motifs of microscopic configurations may remain frozen in time due to strong Hilbert space fragmentation. Here, we report the first experimental signatures of statistically-localized behavior. We realize a novel constrained LGT model using a facilitated Rydberg atom array, where atoms mediate the dynamics of electric charge clusters whose nonlocal pattern of net charges remains invariant. By experimentally reconstructing observables sampled from a temporal ensemble, we probe the spatial distribution of each conserved quantity. We find that as a result of strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the expectation values of all conserved quantities remain locally distributed in typical quantum states, even though they are described by nonlocal string-like operators. Our work opens the door to high-energy explorations of cluster dynamics and low-energy studies of strong zero modes that persist in infinite-temperature topological systems.</description>

      <title>Boosting Binomial Exotic Option Pricing with Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pricing of exotic financial derivatives, such as Asian and multi-asset American basket options, poses significant challenges for standard numerical methods such as binomial trees or Monte Carlo methods. While the former often scales exponentially with the parameters of interest, the latter often requires expensive simulations to obtain sufficient statistical convergence. This work combines the binomial pricing method for options with tensor network techniques, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS), to overcome these challenges. Our proposed methods scale linearly with the parameters of interest and significantly reduce the computational complexity of pricing exotics compared to conventional methods. For Asian options, we present two methods: a tensor train cross approximation-based method for pricing, and a variational pricing method using MPS, which provides a stringent lower bound on option prices. For multi-asset American basket options, we combine the decoupled trees technique with the tensor train cross approximation to efficiently handle baskets of up to $m = 8$ correlated assets. All approaches scale linearly in the number of discretization steps $N$ for Asian options, and the number of assets $m$ for multi-asset options. Our numerical experiments underscore the high potential of tensor network methods as highly efficient simulation and optimization tools for financial engineering.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum computing progresses, traditional cryptographic systems face the threat of obsolescence due to the capabilities of quantum algorithms. This paper introduces the Quantum-Ready Architecture for Security and Risk Management (QUASAR), a novel framework designed to help organizations prepare for the post-quantum era. QUASAR provides a structured approach to transition from current cryptographic systems to quantum-resistant alternatives, emphasizing technical, security, and operational readiness. The framework integrates a set of actionable components, a timeline for phased implementation, and continuous optimization strategies to ensure ongoing preparedness. Through performance indicators, readiness scores, and optimization functions, QUASAR enables organizations to assess their current state, identify gaps, and execute targeted actions to mitigate risks posed by quantum computing. By offering a comprehensive, adaptable, and quantifiable strategy, QUASAR equips organizations with the tools necessary to future-proof their operations and secure sensitive data against the impending rise of quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a central challenge in computational mathematics. Traditional numerical methods, while effective in low-dimensional settings or on coarse grids, often struggle to deliver the precision required in practical applications. Recent machine learning-based approaches offer flexibility but frequently fall short in terms of accuracy and reliability, particularly in industrial contexts. In this work, we explore a quantum-inspired method based on quantized tensor trains (QTT), enabling efficient and accurate solutions to PDEs in a variety of challenging scenarios. Through several representative examples, we demonstrate that the QTT approach can achieve logarithmic scaling in both memory and computational cost for linear and nonlinear PDEs. Additionally, we introduce a novel technique for data-driven learning within the quantum-inspired framework, combining the adaptability of neural networks with enhanced accuracy and reduced training time.</description>

      <title>Real Spectra in PT Symmetry Hamiltonians using Tridiagonal Representation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the solution of PT symmetry Hamiltonians using the technique of tridiagonal representation approach. This methodology provides more accurate results and proper depiction of the Hamiltonian energy level and wavefunctions. It is well know that PT symmetry condition of a Hamiltonian ensure that its spectra are real and positive even if the Hamiltonian is non Hermitian. Here, we introduce the method of TRA to get the eigenvalues and wavefunction of this Hamiltonian for integers values of $N$ and show an approximation solution for non-integer value of $N$. Due to the nature of the Hamiltonian, the TRA was applied in a semi-Analytic manner in the paper.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Mattis ordering theorem of electronic energy levels in the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lieb-Mattis theorem orders the lowest-energy states of total spin $s$ of a system of $P$ interacting fermions. We generalize these predictions to fermionic mixtures of $P$ particles with more than $N=2$ spinor components/species in the thermodynamic limit $P\to\infty$. The lowest-energy state inside each permutation symmetry sector $h$, arising in the $P$-fold tensor product decomposition, is well approximated by a U$(N)$ coherent (quasi-classical, variational) state, specially in the limit $P\to\infty$. In particular, the ground state of the system belongs the most symmetric (dominant Young tableau $h_0$) configuration. We exemplify our construction with the $N=3$ level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, with a previous motivation on pairing correlations and U$(N)$-invariant quantum Hall ferromagnets. In the limit $P\to\infty$, each lowest-energy state within each permutation symmetry sector $h$ undergoes a quantum phase transition for a critical value $\lambda_c(h)$ of the exchange coupling constant $\lambda$, depending on $h$. This generalizes standard quantum phase transitions and their phase diagrams corresponding to the ground state belonging to the most symmetric sector $h_0$.</description>

      <title>Modification of the uniform electron gas polarizational stopping power due to the interaction of the projectile with new collective modes at moderate and strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a detailed study of the polarizational stopping power of a homogeneous electron gas in moderate and strong coupling regimes using the self-consistent version of the method of moments as the key theoretical approach capable of expressing the dynamic characteristics of the system in terms of the static ones, which are the moments. We develop a robust framework that relies on nine sum rules and other exact relationships to analyze electron-electron interactions and their impact on energy-loss processes. We derive an expression for the stopping power that takes into account both quantum statistical effects and electron correlation phenomena. Our results demonstrate significant deviations from classical stopping power predictions, especially under the strong coupling conditions when electron dynamics is highly dependent on collective behavior and a projectile interacts with the system collective modes revealed in Phys. Rev. B 107, 195143 (2023). This work not only advances the theoretical understanding of the homogeneous electron gas but also has implications for practical applications in fields such as plasma physics and materials science.</description>

      <title>Multi-shot readout error benchmark of the nitrogen-vacancy center's electronic qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ground-state electronic spin of a negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond can be used for room-temperature experiments showing coherent qubit functionality. At room temperature, photoluminescence-based qubit readout has a low single-shot fidelity; however, the populations of the qubit's two basis states can be inferred using multi-shot readout. In this work, we calculate the dependence of the error of a multi-shot inference method on various parameters of the readout process. This multi-shot readout error scales as $\Delta/\sqrt{N}$, with $N$ being the number of shots, suggesting to use the coefficient $\Delta$ as a simple multi-shot readout error benchmark. Our calculation takes into account background photons, photon loss, and initialization error. Our model enables the identification of the readout error budget, i.e., the role various imperfections play in setting the readout error. Our results enable experimentalists and engineers to focus their efforts on those hardware improvements that yield the highest performance gain for multi-shot readout.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a ladder system where one leg, referred to as the ``bath", is governed by an Aubry-Andr\'{e} (AA) type Hamiltonian, while the other leg, termed the ``subsystem", follows a standard tight-binding Hamiltonian. We investigate the localization properties in the subsystem induced by its coupling to the bath. For the coupling strength larger than a critical value ($t'&gt;t'_c$), the analysis of the static properties show that there are three distinct phases as the AA potential strength $V$ is varied: a fully delocalized phase at low $V$, a localized phase at intermediate $V$, and a weakly delocalized (fractal) phase at large $V$. An analysis of the wavepacket dynamics shows that the delocalized phase exhibits a ballistic behavior, whereas the weakly delocalized phase is subdiffusive. Interestingly, we also find a superdiffusive narrow crossover regime along the line separating the delocalized and localized phases. When $t'&lt;t'_c$, the intermediate localized phase disappears, and we find a delocalized (ballistic) phase at low $V$ and a weakly delocalized (subdiffusive) phase at large $V$. Between those two phases, there is also a crossover regime where the system can be super- or subdiffusive. Finally, in some limiting scenario, we also establish a mapping between our ladder system and a well-studied one-dimensional generalized Aubry-Andr\'{e} (GAA) model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order topological phases with invertible symmetries have been extensively studied in recent years, revealing gapless modes localized on boundaries of higher codimension. In this work, we extend the framework of higher-order symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases to include non-invertible symmetries. We construct a concrete model of a second-order SPT phase in $2+1$ dimensions that hosts symmetry-protected corner modes protected by a non-invertible symmetry. This construction is then generalized to a $d^{th}$-order SPT phase in $d+1$ dimensions, featuring similarly protected corner modes. Additionally, we demonstrate a second-order SPT phase in $3+1$ dimensions exhibiting hinge modes protected by a non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <title>Multiparty entanglement loops in quantum spin liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) give rise to exotic emergent particles by weaving intricate entanglement patterns in the underlying electrons. Bipartite measures between subregions can detect the presence of anyons, but little is known about the full entanglement structure of QSLs. Here, we study the multiparty entanglement of QSLs via entanglement microscopy. We find that in contrast to conventional matter, the genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) between spins is absent in the smallest subregions, a phenomenon we call "entanglement frustration". Instead, GME is more collective, and arises solely in loops. By exploiting exact results and large-scale numerics, we confirm these properties in various gapped and gapless QSLs realised in physically motivated Hamiltonians, as well as with string-net wavefunctions hosting abelian or non-abelian anyons. Our results shed new light on the phase diagram of Kitaev's honeycomb model in a Zeeman field, and the Kagome Heisenberg model under various perturbations. Going beyond QSLs, we provide evidence that entanglement loops are a universal property of quantum gauge theories. This leads to a new understanding of fractionalization, and the means by which gauge bosons encode quantum information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key problem in quantum information science is to determine optimal protocols for the interconversion of entangled states shared between remote parties. While for two parties a large number of results in this direction is available, the multipartite setting still remains a major challenge. In this article, this problem is addressed by extending the resource theory of entanglement for multipartite systems beyond the standard framework of local operations and classical communication. Specifically, we consider transformations capable of introducing a small, controllable increase of entanglement of a state, with the requirement that the increase can be made arbitrarily small. We demonstrate that in this adjusted framework, the transformation rates between multipartite states are fundamentally dictated by the bipartite entanglement entropies of the respective quantum states. Remarkably, this approach allows the reduction of tripartite entanglement to its bipartite analog, indicating that every pure tripartite state can be reversibly synthesized from a suitable number of singlets distributed between pairs of parties.</description>

Abstract: Coherently controlling the motion of single atoms in optical tweezers would enable new applications in quantum information science. To demonstrate this, we first prepare atoms in their motional ground state using a species-agnostic cooling mechanism that converts motional excitations into erasures -- errors with a known location. This cooling mechanism fundamentally outperforms idealized traditional sideband cooling, which we experimentally demonstrate. By coherently manipulating the resultant pure motional state, we perform mid-circuit readout and mid-circuit erasure detection via local shelving into motional superposition states. We finally entangle the motion of two atoms in separate tweezers and generate hyper-entanglement by preparing a simultaneous Bell state of motional and optical qubits, unlocking a large new class of quantum operations with neutral atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the scaling of quantum Fisher information with the number of system particles in the limit of large number of particles, as a function of the number of parties interacting with each other, for encoding Hamiltonians having arbitrary-body interactions. We find that estimation of coupling strength of such arbitrary-body encoding Hamiltonians provide a super-Heisenberg scaling that increases monotonically with an increase in the number of interacting particles, in the limit of large number of system particles. Moreover, we also find that the optimal probes corresponding to Hamiltonians that contain even-body interaction terms, may be entangled, but certainly not so in all bipartitions, and particularly, it is possible to attain optimal precision using asymmetric probes. Thereby we find a complementarity in the requirement of asymmetry and genuine entanglement in optimal probes for estimating strength of odd- and even-body interactions respectively. Additionally, we provide an upper bound on the number of parties up to which one can always obtain an asymmetric product state that gives the best metrological precision for even-body interactions. En route, we find the quantum Fisher information in closed form for two- and three-body interactions for arbitrary number of parties. We also provide an analysis of the case when the Hamiltonian contains local fields and up to k-body interaction terms, where the strength of interaction gradually decreases with an increase in the number of parties interacting with each other. Interestingly, we find a similar dichotomy in the nature of the optimal probe in this case as well. Further, we identify conditions on the local component of the Hamiltonian, for which this dichotomy is still shown to exist for two- and three-body encoding Hamiltonians with arbitrary local dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Pebble games are used to study space/time trade-offs. Recently, spooky pebble games were introduced to study classical space / quantum space / time trade-offs for simulation of classical circuits on quantum computers. In this paper, the spooky pebble game framework is applied for the first time to general circuits. Using this framework we prove an upper bound for quantum space in the spooky pebble game. We also prove that solving the spooky pebble game is PSPACE-complete. Moreover, we present a solver for the spooky pebble game based on satisfiability solvers combined with heuristic optimizers. This spooky pebble game solver was empirically evaluated by calculating optimal classical space / quantum space / time trade-offs. Within limited runtime, the solver could find a strategy reducing quantum space when classical space is taken into account, showing that the spooky pebble model is useful to reduce quantum space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09532v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum non-demolition measurement plays an essential role in quantum technology, crucial for quantum error correction, metrology, and sensing. Conventionally, the qubit state is classified from the raw or integrated time-domain measurement record. Here, we demonstrate a method to enhance the assignment fidelity of the readout by considering the "path signature" of this measurement record, where the path signature is a mathematical tool for analyzing stochastic time series. We evaluate this approach across five different hardware setups, including those with and without readout multiplexing and parametric amplifiers, and demonstrate a significant improvement in assignment fidelity across all setups. Moreover, we show that the path signature of the measurement record provides an expressive feature set that can be used to detect and classify state transitions that occurred during the measurement, improving the prediction of the qubit state at the end of the measurement. This method has the potential to become a foundational tool for quantum technology.</description>

Abstract: Many resource theories share an interesting property: An operation is free if and only if its renormalized Choi matrix is a free state. In this article, we refer to resource theories exhibiting this property as Choi-defined resource theories. We demonstrate how and under what conditions one can construct a Choi-defined resource theory, and we prove that when such a construction is possible, the free operations are all and only the completely resource-non-generating operations. Moreover, we examine resource measures, a complete family of monotones, and conversion distances in such resource theories.</description>

Abstract: The present work deals with quantum Uncertainty Relations (UR) subjected to the Standard Deviations (SD) of the relevant dynamical variables for a particle constrained to move on a torus knot. It is important to note that these variables have to obey the two distinct periodicities of the knotted paths embedded on the torus. We compute generalized forms of the SDs and the subsequent URs (following the Kennard-Robertson formalism). These quantities explicitly involve the torus parameters and the knot parameters where restrictions on the latter have to be taken into account. These induce restrictions on the possible form of wave functions that are used to calculate the SDs and URs and in our simple example, two distinct SDs and URs are possible. In a certain limit (thin torus limit), our results will reduce to the results for a particle moving in a circle.
  An interesting fact emerges that in the case of the SDs and URs, the local geometry of the knots plays the decisive role and not their topological properties.</description>

      <title>Training-efficient density quantum machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) requires powerful, flexible and efficiently trainable models to be successful in solving challenging problems. We introduce density quantum neural networks, a model family that prepares mixtures of trainable unitaries, with a distributional constraint over coefficients. This framework balances expressivity and efficient trainability, especially on quantum hardware. For expressivity, the Hastings-Campbell Mixing lemma converts benefits from linear combination of unitaries into density models with similar performance guarantees but shallower circuits. For trainability, commuting-generator circuits enable density model construction with efficiently extractable gradients. The framework connects to various facets of QML including post-variational and measurement-based learning. In classical settings, density models naturally integrate the mixture of experts formalism, and offer natural overfitting mitigation. The framework is versatile - we uplift several quantum models into density versions to improve model performance, or trainability, or both. These include Hamming weight-preserving and equivariant models, among others. Extensive numerical experiments validate our findings.</description>

      <title>Thermalization without detailed balance: population oscillations in the absence of coherences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open quantum systems that comply with the master equation and detailed balance decay in a non-oscillatory manner to thermal equilibrium. Beyond the weak coupling limit, systems that break microreversibility (e.g., in the presence of magnetic fields) violate detailed balance but still thermalize. We study the thermalization of these systems and show that a temperature rise produces novel exceptional points that indicate a sharp transition in the thermalization dynamics. A further temperature increase fuels oscillations of the energy level populations even without quantum coherences. Moreover, the violation of detailed balance introduces an energy scale that characterizes the oscillatory regime at high temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a Krylov-subspace time evolution algorithm, we simulate the real-time dynamics of translation invariant non-integrable finite spin rings to quite long times with high accuracy. We systematically study the finite-size deviation between the resulting equilibrium state and the thermal state, and we highlight the importance of the energy variance on the deviations. We find that the deviations are well described by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and that the von Neumann entropy correction scaling is the square of the local operator scaling. We reveal also an area law contribution to the relaxed von Neumann entropy, which we connect to the mutual information between the considered subsystem and its immediate environment. We also find that local observables relax towards equilibrium exponentially with a relaxation time scale that grows linearly with system length and is somewhat independent of the local operator, but depends strongly on the energy of the initial state, with the fastest relaxation times found towards one end of the overall energy spectrum. To contrast this behaviour we also study domain wall initial states, which exhibit clear diffusive behaviour, with a Thouless time scaling quadratically with the systems size, leading to a rather precise estimate for the diffusion constant for states in the vicinity of the middle of the energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>Superluminal signalling witness for quantum state reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models for quantum state reduction address the quantum measurement problem by suggesting weak modifications to Schr\"odinger's equation that have no observable effect at microscopic scales, but dominate the dynamics of macroscopic objects. Enforcing linearity of the master equation for such models has long been used as a way of ensuring that modifications to Schr\"odinger's equation do not introduce a possibility for superluminal signalling. In large classes of quantum state reduction models, however, and in particular in models employing correlated noise, formulating a master equation for the quantum state is prohibitively difficult or impossible. Here, we formulate a witness for superluminal signalling that is applicable to generic quantum state reduction models, including those involving correlated as well as uncorrelated noise. Surprisingly, application of the witness to known models described by linear master equations shows that these may still admit superluminal signalling, unless a particular locality condition is obeyed. In contrast, we show that the witness introduced here provides a necessary and sufficient condition for excluding superluminal signals under all circumstances. We further apply the witness to several models driven by physical, correlated noise, where linear master equations are not analytically obtainable, and find that they allow for superluminal signalling. We suggest how specific correlated-noise models may be able to avoid it, and that the witness introduced here provides a stringent guide to constructing such models.</description>

Abstract: We design a variational quantum algorithm to solve multi-dimensional Poisson equations with mixed boundary conditions that are typically required in various fields of computational science. Employing an objective function that is formulated with the concept of the minimal potential energy, we not only present in-depth discussion on the cost-efficient &amp; noise-robust design of quantum circuits that are essential for evaluation of the objective function, but, more remarkably, employ the proposed algorithm to calculate bias-dependent spatial distributions of electric fields in semiconductor systems that are described with a two-dimensional domain and up to 10-qubit circuits. Extending the application scope to multi-dimensional problems with mixed boundary conditions for the first time, fairly solid computational results of this work clearly demonstrate the potential of variational quantum algorithms to tackle Poisson equations derived from physically meaningful problems.</description>

Abstract: Violation of the CHSH inequality by a bipartite quantum state is now used in many quantum applications. However, the explicit analytical expression for the maximal value of the CHSH expectation under local Alice and Bob spin-$s$ measurements is still known only for $s=1/2$. In the present article, for an arbitrary state of two spin-$s$ qudits, each of dimension $d=2s+1\geq 2$, we introduce the notion of the spin-$s$ correlation matrix, which has dimension $3\times 3$ for all $s\geq \frac{1}{2}$; establish its relation to the general correlation $(d^{2}-1)\times (d^{2}-1)$ matrix of this state within the generalized Pauli representation and derive in terms of the spin-$s$ correlation matrix the explicit analytical expression for the maximal value of the CHSH expectation under local Alice and Bob spin-$s$ measurements in this state. Specifying this general expression for the two-qudit GHZ state, the nonlocal two-qudit Werner state, and some nonseparable pure two-qudit states, we find that, under local Alice and Bob high-spin ($s\geq1$) measurements in each of these nonseparable states, including the maximally entangled one, the CHSH inequality is not violated. Moreover, unlike the case of spin-$1/2$ measurements, where each pure nonseparable two-qubit state violates the CHSH inequality and the maximal value of its CHSH expectation increases monotonically with a growth of its entanglement, the situation under high-spin measurements is quite different -- for a pure two-qudit state with a higher degree of entanglement, the maximal value of the CHSH expectation turns out to be less than for a pure two-qudit state with lower entanglement and even for a separable one.</description>

      <title>Impact of dephased entangled states and varying measurement orientations on the reliability of cryptographic keys generated via the quantum protocol E91: A quantum simulation approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main requirements to achieve reliable quantum communications are on-demand sources of highly entangled photon pairs, and semiconductor quantum dots have emerged as prominent candidates to satisfy the necessary conditions of brightness and entanglement fidelity. However, in most cases the biexciton-exciton-vacuum cascade produces a pair of maximally polarization-entangled photons with a dephasing, due to a non-negligible exciton fine structure splitting in the emitting nanostructure. This work focuses on the performance of the E91 quantum key distribution protocol under the variation of two elements: first, the phase in the input state when the protocol is implemented using entangled photons generated via the radiative cascade, and second, the relative directions of the polarization analyzers. We use a quantum computational approach by means of the IBM's API Qiskit to simulate the optical implementation of the studied cryptographic protocol and thus to validate analytical expressions derived for the secret key rate and the Bell's parameter. Our results show that the performance of the quantum transmission is highly impacted by the product between the exciton lifetime and the quantum dot's fine structure splitting and that such an impact may be modulated through the orientation of the polarizers. Under some specific conditions, the studied E91 protocol is shown to turn into the BBM92 protocol, to which the results can be extended. These findings provide important insight for the scalable implementation of quantum key distribution protocols with realistic entanglement sources. Furthermore, this study constitutes an illustrative example of how quantum computation can be used as a tool for simulating physical processes whose experimental realization can be substituted by short algorithms run on quantum software.</description>

      <title>The State Preparation of Multivariate Normal Distributions using Tree Tensor Network</title>

Abstract: The quantum state preparation of probability distributions is an important subroutine for many quantum algorithms. When embedding $D$-dimensional multivariate probability distributions by discretizing each dimension into $2^n$ points, we need a state preparation circuit comprising a total of $nD$ qubits, which is often difficult to compile. In this study, we propose a scalable method to generate state preparation circuits for $D$-dimensional multivariate normal distributions, utilizing tree tensor networks (TTN). We establish theoretical guarantees that multivariate normal distributions with 1D correlation structures can be efficiently represented using TTN. Based on these analyses, we propose a compilation method that uses automatic structural optimization to find the most efficient network structure and compact circuit. We apply our method to state preparation circuits for various high-dimensional random multivariate normal distributions. The numerical results suggest that our method can dramatically reduce the circuit depth and CNOT count while maintaining fidelity compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a quantum framework for addressing reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, grounded in the quantum principles and leveraging a fully quantum model of the classical Markov Decision Process (MDP). By employing quantum concepts and a quantum search algorithm, this work presents the implementation and optimization of the agent-environment interactions entirely within the quantum domain, eliminating reliance on classical computations. Key contributions include the quantum-based state transitions, return calculation, and trajectory search mechanism that utilize quantum principles to demonstrate the realization of RL processes through quantum phenomena. The implementation emphasizes the fundamental role of quantum superposition in enhancing computational efficiency for RL tasks. Results demonstrate the capacity of a quantum model to achieve quantum enhancement in RL, highlighting the potential of fully quantum implementations in decision-making tasks. This work not only underscores the applicability of quantum computing in machine learning but also contributes the field of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) by offering a robust framework for understanding and exploiting quantum computing in RL systems.</description>

Abstract: We present a general non-perturbative method to determine the steady state of open quantum systems under perturbation. The method works for systems with a unique steady state and the perturbation may be time-independent or periodic, and of arbitrarily large amplitude. Using the Drazin inverse and a single diagonalization, we construct an operator that generates the entire dependence of the steady state on the perturbation parameter. The approach also enables exact analytic operations-such as differentiation, integration, and ensemble averaging-with respect to the parameter, even when the steady state is computed numerically. We apply the method to three non-trivial open quantum systems, showing that it achieves exact results, with a computational speedup of one to several orders of magnitude for calculations requiring large sampling, compared to previous approaches.</description>

Abstract: The time evolutions of discrete-time quantum walks on graphs are determined by the local adjacency relations of the graphs. In this paper, first, we construct a discrete-time quantum walk model that reflects the embedding on the surface so that an underlying global geometric information is reflected. Second, we consider the scattering problem of this quantum walk model. We obtain the scattering matrix characterized by the faces on the surface and detect the orientablility of the embedding using scattering information. For the stationary state in the scattering problem, the comfortability is defined as the square norm of the stationary state restricted to the internal. This indicates how a quantum walker is stored in the internal under the embedding. Then we find that a quantum walker feels more comfortable on a surface with small genus in some natural setting. We illustrate our results with some interesting examples.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting quantum computers require microwave control lines running from room temperature to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator. Adding more lines without preliminary thermal modeling to make predictions risks overwhelming the cooling power at each thermal stage. In this paper, we investigate the thermal load of SC-086/50-SCN-CN semi-rigid coaxial cable, which is commonly used for the control and readout lines of a superconducting quantum computer, as we increase the number of lines to a quantum processor. We investigate the makeup of the coaxial cables, verify the materials and dimensions, and experimentally measure the total thermal conductivity of a single cable as a function of the temperature from cryogenic to room temperature values. We also measure the cryogenic DC electrical resistance of the inner conductor as a function of temperature, allowing for the calculation of active thermal loads due to Ohmic heating. Fitting this data produces a numerical thermal conductivity function used to calculate the static heat loads due to thermal transfer within the wires resulting from a temperature gradient. The resistivity data is used to calculate active heat loads, and we use these fits in a cryogenic model of a superconducting quantum processor in a typical Bluefors XLD1000-SL dilution refrigerator, investigating how the thermal load increases with processor sizes ranging from 100 to 225 qubits. We conclude that the theoretical upper limit of the described architecture is approximately 200 qubits. However, including an engineering margin in the cooling power and the available space for microwave readout circuitry at the mixing chamber, the practical limit will be approximately 140 qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonclassical mechanical states, as vital quantum resources for exploring macroscopic quantum behavior, have wide applications in the study of the fundamental quantum mechanics and modern quantum technology. In this work, we propose a scheme for deterministically generating non-classical mechanical states in cavity optomechanical systems. By working in the eigen-representation of the nonlinear optomechanical systems, we identify the carrier-wave resonance conditions and seek optimal driving pulses for state preparations. Concretely, we employ the reinforcement learning method to optimize the pulsed driving fields, effectively suppressing the undesired transitions induced by both the pulsed driving fields and dissipations. This approach enables the high-fidelity preparation of phononic Fock states and superposed Fock states in the single-resonator optomechanical systems, as well as two-mode entangled states in the two-resonator optomechanical systems. The statistical properties of the generated states are also examined. Our results create an opportunity for quantum state engineering in quantum optics and quantum information science via reinforcement learning.</description>

Abstract: Waveguides potentially offer an effective medium for interconnecting quantum processors within a modular framework, facilitating the coherent quantum state transfer between the qubits across separate chips. In this work, we analyze a quantum communication scenario where two qubits are connected to a shared waveguide, whose resonance frequency may match or not match that of the qubits. Both configurations are simulated from the perspective of quantum electrodynamics (QED) to assess the system behavior and key factors that influence reliable inter-chip communication. The primary performance metrics analyzed are quantum state transfer fidelity and latency, considering the impact of key system parameters such as the qubit-waveguide detuning, coupling strength, waveguide decay rate, and qubit decay rate. We present the system design requirements that yield enhanced state transmission fidelity rates and lowered latency, and discuss the scalability of waveguide-mediated interconnects considering various configurations of the system.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the use of a flexible and highly accurate Markov chain Monte Carlo Quantum Detector Tomography method as a minimization algorithm to best describe the response of an efficient $120 nm$ wide NbTiN superconducting nanobridge single photon detector. Separation of the internal quantum efficiency and external quantum efficiency is possible due to the difference in saturation behavior of an ideal 1-photon threshold detector as compared to a detector with non-unity 1-photon internal quantum efficiency. From a statistical analysis of our measurements (at $T=4.23\pm0.01K$, $I=29.4\pm0.1\mu A$, $I/I_\text{switch}=0.90\pm0.01$) we find an external quantum efficiency $\eta=(1.60\pm0.05)\cdot10^{-6}$, a 1-photon internal quantum efficiency $p_1=0.568\pm0.008$ and unity multi-photon (2 or more) internal quantum efficiency.</description>

      <title>Generalization Bounds in Hybrid Quantum-Classical Machine Learning Models</title>

Abstract: Hybrid classical-quantum models aim to harness the strengths of both quantum computing and classical machine learning, but their practical potential remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a unified mathematical framework for analyzing generalization in hybrid models, offering insight into how these systems learn from data. We establish a novel generalization bound of the form $O\big( \sqrt{\frac{T\log{T}}{N}} + \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{N}}\big)$ for $N$ training data points, $T$ trainable quantum gates, and bounded fully-connected layers $||F|| \leq \alpha$. This bound decomposes cleanly into quantum and classical contributions, extending prior work on both components and clarifying their interaction. We apply our results to the quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCCNN), an architecture that integrates quantum convolutional layers with classical processing. Alongside the bound, we highlight conceptual limitations of applying classical statistical learning theory in the hybrid setting and suggest promising directions for future theoretical work.</description>

      <title>Transferring linearly fixed QAOA angles: performance and real device results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) enables solving combinatorial optimization problems on quantum computers by optimizing variational parameters for quantum circuits. We investigate a simplified approach that combines linear parameterization with parameter transferring, reducing the parameter space to just 4 dimensions regardless of the number of layers. This simplification draws inspiration from quantum annealing schedules providing both theoretical grounding and practical advantages. We compare this combined approach with standard QAOA and other parameter setting strategies such as INTERP and FOURIER, which require computationally demanding incremental layer-by-layer optimization. Notably, previously known methods like INTERP and FOURIER yield parameters that can be well fitted by linear functions, which supports our linearization strategy. Our analysis reveals that for the random Ising model, cost landscapes in this reduced parameter space demonstrate consistent structural patterns across different problem instances. Our experiments extend from classical simulation to actual quantum hardware implementation on IBM's Eagle processor, demonstrating the approach's viability on current NISQ devices. Furthermore, the numerical results indicate that parameter transferability primarily depends on the energy scale of problem instances, with normalization techniques improving transfer quality. Most of our numerical experiments are conducted on the random Ising model, while problem-dependence is also investigated across other models. A key advantage of parameter transferring is the complete elimination of instance-specific classical optimization overhead, as pre-trained parameters can be directly applied to other problem instances, reducing classical optimization costs by orders of magnitude for deeper circuits.</description>

      <title>Metrology of open quantum systems from emitted radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the task of learning about the dynamics of a Markovian open quantum system by monitoring the information it radiates into its environment. For an open system with Hilbert space dimension $D$, the quantum state of the emitted radiation can be described as a temporally ordered matrix-product state (MPS). We provide simple analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the radiation state, which asymptotically scales linearly with the sensing time unless the open system has multiple steady states. We characterize the crossovers in QFI near dynamical phase transitions, emphasizing the role of temporal correlations in setting the asymptotic rate at which QFI increases. We discuss when optimal sensing is possible with instantaneously measured radiation.</description>

      <title>Breaking Down Quantum Compilation: Profiling and Identifying Costly Passes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing capabilities of quantum systems, the efficient, practical execution of quantum programs is becoming more critical. Each execution includes compilation time, which accounts for substantial overhead of the overall program runtime. To address this challenge, proposals that leverage precompilation techniques have emerged, whereby entire circuits or select components are precompiled to mitigate the compilation time spent during execution. Considering the impact of compilation time on quantum program execution, identifying the contribution of each individual compilation task to the execution time is necessary in directing the community's research efforts towards the development of an efficient compilation and execution pipeline. In this work, we perform a preliminary analysis of the quantum circuit compilation process in Qiskit, examining the cumulative runtime of each individual compilation task and identifying the tasks that most strongly impact the overall compilation time. Our results indicate that, as the desired level of optimization increases, circuit optimization and gate synthesis passes become the dominant tasks in compiling a Quantum Fourier Transform, with individual passes consuming up to 87% of the total compilation time. Mapping passes require the most compilation time for a GHZ state preparation circuit, accounting for over 99% of total compilation time.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Mirrorless Superradiant Lasing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict collective 'free-space' lasing in a dense nanoscopic emitter arrangement where dipole-dipole coupled atomic emitters synchronize their emission and exhibit lasing behavior without the need for an optical resonator. At the example of a subwavelength-spaced linear emitter chain with varying fractions of pumped and unpumped emitters, we present a comprehensive study of this mirrorless lasing phenomenon. The total radiated power transitions from subradiant suppression under weak pumping to superradiant enhancement at stronger pumping, while exhibiting directional emission confined to a narrow spatial angle. At the same time multiple independent spectral emission lines below the lasing threshold merge towards a single narrow spectral line at high pump power. The most substantial enhancement and line narrowing occur when a fraction of unpumped atoms is present. We show that this leads to superradiant lasing near the bare atomic frequency, making the system a promising candidate for a minimalist active optical frequency reference.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we present a technology development of a superconducting qubit device 3D-integrated by flip-chip-bonding and processed following CMOS fabrication standards and contamination rules on 200 mm wafers. We present the utilized proof-of-concept chip designs for qubit- and carrier chip, as well as the respective front-end and back-end fabrication techniques. In characterization of the newly developed microbump technology based on metallized KOH-etched Si-islands, we observe a superconducting transition of the used metal stacks and radio frequency (RF) signal transfer through the bump connection with negligible attenuation. In time-domain spectroscopy of the qubits we find high yield qubit excitation with energy relaxation times of up to 15 us.</description>

Inspired by a simple light matter interaction open system model, information theoretic quantities like a non-Markovian witness and fidelity are calculated for the $\mathcal{PT-}$symmetric Hamiltonian, and the results are compared with their corresponding Hermitian counterparts. The nature of entanglement between two $\mathcal{PT-}$symmetric and Hermitian open quantum systems is calculated, and the contrast observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum hardware development is progressing rapidly with substantial advancements achieved across leading platforms, including superconducting circuits, trapped-ion systems, and neutral atom arrays. As the pursuit of practical quantum advantage continues, efficient quantum program compilation becomes essential for transforming high-level representations of quantum algorithms into physically executable circuits. A fundamental challenge in this process is qubit mapping and gate scheduling, which play a critical role in adapting compiled circuits to the architectural constraints and physical limitations of specific quantum hardware. In this survey, we systematically review and categorize research on the qubit mapping and routing problems across the three mainstream quantum hardware platforms. We primarily explore the development of hardware-aware compilers for superconducting platforms, classifying existing methods into solver-based, heuristic-based, and machine learning-based approaches, and analyze their optimization targets, including gate count, circuit duration, fidelity, and scalability. Furthermore, we examine the evolution of trapped-ion and neutral atom devices, analyzing the distinct challenges posed by their hardware characteristics and highlighting specialized compilers tailored to these unique physical constraints. Finally, we summarize the key challenges and identify some promising opportunities for future research in quantum compiler design across these hardware platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel technique to measure small angular and lateral displacements of structured light beams. The technique relies on using high-order Hermite-Gaussian (HG) and Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes, which have well-defined symmetry under inversion. We show that the displacements of such fields lead to a crosstalk with modes with opposite parity under inversion, which we measure optimally with an interferometric parity sorter. Using this technique, we achieve improvement factors of up 41 in the signal-to-noise ratio using Hermite-Gaussian modes and 21 using Laguerre-Gaussian modes with order up to 20, as compared to the fundamental Gaussian mode. Our results present a viable way of using structured light for metrology that does not demand quantum light or homodyne detection.</description>

      <title>Tackling Decision Processes with Non-Cumulative Objectives using Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are used to model a wide variety of applications ranging from game playing over robotics to finance. Their optimal policy typically maximizes the expected sum of rewards given at each step of the decision process. However, a large class of problems does not fit straightforwardly into this framework: Non-cumulative Markov decision processes (NCMDPs), where instead of the expected sum of rewards, the expected value of an arbitrary function of the rewards is maximized. Example functions include the maximum of the rewards or their mean divided by their standard deviation. In this work, we introduce a general mapping of NCMDPs to standard MDPs. This allows all techniques developed to find optimal policies for MDPs, such as reinforcement learning or dynamic programming, to be directly applied to the larger class of NCMDPs. Focusing on reinforcement learning, we show applications in a diverse set of tasks, including classical control, portfolio optimization in finance, and discrete optimization problems. Given our approach, we can improve both final performance and training time compared to relying on standard MDPs.</description>

Abstract: The question of thermalization of a closed quantum system is of central interest in non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here we present one such study analyzing the dynamics of a closed coupled Majorana SYK system. We have a large-$q$ SYK model prepared initially at equilibrium quenched by introducing a random hopping term, thus leading to non-equilibrium dynamics. We find that the final stationary state reaches thermal equilibrium with respect to the Green's functions and energy. Accordingly, the final state is characterized by calculating its final temperature and the thermalization rate. We provide a detailed review of analytical methods and derive the required Kadanoff-Baym equations, which are then solved using the algorithm developed in this work. Our results display rich thermalization dynamics in a closed quantum system in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, niobium nitride (NbN) superconductors have emerged as integral components due to their unique structural properties, including a high superconducting transition temperature (Tc), exceptional electrical conductivity, and compatibility with advanced device architectures. This study investigates the impact of high-temperature annealing and high-dose gamma irradiation on the structural and superconducting properties of NbN films grown on GaN via reactive DC magnetron sputtering. The as-deposited cubic {\delta}-NbN (111) films exhibited a high-intensity XRD peak, high Tc of 12.82K, and an atomically flat surface. Annealing at 500 and 950 {\deg}C for varying durations revealed notable structural and surface changes. High-resolution STEM indicated improved local ordering, while AFM showed reduced surface roughness after annealing. XPS revealed a gradual increase in the Nb/N ratio with higher annealing temperatures and durations. High-resolution XRD and STEM analyses showed lattice constant modifications in {\delta}-NbN films, attributed to residual stress changes following annealing. Additionally, XRD phi-scans revealed sixfold symmetry in NbN films due to rotational domains relative to GaN. While Tc remained stable after annealing at 500 {\deg}C, increasing the annealing temperature to 950 {\deg}C degraded Tc to ~8K and reduced the residual resistivity ratio from 0.85 in as-deposited films to 0.29 after 30 minutes. The effects of gamma radiation (5 Mrad (Si)) were also studied, demonstrating minimal changes to crystallinity and superconducting performance, indicating excellent radiation resilience. These findings highlight the potential of NbN superconductors for integration into advanced quantum devices and their suitability for applications in radiation-intensive environments such as space, satellites, and nuclear power plants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is often claimed that adding a qubit to a black hole requires energy $\Delta E \geq T_H \log 2$ so that the extra Bekenstein-Hawking entropy can accommodate the qubit. In this essay, we explain how the recently discovered phenomenon of black hole decoherence allows quantum information to be teleported into a black hole, with arbitrarily small energy cost. The generalized second law is not violated and there is no conflict with unitarity because the teleportation creates new entanglement, analogous to Hawking radiation, between the black hole interior and exterior. In accordance with Landauer's principle, a nonzero minimum energy cost only appears when there is a net erasure of information and noise from the exterior or, equivalently, when ``zerobits'' are sent into the black hole.</description>

      <title>Cat states carrying long-range correlations in the many-body localized phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite considerable efforts over the last decade, the high-energy phase diagram of the random-field Heisenberg chain still eludes our understanding, in particular the nature of the non-ergodic many-body localized (MBL) regime expected at strong disorder. In this work, we revisit this paradigmatic model by studying the statistics of rare atypical events of strongly correlated spin pairs traversing the entire system. They occur for unexpectedly strong disorder, i.e., in a regime where standard estimates fail to detect any instability. We then identify these very peculiar high-energy eigenstates, which exhibit system-wide ${\cal{O}}(1)$ correlations, as nearly degenerate pairs of resonant cat states of the form $|{\Phi}_{\pm}\rangle\sim {|{\alpha_1}\rangle}\pm {|{\alpha_2}\rangle}$, where ${|{\alpha_1}\rangle}$ and ${|{\alpha_2}\rangle}$ are spin basis states. We propose a simple and generic analytical description of this new class of eigenstates that exhibit system-spanning entanglement. This analytical ansatz guides us in our search for rare hidden cat states in exponentially large many-body spectra. This also enables a systematic numerical inspection of the microscopic anatomy of these unconventional pairs, which appear in a wide range of disorder strengths. In the light of recent studies and ongoing debates on the MBL problem, our results offer new perspectives and stimulating challenges to this very active field.</description>

      <title>The Quantum LLM: Modeling Semantic Spaces with Quantum Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the previous article, we presented a quantum-inspired framework for modeling semantic representation and processing in Large Language Models (LLMs), drawing upon mathematical tools and conceptual analogies from quantum mechanics to offer a new perspective on these complex systems. In this paper, we clarify the core assumptions of this model, providing a detailed exposition of six key principles that govern semantic representation, interaction, and dynamics within LLMs. The goal is to justify that a quantum-inspired framework is a valid approach to studying semantic spaces. This framework offers valuable insights into their information processing and response generation, and we further discuss the potential of leveraging quantum computing to develop significantly more powerful and efficient LLMs based on these principles.</description>

      <title>Metal-Insulator Transition described by Natural Orbital Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08397</link>

Abstract: The metal-insulator transition (MIT) is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics and a hallmark of strong electronic correlations. Hydrogen-based systems offer a simple yet powerful model for investigating the MIT, as their insulating behavior arises purely from electron-electron interactions. In this work, we study finite hydrogen clusters with cubic geometries using Natural Orbital Functional Theory (NOFT), a method capable of accurately describing correlated systems beyond mean-field approaches. We focus on two key signatures of the MIT: the fundamental energy gap and the harmonic average of the atomic one-particle reduced density matrix. Our results show that NOFT captures the transition from insulating to metallic behavior as the interatomic distance decreases. By extrapolating the energy gap to the thermodynamic limit, we estimate a critical distance rc ~ 1.2 Ang, in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo benchmarks. These findings demonstrate the reliability of NOFT for describing strong correlation effects in large-scale models.</description>

      <title>HQSI: Hybrid Quantum Swarm Intelligence -- A Case Study of Online Certificate Status Protocol Request Flow Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum computing technology continues to advance, various sectors, including industry, government, academia, and research, have increasingly focused on its future applications. With the integration of artificial intelligence techniques, multiple Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models have been proposed, including quantum convolutional neural networks, quantum long short-term memory networks, and quantum generative adversarial networks. Furthermore, optimization methods such as constrained optimization by linear approximation and simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation have been explored. Therefore, this study proposes Hybrid Quantum Swarm Intelligence (HQSI), which constructs a QNN model as a forward propagation neural network. After measuring quantum states and obtaining prediction results, a classical computer-based swarm intelligence algorithm is employed for weight optimization. The training process iterates between quantum and classical computing environments. During the experimental phase, the proposed HQSI method is evaluated using an online certificate status protocol request traffic prediction task. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art quantum optimization algorithms demonstrates that the proposed HQSI approach achieves more than a 50% reduction in error.</description>
