      <title>A Note on Improved bounds for the Oriented Radius of Mixed Multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive integer $r$, let $f(r)$ denote the smallest number such that any 2-edge connected mixed graph with radius $r$ has an oriented radius of at most $f(r)$. Recently, Babu, Benson, and Rajendraprasad significantly improved the upper bound of $f(r)$ by establishing that $f(r) \leq 1.5r^2 + r + 1$, see [Improved bounds for the oriented radius of mixed multigraphs, J. Graph Theory, 103 (2023), 674-689]. Additionally, they demonstrated that if each edge of a graph $G$ is contained within a cycle of length at most $\eta$, then the oriented radius of $G$ is at most $1.5r\eta$. The authors' results were derived through Observation 1, which served as the foundation for the development of Algorithm ORIENTOUT and Algorithm ORIENTIN. By integrating these algorithms, they obtained the improved bounds. However, an error has been identified in Observation 1, necessitating revisions to Algorithm ORIENTOUT and Algorithm ORIENTIN. In this note, we address the error and propose the necessary modifications to both algorithms, thereby ensuring the correctness of the conclusions.</description>

      <title>Balanced clique subdivisions and cycles lengths in $K_{s, t}$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ t\ge s\ge2$ be integers. Confirming a conjecture of Mader, Liu and Montgomery [J. Lond. Math. Soc., 2017] showed that every $K_{s, t}$-free graph with average degree $d$ contains a subdivision of a clique with at least $\Omega(d^{\frac{s}{2(s-1)}})$ vertices. We give an improvement by showing that such a graph contains a balanced subdivision of a clique with the same order, where a balanced subdivision is a subdivision in which each edge is subdivided the same number of times.
  In 1975, Erd\H{o}s asked whether the sum of the reciprocals of the cycle lengths in a graph with infinite average degree $d$ is necessarily infinite. Recently, Liu and Montgomery [J. Amer. Math. Soc., 2023] confirmed the asymptotically correct lower bound on the reciprocals of the cycle lengths, and provided a lower bound of at least $(\frac{1}{2} -o_d(1)) \log d$. In this paper, we improve this low bound to $\left(\frac{s}{2(s-1)} -o_d(1)\right) \log d$ for $K_{s, t}$-free graphs.
  Both proofs of our results use the graph sublinear expansion property as well as some novel structural techniques.</description>

      <title>Rearranging small sets for distinct partial sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A conjecture of Graham (repeated by Erd\H{o}s) asserts that for any set $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p \setminus \{0\}$, there is an ordering $a_1, \ldots, a_{|A|}$ of the elements of $A$ such that the partial sums $a_1, a_1+a_2, \ldots, a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_{|A|}$ are all distinct. We give a very short proof of this conjecture for sets $A$ of size at most $\log p/\log\log p$.</description>

      <title>Power Domination and Resolving Power Domination of Fractal Cubic Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In network theory, the domination parameter is vital in investigating several structural features of the networks, including connectedness, their tendency to form clusters, compactness, and symmetry. In this context, various domination parameters have been created using several properties to determine where machines should be placed to ensure that all the places are monitored. To ensure efficient and effective operation, a piece of equipment must monitor their network (power networks) to answer whenever there is a change in the demand and availability conditions. Consequently, phasor measurement units (PMUs) are utilised by numerous electrical companies to monitor their networks perpetually. Overseeing an electrical system which consists of minimum PMUs is the same as the vertex covering the problem of graph theory, in which a subset D of a vertex set V is a power dominating set (PDS) if it monitors generators, cables, and all other components, in the electrical system using a few guidelines. Hypercube is one of the versatile, most popular, adaptable, and convertible interconnection networks. Its appealing qualities led to the development of other hypercube variants. A fractal cubic network is a new variant of the hypercube that can be used as a best substitute in case faults occur in the hypercube, which was wrongly defined in [Eng. Sci. Technol. 18(1) (2015) 32-41]. Arulperumjothi et al. have recently corrected this definition and redefined this variant with the exact definition in [Appl. Math. Comput. 452 (2023) 128037]. This article determines the PDS of the fractal cubic network. Further, we investigate the resolving power dominating set (RPDS), which contrasts starkly with hypercubes, where resolving power domination is inherently challenging.</description>

      <title>Principal minors of the distance matrix of a tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T = ([n], E)$ be a tree and let $D = ( d(i,j) )_{i, j \le n}$ be the distance matrix of $T$. Let $S\subseteq [n]$. We give the first combinatorial proof for a formula to compute the principal minor of $D$ indexed by $S$, namely $\det D[S]$. This generalizes work of Graham and Pollak, as well as more recent works.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetry in product graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we establish an edge-isoperimetric inequality for arbitrary product graphs. Our inequality is sharp for subsets of many different sizes in every product graph. In particular, it implies that the $2^d$-element sets with smallest edge-boundary in the hypercube are subcubes and is only marginally weaker than the Bollob\'as$\unicode{x2013}$Leader edge-isoperimetric inequalities for grids and tori. Additionally, it improves two edge-isoperimetric inequalities for products of regular graphs proved by Erde, Kang, Krivelevich, and the first author and answers two questions about edge-isoperimetry in powers of regular graphs raised in their work.</description>

      <title>Separating the edges of a graph by cycles and by subdivisions of $K_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A separating system of a graph $G$ is a family $\mathcal{S}$ of subgraphs of $G$ for which the following holds: for all distinct edges $e$ and $f$ of $G$, there exists an element in $\mathcal{S}$ that contains $e$ but not $f$. Recently, it has been shown that every graph of order $n$ admits a separating system consisting of $19n$ paths [Bonamy, Botler, Dross, Naia, Skokan, Separating the Edges of a Graph by a Linear Number of Paths, Adv. Comb., October 2023], improving the previous almost linear bound of $\mathrm{O}(n\log^\star n)$ [S. Letzter, Separating paths systems of almost linear size, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., to appear], and settling conjectures posed by Balogh, Csaba, Martin, and Pluh\'ar and by Falgas-Ravry, Kittipassorn, Kor\'andi, Letzter, and Narayanan.
  We investigate a natural generalization of these results to subdivisions of cliques, showing that every graph admits both a separating system consisting of $41n$ edges and cycles, and a separating system consisting of $82 n$ edges and subdivisions of $K_4$.</description>

      <title>Graceful coloring is computationally hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a (proper) vertex coloring $f$ of a graph $G$, say $f\colon V(G)\to \mathbb{N}$, the difference edge labelling induced by $f$ is a function $h\colon E(G)\to \mathbb{N}$ defined as $h(uv)=|f(u)-f(v)|$ for every edge $uv$ of $G$. A graceful coloring of $G$ is a vertex coloring $f$ of $G$ such that the difference edge labelling $h$ induced by $f$ is a (proper) edge coloring of $G$. A graceful coloring with range $\{1,2,\dots,k\}$ is called a graceful $k$-coloring. The least integer $k$ such that $G$ admits a graceful $k$-coloring is called the graceful chromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\chi_g(G)$.
  We prove that $\chi(G^2)\leq \chi_g(G)\leq a(\chi(G^2))$ for every graph $G$, where $a(n)$ denotes the $n$th term of the integer sequence A065825 in OEIS. We also prove that graceful coloring problem is NP-hard for planar bipartite graphs, regular graphs and 2-degenerate graphs. In particular, we show that for each $k\geq 5$, it is NP-complete to check whether a planar bipartite graph of maximum degree $k-2$ is graceful $k$-colorable. The complexity of checking whether a planar graph is graceful 4-colorable remains open.</description>

      <title>Some online Maker-Breaker games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider some Maker-Breaker games of the following flavor. We have some set $V$ of items for purchase. Maker's goal is to purchase some member of a given family $\cH$ of subsets of $V$ as cheaply as possible and Breaker's goal is to make the purchase as expensive as possible. Each player has a pointer and during a player's turn their pointer moves through the items in the order of the permutation until the player decides to take one. We mostly focus on the case where the permutation is random and unknown to the players (it is revealed by the players as their pointers move).</description>

      <title>Finding automorphism groups of double coset graphs and Cayley graphs are equivalent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been known that a vertex-transitive graph $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to a double coset graph $\text{Cos}(G,H,S)$ of a transitive group $G\le\text{Aut}(\Gamma)$, a vertex stabilizer $H\le G$, and some subset $S\subseteq G$. We show that the automorphism group of the Cayley graph $\text{Cay}(G,S)$ with connection set $S$ can be obtained from the automorphism group of $\text{Cos}(G,H,S)$ and vice versa. We also show that the isomorphism problem for double coset graphs is equivalent to the isomorphism problem for Cayley graphs provided one knows all groups $G$ for which a fixed Cayley graph is a Cayley graph of $G$. Our main tool is a "recognition theorem", which recognizes when a Cayley graph of a group $G$ is a wreath product of two graphs based upon its connection set.</description>

      <title>A Proof of the Symmetric Theta Conjecture when q = 0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 10.1093/imrn/rnac258, the authors conjecture a combinatorial formula for the expressions $\Xi e_\alpha \rvert_{t=1}$, known as Symmetric Theta Trees Conjecture, in terms of tiered trees with an inversion statistic. In 10.1017/fms.2024.14, the authors prove a combinatorial formula for the same symmetric function, in terms of doubly labelled Dyck paths with the area statistic. In this paper, we give an explicit bijection between the subsets of the two families of objects when the relevant statistic is equal to $0$, thus proving the Symmetric Theta Tree Conjecture when $q=0$.</description>

      <title>Schubert polynomial expansions revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an elementary approach utilizing only the divided difference formalism for obtaining expansions of Schubert polynomials that are manifestly nonnegative, by studying solutions to the equation $\sum Y_i\partial_i=\mathrm{id}$ on polynomials with no constant term. This in particular recovers the pipe dream and slide polynomial expansions. We also show that slide polynomials satisfy an analogue of the divided difference formalisms for Schubert polynomials and forest polynomials, which gives a simple method for extracting the coefficients of slide polynomials in the slide polynomial decomposition of an arbitrary polynomial.</description>

      <title>$k$-Leaf Powers Cannot be Characterized by a Finite Set of Forbidden Induced Subgraphs for $k \geq 5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G=(V,E)$ is a $k$-leaf power if there is a tree $T$ whose leaves are the vertices of $G$ with the property that a pair of leaves $u$ and $v$ induce an edge in $G$ if and only if they are distance at most $k$ apart in $T$. For $k\le 4$, it is known that there exists a finite set $F_k$ of graphs such that the class $L(k)$ of $k$-leaf power graphs is characterized as the set of strongly chordal graphs that do not contain any graph in $F_k$ as an induced subgraph. We prove no such characterization holds for $k\ge 5$. That is, for any $k\ge 5$, there is no finite set $F_k$ of graphs such that $L(k)$ is equivalent to the set of strongly chordal graphs that do not contain as an induced subgraph any graph in $F_k$.</description>

Abstract: A set of points with finite density is constructed in $\mathbb{R}^d$, with $d\geq2$, by adding points to a Poisson process such that any line segment of length $O\left(\varepsilon^{-(d-1)}\ln\varepsilon^{-1}\right)$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ will contain one of the points of the set within distance $\varepsilon$ of it. The constant implied by the big-$O$ notation depends on dimension only.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we introduce the notion of $(b,d)$-geprofi sets and study their basic properties. These are sets of $bd$ points in $\mathbb{P}^4$ whose projection from a general point to a hyperplane is a full intersection, i.e., the intersection of a curve of degree $b$ and a surface of degree $d$. We show that such nontrivial sets exist if and only if $b\geq 4$ and $d\geq 2$. Somewhat surprisingly, for infinitely many values of $b$ and $d$ there exist such sets in linear general position. The note contains open questions and problems.</description>

Abstract: We consider the coding problem in the Stiefel manifold with chordal distance. After considering various low-dimensional instances of this problem, we use Rankin's bounds on spherical codes to prove upper bounds on the minimum distance of a Stiefel code, and then we construct several examples of codes that achieve equality in these bounds.</description>

      <title>Jets and principal components of monomial ideals, and very well-covered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by using combinatorics to study jets of monomial ideals, we extend a definition of jets from graphs to clutters. We offer some structural results on their vertex covers, and show an interesting connection between the cover ideal of the jets of a clutter and the symbolic powers of the cover ideal of the original clutter. We use this connection to prove that jets of very well-covered graphs are very well-covered. Next, we turn our attention to principal jets of monomial ideals, describing their primary decomposition and minimal generating sets. Finally, we give formulas to compute various algebraic invariants of principal jets of monomial ideals, including their Hilbert series, Betti numbers, multiplicity and regularity.</description>

      <title>Non-crossing permutations for the KP solitons under the Gel'fand-Dickey reductions and the vertex operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a classification of the $regular$ soliton solutions of the KP hierarchy, referred to as the $KP solitons$, under the Gel'fand-Dickey $\ell$-reductions in terms of the permutation of the symmetric group. As an example, we show that the regular soliton solutions of the (good) Boussinesq equation as the 3-reduction can have $at ~most$ one resonant soliton in addition to two sets of solitons propagating in opposite directions. We also give a systematic construction of these soliton solutions for the $\ell$-reductions using the vertex operators. In particular, we show that the $non-crossing$ permutation gives the regularity condition for the soliton solutions.</description>

      <title>Universal Plans: One Action Sequence to Solve Them All!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the notion of a universal plan, which when executed, is guaranteed to solve all planning problems in a category, regardless of the obstacles, initial state, and goal set. Such plans are specified as a deterministic sequence of actions that are blindly applied without any sensor feedback. Thus, they can be considered as pure exploration in a reinforcement learning context, and we show that with basic memory requirements, they even yield asymptotically optimal plans. Building upon results in number theory and theory of automata, we provide universal plans both for discrete and continuous (motion) planning and prove their (semi)completeness. The concepts are applied and illustrated through simulation studies, and several directions for future research are sketched.</description>

      <title>General limit theorems for mixtures of free, monotone, and boolean independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study mixtures of free, monotone, and boolean independence described by directed graphs (digraphs). For a sequence of digraphs $G_n = (V_n,E_n)$, we give sufficient conditions for the limit $\widehat{\mu} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \boxplus_{G_n}(\mu_n)$ to exist whenever the boolean convolution powers $\mu_n^{\uplus |V_n|}$ converge to some $\mu$. This in particular includes central limit and Poisson limit theorems, as well as limit theorems for each classical domain of attraction. The hypothesis on the sequence of $G_n$ is that the normalized counts of digraph homomorphisms from rooted trees into $G_n$ converge as $n \to \infty$, and we verify this for several families of examples where the $G_n$'s converge in some sense to a continuum limit. In particular, we obtain a new limit theorems for multiregular digraphs, as well as recovering several limit theorems in prior work.</description>

      <title>Singular loci of Schubert varieties and the Lookup Conjecture in type $\tilde A_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the loci of non-rationally smooth (nrs) points and of singular points for any non-spiral Schubert variety of $\tilde{A}_2$ in terms of the geometry of the (affine) Weyl group action on the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. Together with the results of Graham and Li for spiral elements, this allows us to explicitly identify the maximal singular and nrs points in any Schubert variety of type $\tilde{A}_2$. Comparable results are not known for any other infinite-dimensional Kac-Moody flag variety (except for type $\tilde{A}_1$, where every Schubert variety is rationally smooth). As a consequence, we deduce that if $x$ is a point in a non-spiral Schubert variety $X_w$, then $x$ is nrs in $X_w$ if and only if there are more than $\dim X_w$ curves in $X_w$ through $x$ which are stable under the action of a maximal torus, as is true for Schubert varieties in (finite) type $A$. Combined with the work of Graham and Li for spiral Schubert varieties, this implies the Lookup Conjecture for $\tilde{A}_2$.</description>

      <title>The Symplectic Schur Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a measure on tuples of partitions, called the symplectic Schur process, that should be regarded as the right analogue of the Schur process of Okounkov-Reshetikhin for the Cartan type C. The weights of our measure include factors that are universal symplectic characters, as well as a novel family of "Down-Up Schur functions" that we define and for which we prove new identities of Cauchy-Littlewood-type. Our main structural result is that the point process corresponding to the symplectic Schur process is determinantal and we find an explicit correlation kernel. We also present dynamics that preserve the family of symplectic Schur processes and explore an alternative sampling scheme, based on the Berele insertion algorithm, in a special case. Finally, we study the asymptotics of the Berele insertion process and find explicit formulas for the limit shape and fluctuations near the bulk and the edge. One of the limit regimes leads to a new kernel that resembles the symmetric Pearcey kernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the fundamentals of a new theory of convex geometry -- which we call "broken line convex geometry". This is a theory of convexity where the ambient space is the rational tropicalization of a cluster variety, as opposed to an ambient vector space. In this theory, line segments are replaced by broken line segments, and we adopt the notion of convexity in [CMN21]. We state and prove broken line convex geometry versions of many standard results from usual convex geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1607.04144v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exposition on the Fuss--Catalan numbers, which are a generalization of the well known Catalan numbers. The literature on the subject is scattered (especially for the case of multiple independent parameters, as will be explained in the text), with overlapping definitions by different authors and duplication of proofs. This paper collects the main theorems and identities, with a consistent notation. Contact is made with the works of numerous authors, including the early works of Lambert and Euler. We demonstrate the application of the formalism to solve algebraic equations by infinite series. Our main result in this context is a new necessary and sufficient formula for the domain of absolute convergence of the series solutions of algebraic equations, which corrects and extends previous work in the field. Some historical material is placed in an Appendix.</description>

      <title>Twin-width of Planar Graphs; a Short Proof</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fascinating question of the maximum value of twin-width on planar graphs is nowadays not far from the final resolution; there is a lower bound of 7 coming from a construction by Kr\'al' and Lamaison [arXiv, September 2022], and an upper bound of 8 by Hlin\v{e}n\'y and Jedelsk\'y [arXiv, October 2022]. The upper bound (currently best) of 8, however, is rather complicated and involved. In the paper we give a short and simple self-contained proof that the twin-width of planar graphs is at most 11. We believe that this short proof can also shed more light on the topic of upper bound(s) on the twin-width of planar and beyond-planar graphs in general.</description>

Abstract: Newton's identities provide a way to express elementary symmetric polynomials in terms of power polynomials over fields of characteristic zero. In this article, we study the failure of this relation in positive characteristic and what can be recovered. In particular, we show how one can write the elementary symmetric polynomials as rational functions in the power polynomials over any commutative unital ring.</description>

      <title>On a Traveling Salesman Problem for Points in the Unit Cube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an $n$-element point set in the $k$-dimensional unit cube $[0,1]^k$ where $k \geq 2$. According to an old result of Bollob\'as and Meir (1992), there exists a cycle (tour) $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ through the $n$ points, such that $\left(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - x_{i+1}|^k \right)^{1/k} \leq c_k$, where $|x-y|$ is the Euclidean distance between $x$ and $y$, and $c_k$ is an absolute constant that depends only on $k$, where $x_{n+1} \equiv x_1$. From the other direction, for every $k \geq 2$ and $n \geq 2$, there exist $n$ points in $[0,1]^k$, such that their shortest tour satisfies $\left(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - x_{i+1}|^k \right)^{1/k} = 2^{1/k} \cdot \sqrt{k}$. For the plane, the best constant is $c_2=2$ and this is the only exact value known. Bollob{\'a}s and Meir showed that one can take $c_k = 9 \left(\frac23 \right)^{1/k} \cdot \sqrt{k}$ for every $k \geq 3$ and conjectured that the best constant is $c_k = 2^{1/k} \cdot \sqrt{k}$, for every $k \geq 2$. Here we significantly improve the upper bound and show that one can take $c_k = 3 \sqrt5 \left(\frac23 \right)^{1/k} \cdot \sqrt{k}$ or $c_k = 2.91 \sqrt{k} \ (1+o_k(1))$. Our bounds are constructive. We also show that $c_3 \geq 2^{7/6}$, which disproves the conjecture for $k=3$.
  Connections to matching problems, power assignment problems, related problems, including algorithms, are discussed in this context. A slightly revised version of the Bollob\'as--Meir conjecture is proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a game version of the general position problem in which a general position set is built through adversarial play. Two players in a graph, Builder and Blocker, take it in turns to add a vertex to a set, such that the vertices of this set are always in general position. The goal of Builder is to create a large general position set, whilst the aim of Blocker is to frustrate Builder's plans by making the set as small as possible. The game finishes when no further vertices can be added without creating three-in-a-line and the number of vertices in this set is the game general position number. We determine this number for some common graph classes and provide sharp bounds, in particular for the case of trees. We also discuss the effect of changing the order of the players.</description>

Abstract: We study whether the probability distribution of a discrete quantum walk can get arbitrarily close to uniform, given that the walk starts with a uniform superposition of the outgoing arcs of some vertex. We establish a characterization of this phenomenon on regular non-bipartite graphs in terms of their adjacency eigenvalues and eigenprojections. Using theory from association schemes, we show this phenomenon happens on a strongly regular graph $X$ if and only if $X$ or $\overline{X}$ has parameters $(4m^2, 2m^2\pm m, m^2\pm m, m^2\pm m)$ where $m\ge 2$.</description>

Abstract: We study geometric and topological properties of infinite graphs that are quasi-isometric to a planar graph of bounded degree. We prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph excluding a minor is quasi-isometric to a planar graph of bounded degree. We use the result to give a simple proof of the result that finitely generated minor-excluded groups have Assouad-Nagata dimension at most 2 (this is known to hold in greater generality, but all known proofs use significantly deeper tools). We also prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph that is quasi-isometric to a planar graph is $k$-planar for some $k$ (i.e. it has a planar drawing with at most $k$ crossings per edge), and discuss a possible approach to prove the converse statement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the problem as a two-player game between Algorithm and Builder. The game is played in rounds. Each round, Builder presents an interval that is neither contained in nor contains any previously presented interval. Algorithm immediately and irrevocably assigns the interval a color that has not been assigned to any interval intersecting it. The set of intervals form an interval representation for a unit interval graph and the colors form a proper coloring of that graph. For every positive integer $\omega$, we define the value $R(\omega)$ as the maximum number of colors for which Builder has a strategy that forces Algorithm to use $R(\omega)$ colors with the restriction that the unit interval graph constructed cannot contain a clique of size $\omega$. In 1981, Chrobak and \'{S}lusarek showed that $R(\omega)\leq2\omega -1$. In 2005, Epstein and Levy showed that $R(\omega)\geq\lfloor{3\omega/2\rfloor}$. This problem remained unsolved for $\omega\geq 3$. In 2022, Bir\'o and Curbelo showed that $R(3)=5$. In this paper, we show that $R(4)=7$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positroids are a family of matroids introduced by Postnikov in the study of non-negative Grassmannians. Postnikov identified several combinatorial objects in bijections with positroids, among which are bounded affine permutations. On the other hand, the notion of essential sets, introduced for permutations by Fulton, was used by Knutson in the study of the special family of interval rank positroids. We generalize Fulton's essential sets to bounded affine permutations. The bijection of the latter with positroids, allows study of the relationship between them. From the point of view of positroids, essential sets are maximally dependent cyclic interval. We define connected essential sets and prove that they give a facet description of the positroid polytope, as well as equations defining the positroid variety. We define a subset of essential sets, called core, which contains minimal rank conditions to uniquely recover a positroid. We provide an algorithm to retrieve the positroid satisfying the rank conditions in the core or any compatible rank condition on cyclic intervals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances have linked various statements involving sumsets and cardinalities with corresponding statements involving sums of random variables and entropies. In this vein, this paper shows that the quantity $2{\bf H}\{X, Y\} - {\bf H}\{X+Y\}$ is a natural entropic analogue of the additive energy $E(A,B)$ between two sets. We develop some basic theory surrounding this quantity, and demonstrate its role in the proof of Tao's entropy variant of the Balog--Szemer\'edi--Gowers theorem. We examine the regime where entropic additive energy is small, and discuss a family of random variables related to Sidon sets. In finite fields, one can define an entropic multiplicative energy as well, and we formulate sum-product-type conjectures relating these two entropic energies.</description>

Abstract: Given $h,g \in \mathbb{N}$, we write a set $X \subset \mathbb{Z}$ to be a $B_{h}^{+}[g]$ set if for any $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, the number of solutions to the additive equation $n = x_1 + \dots + x_h$ with $x_1, \dots, x_h \in X$ is at most $g$, where we consider two such solutions to be the same if they differ only in the ordering of the summands. We define a multiplicative $B_{h}^{\times}[g]$ set analogously. In this paper, we prove, amongst other results, that there exist absolute constants $g \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\delta&gt;0$ such that for any $h \in \mathbb{N}$ and for any finite set $A$ of integers, the largest $B_{h}^{+}[g]$ set $B$ inside $A$ and the largest $B_{h}^{\times}[g]$ set $C$ inside $A$ satisfy \[ \max \{ |B| , |C| \} \gg_{h} |A|^{(1+ \delta)/h }. \] In fact, when $h=2$, we may set $g = 31$, and when $h$ is sufficiently large, we may set $g = 1$ and $\delta \gg (\log \log h)^{1/2 - o(1)}$. The former makes progress towards a recent conjecture of Klurman--Pohoata and quantitatively strengthens previous work of Shkredov.</description>

      <title>On symmetric Tetranacci polynomials in mathematics and physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce (symmetric) Tetranacci polynomials $\xi_j$ as a twofold generalization of ordinary Tetranacci numbers, by considering both non unity coefficients and generic initial values in their recursive definition. The issue of these polynomials arose in condensed matter physics and the diagonalization of symmetric Toeplitz matrices having in total four non-zero off diagonals. For the latter, the symmetric Tetranacci polynomials are the basic entities of the associated eigenvectors; thus, treating the recursive structure determines the eigenvalues as well. Subsequently, we present a complete closed form expression for any symmetric Tetranacci polynomial. The key feature is a decomposition in terms of generalized Fibonacci polynomials.</description>

      <title>A New (But Very Nearly Old) Proof of the Rogers-Ramanujan Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new proof of the Rogers-Ramanujan identities. Surprisingly, all its ingredients are available already in Rogers seminal paper from 1894, where he gave a considerably more complicated proof.</description>

      <title>Local certification of geometric graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16953v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of local certification is to locally convince the vertices of a graph $G$ that $G$ satisfies a given property. A prover assigns short certificates to the vertices of the graph, then the vertices are allowed to check their certificates and the certificates of their neighbors, and based only on this local view, they must decide whether $G$ satisfies the given property. If the graph indeed satisfies the property, all vertices must accept the instance, and otherwise at least one vertex must reject the instance (for any possible assignment of certificates). The goal is to minimize the size of the certificates.
  In this paper we study the local certification of geometric and topological graph classes. While it is known that in $n$-vertex graphs, planarity can be certified locally with certificates of size $O(\log n)$, we show that several closely related graph classes require certificates of size $\Omega(n)$. This includes penny graphs, unit-distance graphs, (induced) subgraphs of the square grid, 1-planar graphs, and unit-square graphs. These bounds are tight up to a constant factor and give the first known examples of hereditary (and even monotone) graph classes for which the certificates must have linear size. For unit-disk graphs we obtain a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$ for any $\delta&gt;0$ on the size of the certificates, and an upper bound of $O(n \log n)$. The lower bounds are obtained by proving rigidity properties of the considered graphs, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The weakness of finding descending sequences in ill-founded linear orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Weihrauch degree of the problem of finding a bad sequence in a non-well quasi order ($\mathsf{BS}$) is strictly above that of finding a descending sequence in an ill-founded linear order ($\mathsf{DS}$). This corrects our mistaken claim in arXiv:2010.03840, which stated that they are Weihrauch equivalent. We prove that K\"onig's lemma $\mathsf{KL}$ and the problem $\mathsf{wList}_{2^{\mathbb{N}},\leq\omega}$ of enumerating a given non-empty countable closed subset of $2^\mathbb{N}$ are not Weihrauch reducible to $\mathsf{DS}$ either, resolving two main open questions raised in arXiv:2010.03840.</description>
