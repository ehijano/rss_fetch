      <title>On the edge expansion of random polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $0/1$-polytope in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the convex hull of a subset of $\{0,1\}^n$. The graph of a polytope $P$ is the graph whose vertices are the zero-dimensional faces of $P$ and whose edges are the one-dimensional faces of $P$. A conjecture of Mihail and Vazirani states that the edge expansion of the graph of every $0/1$-polytope is at least one. We study a random version of the problem, where the polytope is generated by selecting vertices of $\{0,1\}^n$ independently at random with probability $p\in (0,1)$. Improving earlier results, we show that, for any $p\in (0,1)$, with high probability the edge expansion of the random $0/1$-polytope is bounded from below by an absolute constant.</description>

      <title>Three more proofs of two congruences for Merca's partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we provide three new, very short proofs of two interesting congruences for Merca's partition function $a(n)$, which enumerates integer partitions where the odd parts have multiplicity at most 2. These modulo 2 congruences were first shown elementarily by Sellers. We then frame $a(n)$ into the much broader context of eta-quotients, and suggest how to comprehensively describe its parity behavior. In particular, extensive computations suggest that $a(n)$ is odd precisely 25\% of the time.</description>

      <title>Tree-width of a graph excluding an apex-forest or a wheel as a minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Grid Minor Theorem states that for every planar graph $H$, there exists a smallest integer $f(H)$ such that every graph with tree-width at least $f(H)$ contains $H$ as a minor. The only known lower bounds on $f(H)$ beyond the trivial bound $f(H)\geq |V(H)|-1$ come from the maximum number of disjoint cycles in $H$. In this paper, we study $f(H)$ for planar graphs $H$ with no two disjoint cycles. We prove that $f(H)=|V(H)|-1$ for every apex-forest $H$. This result improves a bound of Leaf and Seymour and contains all known large graphs $H$ meeting the trivial lower bound to our knowledge. We also prove that $f(H)\leq \max\{\tfrac32|V(H)|-\tfrac92,|V(H)|-1\}$ for every wheel $H$.</description>

      <title>Further constructions of square integer relative Heffter arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A square integer relative Heffter array is an $n \times n$ array whose rows and columns sum to zero, each row and each column has exactly $k$ entries and either $x$ or $-x$ appears in the array for every $x \in \mathbb{Z}_{2nk+t}\setminus J$, where $J$ is a subgroup of size $t$. There are many open problems regarding the existence of these arrays. In this paper we construct two new infinite families of these arrays with the additional property that they are strippable. These constructions complete the existence theory for square integer relative Heffter arrays in the case where $k=3$ and $n$ is prime.</description>

      <title>A sharp lower bound on the generalized 4-independence number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, a vertex subset $S$ is called a maximum generalized $k$-independent set if the induced subgraph $G[S]$ does not contain a $k$-tree as its subgraph, and the subset has maximum cardinality. The generalized $k$-independence number of $G$, denoted as $\alpha_k(G)$, is the number of vertices in a maximum generalized $k$-independent set of $G$. For a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, $c$ connected components, and $c_1$ induced cycles of length 1 modulo 3, Bock et al. [J. Graph Theory 103 (2023) 661-673] showed that $\alpha_3(G)\geq n-\frac{1}{3}(m+c+c_1)$ and identified the extremal graphs in which every two cycles are vertex-disjoint. Li and Zhou [Appl. Math. Comput. 484 (2025) 129018] proved that if $G$ is a tree with $n$ vertices, then $\alpha_4(G) \geq \frac{3}{4}n$. They also presented all the corresponding extremal trees. In this paper, for a general graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, it is proved that $\alpha_4(G)\geq \frac{3}{4}(n-\omega(G))$ by using a different approach, where $\omega(G)$ denotes the dimension of the cycle space of $G$. The graphs whose generalized $4$-independence number attains the lower bound are characterized completely. This represents a logical continuation of the work by Bock et al. and serves as a natural extension of the result by Li and Zhou.</description>

      <title>The capture time in the game of cops and many robbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The game of cops and robber is a pursuit-evasion game played on graphs that has been extensively studied. Traditionally the game is played with one or more cops and only one robber, but in this paper we consider the game played with multiple robbers, with rules allowing for consecutive capture of the robbers. While the cop number remains the same, the capture time can differ drastically compared to the game played with one robber. In this paper we present general upper bounds for the capture time of cop-win graphs in the game with multiple robbers and show that they are the best possible for some families of graphs. Moreover, we explore how the capture time behaves with an increasing number of robbers and prove a surprising relation between this behavior and the 0-visibility cop number.</description>

      <title>Some conjectures of Schlosser and Zhou on sign patterns of the coefficients of infinite products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Schlosser and Zhou proposed many conjectures on sign patterns of the coefficients appearing in the $q$-series expansions of the infinite Borwein product and other infinite products raised to a real power. In this paper, we will study several of these conjectures. Let \[ G(q):=\prod_{i=1}^{I}\left(\prod_{k=0}^{\infty}(1-q^{m_{i}+kn_{i}})(1-q^{-m_{i}+(k+1)n_{i}})\right)^{u_{i}} \] where $I$ is a positive integer, $1\leq m_{i}&lt;n_{i}$ and $u_{i}\neq0$ for $1\leq i\leq I$ and $|q|&lt;1.$ We will establish an asymptotic formula for the coefficients of $G(q)^{\delta}$ with $\delta$ being a positive real number by using the Hardy--Ramanujan--Rademacher circle method. As applications, we apply the asymptotic formula to confirm some of the conjectures of Schlosser and Zhou.</description>

      <title>The Bin Packing Problem with Setups: Formulation, Structural Properties and Computational Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a novel generalization of the classical Bin Packing Problem (BPP), called the Bin Packing Problem with Setups (BPPS). In this problem, which has many practical applications in production planning and logistics, the items are partitioned into classes and, whenever an item from a given class is packed into a bin, a setup weight and cost are incurred. We present a natural Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for the BPPS and analyze the structural properties of its Linear Programming relaxation. We show that the lower bound provided by the relaxation can be arbitrarily poor in the worst case. We introduce the Minimum Classes Inequalities (MCIs), which strengthen the relaxation and restore a worst-case performance guarantee of 1/2, matching that of the classical BPP. In addition, we derive the Minimum Bins Inequality (MBI) to further reinforce the relaxation, together with an upper bound on the number of bins in any optimal BPPS solution, which leads to a significant reduction in the number of variables and constraints of the ILP formulation. Finally, we establish a comprehensive benchmark of 480 BPPS instances and conduct extensive computational experiments. The results show that the integration of MCIs, the MBI, and the upper bound on the number of bins substantially improves the performance of the ILP formulation in terms of solution time and number of instances solved to optimality.</description>

      <title>A case of the dijoin conjecture on inverting oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an oriented graph $D$, the inversion of $X\subseteq V(D)$ in $D$ is the graph obtained by reversing the orientation of all arcs with both ends in $X$. The inversion number $\mathrm{inv}(D)$ is the minimum number of inversions needed to obtain an acyclic oriented graph.
  We show that the dijoin conjecture of Bang-Jensen, da Silva and Havet, that $\mathrm{inv}(D_1\rightarrow D_2)=\mathrm{inv}(D_1)+\mathrm{inv}(D_2)$, is true in the case where $\mathrm{inv}(D_1)=2$ and $\mathrm{inv}(D_2)$ is even. We also characterise the cases $\mathrm{inv}(D_1)=2$ and $\mathrm{inv}(D_2)$ odd, for which the conjecture does and does not hold. We then go on to show a similar result for n-joins, in doing so we prove a conjecture of Alon, Powierski, Savery, Scott and Wilmer. Our proofs build on the idea of tournament minimum rank, introduced by Behague, Johnston, Morrison and Ogden.</description>

      <title>Projective Planar Cartesian Products of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a complete classification of Cartesian products of graphs that embed in the projective plane. Our work requires us to determine minimal Cartesian products that are nonprojective planar, organize their essential properties to be used as constraints for projective planar embeddings, and explicitly construct projective planar embeddings for Cartesian products that satisfy these constraints. A corollary of our work shows that only six of the 35 forbidden minors for the projective plane are sufficient to classify projective planar Cartesian products.</description>

      <title>Saturation for Sums of Posets and Antichains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite poset $\mathcal P$, we say that a family $\mathcal F$ of subsets of $[n]$ is $\mathcal P$-saturated if $\mathcal F$ does not contain an induced copy of $\mathcal P$, but adding any other set to $\mathcal F$ creates an induced copy of $\mathcal P$. The saturation number of $\mathcal P$ is the size of the smallest $\mathcal P$-saturated family with ground set $[n]$.
  The saturation numbers have been shown to exhibit a dichotomy: for any poset, the saturation number is either bounded, or at least $2\sqrt n$. The general conjecture is that in fact, the saturation number for any poset is either bounded, or at least linear.
  The linear sum of two posets $\mathcal P_1$ and $\mathcal P_2$, dented by $\mathcal P_1*\mathcal P_2$, is defined as the poset obtained from a copy of $\mathcal P_1$ placed completely on top of a copy of $\mathcal P_2$. In this paper we show that the saturation number of $\mathcal P_1*\mathcal A_k*\mathcal P_2$ is always at least linear, for any $\mathcal P_1$, $\mathcal P_2$ and $k\geq2$, where $\mathcal A_k$ is the antichain of size $k$. This is a generalisation of the recent result that the saturation number for the diamond is linear (in that case $\mathcal P_1$ and $\mathcal P_2$ are both the single point poset, and $k=2$). We also show that, with the exception of chains which are known to have bounded saturation number, the saturation number for all complete multipartite posets is linear.</description>

      <title>The rank distribution of matrices representing graphs with a long induced path over the field of two elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A square matrix $M$ represents a graph $\Gamma$ if its nonzero off-diagonal entries encode the adjacencies of $\Gamma$, subject to a fixed ordering of the vertices. Over the field of two elements, we investigate the distribution of ranks in the affine space consisting of all matrices representing a given $\Gamma$. In particular, we consider which graphs of order $n$ are represented by more matrices of rank $n-1$ than of rank $n$. This property reflects an exceptional feature of the space $M_n(\mathbb{F}_2)$ of all $n\times n$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}_2$, namely that its most frequently occurring rank is not $n$ but $n-1$. Our analysis focuses on the class of connected graphs with an induced path on all but one vertex. The main result is a characterisation of all such graphs that are represented by more matrices of rank $n-1$ than of rank $n$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$.</description>

      <title>Counting Homogeneous Einstein Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an explicit upper bound on the number of isolated homogeneous Einstein metrics on compact homogeneous spaces whose isotropy representations consist of pairwise inequivalent irreducibles. This is the BKK bound of the corresponding system of Laurent polynomials and is found combinatorially by computing the volume of a polytope. Inspired by a connection with algebraic statistics, we describe this system's BKK discriminant in terms of the principal $A$-determinant of scalar curvature. As a consequence, we confirm the Finiteness Conjecture of B\"ohm--Wang--Ziller in special cases. In particular, we give a unified proof that it holds on all generalized Wallach spaces. Finally, using numerical algebraic geometry, we compute $G$-invariant Einstein metrics on low-dimensional full flag manifolds $G/T$, where $G$ is a compact simple Lie group and $T$ is a maximal torus.</description>

      <title>On a Restriction Problem of Hickman and Wright for the Parabola in $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ for Squarefree $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hickman and Wright proved an $L^2$ restriction estimate for the parabola $\Sigma$ in $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ of the form
  $$\left(\frac{1}{|\Sigma|}\sum\limits_{m\in\Sigma}|\widehat{f}(m)|^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\leq C_\epsilon N^\epsilon\cdot N^{-1}\left(\sum\limits_{x\in (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2}|f(x)|^\frac{6}{5}\right)^\frac{5}{6}$$
  for all functions $f:(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ and any $\epsilon&gt;0$, and that this bound is sharp when $N$ has a large square factor, and especially for $N = p^2$ for $p$ a prime. In contrast, Mockenhaupt and Tao proved in the special case $N = p$ the stronger estimate
  $$\left(\frac{1}{|\Sigma|}\sum\limits_{m\in\Sigma}|\widehat{f}(m)|^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\leq C N^{-1}\left(\sum\limits_{x\in (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2}|f(x)|^\frac{4}{3}\right)^\frac{3}{4}.$$
  We extend the Mockenhaupt-Tao bound to the case of squarefree $N$, proving
  $$\left(\frac{1}{|\Sigma|}\sum\limits_{m\in\Sigma}|\widehat{f}(m)|^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\leq C_\epsilon N^\epsilon\cdot N^{-1}\left(\sum\limits_{x\in (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2}|f(x)|^\frac{4}{3}\right)^\frac{3}{4},$$
  and discuss applications of this result to uncertainty principles and signal recovery.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal polynomials, quantum walks and the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by the following problem. Define a quantum walk on a positively weighted path (linear chain). Can the weights be tuned so that perfect state transfer occurs between the first vertex and any other position? We do not fully answer this question - in fact, we show that a particular case of this problem is equivalent to a solution of a particular case of the well known Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem, deeming our original task certainly harder than anticipated. In our journey, we prove new results about sequences of orthogonal polynomials satisfying three-term recurrences. In particular, we provide a full characterization of when two polynomials belong to such a sequence, which (as far as we were able to ascertain) was known only for when their degrees differ by one.</description>

      <title>Field-independent Kronecker-plethysm isomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an explicit field-independent SL$_2$-equivariant isomorphism between an invariant space of tensors and a plethysm space. The existence of such an isomorphism was only known in characteristic 0, and only indirectly via character theory. Our isomorphism naturally extends the web of field-independent isomorphisms given by Hermite reciprocity, Hodge duality, and the Wronskian isomorphism. This is a characteristic free generalization of a classical situation in characteristic zero: certain rectangular Kronecker coefficients coincide with certain plethysm coefficients, and their non-negativiy proves the unimodality of the $q$-binomial coefficient.
  We also give a short combinatorial field-independent proof that the Hermite reciprocity map over the standard basis is a triangular matrix with 1s on the main diagonal.</description>

      <title>Toward Minimum Graphic Parity Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuits composed of CNOT and $R_z$ are fundamental building blocks of many quantum algorithms, so optimizing the synthesis of such quantum circuits is crucial. We address this problem from a theoretical perspective by studying the graphic parity network synthesis problem. A graphic parity network for a graph $G$ is a quantum circuit composed solely of CNOT gates where each edge of $G$ is represented in the circuit, and the final state of the wires matches the original input. We aim to synthesize graphic parity networks with the minimum number of gates, specifically for quantum algorithms addressing combinatorial optimization problems with Ising formulations. We demonstrate that a graphic parity network for a connected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges requires at least $m+n-1$ gates. This lower bound can be improved to $m+\Omega(m) = m+\Omega(n^{1.5})$ when the shortest cycle in the graph has a length of at least five. We complement this result with a simple randomized algorithm that synthesizes a graphic parity network with expected $m + O(n^{1.5}\sqrt{\log n})$ gates. Additionally, we begin exploring connected graphs that allow for graphic parity networks with exactly $m+n-1$ gates. We conjecture that all such graphs belong to a newly defined graph class. Furthermore, we present a linear-time algorithm for synthesizing minimum graphic parity networks for graphs within this class. However, this graph class is not closed under taking induced subgraphs, and we show that recognizing it is $\textsf{NP}$-complete, which is complemented with a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm parameterized by the treewidth.</description>

      <title>Resolving subcategories for gentle algebras II: Resolving subcategories for gentle trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is the second part of a series that intends to study the resolving subcategories for gentle algebras over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{K}$. As in the first part, we continue to focus on gentle quivers $(Q,R)$, where $Q$ is a directed tree, known as gentle trees. In our previous work, via a modified surface model for gentle algebras with finite global dimension, we studied the join-irreducible elements of the lattice of resolving subcategories of $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R \rangle - \text{mod}$, which happen to be those generated by a non-projective indecomposable object. In this paper, we notice that this lattice is not semidistributive in general and, accordingly, introduce a so-called upper join-decomposition, replacing the canonical one. Together with the techniques we develop in our geometric model, it allows us to describe the resolving subcategories of any gentle tree. These same techniques let us explicitly construct the resolving subcategory generated by any collection of indecomposable $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R\rangle$-modules.</description>

      <title>On the threshold for triangulations inside convex polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Start with a large convex polygon and add all other edges inside independently with probability $p$. At what critical threshold $p_c$ do triangulations of the polygon begin to appear?
  The first author and Gravner asked this question, and observed that $p_c=\Theta(1)$, using the relationship with the Catalan numbers and a coupling with oriented site percolation on ${\mathbb Z}^2$. More recently, Archer, Hartarsky, the first author, Olesker-Taylor, Schapira and Valesin proved that $1/4&lt;p_c&lt;p_c^o$, where $1/4$ is the Catalan exponential growth rate and $p_c^o$ is the critical threshold for oriented percolation. The upper bound is strict, but non-quantitative, and follows by a renormalization argument.
  We show that $p_c&lt;1/2$ using a simple ear clipping algorithm, which can be analyzed using the gambler's ruin problem. This bound is closer to the truth (perhaps near $0.4$) and shows that most configurations of edges inside large convex polygons contain triangulations.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of 321-avoiding Kazhdan--Lusztig varieties can be computed combinatorially in terms of $K$-theoretic skew excited Young diagrams. We present an algorithm which gives a lower bound for this regularity and describe a setting in which this algorithm provides precise regularity computations. This algorithm specializes to compute the regularity of all two-sided mixed ladder determinantal varieties.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Equimatchable Even-Regular Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph is called equimatchable if all of its maximal matchings have the same size. Due to Eiben and Kotrb\v{c}\'{i}k,, any connected graph with odd order and independence number $\alpha(G)$ at most $2$ is equimatchable. Akbari et al. showed that for any odd number $r$, a connected equimatchable $r$-regular graph must be either the complete graph $K_{r+1}$ or the complete bipartite graph $K_{r,r}$. They also determined all connected equimatchable $4$-regular graphs and proved that for any even $r$, any connected equimatchable $r$-regular graph is either $K_{r,r}$ or factor-critical. In this paper, we confirm that for any even $r\ge 6$, there exists a unique connected equimatchable $r$-regular graph $G$ with $\alpha(G)\geq 3$ and odd order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a $3$-connected matroid. A pair $\{e,f\}$ in $M$ is detachable if $M \backslash e \backslash f$ or $M / e / f$ is $3$-connected. Williams (2015) proved that if $M$ has at least 13 elements, then at least one of the following holds: $M$ has a detachable pair, $M$ has a $3$-element circuit or cocircuit, or $M$ is a spike. We address the case where $M$ has a $3$-element circuit or cocircuit, to obtain a characterisation of when a matroid with at least 13 elements has a detachable pair. As a consequence, we characterise when a simple $3$-connected graph $G$ with $|E(G)| \ge 13$ has a pair of edges $\{e,f\}$ such that $G/e/f$ or $G \backslash e\backslash f$ is simple and $3$-connected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coven and Meyerowitz formulated two conditions which have since been conjectured to characterize all finite sets that tile the integers by translation. By periodicity, this conjecture is reduced to sets which tile a finite cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_M$. In this paper we consider a natural relaxation of this problem, where we replace sets with nonnegative functions $f,g$, such that $f(0)=g(0)=1$, $f\ast g=\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Z}_M}$ is a functional tiling, and $f, g$ satisfy certain further natural properties associated with tilings. We show that the Coven-Meyerowitz tiling conditions do not necessarily hold in such generality. Such examples of functional tilings carry the potential to lead to proper tiling counterexamples to the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We completely classify the asymptotic behavior of the number of alternating sign matrices classically avoiding a single permutation pattern, in the sense of [Johansson and Linusson 2007]. In particular, we give a uniform proof of an exponential upper bound for the number of alternating sign matrices classically avoiding one of eleven particular patterns, and a super-exponential lower bound for all other single-pattern avoidance classes. We also show that for any fixed integer $k$, there is an exponential upper bound for the number of alternating sign matrices that classically avoid any single permutation pattern and contain precisely $k$ negative ones. Finally, we prove that there must be at most $3$ negative ones in an alternating sign matrix which classically avoids both $2143$ and $3412$, and we exactly enumerate the number of them with precisely $3$ negative ones.</description>

      <title>The Ising model on cubic maps: arbitrary genus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design a recursive algorithm to compute the partition function of the Ising model, summed over cubic maps with fixed size and genus. The algorithm runs in polynomial time, which is much faster than methods based on a Tutte-like, or topological, recursion.
  We construct this algorithm out of a partial differential equation that we derive from the first equation of the KP hierarchy satisfied by the generating function of bipartite maps. This series is indeed related to the Ising partition function by a change of variables. We also obtain inequalities on the coefficients of this partition function, which should be useful for a probabilistic study of cubic Ising maps whose genus grows linearly with their size.</description>

      <title>Existence of trees with prescribed maximum degrees and spectral radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the spectral radius $\rho(T)$ of a tree $T$ with at least $3$ vertices has the property that $\frac 14\rho(T)^2+1&lt;\Delta(T)\le \rho(T)^2$, where $\Delta(T)$ is the maximum degree of $T$. Let $\mathbb{P}$ denote the set of spectral radii of all non-trivial trees. In this article, we study the inverse problem that for any $\alpha\in \mathbb{P}$ and integer $r$ satisfying the condition $\frac 14\alpha^2+1&lt;r\le \alpha^2$, is there a tree $T$ such that $\Delta(T)=r$ and $\rho(T)=\alpha$?
  For any positive integer $r$ and positive number $\alpha$, let ${\mathscr W}_r(\alpha)$ denote a set of non-negative real numbers defined as follows: $\alpha\in {\mathscr W}_r(\alpha)$, and for any multi-set $\{q_i\in {\mathscr W}_r(\alpha): q_i&gt;0, 1\le i\le s\}$, if $\beta:=\alpha-\sum\limits_{i=1}^sq_i^{-1}\ge 0$ and $s\le r-\left \lceil \frac{\beta}{\beta+1}\right\rceil$, then $\beta \in {\mathscr W}_r(\alpha)$. We first show that $0\in {\mathscr W}_r(\alpha)$ if and only if there exists a tree $T$ with $\Delta(T)\le r$ and $\rho(T)=\alpha$. It follows directly that $\mathbb{P}$ is exactly the set of positive numbers $\alpha$ such that $0\in {\mathscr W}_{\lfloor\alpha^2\rfloor}(\alpha)$. Applying this conclusion, we prove that for any two positive integers $r\ge 2$ and $k$, there exists a tree $T$ with $\Delta(T)=r$ and $\rho(T)=\sqrt k$ if and only if $\frac 14 k+1&lt;r\le k$.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial and Gaussian Foundations of Rational Nth Root Approximations: Theorems and Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an approach (the biroot method) for nth root approximation that yields closed-form rational functions with coefficients derived from binomial structures, Gaussian functions, or qualifying DAG structures. The method emerges from an analysis of Newton's method applied to root extraction, revealing that successive iterations generate coefficients following rows of Pascal's triangle in an alternating numerator-denominator pattern. After further exploration of these patterns, we formulate three main conjectures: (1) the Binomial Biroot Conjecture establishing the fundamental alternating coefficient structure to approximate nth roots (for which we prove the square root case and optimal parameter conditions), (2) the Gaussian Biroot Conjecture, and (3) the General DAG Biroot Conjecture showing a structural invariance to nth root approximation using arbitrary linearly-constructed directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Computational evidence demonstrates superior convergence properties when compared to Taylor series and Pad\'e approximations, especially considering the more direct and less computationally intensive approach to the biroot function construction. A computational framework has been developed to support systematic exploration of the biroot method's parameter space and to enable extensive numerical and symbolic analysis. The method provides both theoretical insights and computational significance by connecting combinatorial structures to nth root rational approximation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12285v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The moduli space of stable rational curves with marked points has two distinguished families of maps: the forgetful maps, given by forgetting some of the markings, and the Kapranov maps, given by complete linear series of $\psi$-classes. The collection of all these maps embeds the moduli space into a product of projective spaces. We call the multidegrees of this embedding ``Kapranov degrees,'' which include as special cases the work of Witten, Silversmith, Gallet--Grasegger--Schicho, Castravet--Tevelev, Postnikov, Cavalieri--Gillespie--Monin, and Gillespie--Griffins--Levinson. We establish, in terms of a combinatorial matching condition, upper bounds for Kapranov degrees and a characterization of their positivity. The positivity characterization answers a question of Silversmith and gives a new proof of Laman's theorem characterizing generically rigid graphs in the plane. We achieve this by proving a recursive formula for Kapranov degrees and by using tools from the theory of error correcting codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetric ideal is an ideal in a polynomial ring which is stable under all permutations of the variables. In this paper we initiate a global study of zero-dimensional symmetric ideals. By this we mean a geometric study of the invariant Hilbert schemes $\mathrm{Hilb}_{\rho}^{S_n}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ parametrizing symmetric subschemes of $\mathbb{C}^n$ whose coordinate rings, as $S_n$-modules, are isomorphic to a given representation $\rho$. In the case that $\rho = M^\lambda$ is a permutation module corresponding to certain special types of partitions $\lambda$ of $n$, we prove that $\mathrm{Hilb}_{\rho}^{S_n}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ is irreducible or even smooth. We also prove irreducibility whenever $\dim \rho \leq 2n$ and the invariant Hilbert scheme is non-empty. In this same range, we classify all homogeneous symmetric ideals and decide which of these define singular points of $\mathrm{Hilb}_{\rho}^{S_n}(\mathbb{C}^n)$. A central tool is the combinatorial theory of higher Specht polynomials.</description>

Abstract: Almost equitable partitions (AEPs) have been linked to cluster synchronization in oscillatory systems, highlighting the importance of structure in collective network dynamics. We provide a general spectral framework that formalizes this connection, showing how eigenvectors associated with AEPs span a subspace of the Laplacian spectrum that governs partition-induced synchronization behavior. This offers a principled reduction of network dynamics, allowing clustered states to be understood in terms of quotient graph projections. Our approach clarifies the conditions under which transient hierarchical clustering and multi-frequency synchronization emerge, and connects these dynamical phenomena directly to network symmetry and community structure. In doing so, we bridge a critical gap between static topology and dynamic behavior-namely, the lack of a spectral method for analyzing synchronization in networks that exhibit exact or approximate structural regularity. Perfect AEPs are rare in real-world networks since most have some degree of irregularity or noise. We define a relaxation of an AEP we call a quasi-equitable partition at level $\delta$ ($\delta-$QEP). $\delta-$QEPs can preserve many of the clustering-relevant properties of AEPs while tolerating structural imperfections and noise. This extension enables us to describe synchronization behavior in more realistic scenarios, where ideal symmetries are rarely present. Our findings have important implications for understanding synchronization patterns in real-world networks, from neural circuits to power grids.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of asymmetric gelation between three walks on the square lattice</title>

Abstract: We find and analyse the exact solution of a model of three different
  polymers with asymmetric contact interactions in two dimensions, modelling a
  scenario where there are different types of polymers involved. In particular, we find
  the generating function of three directed osculating walks in star
  configurations on the square lattice with two interaction Boltzmann weights,
  so that there is one type of contact interaction between the top pair of walks and a
  different interaction between the bottom pair of walks. These osculating
  stars are found to be the most amenable to exact solution using functional
  equation techniques in comparison to the symmetric case where three friendly
  walks in watermelon configurations were successfully solved with the same
  techniques. We elucidate the phase diagram, which has four phases, and find
  the order of all the phase transitions between them. We also calculate the
  entropic exponents in each phase.</description>

      <title>Comparing Left and Right Quotient Sets in Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a finite subset $A$ of a group $G$, we define the right quotient set and the left quotient set of $A$, respectively, as $AA^{-1} := \{a_1a_2^{-1}:a_1,a_2\in A\}$, $A^{-1}A := \{a_1^{-1}a_2:a_1,a_2\in A\}$. While the right and left quotient sets are equal if $G$ is abelian, subtleties arise when $G$ is a nonabelian group, where the cardinality difference $|AA^{-1}| - |A^{-1}A|$ may be take on arbitrarily large values. Using the results of Martin and O'Bryant on the cardinality differences of sum sets and difference sets in $\mathbb{Z}$, we prove in the infinite dihedral group, $D_\infty \cong \mathbb{Z} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, every integer difference is achievable. Further, we prove that in $F_2$, the free group on $2$ generators, an integer difference is achievable if and only if that integer is even, and we explicitly construct subsets of $F_2$ that achieve every even integer. We further determine the minimum cardinality of $A \subset G$ so that the difference between the cardinalities of the left and right quotient sets is nonzero, depending on the existence of order $2$ elements in $G$. To prove these results, we construct difference graphs $D_A$ and $D_{A^{-1}}$ which encode equality, respectively, in the right and left quotient sets. We observe a bijection from edges in $D_A$ to edges in $D_{A^{-1}}$ and count connected components in order to obtain our results on cardinality differences $|AA^{-1}| - |A^{-1}A|$.</description>
