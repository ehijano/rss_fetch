      <title>Cerny type automata and rank conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to prove the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture and the rank conjecture for \v{C}ern\'y type automata and monoids. A transformation monoid is said to be \v{C}ern\'y type if it is generated by a simple idempotent and a regular group of permutations. We prove \v{C}ern\'y conjecture for the \v{C}ern\'y type synchronizing automata and the rank conjecture for the \v{C}ern\'y type transformation monoids. In particular, we obtain the tight bound for the reset threshold of \v{C}ern\'y type synchronizing monoids.</description>

      <title>Navigational hierarchies of regular languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the class of star-free languages. A long-standing goal is to classify them by the complexity of their descriptions. The most influential research effort involves concatenation hierarchies, which measure alternations between ``complement'' and ``union plus concatenation''.
  We explore alternative hierarchies that also stratify star-free languages. They are built with an operator $C\mapsto TL(C)$. From an input class $C$, it produces a larger one $TL(C)$, consisting of all languages definable in a variant of unary temporal logic, where temporal modalities depend on $C$. Level $n$ in the navigational hierarchy of basis $C$ is constructed by applying this operator $n$ times to $C$.
  As bases $G$, we focus on group languages and natural extensions thereof, denoted $G^+$. We prove that the navigational hierarchies of bases $G$ and $G^+$ are strictly intertwined and conduct a thorough investigation of their relationships with concatenation hierarchies. We also look at two problems on classes of languages: membership (decide if a language is in the class) and separation (decide, for two languages $L_1,L_2$, if there is a language $K$ in the class with $L_1\subseteq K$ and $L_2\cap K=\emptyset$). We prove that if separation is decidable for $G$, then so is membership for level \emph{two} in the navigational hierarchies of bases $G$ and $G^+$.
  We take a look at the trivial class $ST=\{\emptyset,A^*\}$. For the bases $ST$ and $ST^+$, the levels \emph{one} are standard variants of unary temporal logic. The levels \emph{two} correspond to variants of two-variable logic, investigated recently by Krebs, Lodaya, Pandya and Straubing. We solve one of their conjectures. We also prove that for these two bases, level \emph{two} has decidable \emph{separation}. Combined with earlier results on the operator $C\mapsto TL(C)$, this implies that level \emph{three} has decidable membership.</description>

      <title>The complexity of separability for semilinear sets and Parikh automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a \emph{separability problem}, we are given two sets $K$ and $L$ from a class $\mathcal{C}$, and we want to decide whether there exists a set $S$ from a class $\mathcal{S}$ such that $K\subseteq S$ and $S\cap L=\emptyset$. In this case, we speak of \emph{separability of sets in $\mathcal{C}$ by sets in $\mathcal{S}$}.
  We study two types of separability problems. First, we consider separability of semilinear sets by sets definable by quantifier-free monadic Presburger formulas (or equivalently, the recognizable subsets of $\mathbb{N}^d$). Here, a formula is monadic if each atom uses at most one variable. Second, we consider separability of languages of Parikh automata by regular languages. A Parikh automaton is a machine with access to counters that can only be incremented, and have to meet a semilinear constraint at the end of the run. Both of these separability problems are known to be decidable with elementary complexity.
  Our main results are that both problems are coNP-complete. In the case of semilinear sets, coNP-completeness holds regardless of whether the input sets are specified by existential Presburger formulas, quantifier-free formulas, or semilinear representations. Our results imply that recognizable separability of rational subsets of $\Sigma^*\times\mathbb{N}^d$ (shown decidable by Choffrut and Grigorieff) is coNP-complete as well. Another application is that regularity of deterministic Parikh automata (where the target set is specified using a quantifier-free Presburger formula) is coNP-complete as well.</description>

      <title>The Alternation Hierarchy of First-Order Logic on Words is Decidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for any $i &gt; 0$, it is decidable, given a regular language, whether it is expressible in the $\Sigma_i[&lt;]$ fragment of first-order logic FO[&lt;]. This settles a question open since 1971.
  Our main technical result relies on the notion of polynomial closure of a class of languages $\mathcal{V}$, that is, finite unions of languages of the form $L_0a_1L_1\cdots a_nL_n$ where each $a_i$ is a letter and each $L_i$ a language of $\mathcal{V}$. We show that if a class $\mathcal{V}$ of regular languages with some closure properties (namely, a positive variety) has a decidable separation problem, then so does its polynomial closure Pol($\mathcal{V}$). The resulting algorithm for Pol($\mathcal{V}$) has time complexity that is exponential in the time complexity for $\mathcal{V}$ and we propose a natural conjecture that would lead to a polynomial time blowup instead.
  Corollaries include the decidability of half levels of the dot-depth hierarchy and the group-based concatenation hierarchy.</description>
