      <title>Support + Belief = Decision Trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SBTrust, a logical framework designed to formalize decision trust. Our logic integrates a doxastic modality with a novel non-monotonic conditional operator that establishes a positive support relation between statements, and is closely related to a known dyadic deontic modality. For SBTrust, we provide semantics, proof theory and complexity results, as well as motivating examples. Compared to existing approaches, our framework seamlessly accommodates the integration of multiple factors in the emergence of trust.</description>

      <title>The Adjacent Fragment and Quine's Limits of Decision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the adjacent fragment AF of first-order logic, obtained by restricting the sequences of variables occurring as arguments in atomic formulas. The adjacent fragment generalizes (after a routine renaming) the two-variable fragment of first-order logic as well as the so-called fluted fragment. We show that the adjacent fragment has the finite model property, and that the satisfiability problem for its k-variable sub-fragment is in (k-1)-NExpTime. Using known results on the fluted fragment, it follows that the satisfiability problem for the whole adjacent fragment is Tower-complete. We additionally consider the effect of the adjacency requirement on the well-known guarded fragment of first-order logic, whose satisfiability problem is TwoExpTime-complete. We show that the satisfiability problem for the intersection of the adjacent and guarded adjacent fragments remains TwoExpTime-hard. Finally, we show that any relaxation of the adjacency condition on the allowed order of variables in argument sequences yields a logic whose satisfiability and finite satisfiability problems are undecidable.</description>

      <title>The category of well-filtered dcpos is not $\Gamma$-faithful</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ho-Zhao problem asks whether any two dcpo's with isomorphic Scott closed set lattices are themselves isomorphic, that is, whether the category $\mathbf{DCPO}$ of dcpo's and Scott-continuous maps is $\Gamma$-faithful. In 2018, Ho, Goubault-Larrecq, Jung and Xi answered this question in the negative, and they introduced the category $\mathbf{DOMI}$ of dominated dcpo's and proved that it is {$\Gamma$-faithful}. Dominated dcpo's subsume many familiar families of dcpo's in domain theory, such as the category of bounded-complete dcpo's and that of sober dcpo's, among others. However, it is unknown whether the category of dominated dcpo's dominates all well-filtered dcpo's, a class strictly larger than that of bounded-complete lattices and that of sober dcpo's. In this paper, we address this very natural question and show that the category $\mathbf{WF}$ of well-filtered dcpo's is not $\Gamma$-faithful, and as a result of it, well-filtered dcpo's need not be dominated in general. Since not all dcpo's are well-filtered, our work refines the results of Ho, Goubault-Larrecq, Jung and Xi.
  As a second contribution, we confirm that the Lawson's category of $\Omega^{*}$-compact dcpo's is $\Gamma$-faithful. Moreover, we locate a class of dcpo's which we call weakly dominated dcpo's, and show that this class is $\Gamma$-faithful and strictly larger than $\mathbf{DOMI}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An infinite binary sequence is Bennett deep if, for any computable time bound, the difference between the time-bounded prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity and the prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity of its initial segments is eventually unbounded. It is known that weakly 2-generic sets are shallow, i.e. not deep. In this paper, we show that there is a deep 1-generic set.</description>

      <title>You-Only-Randomize-Once: Shaping Statistical Properties in Constraint-based PCG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In procedural content generation, modeling the generation task as a constraint satisfaction problem lets us define local and global constraints on the generated output. However, a generator's perceived quality often involves statistics rather than just hard constraints. For example, we may desire that generated outputs use design elements with a similar distribution to that of reference designs. However, such statistical properties cannot be expressed directly as a hard constraint on the generation of any one output. In contrast, methods which do not use a general-purpose constraint solver, such as Gumin's implementation of the WaveFunctionCollapse (WFC) algorithm, can control output statistics but have limited constraint propagation ability and cannot express non-local constraints. In this paper, we introduce You-Only-Randomize-Once (YORO) pre-rolling, a method for crafting a decision variable ordering for a constraint solver that encodes desired statistics in a constraint-based generator. Using a solver-based WFC as an example, we show that this technique effectively controls the statistics of tile-grid outputs generated by several off-the-shelf SAT solvers, while still enforcing global constraints on the outputs.1 Our approach is immediately applicable to WFC-like generation problems and it offers a conceptual starting point for controlling the design element statistics in other constraint-based generators.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Power of Semi-Structured Knowledge and LLMs with Triplet-Based Prefiltering for Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently lack domain-specific knowledge and even fine-tuned models tend to hallucinate. Hence, more reliable models that can include external knowledge are needed. We present a pipeline, 4StepFocus, and specifically a preprocessing step, that can substantially improve the answers of LLMs. This is achieved by providing guided access to external knowledge making use of the model's ability to capture relational context and conduct rudimentary reasoning by themselves. The method narrows down potentially correct answers by triplets-based searches in a semi-structured knowledge base in a direct, traceable fashion, before switching to latent representations for ranking those candidates based on unstructured data. This distinguishes it from related methods that are purely based on latent representations. 4StepFocus consists of the steps: 1) Triplet generation for extraction of relational data by an LLM, 2) substitution of variables in those triplets to narrow down answer candidates employing a knowledge graph, 3) sorting remaining candidates with a vector similarity search involving associated non-structured data, 4) reranking the best candidates by the LLM with background data provided. Experiments on a medical, a product recommendation, and an academic paper search test set demonstrate that this approach is indeed a powerful augmentation. It not only adds relevant traceable background information from information retrieval, but also improves performance considerably in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. This paper presents a novel, largely unexplored direction and therefore provides a wide range of future work opportunities.

      <title>Hypergraph rewriting and Causal structure of $\lambda-$calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first study hypergraph rewriting in categorical terms in an attempt to define the notion of events and develop foundations of causality in graph rewriting. We introduce novel concepts within the framework of double-pushout rewriting in adhesive categories. Secondly, we will study the notion of events in $\lambda-$calculus, wherein we construct an algorithm to determine causal relations between events following the evaluation of a $\lambda-$expression satisfying certain conditions. Lastly, we attempt to extend this definition to arbitrary $\lambda-$expressions.</description>

      <title>Universal Proof Theory: Semi-analytic Rules and Craig Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.06256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a general and syntactically-defined family of sequent calculi, called \emph{semi-analytic}, to formalize the informal notion of a "nice" sequent calculus. We show that any sufficiently strong (multimodal) substructural logic with a semi-analytic sequent calculus enjoys the Craig Interpolation Property, CIP. As a positive application, our theorem provides a uniform and modular method to prove the CIP for several multimodal substructural logics, including many fragments and variants of linear logic. More interestingly, on the negative side, it employs the lack of the CIP in almost all substructural, superintuitionistic and modal logics to provide a formal proof for the well-known intuition that almost all logics do not have a "nice" sequent calculus. More precisely, we show that many substructural logics including $\mathsf{UL^-}$, $\mathsf{MTL}$, $\mathsf{R}$, $\mathsf{L}_n$ (for $n \geq 3$), $\mathsf{G}_n$ (for $n \geq 4$), and almost all extensions of $\mathsf{IMTL}$, $\mathsf{L}$, $\mathsf{BL}$, $\mathsf{RM^e}$, $\mathsf{IPC}$, $\mathsf{S4}$, and $\mathsf{Grz}$, (except for at most 1, 1, 3, 8, 7, 37, and 6 of them, respectively) do not have a semi-analytic calculus.

      <title>Preservation theorems for Tarski's relation algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04656v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a number of semantically defined fragments of Tarski's algebra of binary relations, including the function-preserving fragment. We address the question whether they are generated by a finite set of operations. We obtain several positive and negative results along these lines. Specifically, the homomorphism-safe fragment is finitely generated (both over finite and over arbitrary structures). The function-preserving fragment is not finitely generated (and, in fact, not expressible by any finite set of guarded second-order definable function-preserving operations). Similarly, the total-function-preserving fragment is not finitely generated (and, in fact, not expressible by any finite set of guarded second-order definable total-function-preserving operations). In contrast, the forward-looking function-preserving fragment is finitely generated by composition, intersection, antidomain, and preferential union. Similarly, the forward-and-backward-looking injective-function-preserving fragment is finitely generated by composition, intersection, antidomain, inverse, and an `injective union' operation.</description>

      <title>On Complexity Bounds and Confluence of Parallel Term Rewriting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18250v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit parallel-innermost term rewriting as a model of parallel computation on inductive data structures and provide a corresponding notion of runtime complexity parametric in the size of the start term. We propose automatic techniques to derive both upper and lower bounds on parallel complexity of rewriting that enable a direct reuse of existing techniques for sequential complexity. Our approach to find lower bounds requires confluence of the parallel-innermost rewrite relation, thus we also provide effective sufficient criteria for proving confluence. The applicability and the precision of the method are demonstrated by the relatively light effort in extending the program analysis tool AProVE and by experiments on numerous benchmarks from the literature.</description>

      <title>A Truly Concurrent Semantics for Reversible CCS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reversible CCS (RCCS) is a well-established, formal model for reversible communicating systems, which has been built on top of the classical Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS). In its original formulation, each CCS process is equipped with a memory that records its performed actions, which is then used to reverse computations. More recently, abstract models for RCCS have been proposed in the literature, basically, by directly associating RCCS processes with (reversible versions of) event structures. In this paper we propose a different abstract model: starting from one of the well-known encoding of CCS into Petri nets we apply a recently proposed approach to incorporate causally-consistent reversibility to Petri nets, obtaining as result the (reversible) net counterpart of every RCCS term.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Second-order HyperLTL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the complexity of second-order HyperLTL satisfiability, finite-state satisfiability, and model-checking: All three are as hard as truth in third-order arithmetic.
  We also consider two fragments of second-order HyperLTL that have been introduced with the aim to facilitate effective model-checking by restricting the sets one can quantify over. The first one restricts second-order quantification to smallest/largest sets that satisfy a guard while the second one restricts second-order quantification further to least fixed points of (first-order) HyperLTL definable functions. The first fragment is still as hard as truth in third-order arithmetic while satisfiability for the second one is $\Sigma_1^1$-complete, i.e., only as hard as (first-order) HyperLTL and therefore much less complex. Finally, finite-state satisfiability and model-checking are in $\Sigma_2^2$ and $\Sigma_1^1$-hard, and thus also less complex than for full second-order HyperLTL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a sequence of random structures with $n$-element domains over a relational signature, we define its first order (FO) complexity as a certain subset in the Banach space $\ell^{\infty}/c_0$. The well-known FO zero-one law and FO convergence law correspond to FO complexities equal to $\{0,1\}$ and a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, respectively. We present a hierarchy of FO complexity classes, introduce a stochastic FO reduction that allows to transfer complexity results between different random structures, and deduce using this tool several new logical limit laws for binomial random structures. Finally, we introduce a conditional distribution on graphs, subject to a FO sentence $\varphi$, that generalises certain well-known random graph models, show instances of this distribution for every complexity class, and prove that the set of all $\varphi$ validating 0--1 law is not recursively enumerable.</description>

Abstract: We present the first automated verification technique for confidence-based 2-safety properties, such as global robustness and global fairness, in deep neural networks (DNNs). Our approach combines self-composition to leverage existing reachability analysis techniques and a novel abstraction of the softmax function, which is amenable to automated verification. We characterize and prove the soundness of our static analysis technique. Furthermore, we implement it on top of Marabou, a safety analysis tool for neural networks, conducting a performance evaluation on several publicly available benchmarks for DNN verification.</description>

      <title>Efficient Discovery of Actual Causality using Abstraction-Refinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causality is the relationship where one event contributes to the production of another, with the cause being partly responsible for the effect and the effect partly dependent on the cause. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective method to formally reason about the causal effect of events in engineered systems, with application for finding the root-cause of safety violations in embedded and cyber-physical systems. We are motivated by the notion of actual causality by Halpern and Pearl, which focuses on the causal effect of particular events rather than type-level causality, which attempts to make general statements about scientific and natural phenomena. Our first contribution is formulating discovery of actual causality in computing systems modeled by transition systems as an SMT solving problem.
  Since datasets for causality analysis tend to be large, in order to tackle the scalability problem of automated formal reasoning, our second contribution is a novel technique based on abstraction-refinement that allows identifying for actual causes within smaller abstract causal models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach (by several orders of magnitude) using three case studies to find the actual cause of violations of safety in (1) a neural network controller for a Mountain Car, (2) a controller for a Lunar Lander obtained by reinforcement learning, and (3) an MPC controller for an F-16 autopilot simulator.</description>

      <title>Fair Asynchronous Session Subtyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.08181v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Session types are widely used as abstractions of asynchronous message passing systems. Refinement for such abstractions is crucial as it allows improvements of a given component without compromising its compatibility with the rest of the system. In the context of session types, the most general notion of refinement is asynchronous session subtyping, which allows message emissions to be anticipated w.r.t. a bounded amount of message consumptions. In this paper we investigate the possibility to anticipate emissions w.r.t. an unbounded amount of consumptions: to this aim we propose to consider fair compliance over asynchronous session types and fair refinement as the relation that preserves it. This allows us to propose a novel variant of session subtyping that leverages the notion of controllability from service contract theory and that is a sound characterisation of fair refinement. In addition, we show that both fair refinement and our novel subtyping are undecidable. We also present a sound algorithm which deals with examples that feature potentially unbounded buffering. Finally, we present an implementation of our algorithm and an empirical evaluation of it on synthetic benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Variational Causal Approach in Observational Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06269v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new causal methodology that accounts for the rarity and frequency of events in observational studies based on their relevance to the underlying problem. Specifically, we propose a direct causal effect metric called the Probabilistic Variational Causal Effect (PACE) and its variations adhering to certain postulates applicable to both non-binary and binary treatments. The PACE metric is derived by integrating the concept of total variation -- representing the purely causal component -- with interventions on the treatment value, combined with the probabilities of hypothetical transitioning between treatment levels. PACE features a parameter d, where lower values of d correspond to scenarios emphasizing rare treatment values, while higher values of d focus on situations where the causal impact of more frequent treatment levels is more relevant. Thus, instead of a single causal effect value, we provide a causal effect function of the degree d. Additionally, we introduce positive and negative PACE to measure the respective positive and negative causal changes in the outcome as exposure values shift. We also consider normalized versions of PACE, referred to as MEAN PACE. Furthermore, we provide an identifiability criterion for PACE to handle counterfactual challenges in observational studies, and we define several generalizations of our methodology. Lastly, we compare our framework with other well-known causal frameworks through the analysis of various examples.</description>

      <title>Relating homotopy equivalences to conservativity in dependendent type theories with propositional computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a conservativity result for extensional type theories over propositional ones, i.e. dependent type theories with propositional computation rules, using insights from homotopy type theory. The argument exploits a notion of canonical homotopy equivalence between contexts, and uses the notion of a category with attributes to phrase the semantics of theories of dependent types. Informally, our main result asserts that, for judgements essentially concerning h-sets, reasoning with extensional or propositional type theories is equivalent.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Universality in Physics, Computer Science, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turing machines and spin models share a notion of universality according to which some simulate all others. Is there a theory of universality that captures this notion? We set up a categorical framework for universality which includes as instances universal Turing machines, universal spin models, NP completeness, top of a preorder, denseness of a subset, and more. By identifying necessary conditions for universality, we show that universal spin models cannot be finite. We also characterize when universality can be distinguished from a trivial one and use it to show that universal Turing machines are non-trivial in this sense. Our framework allows not only to compare universalities within each instance, but also instances themselves. We leverage a Fixed Point Theorem inspired by a result of Lawvere to establish that universality and negation give rise to unreachability (such as uncomputability). As such, this work sets the basis for a unified approach to universality and invites the study of further examples within the framework.</description>

      <title>Random Deterministic Automata With One Added Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every language recognized by a non-deterministic finite automaton can be recognized by a deterministic automaton, at the cost of a potential increase of the number of states, which in the worst case can go from $n$ states to $2^n$ states. In this article, we investigate this classical result in a probabilistic setting where we take a deterministic automaton with $n$ states uniformly at random and add just one random transition. These automata are almost deterministic in the sense that only one state has a non-deterministic choice when reading an input letter. In our model, each state has a fixed probability to be final. We prove that for any $d\geq 1$, with non-negligible probability the minimal (deterministic) automaton of the language recognized by such an automaton has more than $n^d$ states; as a byproduct, the expected size of its minimal automaton grows faster than any polynomial. Our result also holds when each state is final with some probability that depends on $n$, as long as it is not too close to $0$ and $1$, at distance at least $\Omega(\frac1{\sqrt{n}})$ to be precise, therefore allowing models with a sublinear number of final states in expectation.</description>

      <title>On reduction and parameter recovering of Petri's cycloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cycloids are particular Petri nets for modelling processes of actions and events, belonging to the fundaments of Petri's general systems theory. Defined by four parameters they provide an algebraic formalism to describe strongly synchronized sequential processes. To further investigate their structure, reduction systems of cycloids are defined in the style of rewriting systems and properties of reduced cycloids are proved. In particular the recovering of cycloid parameters from their Petri net structure is derived.</description>

      <title>Weak Distributive Laws between Monads of Continuous Valuations and of Non-Deterministic Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is weak distributive law of the Smyth hyperspace monad $\mathcal Q_{\mathsf V}$ (resp., the Hoare hyperspace monad $\mathcal H_{\mathsf V}$, resp. the monad $\mathcal P\ell^{\mathrm q}_{\mathsf V}$ of quasi-lenses, resp. the monad $\mathcal P\ell_{\mathsf V}$ of lenses) over the continuous valuation monad $\mathbf V$, as well as over the subprobability valuation monad $\mathbf V_{\leq 1}$ and the probability valuation monad $\mathbf V_1$, on the whole category $\mathbf{Top}$ of topological spaces (resp., on certain full subcategories such as the category of locally compact spaces or of stably compact spaces). We show that the resulting weak composite monad is the author's monad of superlinear previsions (resp., sublinear previsions, resp. forks), possibly subnormalized or normalized depending on whether we consider $\mathbf V_{\leq 1}$ or $\mathbf V_1$ instead of $\mathbf V$. As a special case, we obtain a weak distributive law of the monad $\mathcal P\ell^{\mathrm q}_{\mathsf V} \cong \mathcal P\ell_{\mathsf V}$ over the monad of (sub)probability Radon measures $\mathbf R_\bullet$ on the category of stably compact spaces, which specializes further to a weak distributive laws of the Vietoris monad over $\mathbf R_\bullet$. The associated weak composite monad is the monad of (sub)normalized forks.</description>
