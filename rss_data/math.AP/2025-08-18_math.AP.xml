      <title>On the relaxation of polyconvex functionals with linear growth under strict convergence in $BV$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the relaxation of polyconvex functionals with linear growth with respect to the strict convergence in the space of functions of bounded variation. These functionals appears as relaxation of $F(u,\Omega):=\int_\Omega f(\nabla u)dx$, where $u:\Omega\rightarrow \mathbb R^m$, and $f$ is polyconvex. In constrast with the case of relaxation with respect to the standard $L^1$-convergence, in the case that $\Omega$ is $2$-dimensional, we prove that the sets map $A\mapsto F(u,A)$ for $A$ open, is, for every $u\in BV(\Omega;\mathbb R^m)$, $m\geq1$, the restriction of a Borel measure. This is not true in the case $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$, with $n\geq3$. Using the integral representation formula for a special class of functions, we also show the presence of Cartesian maps whose relaxed area functional with respect to the $L^1$-convergence is strictly larger than the area of its graph.</description>

      <title>A porous medium equation with spatially inhomogeneous absorption. Part II: Large time behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large time behavior of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the quasilinear absorption-diffusion equation $$ \partial_tu=\Delta u^m-|x|^{\sigma}u^p, \quad (x,t)\in\real^N\times(0,\infty), $$ with exponents $p&gt;m&gt;1$ and $\sigma&gt;0$ and with initial conditions either satisfying $$ u_0\in L^{\infty}(\real^N)\cap C(\real^N), \quad \lim\limits_{|x|\to\infty}|x|^{\theta}u_0(x)=A\in(0,\infty) $$ for some $\theta\geq0$. A number of different asymptotic profiles are identified, and uniform convergence on time-expanding sets towards them is established, according to the position of both $p$ and $\theta$ with respect to the following critical exponents $$ p_F(\sigma)=m+\frac{\sigma+2}{N}, \quad \theta_*=\frac{\sigma+2}{p-m}, \quad \theta^*=N. $$ More precisely, solutions in radially symmetric self-similar form decaying as $|x|\to\infty$ with the rates $$ u(x,t)\sim A|x|^{-\theta_*}, \quad {\rm or} \quad u(x,t)\sim \left(\frac{1}{p-1}\right)^{1/(p-1)}|x|^{-\sigma/(p-1)}, $$ are obtained as asymptotic profiles in some of these cases, while asymptotic simplifications or logarithmic corrections in the time scales also appear in other cases. The uniqueness of some of these self-similar solutions, left aside in the first part of this work, is also established.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of a nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (MMT model)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (MMT model). We investigate the effect of the nonlocal operator appearing in the nonlinearity on the long-term behavior of solutions, and we identify the conditions under which the solutions of the Cauchy problem associated with this equation is bounded globally in time in the energy space. We also explore the dynamical behavior of standing wave solutions. Therefore, we first numerically generate standing wave solutions of nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation by using the Petviashvili's iteration method and their stability is investigated by the split-step Fourier method. This equation also has a two-parameter family of standing wave solutions. In a second step, we meticulously concern with the construction and stability of a two-parameter family of standing wave solutions numerically. Finally, we investigate the semi-classical limit of the nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in both focusing and defocusing cases.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{L}^p$-based Sobolev theory for PDEs on closed manifolds of class $C^m$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\mathrm{L}^p$-based ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$) well-posedness and Sobolev regularity for appropriate weak formulations of the (stationary) Laplace--Beltrami, Bochner Laplace, tangent Stokes, and tangent Navier--Stokes problems on compact, connected $d$-dimensional manifolds without boundary of class $C^m$ ($m \geq 2$) embedded in $\mathrm{R}^{d+1}$, in terms of the regularity of the source terms and the manifold. Firstly, we localize and translate the Laplace--Beltrami problem into flat domains to establish $\mathrm{L}^p$-based ($2 \leq p &lt; \infty$) Sobolev regularity results as a consequence of the powerful Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund theory. From then onwards, our strategy is purely ``variational'', building upon the abstract functional analytic idea of ``duality'' and classical results such as the Banach--Ne\v{c}as--Babu\v{s}ka theorem and the generalized Babu\v{s}ka--Brezzi theory in reflexive Banach spaces to analyze and relate to each other different strong, weak and ultra-weak formulations for the aforementioned problems. In particular, by exploiting the lack of manifold boundary, we are able to decouple the velocity and the pressure unknowns in the tangent Stokes problem to establish their higher-regularity $\mathbf{W}^{k,p} \times \mathrm{W}^{k-1,p}$ ($k \geq 2$) as a consequence of the $\mathrm{L}^p$-based well-posedness and regularity theory for the Laplace--Beltrami and Bochner--Laplace operators. We finish this work by applying this newly derived regularity theory to: i) define and appropriate Stokes operator and study its spectral and regularity properties, ii) establish $\mathrm{L}^p$-based ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$) existence and well-posedness for the (stationary) tangent Oseen and Navier--Stokes equations via a Galerkin method and bootstrapping, and higher $\mathrm{L}^p$-based Sobolev regularity results. iii) transfer our regularity results to other choices of vector Laplace operators.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of weak solutions to the 3D Hall-MHD equations on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the non-uniqueness of weak solutions with non-trivial magnetic fields to the 3D Hall-MHD equations on the plane in the space $C^0_t L_x^2$ through the convex integration scheme and by constructing new errors and new intermittent flows. In particular, based on the construction of 3D intermittent flows, we obtain the $2\frac{1}{2}$D Mikado flows through a projection onto the plane. Moreover, we prove that the constructed weak solution do not conserve the magnetic helicity and find that weak solutions of the ideal Hall-MHD equations in $C^{\bar{\beta}}_{t,x}$ ($\bar{\beta}&gt;0$) are the strong vanishing viscosity and resistive limit of weak solutions to the Hall-MHD equations.</description>

      <title>Perturbation of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation by a localized nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the perturbative theory of infinite dimensional integrable systems developed by P. Deift and X. Zhou \cite{DZ-2}, aiming to provide new and simpler proofs of some key $L^\infty$ bounds and $L^p$ \emph{\textit{a priori}} estimates. Our proofs emphasizes a further step towards understanding focussing problems and extends the applicability to other integrable models. As a concrete application, we examine the perturbation of the one-dimensional defocussing cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation by a localized higher-order term. We introduce improved estimates to control the power of the perturbative term and demonstrate that the perturbed equation exhibits the same long-time behavior as the completely integrable nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Explicit solutions to Christoffel-Minkowski problems and Hessian equations under rotational symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An explicit solution to the Christoffel-Minkowski problem for convex bodies of revolution is presented. The conditions on the prescribed measure involve only first moments over spherical caps, and the support function of the resulting convex body is given by an explicit representation formula in terms of the measure. More generally, existence problems for mixed area measures are addressed. The approach relies on constructing explicit convex solutions to mixed Monge-Amp\`ere equations on $\mathbb{R}^n$ under the assumption of radial symmetry, with the conditions on the measure being expressed through its values on open balls. As a special case, the Dirichlet problem for $k$-Hessian equations on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is treated.</description>

      <title>BRIDGES Lectures: Flows of geometric structures, especially $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The BRIDGES meeting in gauge theory, extremal structures, and stability was held June 2024 at l'Institut d'\'Etudes Scientifiques de Carg\`ese in Corsica, organized by Daniele Faenzi, Eveline Legendre, Eric Loubeau, and Henrique S\'a Earp. The first week was a summer school consisting of four independent but related lecture series by Oscar Garc\'ia Prada, Spiro Karigiannis, Laurent Manivel, and Ruxandra Moraru. The present document consists of notes for the lecture series by Spiro Karigiannis on "Flows of geometric structures, especially $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures". Some assistance in the preparation of these notes by the author was provided by several participants of the summer school. See the Comments field for more information.
  The main theme is short time existence (STE) and uniqueness for geometric flows. We first introduce geometric structures on manifolds and geometric flows of such structures. We discuss some qualitative features of geometric flows, and consider the notions of strong and weak parabolicity. We focus on the Ricci flow, explaining carefully the DeTurck trick to establish short-time existence and uniqueness, an argument which we then extend to a general class of geometric flows of Riemannian metrics, previewing similar ideas for flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. Finally, we consider geometric flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. We review the basics of $\mathrm{G}_2$-geometry and survey several different geometric flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. In particular, we clarify in what sense STE results for the $\mathrm{G}_2$ Laplacian flow differ from STE results for other geometric flows. We conclude with a summary of some recent results by the author with Dwivedi and Gianniotis, including a classification of all possible heat-type flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures, and a sufficient condition for such a flow to admit STE and uniqueness by a modified DeTurck trick.</description>

      <title>Underdetermined-elliptic PDE on asymptotically Euclidean manifolds, and generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study underdetermined-elliptic linear partial differential operators $P$ on asymptotically Euclidean manifolds, such as the divergence operator on 1-forms or symmetric 2-tensors. Suitably interpreted, these are instances of (weighted) totally characteristic differential operators on a compact manifold with boundary whose principal symbols are surjective but not injective. We study the equation $P u=f$ when $f$ has a generalized Taylor expansion at $r=\infty$, that is, a full asymptotic expansion into terms with radial dependence $r^{-i z}(\log r)^k$ with $(z,k)\in\mathbb{C}\times\mathbb{N}_0$ up to rapidly decaying remainders. We construct a solution $u$ whose asymptotic behavior at $r=\infty$ is optimal in that the index set of exponents $(z,k)$ arising in its asymptotic expansion is as small as possible. On the flipside, we show that there is an infinite-dimensional nullspace of $P$ consisting of smooth tensors whose expansions at $r=\infty$ contain nonzero terms $r^{-i z}(\log r)^k$ for any desired index set of $(z,k)\in\mathbb{C}\times\mathbb{N}_0$.
  Applications include sharp solvability results for the divergence equation on 1-forms or symmetric 2-tensors on asymptotically Euclidean spaces, as well as a regularity improvement in a gluing construction for the constraint equations in general relativity recently introduced by the author.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the 1D Hou-Luo model on the real line admits exact self-similar finite-time blowup solutions with smooth self-similar profiles. The existence of these profiles is established via a fixed-point method that is purely analytic. We also prove that the profiles satisfy some monotonicity and convexity properties that were unknown before, and we give rigorous estimates on the algebraic decay rates of the profiles in the far field. Our result supplements the previous computer-assisted proof of self-similar finite-time blowup for the Hou-Luo model with finer characterizations of the profiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider second-order hyperbolic equations with rough time-independent coefficients. Our main result is that such equations are well posed on the Hardy spaces $\mathcal{H}^{s,1}_{FIO}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ and $\mathcal{H}^{s,\infty}_{FIO}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ for Fourier integral operators if the coefficients have $C^{1,1}\cap C^{r}$ regularity in space, for $r&gt;\frac{n+1}{2}$, where $s$ ranges over an $r$-dependent interval. As a corollary, we obtain the sharp fixed-time $\mathcal{H}^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ and $\mathrm{bmo}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ regularity for such equations, extending work by Seeger, Sogge and Stein in the case of smooth coefficients.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of prescribing Gaussian curvature and geodesic curvature in a compact surface with boundary with conical singularities and corners. Solutions are obtained using a new variational formulation, recently introduced for the regular counterpart of the problem and extended here to the singular case. As far as we know, this is the first result for the problem of prescribed curvatures in surfaces with singularities.</description>

      <title>Nadirashvili' Conjecture for Elliptic PDEs and its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the conjecture posed by Nadirashvili in 1997. It states that if a harmonic function has bounded nodal volume in the unit ball, then the supermum over the half-ball can be bounded by a finite sum of derivatives at the center. The main tool in this paper is the lower bound of nodal sets, which is first proved by Alexander Logunov. Also we combine the propagation of smallness property and elliptic estimates to give a positive answer to this conjecture. In fact, we can extend this conjecture to general elliptic PDEs with smooth coefficients and also obtain a weak verison for less regular coefficients. Finally, we give several applications of this conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We consider a system consisting of one conservation law and one balance law with a time-dependent source term, and provide a comprehensive analysis of Riemann solutions, including the non-classical overcompressive delta shocks. The minimal yet representative structure of the system captures essential features of transport under density constraints and, despite its simplicity, serves as a versatile prototype for crowd-limited transport processes across diverse contexts, including biological aggregation, ecological dispersal, granular compaction, and traffic congestion. In addition to non-self-similar solutions mentioned above, the associated Riemann problem admits solution structures that traverse vacuum states ($\rho = 0$) and the critical density threshold ($\rho = \bar{\rho}$), where mobility vanishes and characteristic speed degenerates. Moreover, the explicit time dependence in the source term leads to the breakdown of self-similarity, resulting in distinct Riemann solutions over successive time intervals and highlighting the dynamic nature of the solution landscape. The theoretical findings are numerically confirmed using the Local Lax-Friedrichs scheme.</description>

      <title>Weyl Law for Schr\"odinger Operators on Noncompact Manifolds, Heat Kernel, and Karamata-Hardy-Littlewood Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on our earlier work on heat kernel asymptotics for Schr\"odinger-type operators on noncompact manifolds, we establish both the classical and semiclassical Weyl laws for Schr\"odinger operators of the form $\Delta+V$ and $\hbar^2\Delta+V$ on complete noncompact manifolds. While the semiclassical law can be approached via localization, the classical Weyl law has remained widely expected but unproven in this generality. We impose a mild bounded integral oscillation condition on $ V $ in addition to the assumptions that $V$ diverges at infinity and satisfies a doubling condition. In this setting, our oscillation condition is sharp and strictly weaker than all previously known assumptions, even in the Euclidean case.
  A central novelty of our approach is an extended Karamata-Hardy-Littlewood Tauberian theorem, adapted to accommodate non-regularly varying spectral asymptotics in noncompact settings, together with its semiclassical analogue. These Tauberian tools allow us to derive both versions of Weyl's law within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Helmholtz boundary integral methods and the pollution effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22797</link>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with solving the Helmholtz exterior Dirichlet and Neumann problems with large wavenumber $k$ and smooth obstacles using the standard second-kind boundary integral equations (BIEs) for these problems. We consider Galerkin and collocation methods - with subspaces consisting of $\textit{either}$ piecewise polynomials (in 2-d for collocation, in any dimension for Galerkin) $\textit{or}$ trigonometric polynomials (in 2-d) - as well as a fully discrete quadrature (a.k.a., Nystr\"om) method based on trigonometric polynomials (in 2-d).
  For each of these methods, we address the fundamental question: how quickly must $N$, the dimension of the approximation space, grow with $k$ to maintain accuracy as $k\to\infty$?
  For the methods involving piecewise-polynomials, we give sufficient conditions for $k$-uniform quasi-optimality. For the Galerkin method we show that these conditions are, in fact, necessary and sufficient. In particular we prove that the Galerkin method $\textit{suffers from the pollution effect}$; i.e., $N$ growing like $k^{d-1}$ is often not sufficient for $k$-uniform quasi-optimality. For the Dirichlet BIEs, pollution occurs when the obstacle is trapping - and we also give numerical experiments illustrating this - but for the Neumann BIEs pollution occurs even when the obstacle is a ball.
  For all the methods involving trigonometric polynomials, we show that, up to potential factors of $k^\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, there is no pollution (even for trapping obstacles).
  These are the first results about $k$-explicit convergence of collocation or Nystr\"om methods applied to the Dirichlet BIEs, the first results about $k$-explicit convergence of any method used to solve the standard second-kind Neumann BIEs, and the first results proving that a boundary integral method applied to the Helmholtz equation suffers from the pollution effect.</description>
