      <title>A Review of Theory and Practical Considerations of Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) has emerged as a versatile and reliable diagnostic tool for measuring temperature, pressure, gas composition, and velocity in power generation and propulsion systems. This paper provides a comprehensive review of TDLAS principles and practical considerations for sensor design and implementation. The discussion begins with a mathematical introduction to the theory of gas absorption including: lineshape modeling and broadening mechanisms, quantitative measurements and challenges, and practical line selection rules. The analysis progresses to wavelength-modulation spectroscopy (WMS), highlighting its advantages in noise rejection and robustness in harsh environments. Furthermore, the calibration-free WMS model and the connection between WMS harmonics and lineshape derivatives is derived. Quantitative measurements through use of multiple harmonics is discussed and challenges surrounding measurement rate are presented. The end of the discussion focuses on practical aspects regarding the implementation of scanned-WMS sensors including laser characterization, background subtraction, and hardware debugging.</description>

      <title>Controlling Ultrafast Excitations in Germanium:The Role of Pump-Pulse Parameters and Multi-Photon Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the Dynamical Projective Operatorial Approach (DPOA) to investigate the ultrafast optical excitations of germanium under intense, ultrashort pump pulses. The method has very low resource demand relative to many other available approaches and enables detailed calculation of the residual electron and hole populations induced by the pump pulse. It provides direct access to the energy distribution of excited carriers and to the total energy transferred to the system. By decomposing the response into contributions from different multi-photon resonant processes, we systematically study the dependence of excited-carrier density and absorbed energy on key pump-pulse parameters: duration, amplitude, and photon energy. Our results reveal a complex interplay between these parameters, governed by resonant Rabi-like dynamics and competition between different multi-photon absorption channels. For the studied germanium setup, we find that two-photon processes are generally dominant, while one- and three-photon channels become significant under specific conditions of pump-pulse frequency, duration, and intensity. This comprehensive analysis offers practical insights for optimizing ultrafast optical control in semiconductors by targeting specific multi-photon pathways.</description>

      <title>Microscale selective laser sintering of Cu nanoparticles with a short-wavelength nanosecond laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscale additive manufacturing of reflective copper is becoming increasingly important for microelectronics and microcomputers, due to its excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. Yet, it remains challenging for state-of-the-art commercial metal 3D printers to achieve sub-100-micron manufacturing. Two aspects are sub-optimal using commercial laser powder bed fusion systems with infrared (IR) lasers (wavelength of 1060-1070 nm): (1) IR laser has a low absorption rate for Cu, which is energy-inefficient for manufacturing; (2) short wavelength lasers can potentially offer higher resolution processing due to the diffraction-limited processing. On the other hand, laser sintering or melting typically uses continuous wave (CW) lasers, which may reduce the manufacturing resolution due to a large heat-affected zone. Based on these facts, this study investigates the UV (wavelength of 355 nm) nanosecond (ns) laser sintering of Cu nanoparticles. Different laser processing parameters, as well as different nanoparticle packing densities, are studied. Our results show that a short-wavelength laser can reduce the required energy for sintering with decent morphology, and a densified nanoparticle powder bed favors continuous melting. We further show that sub-20 micron printing can be readily achieved with a UV ns laser. These findings provide new insights into short-wavelength laser-metal nanoparticle interactions, which may pave the way to achieve high-resolution micro and nano-scale additive manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Sub-nanometer 3D morphometric precision of polarisation-resolved wide-field optical extinction microscopy determines the roundness of individual gold nanospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative polarisation-resolved optical extinction microscopy of individual plasmonic nanoparticles has recently been introduced as a powerful tool to characterise the nanoparticle's morphology with a precision comparable to electron microscopy, while using a simple optical microscope [Nanoscale 12, 16215 (2020)]. Here we extend the technique by adding measurements for radial polarisation in the condenser back focal plane, probing plasmonic resonances polarised in axial direction. The combined linear and radial polarisation measurements provide a significantly enhanced precision of the retrieved 3D morphology, as we show on defect-free ultra-uniform gold nanospheres of 30 nm nominal diameter characterised by transmission electron microscopy. The measured cross-sections are quantitatively described by an ellipsoid model, determining the three semi-axes and rotation angles by fitting the measurements. Evaluation the distribution of the fit error across the set of measured particles, the material permittivity dataset and surface damping parameter g providing the best fit are found to be the single crystal dataset by Olmon et al. [Phys. Rev. B 86, 235147 (2012)] and g = 1.8, respectively. The precision of the retrieved aspect ratio is below 5%, and all three ellipsoidal semi-axes are determined with an impressive precision of 0.25 nm. Notably, corrections to the Rayleigh-Gans ellipsoid model due to retardation are significant even though the particle diameters are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the wavelength, and taking them into account improves the accuracy to below a nanometer.</description>

      <title>Line lasing in a two-dimensional lattice of orbital photonic resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The engineering of specialty lasers with unconventional mode structures is one of the modern challenges in the development of integrated coherent sources. Examples include the use of bound states in the continuum, microlasers with orbital angular momentum, Dirac-band lasers and topological lasers. In this work we engineer a two-dimensional lattice of coupled micropillars with lasing line modes. We use a convenient combination of orbital photonic modes to design photonic bands which are flat in one direction and dispersive in the perpendicular one giving rise to line lasing modes. Such an architecture opens the possibility of implementing densely packed lasing matrices in compact two dimensional lattices.</description>

      <title>A Segmented Heater-Driven, Low-Loss, Reconfigurable Photonic Phase-Change Material-Based Phase Shifter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-change material (PCM)-based non-volatile multilevel phase shifters are key components in photonic integrated circuits. Electrically, multiple phase levels can be encoded by controlling the heater power and employing different microheater architectures to induce varying degrees of PCM amorphization. However, encoding a large number of levels is not straightforward. In this work, we first investigate a phase shifter structure based on a GeSe PCM integrated on top of a silicon-on-insulator waveguide, employing a simple rectangular-shaped heater under pulse-width modulation (PWM). We numerically demonstrate that multilevel phase shifts can be achieved because of non-uniform heating in the GeSe PCM layer. However, the resulting phase levels for this basic configuration are highly non-linear because of the uniform power dissipation along the light propagation direction characterized by the same cross-section. To overcome this limitation, we designed a novel PCM-based phase shifter with a segmented heater whose width gradually increases along the light propagation direction. This configuration enables the encoding of hundreds of well-spaced phase levels between 0 and $\pi$, facilitated by smoother amorphization arising from the combined effects of non-uniform heating across segments and within each segment, while achieving an insertion loss of only 0.6 dB in the worst case. Furthermore, when evaluating both heater architectures under pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) at a fixed pulse duration, we observe behavior consistent with the trends observed for PWM, confirming the superior performance of the segmented heater design.</description>

      <title>Simulation Driven Design of a Multilayer Plasmonic Sensor Using Cu Ni and BaTiO3 for Waterborne Pathogen Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simulation guided design for a multilayer surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based biosensor capable of detecting refractive index changes in a target induced by analytes. Surface plasmons are excited using a hybrid Kretschmann configuration with a calcium fluoride (CaF2) prism under transverse magnetic polarization illumination. In the sensing architecture, copper (Cu) serves as the plasmonic metal and is overlaid with a thin nickel (Ni) layer to prevent oxidation. To enhance analyte coupling and electromagnetic field confinement, a dielectric layer of barium titanium oxide (BaTiO3) along with a monolayer of graphene oxide (GO) is incorporated. The multilayer structure is iteratively optimized using the transfer matrix method for angular interrogation at a wavelength of 1064 nm, focusing on key performance parameters such as sensitivity, minimum reflectivity, and figure of merit (FOM). Finite element method based simulations confirm efficient surface plasmon excitation, with optimal layer thicknesses of 30 nm for Cu and 5 nm for BaTiO3. The proposed SPR based sensor (CaF2 Cu Ni BaTiO3 GO) achieves a sensitivity of 157.8 deg per RIU and a figure of merit of 17.48 RIU minus one while detecting the presence of Escherichia coli bacteria in water, demonstrating its potential for waterborne pathogen sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Visualizing and Optimizing Phase Matching in Nonlinear Guided-mode Resonators with the Green's Function Integral Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient nonlinear frequency conversion in nanophotonics requires not only strong fundamental field but also precise phase matching among distributed nonlinear sources. Here, we develop the two-dimensional Green's function integral method (GFIM), which enables direct visualization and optimization of phase matching in nonlinear guided-mode resonators. Using GFIM phase analysis, we generalize the phase-matching factor (PMF) as a rigorous metric of spatial phase coherence in harmonic generation, revealing severe phase mismatch in conventional guide mode resonators. Guided by phase-matching profiles, we propose design strategies to improve the phase coherence, particularly by introducing a high-index waveguide layer that confines the fundamental field in the nonlinear material to regions where the harmonic Green's function varies slowly. This configuration achieves a PMF exceeding 0.91, approaching the ideal value of unity, and yields a record SHG efficiency of 26.7% at a low pump intensity of 2 kW/$\mathrm{cm}^2$. These results establish the GFIM-based phase-matching visualization as an effective strategy for compact, high-performance nonlinear photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Near-field-driven Radiative Thermal Dynamics in Aperiodic Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing structural correlations in near-field plasmonic and polaritonic systems hold untapped potential for controlling light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. By tuning these correlations, one can reshape mode localization, coupling, and spectral distribution which are properties central to manipulating energy transport and field enhancement in nanophotonic platforms. We exploit Vogel spirals, an aperiodic geometry where a single parameter dictates spatial correlations, to show how correlation strength reshapes the modal spectrum and transient dynamics of near-field coupling. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that aperiodic configurations outperform both uncorrelated (random) and periodic arrays in controlling near-field radiative heat-transfer dynamics. These results establish deterministic aperiodic order as a powerful platform for tailoring correlated electromagnetic responses in next-generation nanophotonic devices.</description>

      <title>A fast, large-scale optimal transport algorithm for holographic beam shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal transport methods have recently established state of the art accuracy and efficiency for holographic laser beam shaping. However, use of such methods is hindered by severe $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ memory and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ time requirements for large scale input or output images with $N$ total pixels. Here we leverage the dual formulation of the optimal transport problem and the separable structure of the cost to implement algorithms with greatly reduced $\mathcal{O}(N)$ memory and $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N^{3/2})$ time complexity. These algorithms are parallelizable and can solve megapixel-scale beam shaping problems in tens of seconds on a CPU or seconds on a GPU.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Photonic Switching in GST-467 for Deep Neural Network Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-change materials (PCMs) have emerged as key enablers of non-volatile, ultra-compact photonic switches for energy-efficient deep neural network (DNN) applications. In this work, we investigate the recently discovered $\mathrm{Ge_{4}Sb_{6}Te_{7}}$ (GST-467) as a high-contrast optical PCM and demonstrate its suitability for multi-level photonic computing. The complex refractive indices of amorphous and crystalline GST-467 were experimentally extracted and used to propose a segmented silicon-on-insulator photonic switch optimized at 1550 nm. Three-dimensional FDTD simulations reveal that segmentation significantly enhances the extinction ratio while maintaining low insertion loss, resulting in a more than seven times higher design figure of merit than an unsegmented design. Laser-induced thermo-optical simulations further establish efficient, reversible switching with sub-nJ energy requirements for crystallization and amorphization. Compared with established GST, GSST, and GSS compositions, GST-467 provides the largest transmission contrast and supports up to 48 resolvable optical states. When deployed as multi-level weights in photonic DNN architectures, the GST-467 switch achieves superior classification accuracy on EMNIST and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks. These results position GST-467 as a highly promising PCM for scalable, low-energy photonic computing and neuromorphic hardware.</description>

      <title>Optical design and characterization of a multi-depth vision simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a vision simulator device (Katsim), a compact near-eye optical display designed for assessing postoperative corrected vision, preoperative intraocular lens (IOL) assessment, and objective IOL characterization. The system forms a virtual image using an amplitude-modulated LCoS spatial light modulator (AM-SLM), RGB LED illumination, and a high-speed varifocal lens. In the proposed architecture, the LED illumination and varifocal lens diopter changes are triggered in synchrony with the SLM RGB subframes, rendering three depth planes perceptually simultaneously via high-frequency time-multiplexing. Operating at 60 frames per second (fps), the system achieves an effective 180 Hz depth-coded cycle, enabling sharp, multi-depth rendering within a dynamically adjustable depth range from 0.2 m to optical infinity. The system's eyebox is configurable from 1 to 5 mm, while maintaining a fixed spatial location and preserving angular magnification regardless of changes in focus or eyebox size. The designed system features a 9.15-degree field of view. An integrated infrared pupil-tracking module detects non-cataractous regions of the cataractous crystalline lens, and the projected imagery is mechanically steered through those clear zones in real time. The proposed vision simulator supports both subjective simulation of post-surgical vision for patient-specific counseling and objective optical evaluation of IOLs, including resolution and contrast fidelity (e.g., modulation transfer function, contrast transfer function, and defocus curves). By decoupling depth modulation from eyebox position and size, the system offers a modular, portable platform that supports enhanced preoperative planning, personalized IOL selection, objective IOL characterization, and use as a novel research vision tool.</description>

      <title>Photonic Spiking Graph Neural Network for Energy-Efficient Structured Data Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic computing shows great potential for signal processing and artificial intelligence (AI) acceleration due to its ultra-high speed, low energy consumption, and inherent parallelism. Existing photonic computing research has mainly focused on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fully connected neural networks (FCNNs), which are well suited for tasks such as image classification and object detection but face limitations in handling graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are specifically designed to model complex relational structures. In this work, we propose a photonic spiking graph neural network (PSGNN) architecture that integrates the structural modeling capability of GNNs, the temporal dynamics of spiking neurons, and the parallel computing advantages of photonic hardware. Through hardware-software co-optimization, a bias-term simulation method tailored for photonic chips is implemented using feature-dimension expansion, enabling effective network training. Experiments on the KarateClub and PubMed datasets achieve training accuracies of 100 percent (92 +/- 2 percent) and test accuracies of 97 percent (90 +/- 1 percent). A silicon photonics 4 x 4 Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) array is further constructed for hardware validation, achieving a test accuracy of 93 percent. The system demonstrates an inference latency of 97 ps, with an energy efficiency of 280 GOPS/W and a computational density of 52 GOPS/mm^2. These results highlight the potential of PSGNN for structured-data processing applications.</description>

Abstract: Thermal-radiation detectors such as bolometers -- often found as thin, suspended films -- are intrinsically limited by their optical absorption properties and by their intrinsic thermal conductive and radiative losses. We analyze the impact of the photon energy exchange between the film and a substrate located close to each other, noticing that the associated near-field exchange has been overlooked and could reduce the detectivity. In addition, we study how the nanometric thickness of the suspended film and its material impact the detectivity of such sensors. It is found that the blackbody-related photon noise limit of the detectivity can be surpassed with thin films. These results emphasize pathways for improvements of thermal-radiation detectors.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient multi-chromatic Raman microlasers from cavity polygon modes on thin-film lithium niobate platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and second order nonlinearity in non-centrosymmetric photonic microresonators presents a highly promising solution for developing on-chip coherent light sources with exceptional bandwidth and flexible tunability. Our study introduces an innovative methodology leveraging cavity polygon modes within an X-cut thin-film lithium niobate microdisk to achieve highly efficient multi-chromatic Raman microlasers. Specifically, high-Q square modes characterized by two parallel sides oriented perpendicularly relative to the optical axis of lithium niobate crystal were excited. These modes offer distinct advantages, including enhancing both mode-field overlap and improved phase matching, achieved through the utilization of the largest second-order susceptibility component (d_33), which is critical for Raman-quadratic nonlinear interactions. The experimental results highlight significant advancements in multi-wavelength multi-wavelength laser generation, with forward stimulated Raman laser signals exhibiting a high conversion efficiency of up to 65.02% and an impressively narrow integral linewidth of only 5.2 kHz. Simultaneously, our system enables the generation of multi-wavelength Raman-quadratic laser signals across the ~800 nm and ~530 nm spectral bands. These findings are further underscored by an impressive absolute conversion efficiency of 1.33% for the 797.4-nm Raman laser, achieved at a remarkably low pump power of just 1.07 mW. This work not only extends the application scope of cavity polygon modes from single second/third-order nonlinear optical processes to cascaded processes but also establishes a foundation for realizing high-efficiency on-chip multi-chromatic laser sources with versatile functionalities.</description>

      <title>Optical parametric free-electron--photon quantum interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical parametric processes underpin quantum photonics, while free-electron--photon interactions offer agile pathways to generate nontrivial quantum photonic states. These threads have so far largely progressed independently, whereas placing free electrons in a driven nonlinear system can potentially activate coherent parametric interaction channels for joint state engineering of both types of particles. Here we unify these paradigms by developing a general theoretical framework for parametric free-electron--photon interactions in a nonlinear optical system driven by degenerate parametric down-conversion. Unlike free electrons in a linear bath, here they can couple to Bogoliubov quasiparticles through two detuned phase-matching channels, where the parametric process and free-electron interactions can quantum amplify each other. Seeding the interaction with squeezed vacuum yields gain-only or loss-only electron energy spectra, and enables electron-heralded squeezed Fock states; with bare vacuum, postselecting electron energy sidebands generates high-fidelity Schr\"odinger cat states. Our results show how optical parametric interactions can quantum shape free electrons and photons, potentially enabling a quantum parametric dielectric laser accelerator that mitigates the need for temporal phase synchronization, thereby allowing acceleration probabilities to approach unity even for phase-random electrons.</description>

      <title>A deterministic approach for integrating an emitter in a nanocavity with subwavelength light confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel light-matter interface that integrates a nanoscale buried heterostructure emitter into a dielectric bowtie cavity, co-localising the optical hotspot and the electronic wavefunction. This platform enables strong light-matter interaction through deep subwavelength confinement while remaining compatible with scalable fabrication. We show that in this regime an explicit treatment of the emitter's spatial extent is required, and that a confinement-factor approximation more accurately predicts the coupling, revealing design rules inaccessible to dipole-based metrics. For an InP/InGaAsP system, we predict coupling strengths of 0.4-0.7 meV for gap sizes of 50-10 nm, establishing the buried heterostructure-bowtie architecture as a practical route to deterministic strong coupling in solid-state nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Sculpting ultrafast mid-infrared light for solid-state high harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to sculpt light in space, time, and polarization has revolutionized studies of light-matter interaction and enabled breakthroughs in optical communication, imaging, and ultrafast science. Among the many degrees of freedom of light, orbital angular momentum (OAM) further expands these capabilities by unlocking new regimes of control in information encoding, particle manipulation, and symmetry-driven selection rules. However, exploiting OAM to drive nonlinear, non-perturbative effects in solids remains challenging, especially in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral regime, a key region for accessing these effects in ambient air, where spatial light modulators do not operate. Here, we circumvent this limitation by generating femtosecond, few-cycle MIR Bessel-Gauss vortex (BGV) and Perfect optical vortices (POVs), using a robust, static spatial-shaping strategy. Using those beams to drive the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process in solids, we show that the resulting harmonic beams faithfully inherit the structural properties of the drivers: the constant-intensity ring of the POV is preserved across harmonic orders, while the harmonic BGVs retain their intrinsic TC-dependent profiles. Furthermore, by verifying the OAM up-scaling law, we confirm OAM conservation during HHG in solids. These results establish strong-field HHG in solids as a robust platform for synthesizing ultrafast structured harmonic light with controllable, high-value OAM.</description>

      <title>Hair-thin confocal fluorescence endo-microscopy for deep-brain in-vivo imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confocal and multi-photon microscopy are widely used for in-vivo fluorescence imaging of biological tissues such as the brain, offering non-invasive access up to ~1 mm depth without major loss in performance. A recently-developed alternative is holographic endoscopy, which exploits controlled light transport through hair-thin optical fibres. With minimal invasiveness, it provides observations at comparable spatial resolution, while extending its applicability to unprecedented depths. It has been used to resolve details of sub-cellular structural connectivity, record neuronal signalling, and monitor blood flow from the deepest locations of the living brain. Yet, its use, particularly in densely labelled brain regions, has so far been constrained by significant contrast loss, primarily due to the absence of a practical mechanism for rejecting out-of-focus fluorescence light -- a capability inherently provided by confocal and multi-photon microscopy. Exploring opportunities in the structure of light modes of different MMF types we identify the possibility of achieving an analogue to confocal fluorescence microscopy through MMF-based endoscopes. Using a novel composite fibre probe that combines graded-index and step-index MMFs, we enable spatially resolved signal collection and selective rejection of out-of-focus light. This confocal filtering significantly enhances image contrast and resolution by suppressing background and off-plane signals. We demonstrate improved imaging performance on fine structural connectivity and intracellular calcium signalling in living mouse brain.</description>

      <title>Gap-free Information Transfer in 4D-STEM via Fusion of Complementary Scattering Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19460v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear phase-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques compatible with high-throughput 4D-STEM acquisition are widely used to enhance phase contrast in weakly scattering and beam-sensitive materials. In these modalities, contrast transfer is often suppressed at low spatial frequencies, resulting in a characteristic contrast gap that limits quantitative imaging. Approaches that retain low-frequency phase contrast exist but typically require substantially increased experimental complexity, restricting routine use. Dark-field STEM imaging captures this missing low-frequency information through electrons scattered outside the bright-field disk, but discards a large fraction of the scattered signal and is therefore dose-inefficient. Fused Full-field STEM (FF-STEM) is introduced as a 4D-STEM imaging modality that overcomes this limitation by combining ptychographic phase reconstruction with tilt-corrected dark-field imaging within a single acquisition. Bright-field data are used to estimate probe aberrations and reconstruct a high-resolution phase image, while dark-field data provide complementary low-frequency contrast. The two channels are optimally fused in Fourier space using minimum-variance weighting based on the spectral signal-to-noise ratio, yielding transfer-gap-free images with high contrast and quantitative fidelity. FF-STEM preserves the upsampling and depth-sectioning capabilities of ptychography, adds robust low-frequency contrast characteristic of dark-field imaging, and enables dose-efficient, near-real-time reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Gold-polymer hybrid metasurface for polarization-independent enhanced third harmonic generation in the ultraviolet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of nonlinear light-matter interactions in a three-dimensional gold-polymer hybrid metasurface. In contrast to conventional two-dimensional designs, which by symmetry may support either transverse electric (TE) or transverse magnetic (TM) polarization, our volumetric architecture accepts both TE and TM modes simultaneously, reflecting the dimensionality and versatility required by the photonic devices. The metasurface comprises a periodic lattice of gold nanostructures embedded in a dielectric polymer matrix, creating complex metal-dielectric interfaces that sustain tightly confined plasmonic resonances. When driven by ultrafast near-infrared pulses, these resonances concentrate optical energy at the nanoscale, enabling efficient third-harmonic generation and upconversion of visible light into the ultraviolet (UV) and deep-UV regimes with enhanced conversion efficiency. We perform spatial and temporal mapping of the nonlinear response under both TE and TM excitation. Our measurements reveal polarization-agnostic field enhancement and spectral tunability arising from the three-dimensional morphology-capabilities unattainable in planar metasurfaces, where two-dimensional symmetry inherently limits polarization flexibility and functional bandwidth. This 3D platform provides a flexible design toolbox for polarization-independent UV and deep-UV light sources. Potential applications include high-resolution UV spectroscopy, optical multiplexing, data storage, and emerging quantum photonic architectures. By establishing fundamental insights into three-dimensional nonlinear metasurface behavior, our work paves the way for next-generation reconfigurable, multi-polarization nanophotonic devices.</description>

      <title>Active Convolved Illumination with Deep Transfer Learning for Complex Beam Transmission through Atmospheric Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence imposes a fundamental limitation across a broad range of applications, including optical imaging, remote sensing, and free-space optical communication. Recent advances in adaptive optics, wavefront shaping, and machine learning, driven by synergistic progress in fundamental theories, optoelectronic hardware, and computational algorithms, have demonstrated substantial potential in mitigating turbulence-induced distortions. Recently, active convolved illumination (ACI) was proposed as a versatile and physics-driven technique for transmitting structured light beams with minimal distortion through highly challenging turbulent regimes. While distinct in its formulation, ACI shares conceptual similarities with other physics-driven distortion correction approaches and stands to benefit from complementary integration with data-driven deep learning (DL) models. Inspired by recent work coupling deep learning with traditional turbulence mitigation strategies, the present work investigates the feasibility of integrating ACI with neural network-based methods. We outline a conceptual framework for coupling ACI with data-driven models and identify conditions under which learned representations can meaningfully support ACI's correlation-injection mechanism. As a representative example, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) together with a transfer-learning approach to examine how a learned model may operate in tandem with ACI. This exploratory study demonstrates feasible implementation pathways and establishes an early foundation for assessing the potential of future ACI-DL hybrid architectures, representing a step toward evaluating broader synergistic interactions between ACI and modern DL models.</description>

Abstract: In a previous paper, we proposed a unique physically implemented type simulator for combinatorial optimization problems, called the spontaneous symmetry breaking machine (SSBM). In this paper, we first report the results of experimental verification of SSBM using a small-scale benchmark system, and then describe numerical simulations using the benchmark problems (K2000) conducted to confirm its usefulness for large-scale problems. From 1000 samples with different initial fluctuations, it became clear that SSBM can explore a single extremely stable state. This is based on the principle of a phenomenon used in SSBM, and could be a notable advantage over other simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the optimization of epsilon-security parameters in quantum key distribution (QKD), aiming to improve the achievable secure key rate under a fixed overall composable security level. For this purpose, we employ a continuous genetic algorithm (CGA) to optimize the epsilon-security components of two representative protocols: the homodyne protocol from the continuous-variable (CV) family and the BB84 protocol from the discrete-variable (DV) family. We detail the CGA configuration, summarize the derivation of the composable key rate, and emphasize the role of the epsilon-parameters in both protocols. We then compare key rates obtained with optimized epsilon-values against those derived from standard and randomized choices. Our results demonstrate substantial key rate improvements at high security levels, where the key rate typically vanishes, and uncover positive-rate regimes that are inaccessible without optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmons in atomically thin materials offer a compelling route to trigger nonlinear light-matter interactions through extreme optical confinement in the two-dimensional (2D) limit. However, optical nonlocality in plasmons is typically associated with losses in the linear response regime. Here, we show that nonlocal effects mediate strong plasmon-assisted optical nonlinearity in electrically reconfigurable 2D heterostructures. Using atomistic simulations that capture quantum finite-size and nonlocal effects in the nonlinear plasmonic response of graphene and phosphorene nanoribbon dimers, we reveal how symmetry and inter-ribbon coupling shape harmonic generation processes in perturbative and high-harmonic regimes. Independent tuning of geometry and carrier density in nanoribbon heterostructures is shown to induce inter-ribbon plasmon hybridization, impacting inversion symmetry governing even-ordered nonlinear processes like second-harmonic generation. These results reveal design principles for active and passive tuning of nonlinear plasmonic effects and enable selective enhancement of specific harmonic processes, establishing 2D heterostructures as a versatile platform for nonlinear nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>The energy-speed relationship of quantum particles challenges Bohmian mechanics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Sharoglazova et al. claimed to have proven a violation of the basic tenet of Bohmian mechanics, namely the phase-speed relation $\vec{v}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{\hbar}{m}\vec{\nabla}S(\vec{r},t)$. Here, $S(\vec{r},t)$ is the (real) phase of the wave function $\psi(\vec{r},t)=\rho^{\frac{1}{2}}(\vec{r},t)e^{iS(\vec{r},t)}$. In a nutshell, they have measured the speed of a claimed evanescent wave, which is real and therefore must have $\vec{\nabla}S=\vec{0}$. However, Fig. 2 clearly shows a density motion from one waveguide to the other, implying a nonzero density current, $\vec{j}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{\hbar}{2mi}\Im(\psi^*\vec{\nabla}\psi)$. If we combine this evidence with the mathematical identity $\vec{\nabla}S=\frac{m}{\rho}\vec{j}$, we should instead conclude that $\vec{\nabla}S\neq\vec{0}$. So, where does this apparent inconsistency come from?</description>

      <title>Reactive near-field subwavelength microwave imaging with a non-invasive Rydberg probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-invasive microwave field imaging--accurately mapping field distributions without perturbing them--is essential in areas such as aerospace engineering, biomedical imaging and integrated-circuit diagnostics. Conventional metal probes, however, inevitably perturb reactive near fields: they act as strong scatterers that drive induced currents and secondary radiation, remap evanescent components and thereby degrade both accuracy and spatial resolution, particularly in the reactive near-field regime that is most relevant to these applications. Here we demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, reactive near-field subwavelength imaging of microwave fields using the quantum non-demolition properties of Rydberg atoms, realized with a compact, non-invasive single-ended fibre-integrated Rydberg probe engineered to minimize field disturbance. The probe achieves an imaging resolution of {\unboldmath$\lambda/56$}, and the measured field distributions agree with full-wave simulations with structural similarity approaching unity, confirming both its subwavelength spatial resolution and its genuinely non-invasive character compared with conventional metal-based probes. Because the atomic sensor is intrinsically isotropic, the same device can faithfully image multi-dimensional field structures without orientation-dependent calibration. Our results therefore establish a general, non-invasive route to high-accuracy, subwavelength reactive near-field microwave imaging, with particular promise for applications such as chip-defect detection and integrated-circuit diagnostics, where even small perturbations by the probe can mask the underlying physics of interest.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a method for determining the sensitivity of any given Entangled Two-Photon Absorption (ETPA) measurement. By modeling all signal and noise contributions to the measurement, we derive a single numerical value that describes the sensitivity of the ETPA measurement in G\"oppert-Mayer units. This allows us to directly compare vastly different experimental approaches and, determine whether ETPA will be detectable under the given conditions. Therefore, we can quantify the effect of any change to a given experimental apparatus and identify the ideal optimization pathway.</description>

      <title>Precise control of high-frequency ultrasounds in thin crystals for the development of tunable narrowband and directional gamma-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a complete methodology for the precise characterization of the acoustic field inside crystal-based devices driven by high-frequency ultrasounds towards the generation of tunable narrowband and directional gamma radiation via undulation of ultra-relativistic charged particles. Such gamma-ray sources have long been anticipated by the scientific community, as they promise new powerful tools for the study of high-energy physical phenomena and the development of novel nuclear technologies. In such devices, a piezoelectric transducer induces tens of MHz harmonic waves inside a silicon monocrystal. Ultra-relativistic charged particles traversing the crystal get trapped within the channels formed by the extremely strong electric fields of the acoustically modulated lattice planes, undergoing undulation and emitting gamma radiation. Precise characterization of the acoustic field in the crystal is crucial for the determination of the expected characteristics of the secondarily generated gamma rays. For this purpose, fast laser refraction imaging is used here to image the acoustic waves by exploiting the spatial redistribution of a laser beam optical intensity caused by the acoustic field. A dedicated computational model is developed for the estimation of the spatial distribution of the pressure and lattice deformation inside the crystal. This methodology provides a framework for future novel gamma-ray sources in high-energy facilities.</description>

      <title>Quantum Imaging of Birefringent Samples using Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-photon interference in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer can be used as a quantum sensing mechanism due to the sensitivity of the interference dip to perturbations of the photon indistinguishability. In particular, recent works have generalized this concept to microscopy setups, but the sensitivity to optical path differences constrains its application to samples with thickness variation typically below a few micrometers if tracking changes in the coincidences at a fixed delay. Extending the concept to polarization microscopy and circumventing this limitation, this manuscript explores the use of a narrowband photon pair source with coherence length &gt;1 mm to broaden the HOM dip. Thus, realistic sample-thickness variations introduce negligible temporal distinguishability, and changes in coincidence rate at the dip centre are then dominated by sample-induced polarization effects. To compute the polarization rotation, we develop a statistical model for the interferometer, derive the Fisher information, and establish a maximum-likelihood estimator for the local fast-axis angle. Recording dip and baseline frames at each sample position via raster scanning, the experimental results validate the framework, agreeing with classical polarized-intensity images while demonstrating operation at a maximum-precision regime and insensitiveness to layer thickness. Overall, the approach enclosed provides a quantum-based quantitative imaging of birefringent structures, which can motivate further advantageous applications, including enhanced signal-to-noise ratio and lower damage imaging of photosensitive samples.</description>

      <title>WaveOrder: A differentiable wave-optical framework for scalable biological microscopy with diverse modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlative computational microscopy can accelerate imaging and modeling of cellular dynamics by relaxing trade-offs inherent to dynamic imaging. Existing computational microscopy frameworks are either specialized or overly generic, limiting use to fixed configurations or domain experts. We introduce WaveOrder, a generalist wave-optical framework for imaging the architectural order of biomolecules. WaveOrder reconstructs diverse specimen properties from multi-channel acquisitions, with or without fluorescence. It provides a unified representation of linear optical properties and differentiable physics-based image formation models spanning widefield, confocal, light-sheet, and oblique label-free geometries. WaveOrder uses physics-informed ML to auto-tune model parameters and solve blind shift-variant restoration problems. This open-source, PyTorch-based framework enables scalable quantitative imaging across scales from organelles to adult zebrafish, and improves restoration of cellular structures in high-throughput experiments. We validate WaveOrder on diverse imaging applications, demonstrating its ability to recover biomolecular structure beyond the limits of existing approaches.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the band structure and the dynamics of topological singularities of magneto-optical Moir\'e bound states in the continuum (BICs), which originate from two overlapped conventional magneto-optical BIC gratings with mismatched periods. We show that breaking time-reversal symmetry by applying an external magnetic field in different directions can effectively manipulate the Moir\'e BICs' topological singularities, which exhibit a high Q factor throughout the momentum space.</description>

      <title>Chiral superfluorescence from perovskite superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superfluorescence (SF) is the collective emission of intense, coherent light from an interacting ensemble of quantum emitters1-4. While SF has been observed in several solid-state materials5-8, the spontaneous generation of circularly polarized SF from chiral materials (chiral SF) has not been realized9,10. Here, we report the first observation of chiral SF originating from edge states in large-area (&gt;100 um * 100 um) vertically aligned chiral perovskite superlattices at room-temperature. Theoretical quantum optics calculations describe the transition from initially unpolarized, incoherent spontaneous emission to a coherent chiral SF state, quantitatively reproducing both the experimentally observed generation of circular polarization (up to ~14%) and its reversal in sign with opposite material handedness. Moreover, we show that both the intensity and the degree of circular polarization of chiral SF can be modulated by a weak magnetic field, enabling precise control over solid-state quantum light emission at room temperature. Our findings demonstrate an interplay between chirality and many-body quantum coherence, thereby revealing promising new directions for chirality-controlled quantum-optical applications.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically analyze the nonlinear dynamics and routes to chaos in a multimode vertical cavity surface-emitting laser (MM-VCSEL) in free-running operation. Including higher order transverse modes (TMs) results in additional bifurcations at higher currents not found for single-mode VCSELs (SM-VCSELs). The resulting dynamics involve competition between modes with different transverse profiles and polarization and show good qualitative agreement with recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Wave Generation in Two-Dimensional MXenes under Femtosecond Pulsed Laser Illumination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient generation of terahertz (THz) waves in two-dimensional (2D) MXene layers driven by near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses is demonstrated through predictive simulations. Employing a novel hydrodynamic model that self-consistently captures nonlinearities from electric, magnetic, and convective interactions with a minimal set of material parameters. The coupled hydrodynamic-Maxwell equations are solved via finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods to resolve the spatiotemporal dynamics of laser-induced carriers and THz emission. The results reveal strong, tunable THz output dependent on laser (intensity, polarization, incidence angle), material (composition, carrier density, temperature), and struc-tural (layer thickness, substrate) parameters. These predictions offer verifiable guidelines for experiments and position MXenes as versatile platforms for compact, broadband THz sources in on-chip photonics and 6G communications. This work establishes a robust, self-contained framework for modeling ultrafast nonlinear optics in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal decomposition of unitary matrices using phase masks and the discrete Fourier transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal multiport interferometers (UMIs) have emerged as a key tool for performing arbitrary linear transformations on optical modes, enabling precise control over the state of light in essential applications of classical and quantum information processing such as neural networks and boson sampling. While UMI architectures based on Mach-Zehnder interferometer networks are well established, alternative approaches that involve interleaving fixed multichannel mixing layers and phase masks have recently gained interest due to their high robustness to losses and fabrication errors. However, these approaches currently lack optimal analytical methods to compute design parameters with low optical depth. In this work, we introduce a constructive decomposition of unitary matrices using a sequence of $2N+5$ phase masks interleaved with $2N+4$ discrete Fourier transform matrices. This decomposition can be leveraged to design universal interferometers based on phase masks and multimode interference couplers, implementing a discrete Fourier transform, offering an analytical alternative to conventional numerical optimization-based designs and reducing by a factor of 3 the previous best known analytical methods.</description>

      <title>Third Harmonic Upconverted Full-Stokes Imaging with High-Efficiency Germanium Metasurface from MWIR to SWIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dielectric resonant metasurfaces can be utilized for efficient high harmonic generation, which has been explored here in this effort for a high-efficient Germanium metasurface for upconverted full-Stokes imaging at 1.33-micron wavelength by the third harmonic generation (THG) from the 4-micron fundamental wavelength. The internal TH conversion efficiency for the Ge film is about 1x10-5 % to 5.6x10-3 % and for the Ge-metasurface 1.5x10-4 % to 1.05x10-1 % for linearly polarized (LP) incidence, and 1.3x10-4 % to 6.1x10-2 % for circularly polarized (CP) incidence, for the optical intensity range 0.47 GW/cm2 to 16.8 GW/cm2 respectively. The effect of the Ge film height variation has been discussed and compared with transmission line theory for the nonlinear medium. The metasurface design pitch is suitably tuned for the anisotropic cross-triangles nanoantenna for analyzing the polarization states of the fundamental beam simultaneously. The effect of source intensity on TH conversion among the LP and CP states, flipping the nonlinear diffraction orders and incipient of new harmonics with intensity dependence and design limitations, has also been addressed. To my knowledge, with this type of metasurface design, this is the first approach for upconverted full-Stokes imaging. The benefit will be upconverted polarimetry of MWIR at SWIR, where uncooled efficient detectors are available for high-resolution thermal imaging. This efficient Ge-metasurface is exempt from TH transmission loss due to the size effect of assigning a phase gradient for polarization-dependent TH diffraction order generation and orthogonal transmission disparity. Integration of this type of metasurface for infrared image upconversion will open new possibilities for intense heat signature identification, especially for target recognition in next-generation infrared homing devices in surveillance and missile defense systems.</description>

Abstract: Ghost imaging (GI) and single-pixel imaging (SPI) techniques enable image reconstruction without spatially resolved detectors, offering unique access to wide spectral ranges and challenging imaging environments. Yet, their adoption has been limited by the slow generation of mask patterns, which constrains achievable frame rates. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast GI that achieves a spatial-temporal information flux of 78.4 gigapixels per second across five wavelengths, which is at least two orders of magnitude larger than that reported for previous training-data-free GI approaches. This breakthrough is enabled by 25 GHz speckle pattern switching and allows parallelizing the pattern illumination using a wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) technique. We show that the proposed approach is capable of reconstructing 28$\times$28-pixel images at the exposure time of 10 ns, achieving 100 megaframes per second (Mfps), and demonstrate the GI of a microsecond-scale dynamic event. This approach opens avenues for studying rapid processes in physics, chemistry, and biology, where conventional cameras are limited by detector bandwidth, readout speed, or cost.</description>

Abstract: Optogenetics has emerged as a powerful tool for disease modeling, enabling precise control of cellular activities through light stimulation and providing a valuable insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities. Innovative materials and technologies such as micro-LEDs, optical fibers and micro/nano probes have been developed to allow precise spatial and temporal control of light delivery to target cells. Recent advances in 3D printing have further enhanced optogenetic applications by enabling the fabrication of implantable, customizable, and miniaturized light stimulation systems with high spatial resolution. In this study, we introduce a novel concept of a 3D printed light delivery system for brain organoid stimulation exploring the capabilities of projection microstereolithography (P$\mu$SL). We characterized the optical properties of the high-resolution acrylate-based 3D print resin, i.e., refractive index and extinction coefficient, to evaluate if the light transmission efficiency might limit the performance of the optogenetic stimulation systems. Finite element method simulations were employed to optimize the 3D printed design. An optogenetic setup was developed for optimal light delivery, and initial tests with optogenetically modified cells showed light-induced dopamine release with a stimulation efficiency of 2.8\%, confirming the 3D printed waveguide functionality and guiding future optimization. Our results demonstrate that this light stimulation tool offers strong potential for advancing customizable optogenetic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) detectors are widely used for their ability to sense thermal radiation. Recently, a room-temperature infrared detector known as the spintronic Poisson bolometer was introduced. Operating in a probabilistic regime governed by Poissonian counting statistics, it establishes a fundamentally different detection mechanism with the potential to relax conventional sensitivity limits. While offering fast digital readout, its sensitivity is currently limited by a small active area and array fill factor. In this work, we present design guidelines for spherical plano-convex microlens arrays that enhance light collection in spintronic Poisson bolometer arrays. Using FDTD simulations of aluminum oxide microlenses, we analyze focal properties, collection efficiency, and concentration factor in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR). Guided by the simulations, we fabricate a microlens array sample to demonstrate that the chosen geometrical parameters are realistic and compatible with the fabrication process. A radiometric-stochastic model is used to quantify the resulting sensitivity improvements.</description>

      <title>First-return statistics in bounded radiative transport: A Motzkin polynomial framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A photon entering a scattering medium executes a three-dimensional random walk determined by the Henyey-Greenstein phase function. The photon either reaches the boundary for a first passage or is absorbed. Projecting the walk onto the axial direction produces a one-dimensional alternating process whose peaks and valleys correspond to changes in the sign of the projected step. This reduction preserves first-return and first-passage events and leads to a representation in terms of Motzkin-type polynomials. The analytical formulation is complete except for boundary-constrained return terms, which appear as high-order integrals. We treat these contributions with a single truncation factor determined from Monte Carlo simulations of first-return distributions over a wide range of anisotropy g and scattering steps ms. The resulting factor follows a Cauchy distribution. Incorporating it yields first-return probabilities in agreement with full three-dimensional Monte Carlo to within 2% for g&lt;=0.7. The approach gives backscattering coefficients from phase-function integrals and provides an efficient alternative to full three-dimensional simulations for problems of radiative transport in semi-infinite media.</description>

      <title>Towards Arbitrary Time-frequency Mode Squeezing with Self-conjugated Mode Squeezing in Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical parametric amplification generates squeezed light in device-specific sets of time-frequency eigenmodes, and it has been widely accepted that detection and utilization of squeezing must comply with this modal constraint. We show that this constraint can be considerably relaxed under the continuous-wave pump and broadband phase-matching approximation, where the modal decomposition is non-unique. Specifically, any time-frequency mode with "self-conjugated" spectral symmetry can approximate a squeezing eigenmode, and partial homodyne detection can herald squeezing in arbitrary time-frequency modes. We demonstrate this using a high-efficiency, low-loss all-fiber source, measuring 4.38 +- 0.11dB and 0.88 +- 0.09 dB squeezing on partially coherent and chaotic self-conjugated modes. Using a bichromatic self-conjugated mode with reduced local-oscillator noise, we achieve 7.50 +- 0.12dB squeezing, which represents the highest level reported for fully guided-wave squeezing sources based on chi(2) and chi(3) nonlinearities.</description>

Abstract: Recent work by Lawrie et al. [PRR 7, 023209 (2025)] introduced a non-diffracting resonant angular filter on a network of thin channels (modelled via quantum graph theory) that exhibits unit transmission of acoustic waves at a discrete, symmetry-paired set of incidence angles determined solely by the graph topology, while transmission at all other angles is strictly forbidden. In the present work, we study the same filtering geometry for waves governed by the magnetic Schr\"odinger equation rather than the classical wave equation. Using a phase shift induced by non-reciprocal wave propagation due to the presence of the magnetic potential and tuning $\delta$-type vertex boundary conditions, we make the previously topology-fixed discrete pass directions continuously tunable: both the transmission angle and the transmission coefficient become control parameters. The resulting flux-tunable angular filtering device replaces topology-constrained passbands with a programmable steering device, broadening the scope for wave-filter and beam-shaping applications.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous velocity during quantum tunnelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum tunnelling, a hallmark phenomenon of quantum mechanics, allows particles to pass through the classically forbidden region. It underpins fundamental processes ranging from nuclear fusion and photosynthesis to the operation of superconducting qubits. Yet the underlying dynamics of particle motion during tunnelling remain subtle and are still the subject of active debate. Here, by analyzing the temporal evolution of the tunnelling process, we show that the particle velocity inside the barrier continuously relaxes from a large initial value toward a smaller one, and may even approach zero in the evanescent regime. Meanwhile, the probability density within the barrier gradually builds up before reaching its stationary profile, in contrast to existing inherently. In addition, starting from the steady-state equations, we derive an explicit relation between the particle velocity and the barrier width, and show that the velocity in evanescent states approaches zero when the barrier is sufficiently wide. These findings resolve the apparent paradox of a vanishing steady-state velocity coexisting with a finite particle density. We point out that defining an effective speed from the probability density, rather than from the probability current, can lead to spuriously nonzero "stationary speed," as appears to be the case in Ref. [Nature 643, 67 (2025)]. Our work establishes a clear dynamical picture for the formation of tunnelling flow and provides a theoretical foundation for testing time-resolved tunnelling phenomena.</description>
