      <title>Rate-Preserving Reductions for Blackwell Approachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abernethy et al. (2011) showed that Blackwell approachability and no-regret learning are equivalent, in the sense that any algorithm that solves a specific Blackwell approachability instance can be converted to a sublinear regret algorithm for a specific no-regret learning instance, and vice versa. In this paper, we study a more fine-grained form of such reductions, and ask when this translation between problems preserves not only a sublinear rate of convergence, but also preserves the optimal rate of convergence. That is, in which cases does it suffice to find the optimal regret bound for a no-regret learning instance in order to find the optimal rate of convergence for a corresponding approachability instance?
  We show that the reduction of Abernethy et al. (2011) does not preserve rates: their reduction may reduce a $d$-dimensional approachability instance $I_1$ with optimal convergence rate $R_1$ to a no-regret learning instance $I_2$ with optimal regret-per-round of $R_2$, with $R_{2}/R_{1}$ arbitrarily large (in particular, it is possible that $R_1 = 0$ and $R_{2} &gt; 0$). On the other hand, we show that it is possible to tightly reduce any approachability instance to an instance of a generalized form of regret minimization we call improper $\phi$-regret minimization (a variant of the $\phi$-regret minimization of Gordon et al. (2008) where the transformation functions may map actions outside of the action set).
  Finally, we characterize when linear transformations suffice to reduce improper $\phi$-regret minimization problems to standard classes of regret minimization problems in a rate preserving manner. We prove that some improper $\phi$-regret minimization instances cannot be reduced to either subclass of instance in this way, suggesting that approachability can capture some problems that cannot be phrased in the language of online learning.</description>

      <title>Fully Adaptive Regret-Guaranteed Algorithm for Control of Linear Quadratic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first algorithm for the Linear Quadratic (LQ) control problem with an unknown system model, featuring a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$, was introduced by Abbasi-Yadkori and Szepesv\'ari (2011). Recognizing the computational complexity of this algorithm, subsequent efforts (see Cohen et al. (2019), Mania et al. (2019), Faradonbeh et al. (2020a), and Kargin et al.(2022)) have been dedicated to proposing algorithms that are computationally tractable while preserving this order of regret. Although successful, the existing works in the literature lack a fully adaptive exploration-exploitation trade-off adjustment and require a user-defined value, which can lead to overall regret bound growth with some factors. In this work, noticing this gap, we propose the first fully adaptive algorithm that controls the number of policy updates (i.e., tunes the exploration-exploitation trade-off) and optimizes the upper-bound of regret adaptively. Our proposed algorithm builds on the SDP-based approach of Cohen et al. (2019) and relaxes its need for a horizon-dependant warm-up phase by appropriately tuning the regularization parameter and adding an adaptive input perturbation. We further show that through careful exploration-exploitation trade-off adjustment there is no need to commit to the widely-used notion of strong sequential stability, which is restrictive and can introduce complexities in initialization.</description>

      <title>Minimal Communication-Cost Statistical Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A client device which has access to $n$ training data samples needs to obtain a statistical hypothesis or model $W$ and then to send it to a remote server. The client and the server devices share some common randomness sequence as well as a prior on the hypothesis space. In this problem a suitable hypothesis or model $W$ should meet two distinct design criteria simultaneously: (i) small (population) risk during the inference phase and (ii) small 'complexity' for it to be conveyed to the server with minimum communication cost. In this paper, we propose a joint training and source coding scheme with provable in-expectation guarantees, where the expectation is over the encoder's output message. Specifically, we show that by imposing a constraint on a suitable Kullback-Leibler divergence between the conditional distribution induced by a compressed learning model $\widehat{W}$ given $W$ and the prior, one guarantees simultaneously small average empirical risk (aka training loss), small average generalization error and small average communication cost. We also consider a one-shot scenario in which the guarantees on the empirical risk and generalization error are obtained for every encoder's output message.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we examine the forward-Euler discretization for simulating Wasserstein gradient flows. We provide two counter-examples showcasing the failure of this discretization even for a simple case where the energy functional is defined as the KL divergence against some nicely structured probability densities. A simple explanation of this failure is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Measuring model variability using robust non-parametric testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training a deep neural network often involves stochastic optimization, meaning each run will produce a different model. The seed used to initialize random elements of the optimization procedure heavily influences the quality of a trained model, which may be obscure from many commonly reported summary statistics, like accuracy. However, random seed is often not included in hyper-parameter optimization, perhaps because the relationship between seed and model quality is hard to describe. This work attempts to describe the relationship between deep net models trained with different random seeds and the behavior of the expected model. We adopt robust hypothesis testing to propose a novel summary statistic for network similarity, referred to as the $\alpha$-trimming level. We use the $\alpha$-trimming level to show that the empirical cumulative distribution function of an ensemble model created from a collection of trained models with different random seeds approximates the average of these functions as the number of models in the collection grows large. This insight provides guidance for how many random seeds should be sampled to ensure that an ensemble of these trained models is a reliable representative. We also show that the $\alpha$-trimming level is more expressive than different performance metrics like validation accuracy, churn, or expected calibration error when taken alone and may help with random seed selection in a more principled fashion. We demonstrate the value of the proposed statistic in real experiments and illustrate the advantage of fine-tuning over random seed with an experiment in transfer learning.</description>

      <title>Deep learning from strongly mixing observations: Sparse-penalized regularization and minimax optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explicit regularization and optimality of deep neural networks estimators from independent data have made considerable progress recently. The study of such properties on dependent data is still a challenge. In this paper, we carry out deep learning from strongly mixing observations, and deal with the squared and a broad class of loss functions. We consider sparse-penalized regularization for deep neural network predictor. For a general framework that includes, regression estimation, classification, time series prediction,$\cdots$, oracle inequality for the expected excess risk is established and a bound on the class of H\"older smooth functions is provided. For nonparametric regression from strong mixing data and sub-exponentially error, we provide an oracle inequality for the $L_2$ error and investigate an upper bound of this error on a class of H\"older composition functions. For the specific case of nonparametric autoregression with Gaussian and Laplace errors, a lower bound of the $L_2$ error on this H\"older composition class is established. Up to logarithmic factor, this bound matches its upper bound; so, the deep neural network estimator attains the minimax optimal rate.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Cost-Parameterized Monge Map Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the field of optimal transport (OT), the choice of ground cost is crucial to ensuring that the optimality of a transport map corresponds to usefulness in real-world applications. It is therefore desirable to use known information to tailor cost functions and hence learn OT maps which are adapted to the problem at hand. By considering a class of neural ground costs whose Monge maps have a known form, we construct a differentiable Monge map estimator which can be optimized to be consistent with known information about an OT map. In doing so, we simultaneously learn both an OT map estimator and a corresponding adapted cost function. Through suitable choices of loss function, our method provides a general approach for incorporating prior information about the Monge map itself when learning adapted OT maps and cost functions.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om Kernel Stein Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel methods underpin many of the most successful approaches in data science and statistics, and they allow representing probability measures as elements of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space without loss of information. Recently, the kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD), which combines Stein's method with kernel techniques, gained considerable attention. Through the Stein operator, KSD allows the construction of powerful goodness-of-fit tests where it is sufficient to know the target distribution up to a multiplicative constant. However, the typical U- and V-statistic-based KSD estimators suffer from a quadratic runtime complexity, which hinders their application in large-scale settings. In this work, we propose a Nystr\"om-based KSD acceleration -- with runtime $\mathcal O\!\left(mn+m^3\right)$ for $n$ samples and $m\ll n$ Nystr\"om points -- , show its $\sqrt{n}$-consistency under the null with a classical sub-Gaussian assumption, and demonstrate its applicability for goodness-of-fit testing on a suite of benchmarks.</description>

      <title>MambaLRP: Explaining Selective State Space Sequence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent sequence modeling approaches using Selective State Space Sequence Models, referred to as Mamba models, have seen a surge of interest. These models allow efficient processing of long sequences in linear time and are rapidly being adopted in a wide range of applications such as language modeling, demonstrating promising performance. To foster their reliable use in real-world scenarios, it is crucial to augment their transparency. Our work bridges this critical gap by bringing explainability, particularly Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), to the Mamba architecture. Guided by the axiom of relevance conservation, we identify specific components in the Mamba architecture, which cause unfaithful explanations. To remedy this issue, we propose MambaLRP, a novel algorithm within the LRP framework, which ensures a more stable and reliable relevance propagation through these components. Our proposed method is theoretically sound and excels in achieving state-of-the-art explanation performance across a diverse range of models and datasets. Moreover, MambaLRP facilitates a deeper inspection of Mamba architectures, uncovering various biases and evaluating their significance. It also enables the analysis of previous speculations regarding the long-range capabilities of Mamba models.</description>

      <title>Treeffuser: Probabilistic Predictions via Conditional Diffusions with Gradient-Boosted Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic prediction aims to compute predictive distributions rather than single-point predictions. These distributions enable practitioners to quantify uncertainty, compute risk, and detect outliers. However, most probabilistic methods assume parametric responses, such as Gaussian or Poisson distributions. When these assumptions fail, such models lead to bad predictions and poorly calibrated uncertainty. In this paper, we propose Treeffuser, an easy-to-use method for probabilistic prediction on tabular data. The idea is to learn a conditional diffusion model where the score function is estimated using gradient-boosted trees. The conditional diffusion model makes Treeffuser flexible and non-parametric, while the gradient-boosted trees make it robust and easy to train on CPUs. Treeffuser learns well-calibrated predictive distributions and can handle a wide range of regression tasks -- including those with multivariate, multimodal, and skewed responses. % , as well as categorical predictors and missing data We study Treeffuser on synthetic and real data and show that it outperforms existing methods, providing better-calibrated probabilistic predictions. We further demonstrate its versatility with an application to inventory allocation under uncertainty using sales data from Walmart. We implement Treeffuser in \href{https://github.com/blei-lab/treeffuser}{https://github.com/blei-lab/treeffuser}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a principled approach to molecular design tasks. In this paper we explain three pitfalls of BO which can cause poor empirical performance: an incorrect prior width, over-smoothing, and inadequate acquisition function maximization. We show that with these issues addressed, even a basic BO setup is able to achieve the highest overall performance on the PMO benchmark for molecule design (Gao et al, 2022). These results suggest that BO may benefit from more attention in the machine learning for molecules community.</description>

      <title>Bias-Corrected Joint Spectral Embedding for Multilayer Networks with Invariant Subspace: Entrywise Eigenvector Perturbation and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to estimate the invariant subspace across heterogeneous multiple networks using a novel bias-corrected joint spectral embedding algorithm. The proposed algorithm recursively calibrates the diagonal bias of the sum of squared network adjacency matrices by leveraging the closed-form bias formula and iteratively updates the subspace estimator using the most recent estimated bias. Correspondingly, we establish a complete recipe for the entrywise subspace estimation theory for the proposed algorithm, including a sharp entrywise subspace perturbation bound and the entrywise eigenvector central limit theorem. Leveraging these results, we settle two multiple network inference problems: the exact community detection in multilayer stochastic block models and the hypothesis testing of the equality of membership profiles in multilayer mixed membership models. Our proof relies on delicate leave-one-out and leave-two-out analyses that are specifically tailored to block-wise symmetric random matrices and a martingale argument that is of fundamental interest for the entrywise eigenvector central limit theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are a class of generative models that generate high-quality samples, but at present it is difficult to characterize how they depend upon their training data. This difficulty raises scientific and regulatory questions, and is a consequence of the complexity of diffusion models and their sampling process. To analyze this dependence, we introduce Ablation Based Counterfactuals (ABC), a method of performing counterfactual analysis that relies on model ablation rather than model retraining. In our approach, we train independent components of a model on different but overlapping splits of a training set. These components are then combined into a single model, from which the causal influence of any training sample can be removed by ablating a combination of model components. We demonstrate how we can construct a model like this using an ensemble of diffusion models. We then use this model to study the limits of training data attribution by enumerating full counterfactual landscapes, and show that single source attributability diminishes with increasing training data size. Finally, we demonstrate the existence of unattributable samples.</description>

      <title>Guiding Frame-Level CTC Alignments Using Self-knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer encoder with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) framework is widely used for automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, knowledge distillation (KD) for ASR displays a problem of disagreement between teacher-student models in frame-level alignment which ultimately hinders it from improving the student model's performance. In order to resolve this problem, this paper introduces a self-knowledge distillation (SKD) method that guides the frame-level alignment during the training time. In contrast to the conventional method using separate teacher and student models, this study introduces a simple and effective method sharing encoder layers and applying the sub-model as the student model. Overall, our approach is effective in improving both the resource efficiency as well as performance. We also conducted an experimental analysis of the spike timings to illustrate that the proposed method improves performance by reducing the alignment disagreement.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Learning and Planning in Separated Latent MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study computational and statistical aspects of learning Latent Markov Decision Processes (LMDPs). In this model, the learner interacts with an MDP drawn at the beginning of each epoch from an unknown mixture of MDPs. To sidestep known impossibility results, we consider several notions of separation of the constituent MDPs. The main thrust of this paper is in establishing a nearly-sharp *statistical threshold* for the horizon length necessary for efficient learning. On the computational side, we show that under a weaker assumption of separability under the optimal policy, there is a quasi-polynomial algorithm with time complexity scaling in terms of the statistical threshold. We further show a near-matching time complexity lower bound under the exponential time hypothesis.</description>

      <title>How Interpretable Are Interpretable Graph Neural Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpretable graph neural networks (XGNNs ) are widely adopted in various scientific applications involving graph-structured data. Existing XGNNs predominantly adopt the attention-based mechanism to learn edge or node importance for extracting and making predictions with the interpretable subgraph. However, the representational properties and limitations of these methods remain inadequately explored. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that formulates interpretable subgraph learning with the multilinear extension of the subgraph distribution, coined as subgraph multilinear extension (SubMT). Extracting the desired interpretable subgraph requires an accurate approximation of SubMT, yet we find that the existing XGNNs can have a huge gap in fitting SubMT. Consequently, the SubMT approximation failure will lead to the degenerated interpretability of the extracted subgraphs. To mitigate the issue, we design a new XGNN architecture called Graph Multilinear neT (GMT), which is provably more powerful in approximating SubMT. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of graph classification benchmarks. The results demonstrate that GMT outperforms the state-of-the-art up to 10% in terms of both interpretability and generalizability across 12 regular and geometric graph benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Interpetable Target-Feature Aggregation for Multi-Task Learning based on Bias-Variance Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is a powerful machine learning paradigm designed to leverage shared knowledge across tasks to improve generalization and performance. Previous works have proposed approaches to MTL that can be divided into feature learning, focused on the identification of a common feature representation, and task clustering, where similar tasks are grouped together. In this paper, we propose an MTL approach at the intersection between task clustering and feature transformation based on a two-phase iterative aggregation of targets and features. First, we propose a bias-variance analysis for regression models with additive Gaussian noise, where we provide a general expression of the asymptotic bias and variance of a task, considering a linear regression trained on aggregated input features and an aggregated target. Then, we exploit this analysis to provide a two-phase MTL algorithm (NonLinCTFA). Firstly, this method partitions the tasks into clusters and aggregates each obtained group of targets with their mean. Then, for each aggregated task, it aggregates subsets of features with their mean in a dimensionality reduction fashion. In both phases, a key aspect is to preserve the interpretability of the reduced targets and features through the aggregation with the mean, which is further motivated by applications to Earth science. Finally, we validate the algorithms on synthetic data, showing the effect of different parameters and real-world datasets, exploring the validity of the proposed methodology on classical datasets, recent baselines, and Earth science applications.</description>

      <title>How social reinforcement learning can lead to metastable polarisation and the voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous explanations for the persistence of polarization of opinions have typically included modelling assumptions that predispose the possibility of polarization (e.g.\ repulsive interactions). An exception is recent research showing that polarization is stable when agents form their opinions using reinforcement learning.
  We show that the polarization observed in this model is not stable, but exhibits consensus asymptotically with probability one. By constructing a link between the reinforcement learning model and the voter model, we argue that the observed polarization is metastable. Finally, we show that a slight modification in the learning process of the agents changes the model from being non-ergodic to being ergodic.
  Our results show that reinforcement learning may be a powerful method for modelling polarization in opinion dynamics, but that the tools appropriate for analysing such models crucially depend on the properties of the resulting systems. Properties which are determined by the details of the learning process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning and statistical methods can be used to enhance monitoring and fault prediction in marine systems. These methods rely on a dataset with records of historical system behaviour, potentially containing periods of both fault-free and faulty operation. An unexpected change in the underlying system, called a concept drift, may impact the performance of these methods, triggering the need for model retraining or other adaptations. In this article, we present an approach for detecting overheating in stator windings of marine propulsion motors that is able to successfully operate during concept drift without the need for full model retraining. Two distinct approaches are presented and tested. All models are trained and verified using a dataset from operational propulsion motors, with known, sudden concept drifts.</description>

Abstract: Predicting edge weights on graphs has various applications, from transportation systems to social networks. This paper describes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach for edge weight prediction with guaranteed coverage. We leverage conformal prediction to calibrate the GNN outputs and produce valid prediction intervals. We handle data heteroscedasticity through error reweighting and Conformalized Quantile Regression (CQR). We compare the performance of our method against baseline techniques on real-world transportation datasets. Our approach has better coverage and efficiency than all baselines and showcases robustness and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Must Be Taught to Know What They Don't Know</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When using large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes applications, we need to know when we can trust their predictions. Some works argue that prompting high-performance LLMs is sufficient to produce calibrated uncertainties, while others introduce sampling methods that can be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we first argue that prompting on its own is insufficient to achieve good calibration and then show that fine-tuning on a small dataset of correct and incorrect answers can create an uncertainty estimate with good generalization and small computational overhead. We show that a thousand graded examples are sufficient to outperform baseline methods and that training through the features of a model is necessary for good performance and tractable for large open-source models when using LoRA. We also investigate the mechanisms that enable reliable LLM uncertainty estimation, finding that many models can be used as general-purpose uncertainty estimators, applicable not just to their own uncertainties but also the uncertainty of other models. Lastly, we show that uncertainty estimates inform human use of LLMs in human-AI collaborative settings through a user study.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Initialization on LoRA Finetuning Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the role of initialization in Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as originally introduced in Hu et al. (2021). Essentially, to start from the pretrained model as initialization for finetuning, one can either initialize B to zero and A to random (default initialization in PEFT package), or vice-versa. In both cases, the product BA is equal to zero at initialization, which makes finetuning starts from the pretrained model. These two initialization schemes are seemingly similar. They should in-principle yield the same performance and share the same optimal learning rate. We demonstrate that this is an incorrect intuition and that the first scheme (initializing B to zero and A to random) on average yields better performance compared to the other scheme. Our theoretical analysis shows that the reason behind this might be that the first initialization allows the use of larger learning rates (without causing output instability) compared to the second initialization, resulting in more efficient learning of the first scheme. We validate our results with extensive experiments on LLMs.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws in Linear Regression: Compute, Parameters, and Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirically, large-scale deep learning models often satisfy a neural scaling law: the test error of the trained model improves polynomially as the model size and data size grow. However, conventional wisdom suggests the test error consists of approximation, bias, and variance errors, where the variance error increases with model size. This disagrees with the general form of neural scaling laws, which predict that increasing model size monotonically improves performance.
  We study the theory of scaling laws in an infinite dimensional linear regression setup. Specifically, we consider a model with $M$ parameters as a linear function of sketched covariates. The model is trained by one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) using $N$ data. Assuming the optimal parameter satisfies a Gaussian prior and the data covariance matrix has a power-law spectrum of degree $a&gt;1$, we show that the reducible part of the test error is $\Theta(M^{-(a-1)} + N^{-(a-1)/a})$. The variance error, which increases with $M$, is dominated by the other errors due to the implicit regularization of SGD, thus disappearing from the bound. Our theory is consistent with the empirical neural scaling laws and verified by numerical simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Membership inference attacks aim to detect if a particular data point was used in training a model. We design a novel statistical test to perform robust membership inference attacks (RMIA) with low computational overhead. We achieve this by a fine-grained modeling of the null hypothesis in our likelihood ratio tests, and effectively leveraging both reference models and reference population data samples. RMIA has superior test power compared with prior methods, throughout the TPR-FPR curve (even at extremely low FPR, as low as 0). Under computational constraints, where only a limited number of pre-trained reference models (as few as 1) are available, and also when we vary other elements of the attack (e.g., data distribution), our method performs exceptionally well, unlike prior attacks that approach random guessing. RMIA lays the groundwork for practical yet accurate data privacy risk assessment in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Subsampling is not Magic: Why Large Batch Sizes Work for Differentially Private Stochastic Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how the batch size affects the total gradient variance in differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), seeking a theoretical explanation for the usefulness of large batch sizes. As DP-SGD is the basis of modern DP deep learning, its properties have been widely studied, and recent works have empirically found large batch sizes to be beneficial. However, theoretical explanations of this benefit are currently heuristic at best. We first observe that the total gradient variance in DP-SGD can be decomposed into subsampling-induced and noise-induced variances. We then prove that in the limit of an infinite number of iterations, the effective noise-induced variance is invariant to the batch size. The remaining subsampling-induced variance decreases with larger batch sizes, so large batches reduce the effective total gradient variance. We confirm numerically that the asymptotic regime is relevant in practical settings when the batch size is not small, and find that outside the asymptotic regime, the total gradient variance decreases even more with large batch sizes. We also find a sufficient condition that implies that large batch sizes similarly reduce effective DP noise variance for one iteration of DP-SGD.</description>

      <title>Batch and match: black-box variational inference with a score-based divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most leading implementations of black-box variational inference (BBVI) are based on optimizing a stochastic evidence lower bound (ELBO). But such approaches to BBVI often converge slowly due to the high variance of their gradient estimates and their sensitivity to hyperparameters. In this work, we propose batch and match (BaM), an alternative approach to BBVI based on a score-based divergence. Notably, this score-based divergence can be optimized by a closed-form proximal update for Gaussian variational families with full covariance matrices. We analyze the convergence of BaM when the target distribution is Gaussian, and we prove that in the limit of infinite batch size the variational parameter updates converge exponentially quickly to the target mean and covariance. We also evaluate the performance of BaM on Gaussian and non-Gaussian target distributions that arise from posterior inference in hierarchical and deep generative models. In these experiments, we find that BaM typically converges in fewer (and sometimes significantly fewer) gradient evaluations than leading implementations of BBVI based on ELBO maximization.</description>

      <title>Neural Dynamic Data Valuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data constitute the foundational component of the data economy and its marketplaces. Efficient and fair data valuation has emerged as a topic of significant interest.\ Many approaches based on marginal contribution have shown promising results in various downstream tasks. However, they are well known to be computationally expensive as they require training a large number of utility functions, which are used to evaluate the usefulness or value of a given dataset for a specific purpose. As a result, it has been recognized as infeasible to apply these methods to a data marketplace involving large-scale datasets. Consequently, a critical issue arises: how can the re-training of the utility function be avoided? To address this issue, we propose a novel data valuation method from the perspective of optimal control, named the neural dynamic data valuation (NDDV). Our method has solid theoretical interpretations to accurately identify the data valuation via the sensitivity of the data optimal control state. In addition, we implement a data re-weighting strategy to capture the unique features of data points, ensuring fairness through the interaction between data points and the mean-field states. Notably, our method requires only training once to estimate the value of all data points, significantly improving the computational efficiency. We conduct comprehensive experiments using different datasets and tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed NDDV method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art data valuation methods in accurately identifying data points with either high or low values and is more computationally efficient.</description>

Abstract: We propose a hierarchical correlation clustering method that extends the well-known correlation clustering to produce hierarchical clusters applicable to both positive and negative pairwise dissimilarities. Then, in the following, we study unsupervised representation learning with such hierarchical correlation clustering. For this purpose, we first investigate embedding the respective hierarchy to be used for tree preserving embedding and feature extraction. Thereafter, we study the extension of minimax distance measures to correlation clustering, as another representation learning paradigm.

Abstract: TWe establish regret lower bounds for adaptively controlling an unknown linear Gaussian system with quadratic costs. We combine ideas from experiment design, estimation theory and a perturbation bound of certain information matrices to derive regret lower bounds exhibiting scaling on the order of magnitude $\sqrt{T}$ in the time horizon $T$. Our bounds accurately capture the role of control-theoretic parameters and we are able to show that systems that are hard to control are also hard to learn to control; when instantiated to state feedback systems we recover the dimensional dependency of earlier work but with improved scaling with system-theoretic constants such as system costs and Gramians. Furthermore, we extend our results to a class of partially observed systems and demonstrate that systems with poor observability structure also are hard to learn to control.</description>

      <title>A flexible empirical Bayes approach to multiple linear regression and connections with penalized regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new empirical Bayes approach for large-scale multiple linear regression. Our approach combines two key ideas: (i) the use of flexible "adaptive shrinkage" priors, which approximate the nonparametric family of scale mixture of normal distributions by a finite mixture of normal distributions; and (ii) the use of variational approximations to efficiently estimate prior hyperparameters and compute approximate posteriors. Combining these two ideas results in fast and flexible methods, with computational speed comparable to fast penalized regression methods such as the Lasso, and with competitive prediction accuracy across a wide range of scenarios. Further, we provide new results that establish conceptual connections between our empirical Bayes methods and penalized methods. Specifically, we show that the posterior mean from our method solves a penalized regression problem, with the form of the penalty function being learned from the data by directly solving an optimization problem (rather than being tuned by cross-validation). Our methods are implemented in an R package, mr.ash.alpha, available from https://github.com/stephenslab/mr.ash.alpha.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised domain adaptation by learning using privileged information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Successful unsupervised domain adaptation is guaranteed only under strong assumptions such as covariate shift and overlap between input domains. The latter is often violated in high-dimensional applications like image classification which, despite this limitation, continues to serve as inspiration and benchmark for algorithm development. In this work, we show that training-time access to side information in the form of auxiliary variables can help relax restrictions on input variables and increase the sample efficiency of learning at the cost of collecting a richer variable set. As this information is assumed available only during training, not in deployment, we call this problem unsupervised domain adaptation by learning using privileged information (DALUPI). To solve this problem, we propose a simple two-stage learning algorithm, inspired by our analysis of the expected error in the target domain, and a practical end-to-end variant for image classification. We propose three evaluation tasks based on classification of entities in photos and anomalies in medical images with different types of available privileged information (binary attributes and single or multiple regions of interest). We demonstrate across these tasks that using privileged information in learning can reduce errors in domain transfer compared to baselines, be robust to spurious correlations in the source domain, and increase sample efficiency.</description>

      <title>Manifold Learning by Mixture Models of VAEs for Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representing a manifold of very high-dimensional data with generative models has been shown to be computationally efficient in practice. However, this requires that the data manifold admits a global parameterization. In order to represent manifolds of arbitrary topology, we propose to learn a mixture model of variational autoencoders. Here, every encoder-decoder pair represents one chart of a manifold. We propose a loss function for maximum likelihood estimation of the model weights and choose an architecture that provides us the analytical expression of the charts and of their inverses. Once the manifold is learned, we use it for solving inverse problems by minimizing a data fidelity term restricted to the learned manifold. To solve the arising minimization problem we propose a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm on the learned manifold. We demonstrate the performance of our method for low-dimensional toy examples as well as for deblurring and electrical impedance tomography on certain image manifolds.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Noise-Driven Generative Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Generative models realized with machine learning techniques are powerful tools to infer complex and unknown data distributions from a finite number of training samples in order to produce new synthetic data. Diffusion models are an emerging framework that have recently overcome the performance of the generative adversarial networks in creating synthetic text and high-quality images. Here, we propose and discuss the quantum generalization of diffusion models, i.e., three quantum-noise-driven generative diffusion models that could be experimentally tested on real quantum systems. The idea is to harness unique quantum features, in particular the non-trivial interplay among coherence, entanglement and noise that the currently available noisy quantum processors do unavoidably suffer from, in order to overcome the main computational burdens of classical diffusion models during inference. Hence, we suggest to exploit quantum noise not as an issue to be detected and solved but instead as a very remarkably beneficial key ingredient to generate much more complex probability distributions that would be difficult or even impossible to express classically, and from which a quantum processor might sample more efficiently than a classical one. An example of numerical simulations for an hybrid classical-quantum generative diffusion model is also included. Therefore, our results are expected to pave the way for new quantum-inspired or quantum-based generative diffusion algorithms addressing more powerfully classical tasks as data generation/prediction with widespread real-world applications ranging from climate forecasting to neuroscience, from traffic flow analysis to financial forecasting.</description>

      <title>Feature Learning and Generalization in Deep Networks with Orthogonal Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fully-connected deep neural networks with weights initialized from independent Gaussian distributions can be tuned to criticality, which prevents the exponential growth or decay of signals propagating through the network. However, such networks still exhibit fluctuations that grow linearly with the depth of the network, which may impair the training of networks with width comparable to depth. We show analytically that rectangular networks with tanh activations and weights initialized from the ensemble of orthogonal matrices have corresponding preactivation fluctuations which are independent of depth, to leading order in inverse width. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically that, at initialization, all correlators involving the neural tangent kernel (NTK) and its descendants at leading order in inverse width -- which govern the evolution of observables during training -- saturate at a depth of $\sim 20$, rather than growing without bound as in the case of Gaussian initializations. We speculate that this structure preserves finite-width feature learning while reducing overall noise, thus improving both generalization and training speed in deep networks with depth comparable to width. We provide some experimental justification by relating empirical measurements of the NTK to the superior performance of deep nonlinear orthogonal networks trained under full-batch gradient descent on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Sparse Bayesian Multidimensional Item Response Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multivariate Item Response Theory (MIRT) is sought-after widely by applied researchers looking for interpretable (sparse) explanations underlying response patterns in questionnaire data. There is, however, an unmet demand for such sparsity discovery tools in practice. Our paper develops a Bayesian platform for binary and ordinal item MIRT which requires minimal tuning and scales well on large datasets due to its parallelizable features. Bayesian methodology for MIRT models has traditionally relied on MCMC simulation, which cannot only be slow in practice, but also often renders exact sparsity recovery impossible without additional thresholding. In this work, we develop a scalable Bayesian EM algorithm to estimate sparse factor loadings from mixed continuous, binary, and ordinal item responses. We address the seemingly insurmountable problem of unknown latent factor dimensionality with tools from Bayesian nonparametrics which enable estimating the number of factors. Rotations to sparsity through parameter expansion further enhance convergence and interpretability without identifiability constraints. In our simulation study, we show that our method reliably recovers both the factor dimensionality as well as the latent structure on high-dimensional synthetic data even for small samples. We demonstrate the practical usefulness of our approach on three datasets: an educational assessment dataset, a quality-of-life measurement dataset, and a bio-behavioral dataset. All demonstrations show that our tool yields interpretable estimates, facilitating interesting discoveries that might otherwise go unnoticed under a pure confirmatory factor analysis setting.</description>

      <title>Deep Bayes Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The is no other model or hypothesis verification tool in Bayesian statistics that is as widely used as the Bayes factor. We focus on generative models that are likelihood-free and, therefore, render the computation of Bayes factors (marginal likelihood ratios) far from obvious. We propose a deep learning estimator of the Bayes factor based on simulated data from two competing models using the likelihood ratio trick. This estimator is devoid of summary statistics and obviates some of the difficulties with ABC model choice. We establish sufficient conditions for consistency of our Deep Bayes Factor estimator as well as its consistency as a model selection tool. We investigate the performance of our estimator on various examples using a wide range of quality metrics related to estimation and model decision accuracy. After training, our deep learning approach enables rapid evaluations of the Bayes factor estimator at any fictional data arriving from either hypothesized model, not just the observed data $Y_0$. This allows us to inspect entire Bayes factor distributions under the two models and to quantify the relative location of the Bayes factor evaluated at $Y_0$ in light of these distributions. Such tail area evaluations are not possible for Bayes factor estimators tailored to $Y_0$. We find the performance of our Deep Bayes Factors competitive with existing MCMC techniques that require the knowledge of the likelihood function. We also consider variants for posterior or intrinsic Bayes factors estimation. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on a relatively high-dimensional real data example about determining cognitive biases.</description>

      <title>The Real Deal Behind the Artificial Appeal: Inferential Utility of Tabular Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative models facilitate the creation of synthetic data to be made available for research in privacy-sensitive contexts. However, the analysis of synthetic data raises a unique set of methodological challenges. In this work, we highlight the importance of inferential utility and provide empirical evidence against naive inference from synthetic data, whereby synthetic data are treated as if they were actually observed. Before publishing synthetic data, it is essential to develop statistical inference tools for such data. By means of a simulation study, we show that the rate of false-positive findings (type 1 error) will be unacceptably high, even when the estimates are unbiased. Despite the use of a previously proposed correction factor, this problem persists for deep generative models, in part due to slower convergence of estimators and resulting underestimation of the true standard error. We further demonstrate our findings through a case study.</description>

      <title>On the Benefits of Public Representations for Private Transfer Learning under Distribution Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Public pretraining is a promising approach to improve differentially private model training. However, recent work has noted that many positive research results studying this paradigm only consider in-distribution tasks, and may not apply to settings where there is distribution shift between the pretraining and finetuning data -- a scenario that is likely when finetuning private tasks due to the sensitive nature of the data. In this work, we show empirically across three tasks that even in settings with large distribution shift, where both zero-shot performance from public data and training from scratch with private data give unusably weak results, public features can in fact improve private training accuracy by up to 67\% over private training from scratch. We provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, showing that if the public and private data share a low-dimensional representation, public representations can improve the sample complexity of private training even if it is impossible to learn the private task from the public data alone. Altogether, our results provide evidence that public data can indeed make private training practical in realistic settings of extreme distribution shift.</description>

      <title>Conformal Convolution and Monte Carlo Meta-learners for Predictive Inference of Individual Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04906v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge of the effect of interventions, known as the treatment effect, is paramount for decision-making. Approaches to estimating this treatment effect using conditional average treatment effect (CATE) meta-learners often provide only a point estimate of this treatment effect, while additional uncertainty quantification is frequently desired to enhance decision-making confidence. To address this, we introduce two novel approaches: the conformal convolution T-learner (CCT-learner) and conformal Monte Carlo (CMC) meta-learners. The approaches leverage weighted conformal predictive systems (WCPS), Monte Carlo sampling, and CATE meta-learners to generate predictive distributions of individual treatment effect (ITE) that could enhance individualized decision-making. Although we show how assumptions about the noise distribution of the outcome influence the uncertainty predictions, our experiments demonstrate that the CCT- and CMC meta-learners achieve strong coverage while maintaining narrow interval widths. They also generate probabilistically calibrated predictive distributions, providing reliable ranges of ITEs across various synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.

      <title>Optimal score estimation via empirical Bayes smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the score function of an unknown probability distribution $\rho^*$ from $n$ independent and identically distributed observations in $d$ dimensions. Assuming that $\rho^*$ is subgaussian and has a Lipschitz-continuous score function $s^*$, we establish the optimal rate of $\tilde \Theta(n^{-\frac{2}{d+4}})$ for this estimation problem under the loss function $\|\hat s - s^*\|^2_{L^2(\rho^*)}$ that is commonly used in the score matching literature, highlighting the curse of dimensionality where sample complexity for accurate score estimation grows exponentially with the dimension $d$. Leveraging key insights in empirical Bayes theory as well as a new convergence rate of smoothed empirical distribution in Hellinger distance, we show that a regularized score estimator based on a Gaussian kernel attains this rate, shown optimal by a matching minimax lower bound. We also discuss extensions to estimating $\beta$-H\"older continuous scores with $\beta \leq 1$, as well as the implication of our theory on the sample complexity of score-based generative models.</description>

      <title>Extrapolation-Aware Nonparametric Statistical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define extrapolation as any type of statistical inference on a conditional function (e.g., a conditional expectation or conditional quantile) evaluated outside of the support of the conditioning variable. This type of extrapolation occurs in many data analysis applications and can invalidate the resulting conclusions if not taken into account. While extrapolating is straightforward in parametric models, it becomes challenging in nonparametric models. In this work, we extend the nonparametric statistical model to explicitly allow for extrapolation and introduce a class of extrapolation assumptions that can be combined with existing inference techniques to draw extrapolation-aware conclusions. The proposed class of extrapolation assumptions stipulate that the conditional function attains its minimal and maximal directional derivative, in each direction, within the observed support. We illustrate how the framework applies to several statistical applications including prediction and uncertainty quantification. We furthermore propose a consistent estimation procedure that can be used to adjust existing nonparametric estimates to account for extrapolation by providing lower and upper extrapolation bounds. The procedure is empirically evaluated on both simulated and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Shifted Interpolation for Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noisy gradient descent and its variants are the predominant algorithms for differentially private machine learning. It is a fundamental question to quantify their privacy leakage, yet tight characterizations remain open even in the foundational setting of convex losses. This paper improves over previous analyses by establishing (and refining) the "privacy amplification by iteration" phenomenon in the unifying framework of $f$-differential privacy--which tightly captures all aspects of the privacy loss and immediately implies tighter privacy accounting in other notions of differential privacy, e.g., $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP and R\'enyi DP. Our key technical insight is the construction of shifted interpolated processes that unravel the popular shifted-divergences argument, enabling generalizations beyond divergence-based relaxations of DP. Notably, this leads to the first exact privacy analysis in the foundational setting of strongly convex optimization. Our techniques extend to many settings: convex/strongly convex, constrained/unconstrained, full/cyclic/stochastic batches, and all combinations thereof. As an immediate corollary, we recover the $f$-DP characterization of the exponential mechanism for strongly convex optimization in Gopi et al. (2022), and moreover extend this result to more general settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to simulate realistic networks based on empirical data is an important task across scientific disciplines, from epidemiology to computer science. Often simulation approaches involve selecting a suitable network generative model such as Erd\"os-R\'enyi or small-world. However, few tools are available to quantify if a particular generative model is suitable for capturing a given network structure or organization. We utilize advances in interpretable machine learning to classify simulated networks by our generative models based on various network attributes, using both primary features and their interactions. Our study underscores the significance of specific network features and their interactions in distinguishing generative models, comprehending complex network structures, and the formation of real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Provably Robust Score-Based Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Plug-and-Play Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a great number of tasks in science and engineering, the goal is to infer an unknown image from a small number of measurements collected from a known forward model describing certain sensing or imaging modality. Due to resource constraints, this task is often extremely ill-posed, which necessitates the adoption of expressive prior information to regularize the solution space. Score-based diffusion models, due to its impressive empirical success, have emerged as an appealing candidate of an expressive prior in image reconstruction. In order to accommodate diverse tasks at once, it is of great interest to develop efficient, consistent and robust algorithms that incorporate unconditional score functions of an image prior distribution in conjunction with flexible choices of forward models.
  This work develops an algorithmic framework for employing score-based diffusion models as an expressive data prior in general nonlinear inverse problems. Motivated by the plug-and-play framework in the imaging community, we introduce a diffusion plug-and-play method (DPnP) that alternatively calls two samplers, a proximal consistency sampler based solely on the likelihood function of the forward model, and a denoising diffusion sampler based solely on the score functions of the image prior. The key insight is that denoising under white Gaussian noise can be solved rigorously via both stochastic (i.e., DDPM-type) and deterministic (i.e., DDIM-type) samplers using the unconditional score functions. We establish both asymptotic and non-asymptotic performance guarantees of DPnP, and provide numerical experiments to illustrate its promise in solving both linear and nonlinear image reconstruction tasks. To the best of our knowledge, DPnP is the first provably-robust posterior sampling method for nonlinear inverse problems using unconditional diffusion priors.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Explanation of the Likelihood OOD Detection Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Likelihood-based deep generative models (DGMs) commonly exhibit a puzzling behaviour: when trained on a relatively complex dataset, they assign higher likelihood values to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from simpler sources. Adding to the mystery, OOD samples are never generated by these DGMs despite having higher likelihoods. This two-pronged paradox has yet to be conclusively explained, making likelihood-based OOD detection unreliable. Our primary observation is that high-likelihood regions will not be generated if they contain minimal probability mass. We demonstrate how this seeming contradiction of large densities yet low probability mass can occur around data confined to low-dimensional manifolds. We also show that this scenario can be identified through local intrinsic dimension (LID) estimation, and propose a method for OOD detection which pairs the likelihoods and LID estimates obtained from a pre-trained DGM. Our method can be applied to normalizing flows and score-based diffusion models, and obtains results which match or surpass state-of-the-art OOD detection benchmarks using the same DGM backbones. Our code is available at https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/dgm_ood_detection.</description>

      <title>RLHF Workflow: From Reward Modeling to Online RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the workflow of Online Iterative Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in this technical report, which is widely reported to outperform its offline counterpart by a large margin in the recent large language model (LLM) literature. However, existing open-source RLHF projects are still largely confined to the offline learning setting. In this technical report, we aim to fill in this gap and provide a detailed recipe that is easy to reproduce for online iterative RLHF. In particular, since online human feedback is usually infeasible for open-source communities with limited resources, we start by constructing preference models using a diverse set of open-source datasets and use the constructed proxy preference model to approximate human feedback. Then, we discuss the theoretical insights and algorithmic principles behind online iterative RLHF, followed by a detailed practical implementation. Our trained LLM, LLaMA-3-8B-SFR-Iterative-DPO-R, achieves impressive performance on LLM chatbot benchmarks, including AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench, as well as other academic benchmarks such as HumanEval and TruthfulQA. We have shown that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and iterative RLHF can obtain state-of-the-art performance with fully open-source datasets. Further, we have made our models, curated datasets, and comprehensive step-by-step code guidebooks publicly available.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel training methodology that enables a Transformer model to generalize the addition of two-digit numbers to numbers with unseen lengths of digits. The proposed approach employs an autoregressive generation technique, processing from right to left, which mimics a common manual method for adding large numbers. To the best of my knowledge, this methodology has not been previously explored in the literature. All results are reproducible, and the corresponding R code is available at github.com/AGPatriota/ALGA-R/.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new framework for formulating optimal transport distances between Markov chains. Previously known formulations studied couplings between the entire joint distribution induced by the chains, and derived solutions via a reduction to dynamic programming (DP) in an appropriately defined Markov decision process. This formulation has, however, not led to particularly efficient algorithms so far, since computing the associated DP operators requires fully solving a static optimal transport problem, and these operators need to be applied numerous times during the overall optimization process. In this work, we develop an alternative perspective by considering couplings between a flattened version of the joint distributions that we call discounted occupancy couplings, and show that calculating optimal transport distances in the full space of joint distributions can be equivalently formulated as solving a linear program (LP) in this reduced space. This LP formulation allows us to port several algorithmic ideas from other areas of optimal transport theory. In particular, our formulation makes it possible to introduce an appropriate notion of entropy regularization into the optimization problem, which in turn enables us to directly calculate optimal transport distances via a Sinkhorn-like method we call Sinkhorn Value Iteration (SVI). We show both theoretically and empirically that this method converges quickly to an optimal coupling, essentially at the same computational cost of running vanilla Sinkhorn in each pair of states. Along the way, we point out that our optimal transport distance exactly matches the common notion of bisimulation metrics between Markov chains, and thus our results also apply to computing such metrics, and in fact our algorithm turns out to be significantly more efficient than the best known methods developed so far for this purpose.</description>

      <title>General Distribution Learning: A theoretical framework for Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05666</link>

Abstract: There remain numerous unanswered research questions on deep learning (DL) within the classical learning theory framework. These include the remarkable generalization capabilities of overparametrized neural networks (NNs), the efficient optimization performance despite non-convexity of objectives, the mechanism of flat minima for generalization, and the exceptional performance of deep architectures in solving physical problems. This paper introduces General Distribution Learning (GD Learning), a novel theoretical learning framework designed to address a comprehensive range of machine learning and statistical tasks, including classification, regression and parameter estimation. Departing from traditional statistical machine learning, GD Learning focuses on the true underlying distribution. In GD Learning, learning error, corresponding to the expected error in classical statistical learning framework, is divided into fitting errors due to models and algorithms, as well as sampling errors introduced by limited sampling data. The framework significantly incorporates prior knowledge, especially in scenarios characterized by data scarcity, thereby enhancing performance. Within the GD Learning framework, we demonstrate that the global optimal solutions in non-convex optimization can be approached by minimizing the gradient norm and the non-uniformity of the eigenvalues of the model's Jacobian matrix. This insight leads to the development of the gradient structure control algorithm. GD Learning also offers fresh insights into the questions on deep learning, including overparameterization and non-convex optimization, bias-variance trade-off, and the mechanism of flat minima.</description>
