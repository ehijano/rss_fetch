      <title>When algebra twinks system biology: a conjecture on the structure of Gr\"obner bases in complex chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of identifying all real positive steady states in chemical reaction networks (CRNs) governed by mass-action kinetics. Traditional numerical methods often require specific initial guesses and may fail to find all the solutions in systems exhibiting multistability. Gr\"obner bases offer an algebraic framework that systematically transforms polynomial equations into simpler forms, facilitating comprehensive solution enumeration. In this work, we propose a conjecture that CRNs with at most pairwise interactions yield Gr\"obner bases possessing a near-"triangular" structure, under appropriate assumptions. We illustrate this phenomenon using examples from a gene regulatory network and the Wnt signaling pathway, where the Gr\"obner basis approach reliably captures all real positive solutions. Our computational experiments reveal the potential of Gr\"obner bases to overcome limitations of local numerical methods for finding the steady states of complex biological systems, making them a powerful tool for understanding dynamical processes across diverse biochemical models.</description>

      <title>Incorporating stochastic gene expression, signaling-mediated intercellular interactions, and regulated cell proliferation in models of coordinated tissue development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formulating quantitative and predictive models for tissue development requires consideration of the complex, stochastic gene expression dynamics, its regulation via cell-to-cell interactions, and cell proliferation. Including all of these processes into a practical mathematical framework requires complex expressions that are difficult to interpret and apply. We construct a simple theory that incorporates intracellular stochastic gene expression dynamics, signaling chemicals that influence these dynamics and mediate cell-cell interactions, and cell proliferation and its accompanying differentiation. Cellular states (genetic and epigenetic) are described by a Waddington vector field that allows for non-gradient dynamics (cycles, entropy production, loss of detailed balance) which is precluded in Waddington potential landscape representations of gene expression dynamics. We define an epigenetic fitness landscape that describes the proliferation of different cell types, and elucidate how this fitness landscape is related to Waddington's vector field. We illustrate the applicability of our framework by analyzing two model systems: an interacting two-gene differentiation process and a spatiotemporal organism model inspired by planaria.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Supervised and Self-Supervised Graph Neural Network for Edge-Centric Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel graph-based deep learning model for tasks involving relations between two nodes (edge-centric tasks), where the focus lies on predicting relationships and interactions between pairs of nodes rather than node properties themselves. This model combines supervised and self-supervised learning, taking into account for the loss function the embeddings learned and patterns with and without ground truth. Additionally it incorporates an attention mechanism that leverages both node and edge features. The architecture, trained end-to-end, comprises two primary components: embedding generation and prediction. First, a graph neural network (GNN) transform raw node features into dense, low-dimensional embeddings, incorporating edge attributes. Then, a feedforward neural model processes the node embeddings to produce the final output. Experiments demonstrate that our model matches or exceeds existing methods for protein-protein interactions prediction and Gene Ontology (GO) terms prediction. The model also performs effectively with one-hot encoding for node features, providing a solution for the previously unsolved problem of predicting similarity between compounds with unknown structures.</description>
