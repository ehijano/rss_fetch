      <title>Pedagogic Null Tests of Dynamical Dark Energy Hints: Reconstructing LambdaCDM with Consistent BAO, CMB, and SNe Mocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hints of a dynamical dark-energy equation of state have appeared in several combined cosmological probes. However, such indications may instead arise from the intrinsic likelihood geometry of individual datasets, residual inter-probe tension, or restrictive priors. These factors can mimic evidence for dynamical dark energy. To clarify these issues, we perform a controlled null test. We use realistic mock BAO, CMB, and Type~Ia supernova datasets generated from a common fiducial LambdaCDM cosmology. These mocks include the DESI~DR2 BAO covariance, the Planck~2018 distance-prior covariance, and the full Pantheon+ SH0ES supernova covariance. This setup isolates physical information from geometric or statistical effects in the CPL parametrization. We find that individual probes and most two-probe combinations show apparent deviations in the (w0,wa) plane. These could be mistaken for phantom crossing or evolving dark energy. Two-probe combinations including supernovae (BAO+SNe, CMB+SNe) recover values near (w0,wa)=(-1,0) but fail to reconstruct (Omegam0,H0), because SNe do not determine the absolute distance scale. Combinations without SNe (BAO+CMB), as well as any single dataset, retain strong degeneracy directions. These produce significant shifts driven purely by likelihood geometry. These behaviors arise because BAO, CMB, and SNe each constrain only one principal direction in (w0,wa) space. Their degeneracy ridges are misaligned due to distinct redshift sensitivities. In contrast, the full BAO+CMB+SNe likelihood with proper covariance breaks all degeneracies simultaneously. It cleanly recovers the fiducial cosmology, including (w0,wa)=(-1,0) and (Omegam0,H0). Our results provide a transparent benchmark for assessing future claims of omega(z) neq -1. They emphasize the need for complete multi-probe analyses with flexible H0 and rd priors.</description>

      <title>Evolution mapping III: A new recipe for the halo mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new prescription for the halo mass function (HMF) built upon the Evolution Mapping framework. This approach provides a physical motivation to parametrise the non-universality of the HMF in terms of the recent history of structure formation and the local shape of the linear matter power spectrum. Our model was calibrated against measurements from N-body simulations, with halo samples defined by ten overdensity thresholds, $\Delta$, ranging from 150 to 1600 times the mean background matter density. For our reference mass definition, $\Delta=200$, the calibrated fitting function achieves per cent-level accuracy across a wide range of masses, redshifts, and structure formation histories, and maintains this performance when tested on cosmologies with different linear power spectrum shapes. This high level of accuracy is maintained across other mass definitions, degrading only slightly to the 5 per cent level at the highest values of $\Delta$. We also provide fitting formulae to interpolate the parameters as a function of $\Delta$, which allows for accurate modelling of HMFs defined by intermediate overdensities, with accuracy still well within 5 per cent when tested on halo catalogues defined by the virial overdensity threshold. Compared to other commonly used recipes, our prescription yields competitive or superior accuracy across all redshifts and cosmologies, successfully capturing the non-universal features of the HMF where other models exhibit systematic deviations. This work provides a high-precision modelling tool for cluster abundance analyses, and demonstrates the power of the evolution mapping framework for building accurate models of observables in the non-linear regime.</description>

      <title>A continuous parameterization of the cosmic web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic properties of galaxies are influenced by their environments, underscoring the environment's critical role in galaxy formation and evolution. Traditionally, these environments are categorized into four fixed classifications: knots, filaments, walls, and voids, which collectively describe the complex organization of galaxies within large-scale structures. We propose an alternative description that complements the traditional quadripartite categorization by introducing a continuous framework, allowing for a more nuanced examination of the relationship between the intrinsic properties of galaxies and their environments. This complementary description is applied using one of the most prevalent methodologies: categorization using the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix extracted from the matter density field. We integrated our findings into a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, combined with cosmological numerical simulations, to analyze how the intrinsic properties of galaxies are influenced by environmental changes. In our study, we find a continuous distribution of eigenvalue ratios, revealing a clear dependence of galaxy properties on their surrounding environments. This method allowed us to identify critical values at which transitions in the behavior of key astrophysical galaxy properties become evident.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the impact of selection effects on FRB DM-$z$ relation cosmological inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as powerful probes of baryonic matter in the Universe, offering constraints on cosmological and feedback parameters through their extragalactic dispersion measure-redshift (DM$_\mathrm{exgal}$-$z$) relation. However, the observed FRB population is shaped by complex selection effects arising from instrument sensitivity, DM-dependent search efficiency, and FRB source population redshift-evolution. In this work, we quantify the impact of such observational and population selection effects on cosmological inference derived from the conditional distribution $p(\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{exgal}}|z)$. Using forward-modeled FRB population simulations, we explore progressively realistic survey scenarios incorporating redshift evolution, luminosity function, and instrument DM selection function. To enable rapid likelihood evaluations, we build a neural-network emulator for the variance in cosmic DM, $\sigma^2[\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{cosmic}}(z)]$, trained on $5\times10^4$ baryonification halo-model simulations, achieving $\leq4\%$ accuracy up to $z=4$. We demonstrate that while redshift and DM-dependent selection effects substantially alter the joint distribution $p(\mathrm{DM},z)$, they have a negligible impact on the conditional distribution $p(\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{exgal}}|z)$ for current sample sizes. The parameter biases are $\lesssim0.8\sigma$ for $10^2$ FRBs, indicating that conditional analyses are robust for present surveys. However, depending on the survey DM-dependent search efficiency, these biases may exceed $3\sigma$ for $10^4$ FRBs, thus implying that explicit modeling of selection effects will be essential for next-generation samples.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Cosmological Model Degeneracy with a new evaluate factor G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of fitting cosmological models, parameter degeneracy remains a central issue. This paper critically examines traditional methods for constraining parameters and focuses on the G factor as a tool for evaluating the quality of observational data. To ensure analytical independence, two datasets--Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO)--were utilized as samples for parameter fitting, supplemented by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. The Figure of Merit (FoM) matrix served as the final criterion for assessing fitting performance. The results show that the G factor of the CC dataset increases linearly with redshift z, whereas the G factor of the BAO dataset follows a cubic relationship. Further analysis indicates that the FoM value for datasets with high G factors is significantly higher than that for datasets with low G factors, thereby validating the G factor's effectiveness as a tool for assessing observational data quality and reducing parameter degeneracy. This suggests that the G factor may serve as a diagnostic tool and selection criterion for optimizing observational datasets in future research.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter Substructure with Image Number Anomaly in Strong Lensing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing observables, including anomalies in image positions, flux ratios, and time delays, serve as usual probes of dark matter (DM) substructure. When dark matter substructure possesses sufficient perturbations, it may lead to the formation of extra images in otherwise canonical doubly or quadruply imaged systems. With the advent of increasingly precise observational instruments, previously undetectable images may become measurable and image number anomalies therefore could be an increasingly viable method. In this paper, we utilize the gravitational lensing phenomenon of image number anomaly to derive constraints on dark matter substructure. We present the extra images induced by distinct forms of DM substructure, specifically primordial black holes (PBHs) and fuzzy dark matter (FDM) and show that higher angular resolution observations increase the probability of detecting additional lensed images. Based on a null detection of image number anomalies in a sample of 3500 lens systems generated from the \textit{Strong Lensing Halo model-based mock catalogs} (SL-Hammocks), we derive upper limits on the abundance of PBHs. At the 95\% confidence level, the PBH abundance is constrained to $\lesssim 0.125\%$, $0.08\%$, and $0.04\%$ for PBH masses in the range $\sim 10^{7}$--$10^{9}~M_{\odot}$, corresponding to angular resolutions of $0.1''$, $0.05''$, and $0.01''$, respectively. Similarly, we exclude particle masses below $0.4$, $0.6$, and $3.5 \times 10^{-22} \ \mathrm{eV}$ for FDM at the same confidence level for the respective resolutions. Furthermore, the abundance of PBHs $\lesssim 0.9\%$ could be constrained at an angular resolution of $0.5''$ for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Observations. Finally, we discuss methodologies for identifying image number anomalies in special cases and demonstrate feasibility using a fitting procedure.</description>

      <title>Constraining non-minimally coupled squared-Quartic Hilltop Inflation in light of ACT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of the data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) with the recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) indicate that the scalar spectral index \( n_s \) has a larger value than the Planck 2018 which leads to tension within standard inflationary models. In this study in order to explain the new data, We consider the squared-Quartic Hilltop inflation potential \( V(\phi) = V_0 [1 - \lambda (\phi/M_p)^4]^2 \) within the Einstein and Jordan frames. In the Jordan frame we introduce the coupling term \( \xi \phi^2 R \) and we calculate analytic expressions for the slow-roll parameters, scalar spectral index, and tensor-to-scalar ratio on the weak and strong coupling regimes. In the weak limit (\( \xi \ll 1 \)), perturbative corrections slightly increase \( n_s \) and suppress \( r \), leading to \( n_s \simeq 0.9743 \) and \( r \sim 7.8 \times 10^{-5} \) for representative parameters \( \lambda = 10^{-3}, \xi = 10^{-3}, {\cal N} = 117 \), values which are in agreement with the joint Planck--ACT--DESI (P-ACT-LB) constraints. On the other hand, for a strong coupled (\( \xi \gg 1 \)), the conformal rescaling provides an exponentially flat potential plateau, which allows us to calculate \( n_s \approx 0.9743 \) with \( r \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-4} \) for \( {\cal N} = 65{-}70 \), consistent with ACT and BK18 bounds. The associated energy scale of inflation, \( V_0^{1/4} \sim 10^{-3}{-}10^{-2} M_p \), remains compatible with high-scale inflationary scenarios.</description>

      <title>Angular clustering and bias of photometric quasars in the Kilo-Degree Survey Data Release 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the angular clustering and effective bias of photometrically selected quasars in the Kilo-Degree Survey Data Release 4 (KiDS DR4). We update the previous photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) of the KiDS quasars using Hybrid-z, a deep learning framework combining four-band KiDS images and nine-band KiDS+VIKING magnitudes. Hybrid-z is trained on the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR1 and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR17 quasars matching with KiDS, and achieves average bias $\langle \delta z \rangle &lt; 0.01$ and scatter $\sim 0.04(1 + z)$ on a test sample. The updated catalog of $\sim 157k$ quasars over $777~\mathrm{deg}^2$ is divided into four tomographic bins spanning $0.1 \leq z_{\mathrm{phot}} \leq 2.7$. In each bin, we measure the angular two-point correlation function and compare it with theoretical predictions for dark matter clustering. We estimate the best-fit scale-independent quasar bias, which increases from $b \approx 1.6$ at $z \approx 0.6$ to $b \approx 4.0$ at $z \approx 2.2$, and is well matched by a quadratic relation in redshift. Our clustering analysis indicates that KiDS quasars reside in dark matter halos of mass $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{eff}}/h^{-1}M_\odot)$ in the range $\sim 12.7$--$12.9$ and effective peak heights $\nu_{\mathrm{eff}}$ rising from $\sim 1.5$ to $2.9$ over our redshift span. We study two systematics that could affect the bias derivation: stellar contamination and the redshift distribution assumed in the theoretical modeling. The former has a negligible effect, whereas the latter significantly impacts the derived $b(z)$, emphasizing the importance of redshift calibration. Our work is the first cosmological application of quasars selected from KiDS and paves the way for future extensions in the final KiDS DR5, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, or the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope.</description>

      <title>Effect of the Memory Burden on Primordial Black Hole Hot Spots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When primordial black holes (PBHs) evaporate, they deposit energy in the surrounding plasma, leading to temperature gradients, or hot spots, that evolve during the evaporation process. Motivated by recent studies suggesting that a memory burden may slow down PBH evaporation, we explore how a suppression of the evaporation rate affects the morphology of such hot spots. We include such a suppression in the form of transfer functions and derive general formulas for the hot-spot core temperature and radius. Applying our results to illustrative scenarios, we find that in the vanilla memory burden scenario in which the evaporation rate and Hawking temperature are exactly constant, the hot-spot temperature is substantially lowered. Nonetheless, we show that alternative scenarios may lead to sizeable hot spots with morphologies that differ significantly from the semi-classical case.</description>

      <title>Moving superfluids in the rotating universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study homogeneous cosmological models featuring shift-symmetric scalar fields (or, superfluids) in relative motion. In the presence of anisotropy this universe generally features rotation, in the sense that the principal axes of anisotropic expansion rotate with respect to the cosmic comoving frame. We focus in particular on the minimal case of two superfluids in 2+1 dimensions. The momentum constraint enforces their spatial gradients to be collinear and the dynamics tends to align such a direction with that of maximal expansion at late times. As opposed to the recently studied case of solids, rotation plays a more important role in the present two-superfluids model. The associated energy density does not dilute away but scales as that of anisotropy and affects the total equation of state. We find that purely non-rotating solutions correspond to an unstable surface in phase space in the direction of non-vanishing rotation. This suggests that rotation is a crucial feature of these scenarios that cannot be neglected.</description>

      <title>How Significant are Cosmological Collider Signals in the Planck Data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) is theoretically well motivated but remains observationally challenging. Tight constraints with low significance for the standard non-Gaussian shapes suggest that detection may lie beyond the reach of near-future experiments. However, tests of PNG are highly template-dependent. From a theory perspective, a whole new family of bispectrum shapes arise in the cosmological collider program, with distinct signatures of heavy particles during inflation. In this work, we provide a class of simplified collider templates for these particles that encompasses a broader range of masses, sound speeds, and interactions. We propose that, given the current state of observations, the most effective strategy to search for PNG signals is through orthogonalizing the collider templates, such that they are uncorrelated with the tightly constrained single field predictions. Using the Modal pipeline and Planck CMB data, we perform a systematic parameter scan of the collider templates with the most significant result reaching $2.4\sigma$ for spin-0, after taking into account the look-elsewhere effect; indicative results for spin-1 and spin-2 peak near 2$\sigma$. These results indicate that, with refined collider templates and improved data analysis strategies, there are credible prospects with forthcoming observations to detect PNG and also rule out single field inflation.</description>

      <title>Growth of Cosmic Strings with Field-Dependent Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel mechanism to produce a cosmic network of fundamental superstrings based on a time-varying string tension has been recently proposed. It has been found that fundamental superstrings can grow in a kinating background driven by the rolling of the volume modulus of Type IIB string compactifications towards the minimum of its potential. In this talk, I will generalise this analysis using dynamical systems techniques. First, I will analyse the cosmological growth of strings with a field-dependent tension in a Universe filled with a perfect fluid, finding a growth region in the phase space of this system. This machinery is then applied to both fundamental superstrings and effective strings obtained from wrapping $p$-branes on $(p-1)$- dimensional cycles. I will show how cosmological growth can be achieved in both cases not only in kinating backgrounds, but also in scaling fixed points. This talk is based on arXiv:2502.14953.</description>

      <title>HIDES -- I. The population and diversity of HI-rich 'dark' galaxies in the Hestia and Auriga simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present our investigation of HI-rich 'Dark' galaxiEs in Simulations (HIDES), specifically using the Hestia and Auriga simulations in this work. We select galaxies that are faint ($M_g &gt; -10$) and contain sufficient HI ($M_\mathrm{HI} &gt; 10^5\,M_\odot$), and identify 89 such objects, only one of which is completely starless. Their demographics generally converge across simulations of different resolution, with $M_{200} \sim 10^{9.5}\,M_\odot$, $M_\mathrm{gas} \sim 10^{7.4}\,M_\odot$, $M_\mathrm{HI} \sim 10^{6.5}\,M_\odot$, $M_\mathrm{*} \sim 10^{5.6}\,M_\odot$, low gas metallicity, little or no current star formation, and a mean stellar age of $\sim$ 11 Gyr, and with some of them can survive in dense environments as close as $\sim$ 300 kpc from a Milky-Way mass neighbor. We find a large scatter in their HI density profiles and $M_\mathrm{HI} - M_\mathrm{*}$ relation, which cannot be fully explained by current halo mass or concentration, but can be attributed to ram pressure stripping in dense environments, past mergers, and stellar feedback. In particular, close encounters with massive halos and dense environments can reshape the HI content, which may explain the asymmetric HI map of an intriguing observed analogue, Cloud-9. An empirical fit, $n = 0.25 \left(d_\mathrm{MW}/{1\,\mathrm{Mpc}}\right)^{-1.4}\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$, based on their number density extended to 3.7 Mpc in constrained local volume simulations, is also provided to aid observational forecasts. We conclude that both mass assembly history and environmental history play a crucial role in the formation and subsequent diversity of these galaxies.</description>

      <title>WIMP Meets ALP: Coherent Freeze-Out of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the cosmological history of a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) coupled to a light axion-like particle (ALP) via a quadratic coupling. Although the coupling is too feeble to thermalize the ALP, coherent forward scattering between the two sectors induces temperature-dependent mass shifts that substantially modify both WIMP freeze-out and ALP misalignment dynamics, giving rise to a novel coherent freeze-out mechanism. At high temperatures, the WIMP thermal bath spontaneously breaks the symmetry of the ALP potential, displacing the field to a new vacuum. The resulting back-reaction reduces the WIMP effective mass and delays its freeze-out. Depending on the strength of the coupling, symmetry restoration occurs via either a first-order phase transition (FOPT) or a crossover. In the FOPT regime, dark matter consists solely of WIMPs, whose delayed freeze-out permits annihilation cross sections up to two (five) orders of magnitude above the standard value for $s$-wave ($p$-wave) annihilation, while still yielding the correct relic density. In the crossover regime, both WIMP and ALP can contribute to dark matter. Remarkably, we find an "ALP miracle": a Planck-suppressed quadratic coupling yields an ALP abundance comparable to the observed dark matter density, largely independent of its initial displacement and mass.</description>

      <title>In-depth analysis of the clustering of dark matter particles around primordial black holes. Part II. Analytical prescriptions for spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are very appealing dark matter (DM) candidates. It is highly plausible though, should they exist, that they would not make up all of the DM. Several studies showed that if the rest of DM is made of thermal particles, then these should accumulate around such PBHs, leading to the formation of very dense spikes in the radiation era. We contributed a detailed analytical study about this phenomenon, providing clear explanations as for the origin of scaling relations in the form of power-law density profiles with up to 3 different spectral indices, i.e. $3/4$, $3/2$, and $9/4$, and 4 asymptotic regimes. Here, we further derive an approximate analytical solution that enables fast numerical predictions for the density profiles of these spikes. We also address the specific case of self-annihilating DM species and derive new approximate analytical formulae. Our approximate density yields the correct annihilation rate within $\pm 15\%$ precision. We then focus on indirect detection in the cosmic microwave background and in extragalactic gamma-rays. We shed new and subtle light on how mutually exclusive PBHs and self-annihilating DM species can really be. In particular, the discovery of a population of sub-solar PBHs would set stringent constraints on the $s$-wave annihilation cross-section of these particles, a point so far missed in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work, we developed a method for computing two-point correlators by decomposing the mode degrees of freedom into fast and slow components. Building on this framework, we present a numerical implementation to study the evolution of primordial scalar perturbations under controlled state deformations induced by the simplest environment corrections from the Lindblad equation. Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range. The resulting outputs are compatible with nonlinear numerical codes, enabling studies of how decoherence effects propagate during reheating.</description>

      <title>Accelerating parameter estimation for parameterized tests of general relativity with gravitational-wave observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tests of general relativity (GR) with gravitational waves (GWs) introduce additional deviation parameters in the waveform model. The enlarged parameter space makes inference computationally costly, which has so far limited systematic, large-scale studies that are essential to quantify degeneracies, check effect of waveform systematics, and assess robustness across non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise effects. The need is even sharper for next-generation (XG) observatories where signals are longer, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are higher, and likelihood evaluations increase substantially. We address this by applying relative binning to the TIGER framework for parameterized tests of GR. Relative binning replaces dense frequency evaluations with evaluations on adaptively chosen frequency bins, reducing the cost per likelihood call while preserving posterior accuracy. Using simulated binary black hole signals, we demonstrate unbiased recovery for GR-consistent cases and targeted non-GR deviations, and we map how bin resolution controls accuracy, with fine binning primarily required for the $-1$ post-Newtonian term. A high-SNR simulated signal at next-generation sensitivity further shows accurate recovery with tight posteriors. Applied to GW150914 and GW250114, both single and multi-parameter TIGER analyses finish within a day, yielding deviation bounds consistent with GR at 90\% credibility and in agreement with previous results. Across analyses, the method reduces wall time by factors of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ to $\mathcal{O}(100)$, depending on frequency range and binning, without degrading parameter estimation accuracy.</description>

Abstract: (abridged) After more than 10yr of ALMA operations, the community interest in conducting deep, extra-galactic, millimetre surveys resulted in varying strategic compromises between areal size and map depth to survey the sky. The current bias leans towards a galaxy population found in the field or towards rich star-bursty proto-cluster groups, both tendentiously surveyed at coarse spatial resolutions. Here, we describe a deep 3mm ALMA survey in long-baselines on a 1x1arcmin2 region in the Hubble Deep Field South, also covered by the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) in order to assess resolved molecular gas properties in galaxies in group environments at z&gt;1. ALMA observations comprising a 4-pointing mosaic with a single Band3 (3mm) spectral tuning were conducted to cover CO transitions from different groups identified by MUSE. This work consists in a total effective time on source of 61h in configurations with up to 15km baselines. The final data-set yields an angular resolution of 0.15"-0.2" (imaging weights dependent) and maximum recoverable scales of 1"-2". The final continuum map reaches a sensitivity of rms~2uJy/beam, allowing the detection of three sources at 3mm (only one showing multi-wavelength counterparts). Moreover, we detect six line emitters associated with CO J=2-1 at zspec=1.284, one of them previously undetected by MUSE and none detected in 3mm continuum. The inter-stellar medium gas masses range from ~2E9 to ~9E10 Msun (adopting alphaCO=4Msun/(K.km/s.pc2), including Helium). Overall, this galaxy group is quite diverse with no two galaxies alike, some showing clear physical offsets with respect to Hubble imaging tracing rest-frame ultra-violet emission. We also derive cosmic molecular gas mass densities using this sample as a reference for group environments, and we find that these yield comparable densities as the galaxy population found in field environments.</description>

Abstract: In relativistic cosmology, the formation of nonlinear inhomogeneities can induce non-negligible backreaction on late-time expansion. Among the important consequences for precision cosmology is the potential impact on the linear growth of large-scale structures. We address this impact by combining covariant spatial averaging with covariant and gauge-invariant perturbation theory. We focus on irrotational dust model spacetimes. The effects of backreaction and nontrivial dynamical curvature on the average cosmological dynamics are formulated as the addition of an effective perfect fluid with pressure. We then introduce an effective background driven by both the averaged dust density and the emergent effective fluid, and derive the general evolution equations for linear perturbations of this system. The residual freedom in this framework amounts to specifying the properties of the effective-fluid perturbations as a closure condition. We analyse two physically motivated choices for this condition. In addition, we clarify the conditions under which the coupling between linear structure growth and perturbations of the effective fluid can be neglected. Finally, we apply this formalism to four examples of averaged cosmological models from the literature, three of which -- intended as effective full descriptions of the largest scales -- have been shown to provide a good fit to observational data. Our results highlight the importance of backreaction effects in shaping linear structure growth in such models. Neglecting these effects may thus lead to biased predictions for the development of large structures, even when the models provide a good description of the general background observables.</description>

      <title>Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO): Options for robust Deep Spectral Line Imaging in the SKA-Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The data storage requirements for deep spectral line observations with next-generation radio interferometers like the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are extremely challenging. The default strategy is to reduce data after each daily observation and stack the resulting images. Although this approach is computationally efficient, it risks propagating systematic errors and significantly degrades the final data quality. However, storage and computation requirements for a traditional way to image the entire deep dataset together are prohibitively expensive. We present an alternative \textit{uv}-grid stacking method and compare its scientific outcomes with both the traditional approach, which processes all data jointly and serves as the best-possible result, and the default image-stacking method. Our technique involves halting the standard imaging pipeline after the daily residual visibility grids are formed. These grids are then stacked and jointly deconvolved to combine many epochs of data. Using the traditional approach as a benchmark, we show that image-stacking recovers only 92\% of the true {\HI} flux. In contrast, our \textit{uv}-grid stacking method recovers 99\%, which is in excellent agreement with the traditional method within the noise limits. Furthermore, image-stacking introduces significant non-physical artefacts, such as negative bowls around strong sources, indicating poor deconvolution and a loss of physical information. Based on these findings, we intend to apply the \textit{uv}-grid stacking to the Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) survey on ASKAP and strongly recommend this or a similar approach for future radio astronomy facilities.</description>

      <title>Quasar clustering and duty cycle measurements at $0\leq z\leq 4$ with the Gaia-unWISE Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the two-point correlation function of a uniformly selected, all-sky sample of $\sim$1.3 million quasars with magnitudes $G\leq20.5$ from the Gaia--unWISE Quasar Catalog (Quaia) over the redshift range $0 \leq z \leq 4$ to trace the evolution of the quasar clustering strength across cosmic time. We find a steady increase in the correlation length $r_0$ with redshift, i.e. $r_0 = 6.8 \pm 0.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $0 \leq z &lt; 1$, $r_0=8.0 \pm 0.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $1 \leq z &lt; 2$, $r_0=10.8 \pm 0.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $2 \leq z &lt; 3$, and $r_0=13.9 \pm 1.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $3 \leq z &lt; 4$, and slopes consistent with $\gamma \approx 2$. Our measurements suggest a slightly weaker clustering signal at $z&gt;3$ than previous studies, and thus we find a smooth, monotonic rise in clustering strength. Using a bias-halo mass relation and a step-function for the halo occupation distribution, we infer characteristic minimum halo masses of quasar hosts of $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{min}}/M_\odot) \approx 12.8$ across all redshifts. Combining these with the observed quasar number densities yields duty cycles that rise from $f_{\mathrm{duty}} \approx 2\%$ to $\approx 7\%$ with increasing redshift, corresponding to integrated quasar lifetimes of $t_{\rm QSO}\sim10^8$~years. These results suggest that both the characteristic halo mass of active quasars and their typical lifetimes have remained remarkably stable over more than $12 \sim$ Gyr of cosmic time, implying a self-regulated growth process largely independent of epoch.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the prospects for detecting a parity-violating gravitational-wave background (GWB) with third-generation ground-based detector networks. We focus on a network consisting of one Einstein Telescope (ET) and two Cosmic Explorer (CE) detectors. In our analysis we vary the ET design, detector orientations, and arm lengths, in order to assess the impact of geometry and scale on detection capabilities. We demonstrate that networks with an L-shaped ET design have stronger parity violation constraining power than networks with a triangular ET design, particularly seen when studying ET designs on their own.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the dynamics of the self-induced collapse of the tachyon wave function in inflationary scenarios. We analyze the modifications on the power spectrum by considering the $\beta$-exponential potential, whose parameters have updated constraints by the Planck 2018 baseline data and recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Moreover, we show that for this kind of potential, just for a narrow range of $\beta$-parameter, there is agreement between the theoretical predictions and the current observational data. Considering the proposal for a collapse scheme that leads to the modification of Schr\"odinger evolution of the inflation wave function from the employment of a Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) approach, we derive the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio. We then obtained the constraints on both collapse and $\beta$-parameters that, in turn, yield deviations in the $n_{s}$ vs. $r$ plane when compared to the $\beta$-exponential potential standard estimate. The CSL scheme applied to tachyonic inflation driven by a $\beta$-potential offers an adequate description of the recent data.</description>

      <title>Generalized framework for likelihood-based field-level inference of growth rate from velocity and density fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring the growth rate of large-scale structures (f) as a function of redshift has the potential to break degeneracies between modified gravity and dark energy models, when combined with expansion-rate probes. Direct estimates of peculiar velocities of galaxies have attracted interest as a means of estimating $f\sigma_8$. In particular, field-level methods can be used to fit the field nuisance parameter along with cosmological parameters simultaneously. This article aims to provide the community with a unified framework for the theoretical modeling of the likelihood-based field-level inference by performing fast field covariance calculations for velocity and density fields. Our purpose is to lay the foundations for a nonlinear extension of the likelihood-based method at the field level. We have developed a generalized framework, implemented in the dedicated software flip to perform a likelihood-based inference of $f\sigma_8$. We derived a new field covariance model, which includes wide-angle corrections. We also included the models previously described in the literature inside our framework. We compared their performance against ours, and we validated our model by comparing it with the two-point statistics of a recent N-body simulation. The tests we performed have allowed us to validate our software and determine the appropriate wavenumber range to integrate our covariance model and its validity in terms of separation. Our framework allows for a wider wavenumber coverage to be used in our calculations than in previous works. Finally, our generalized framework allows us to efficiently perform a survey geometry-dependent Fisher forecast of the $f\sigma_8$ parameter. We show that the Fisher forecast method we developed gives an error bar that is 30 % closer to a full likelihood-based estimation than a standard volume Fisher forecast.</description>

      <title>DESI DR1 Ly{\alpha} 1D power spectrum: The Fast Fourier Transform estimator measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09493</link>

Abstract: We present the one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ forest power spectrum measurement derived from the data release 1 (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The measurement of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest power spectrum along the line of sight from high-redshift quasar spectra provides information on the shape of the linear matter power spectrum, neutrino masses, and the properties of dark matter. In this work, we use a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based estimator, which is validated on synthetic data in a companion paper. Compared to the FFT measurement performed on the DESI early data release, we improve the noise characterization with a cross-exposure estimator and test the robustness of our measurement using various data splits. We also refine the estimation of the uncertainties and now present an estimator for the covariance matrix of the measurement. Furthermore, we compare our results to previous high-resolution and eBOSS measurements. In another companion paper, we present the same DR1 measurement using the Quadratic Maximum Likelihood Estimator (QMLE). These two measurements are consistent with each other and constitute the most precise one-dimensional power spectrum measurement to date, while being in good agreement with results from the DESI early data release.</description>

      <title>Did the Corona Borealis-A2142 supercluster binary-like system originate as a proto-cluster binary embedded in a primordial cloud of galaxies?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of the giant binary-like system composed by the Corona Borealis and Abell 2142 superclusters is an intriguing conundrum of the formation of large scale structures since, from the observational point of view, it represents a rare peculiarity in the distribution of massive galaxy superclusters. Having a configuration similar to a giant binary system interconnected by a huge filament, it is likely one if not the unique case to date observed in the Local Universe. So a question arise: how and when did it form? Here, the CrB and A2142 system has been hypothesized to be a descendent of a primordial binary system composed of two close galaxy proto-clusters, the CrB and A2142, originated from two independent collapsing process within a dense cloud of galaxies. Then, assuming that at a certain point the decoupling occurred due to the interplay of gravity-antigravity of DE, they began to move away in radial motion from each other following the accelerate expansion of the Universe. In the context of the LCDM model a Newtonian approximation of the two body motion in presence of DE has been applied using current physical parameters of the CrB and A2142 system with the aim to calculate the look-back time at decoupling. Its compatibility with the era of formation of the primordial galaxy proto-clusters has been tested. The event of the binary decoupling happened in a time larger than the age of the Universe! Of course, after such a result the advanced hypothesis on the origins of the CrB-A2142 system can be rejected, but not the test of compatibility since the look-back time at the error lower limit is 12.5 Gys ( z = 4.5) largely consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>$w_{dm}$-$w_{de}$ cosmological model with new data samples of cosmological observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit a cosmological model where dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) follow barotropic equations of state, allowing deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework (i.e. $w_{dm} \neq 0$, $w_{de} \neq -1$), considering both flat and non-flat curvature. Using a dynamical system approach, we identify equilibrium states that govern stability, expansion, and contraction. Expansion occurs when $H&gt;0$, while contraction is linked to $H &lt; 0$. Accelerated expansion arises from DE dominance, whereas radiation- and matter-dominated phases lead to deceleration. Some solutions are unphysical due to density constraints, but viable cases offer insights into cosmic transitions, including the Einstein static universe, which allows for shifts between accelerating and decelerating phases. We perform a Bayesian analysis with updated datasets, including observational Hubble data, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae, strong lensing systems, baryon acoustic oscillations and cosmic microwave background, to constrain the parameters $w_{dm}$ and $w_{de}$. Our results from the data joint analysis show consistency with $\Lambda$CDM within $3\sigma$, but none of the cases reproduce $w_{dm} = 0$ and $w_{de} = -1$. Nevertheless, the comparison with the standard model using the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria indicates that only the non-flat scenario has the potential to be competitive. This suggests that a non-dust-like DM may impact structure formation, while DE could shift toward quintessence fluid. While $\Lambda$CDM remains a strong model, our findings indicate that alternative dark sector models with non-standard EoS could be viable and offer new insights into cosmic evolution.</description>

      <title>Revealing Limitation in the Standard Cosmological Model: A Redshift-Dependent Hubble Constant from Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major issue in contemporary cosmology is the persistent discrepancy, known as the Hubble tension, between the Hubble constant ($H_0$) estimates from local measurements and those inferred from early-Universe observations under the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm. Recent advances have identified fast radio bursts (FRBs), a class of extragalactic phenomena observable at considerable redshifts, as a promising observational tool for probing late-time cosmology. In this study, we incorporate two complementary methodologies, machine learning algorithms and Bayesian analysis, on a set of localized FRBs to rigorously test the consistency of the $\Lambda$CDM model at late cosmic epochs. Our results reveal a statistically significant redshift-dependent variation of $H_0$ when using separate priors on baryon density parameters $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$ or $\Omega_\mathrm{b}h^2$, indicating contradiction to the core postulate of $\Lambda$CDM. However, when the priors are combined, this redshift dependence disappears, yielding a consistent estimate of $H_0$. We further validate that the redshift dependency of $H_0$ can be removed within the more flexible framework of $w_0w_a$CDM model even without combining the priors. These findings highlight that the redshift evolution of $H_0$ is not merely an artifact of the standard model but an indication of a deeper inadequacy in the $\Lambda$CDM model, supporting the need for a more flexible cosmological framework.</description>

      <title>The resummation model in FLAMINGO: precisely predicting matter power suppression from observed halo baryon fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to derive unbiased cosmological parameters from Stage-IV surveys, we need models that can predict the matter power spectrum for at least $k\,\lesssim\,10\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$ with percent-level accuracy. The main challenge in this endeavour is that baryonic feedback significantly redistributes matter on large scales, but to an unknown degree. Here, we present an improved version of the "resummation" model, which maps observed halo baryon fractions of massive haloes ($M_{\mathrm{500c}}\gtrsim 10^{12.5}\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) to a flexible suppression signal - i.e. the ratio of baryonic to dark-matter-only (DMO) matter power spectra - using zero free parameters. We calibrate this model to the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations, obtaining a typical accuracy of $\lesssim 1\%$ for $k\,\leq\,10\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$ given mean halo baryon fractions within the spherical overdensity radii $R_{\mathrm{500c}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{200m}}$. When only those within $R_{\mathrm{500c}}$ are available, we still obtain $\lesssim 2\%$ accuracy. We show that given small-scale stellar mass fractions, the model can be extended to yield $\lesssim 3\%$ accurate suppression signals for all scales measured ($k\,\leq\,25\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$). We also extend the model to redshifts $z&gt;0$. Central to the model is a seemingly mass-independent and feedback-independent relation that allows observed halo masses to be mapped to equivalent DMO halo masses using only observed mean halo baryon fractions, to $\lesssim 1\%$ accuracy. This relation can also be used to retrieve the DMO halo mass function from observed halo masses and baryon fractions with percent-level accuracy, without any assumptions on the strength of feedback. A Python package implementing the resummation model is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Kinetic Preheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that violent kinetic preheating following inflation can lead to the formation of black holes in the early Universe. In $\alpha$-attractor models with derivative inflaton couplings, nonlinear amplification of field fluctuations drives large spacetime curvature and gravitational collapse shortly after inflation ends. Using fully general-relativistic lattice simulations, we find that these dynamics produce black holes with masses of order tens of grams at sub-horizon scales, without requiring large primordial curvature perturbations. Although such micro-black holes evaporate rapidly via Hawking radiation, their formation modifies the post-inflationary equation of state and their evaporation can successfully reheat the Universe before Big Bang nucleosynthesis. These results identify kinetic preheating as a new, efficient channel for black-hole production and establish a direct connection between inflationary symmetries and strong-gravity phenomena at reheating.</description>

      <title>Redshift-Frame Systematics and Their Impact on the Hubble Constant from Pantheon+ Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a full-sky, covariance-weighted quantification of redshift-frame systematics in the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova sample with the explicit goal of determining whether such effects can meaningfully bias the inferred Hubble constant. Using 1,543 unique SNe with heliocentric and CMB-frame redshifts, we detect statistically significant but physically small residuals: a monopole offset $\langle z_{\rm CMB} - z_{\rm HEL}\rangle = (-3.8 \pm 0.1)\times 10^{-4}$ and a kinematic dipole with amplitude $A = (1.5 \pm 0.1)\times 10^{-3}$ aligned to within $1^\circ$ of the CMB dipole. When propagated through the full Pantheon+ STAT+SYS covariance matrix, these residuals shift the inferred Hubble constant by only $\Delta H_0 = 0.07~{\rm km,s^{-1},Mpc^{-1}}$, corresponding to about $1%$ of the present $5$--$6~{\rm km,s^{-1},Mpc^{-1}}$ Hubble tension. This shows that redshift-frame inconsistencies in Pantheon+ cannot contribute more than a percent-level fraction of the $H_0$ discrepancy. We therefore rule out a class of proposed explanations attributing the Hubble tension to SN redshift-frame errors.</description>

      <title>Reheating and Inflationary dynamics driven by an inverse tangent potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the early universe inflation and the post-inflation reheating era employing an inverse tangent potential of the form $V=V_0 \cdot[tan^{-1}(\frac{\kappa \phi}{m_p})]^2$, where $\kappa$ is a free parameter of the potential and $m_p$ is the reduced Planck mass. We derive the slow roll parameters, the number of e-folds(N), the scalar spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and the tensor spectral index $n_T$ for the inverse tangent potential. We examine the inflationary observables using the data of the Planck-2018 and recent ACT collaboration and obtain constraints on the potential parameter $\kappa$. We also employ a reheating analysis by invoking the conservation of entropy between today and the time when reheating starts. We obtain bounds on the reheating temperature $T_{re}$ and the number of e-folds of the reheating $N_{re}$ using the spectral-index $n_s$ constraints from Planck 2018 and the ACT results. We show that this inverse-tangent potential can act as an alternative to the standard inflationary potentials like Starobinsky which are excluded at $2\sigma$ level by the recent sixth data release (DR6) of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning mitigation of foregrounds and beam effects in 21-cm intensity mapping using hybrid frequency differencing and PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 21-cm intensity mapping (IM) is a powerful technique to probe the large-scale distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) and extract cosmological information such as the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. A key challenge lies in recovering the faint HI signal from bright foregrounds and frequency-dependent beam effects, which can compromise traditional cleaning methods like principal component analysis (PCA) by removing part of the cosmological signal. Deep-learning approaches have recently been proposed to mitigate these effects by learning mappings between contaminated and true cosmological signals. Building upon our previous work~\citep{2024PhRvD.109f3509S} on the frequency-differencing (FD) method, this study extends the framework to systematically compare FD-based and PCA-based UNet reconstructions using realistic simulations that include foregrounds and beam convolution. We find that both approaches perform comparably without beam or with a Gaussian beam, but under a realistic cosine beam they systematically underestimate the large-scale cross-correlation power spectrum, particularly for $k&lt;0.1 h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. To address this limitation, we explore a hybrid approach in which the UNet is trained with two input channels, one constructed from FD and the other from PCA cleaning, allowing the network to simultaneously exploit the strengths of both inputs. This two-channel strategy achieves superior performance, maintaining the cross-correlation power spectrum close to unity on large scales under a cosine beam, improving by 5-8% relative to either FD-based or PCA-based UNet alone. These results demonstrate that providing complementary FD and PCA information to a single deep network is an effective route to robust HI reconstruction, laying the groundwork for precision BAO measurements with future low-redshift 21 cm IM surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently released data from the $\textit{Atacama Cosmology Telescope}$ (ACT) confirms that the primordial scalar spectrum is extremely flat. This, together with current upper bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, implies that the simplest models of inflation coming from particle physics (for instance, a minimally-coupled scalar with monomial potentials) need additional ingredients in order to make them compatible with observations. Instead of invoking arbitrary new couplings or new interactions that are not protected symmetries, we argue that dissipation of the inflaton field with the radiation bath should be added as a new physical principle. Accordingly, we show that warm inflation provides the correct paradigm to explain the current observations, given very natural choices of dissipative terms. The model analyzed here has mirror and $Z_4$ symmetries, which explicitly protect the inflaton potential from large quantum and thermal corrections. We use a recent precision numerical code designed for warm inflationary perturbations, improving on the determination of the cosmological observables previously obtained for such models.</description>

      <title>The properties of primordially-seeded black holes and their hosts in the first billion years: implications for JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have opened a tantalising new window onto possible black holes as early as redshifts of $z \sim 10.4$. These show a number of puzzling properties including unexpectedly massive black holes in place by $z \sim 10$ and inexplicably high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\geq 0.1$. These pose a serious challenge for "astrophysical" seeding and growth models that we aim to explain with ``cosmological" primordial black holes (PBHs) in this work. We present PHANES, an analytic framework that follows the evolution of dark matter halos, and their baryons in the first billion years, seeded by a population of PBHs with seed masses between $10^{0.5}-10^6 M_\odot$. PBH seeded models yield a black hole mass function that extends between $10^{1.25-11.25} ~(10^{0.75-7.25})M_\odot$ at $z \sim 5 (15)$ for the different models considered in this work. Interestingly, PBH-seeded models (with spin $s=0$ or $-1$) naturally result in extremely high values of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\geq 0.25$ at $z \sim 5-15$. For a typical stellar mass of $M_* =10^9 M_\odot$, we find an average value of $M_{\rm BH}/M_* \sim 0.4~ (1.6)$ for $s=0~(-1)$ at $z=5$, providing a smoking gun for PBH-seeded models. Another particularity of PBH-seeded models is their ability of producing systems with high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios that are extremely metal poor ($Z \leq 10^{-2}~Z_\odot$). Yielding a PBH-to-dark matter fraction $\leq 10^{-9}$ and a stellar mass function that lies four orders of magnitude below observations, our model is in accord with all current cosmological and astrophysical bounds.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing of fast radio bursts: prospects for probing microlens populations in lensing galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing by a stellar microlens of mass $M$ forms two images separated by micro-arcseconds on the sky and has a time delay of $2\times10^{-5}(M/{\rm M_\odot})$ seconds. Although we cannot resolve such micro-images in the sky, they could be resolved in time if the source is a fast radio burst (FRB). In this work, we study the magnification ($|\mu|$) and time delay~($t_d$) distributions of micro-images led by different microlens populations. We find that, in microlensing of typical strongly lensed (macro-)images in galaxy lenses, micro-images stemmed from a population of stellar mass microlenses in the $[0.08, 1.5]\:{\rm M_\odot}$ range and a second (dark) microlens population in $[10^{-3} - 10^{-2}]\:{\rm M_\odot}$ range reside in different parts of $|\mu|-t_d$ plane. For the global minimum macro-image, due to low stellar mass density, we find that the stellar population leads to peaks in autocorrelation at ${&gt;}10^{-6}$ seconds, whereas the secondary population leads to peaks at ${&lt;}10^{-6}$ seconds, allowing us to differentiate different microlens populations. However, an increase in stellar density introduces new peaks at ${&lt;}10^{-6}$ seconds, which can pollute the inference about the presence of multiple microlens populations. In addition, we also show that the number of micro-images, hence the number of peaks in the autocorrelation, is also sensitive to the underlying stellar mass function, allowing us to constrain the stellar initial mass function (IMF) with FRB microlesning in the future. This work is a first step towards using FRB lensing to probe the microlens population within strong lenses, and more detailed studies are required to assess the effect of various uncertainties that we only discussed qualitatively.</description>

      <title>Fast and "lossless" propagation of relativistic electrons along magnetized non-thermal filaments in galaxy clusters and the Galactic Center region</title>

Abstract: Relativistic leptons in galaxy clusters lose their energy via radiation (synchrotron and inverse Compton losses) and interactions with the ambient plasma. At z~0, pure radiative losses limit the lifetime of electrons emitting at ~GHz frequencies to t&lt;100 Myr. Adiabatic losses can further lower Lorentz factors of electrons trapped in an expanding medium. If the propagation speed of electrons relative to the ambient weakly magnetized (plasma $\beta\sim10^2$) Intracluster Medium (ICM) is limited by the Alfv\'en speed, $v_{a,ICM}=c_{s,ICM}/\beta^{1/2}\sim 10^7\,{\rm cm\,s^{-1}}$, GHz-emitting electrons can travel only $l \sim v_{a,ICM}t_r\sim 10\,kpc$ relative to the underlying plasma. Yet, elongated structures spanning hundreds of kpc or even a few Mpc are observed, requiring either a re-acceleration mechanism or another form of synchronization, e.g., by a large-scale shock. We argue that filaments with ordered magnetic fields supported by non-thermal pressure have $v_{a}\gg v_{a,{\rm ICM}}$ and so can provide such a synchronization even without re-acceleration or shocks. In particular, along quasi-stationary filaments, electrons can propagate without experiencing adiabatic losses, and their velocity is not limited by the Alfv\'en or sound speeds of the ambient thermal plasma. This model predicts that along filaments that span significant pressure gradients, e.g., in the cores of galaxy clusters, the synchrotron break frequency $\nu_b\propto B$ should scale with the ambient gas pressure as $P^{1/2}$, and the emission from such filaments should be strongly polarized. While some of these structures can be observed as "filaments", i.e., long and narrow bright structures, others can be unresolved and have a collective appearance of a diffuse structure, or be too faint to be detected, while still providing channels for electrons' propagation.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy parameterizations in VCDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of a theory of minimally modified gravity called VCDM, one can realize any cosmological behavior at the level of the homogeneous and isotropic background without introducing fatal instabilities for perturbations. Therefore, VCDM provides a theoretically-consistent and observationally-testable framework of dynamical dark energy parameterizations with or without phantom behaviors. In this paper, we propose the VCDM realizations of various phenomenological parameterizations present in the literature: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Exponential (EXP), and Logarithmic (LOG) models. Using the VCDM equations for cosmological perturbations, we test them against the recent cosmological datasets, Planck 2018 and DESI BAO DR2, and then discuss their implications.</description>

      <title>LATIS Data Release: $\sim4200$ Spectra of $z \sim 2-3$ Galaxies, Redshifts, and Intergalactic Medium Tomography Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the data release of the Ly$\alpha$ Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS), one of the largest optical spectroscopic surveys of faint high-redshift galaxies. The survey provides 7408 optical spectra of candidate $z \sim 2-3$ galaxies and QSOs in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey D1, D2 (COSMOS), and D4 fields. The $R \sim 1000$ spectra were obtained using the Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS) at the Magellan Baade telescope, with typical integrations of 12 hr. From these spectra, we measured 5575 high-confidence spectroscopic redshifts, of which 4176 are at $z &gt; 1.7$, thereby substantially increasing the number of public spectroscopic redshifts at $z \approx 2-3$ in COSMOS and the other survey fields. The data release includes Ly$\alpha$ transmission fluctuations measured in $4.7 \times 10^5$ pixels, which were used to create 3D maps of the intergalactic medium (IGM) transmission spanning 1.65 deg$^2$ and $z = 2.2-2.8$ at a resolution of 4 $h^{-1}$ cMpc. These are the largest such maps to date and provide a novel tracer of large-scale structure in legacy fields. We also provide ancillary data, including mock surveys. The LATIS data will enable a variety of community studies of galaxy evolution, environments, and the IGM around cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Divergence in tracing the flavors of astrophysical neutrinos: can JUNO help IceCube?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the flavor fractions $(\eta^{}_e , \eta^{}_\mu , \eta^{}_\tau)$ for ultrahigh-energy neutrinos originating from a remote astrophysical source by using their flavor ratios $(f^{}_e , f^{}_\mu , f^{}_\tau)$ observed at a neutrino telescope, and find that a potential divergence may appear in inferring the values of $\eta^{}_\mu$ and $\eta^{}_\tau$ as an unavoidable consequence of the approximate $\mu$-$\tau$ interchange symmetry of lepton flavor mixing. We illustrate such an effect by applying our formula to the IceCube all-sky neutrino flux data ranging from 5 TeV to 10 PeV in the naive assumption that the relevant sources have a common flavor composition. We show that only $\eta^{}_e$ and $\eta^{}_\mu + \eta^{}_\tau$ can be extracted from the measurements of $f^{}_e$, $f^{}_\mu$ and $f^{}_\tau$ if the $\mu$-$\tau$ flavor symmetry is exact, and the JUNO and Daya Bay precision antineutrino oscillation data will help a lot in this connection.</description>
