      <title>Time-series-analysis-based detection of critical transitions in real-world non-autonomous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world non-autonomous systems are open, out-of-equilibrium systems that evolve in and are driven by temporally varying environments. Such systems can show multiple timescale and transient dynamics together with transitions to very different and, at times, even disastrous dynamical regimes. Since such critical transitions disrupt the systems' intended or desired functionality, it is crucial to understand the underlying mechanisms, to identify precursors of such transitions and to reliably detect them in time series of suitable system observables to enable forecasts. This review critically assesses the various steps of investigation involved in time-series-analysis-based detection of critical transitions in real-world non-autonomous systems: from the data recording to evaluating the reliability of offline and online detections. It will highlight pros and cons to stimulate further developments, which would be necessary to advance understanding and forecasting nonlinear behavior such as critical transitions in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bayesian approach for adaptive integration of Bragg peaks in time-of-flight neutron scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) operates in the event mode. Time-of-flight (TOF) information about each detected neutron is collected separately and saved as a descriptive entry in a database enabling unprecedented accuracy of the collected experimental data. Nevertheless, the common data processing pipeline still involves the binning of data to perform analysis and feature extraction. For weak reflections, improper binning leads to sparse histograms with low signal-to-noise ratios, rendering them uninformative. In this study, we propose the Bayesian approach for the identification of Bragg peaks in TOF diffraction data. The method is capable of adaptively handling the varying sampling rates found in different regions of the reciprocal space. Unlike histogram fitting methods, our approach focuses on estimating the true neutron flux function. We accomplish this by employing a profile fitting algorithm based on the event-level likelihood, along with a multiresolution histogram-level prior. By using this approach, we ensure that there is no loss of information due to data reduction in strong reflections and that the search space is appropriately restricted for weak reflections. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we apply it to real experimental data collected at the TOPAZ single crystal diffractometer at SNS.</description>

      <title>A General Track Fit based on Triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents an analytical solution for a general three-dimensional track fit based on hit triplets. Input to the fit are triplet parameters, which contain information about the triplet geometry (hit positions), the radiation length of the material and the magnetic field. The general fit considers spatial hit and multiple Coulomb scattering uncertainties, and can also be extended to include energy losses.
  The output of the fit, which is given by an analytical closed-form solution, contains the total momentum and the hit residuals, including the full covariance matrix, thus allowing for easy software alignment of the detector. The fit qualities are calculated for the global track fit as well as for the local hit triplets. This feature allows filtering out triplets with poor fit quality at an early stage of track reconstruction. The fit of local triplets is fully parallelizable, enabling accelerated computation with parallel hardware architectures.
  The triplet track fit is detector-independent, making it possible to use the same fitting code for all tracking detectors. Only the detector-specific triplet parameters (fit input) depend on the triplet geometries and the magnetic field. Formulas for the calculation of the triplet parameters are given for the most common tracking detector setups, namely a homogeneous magnetic field and a spectrometer using a dipole magnet. Furthermore, an algorithm is presented to calculate tracking parameters for an arbitrary magnetic field configuration.
  Moreover, this work includes a discussion of track fit biases and presents an extension of the fit to include energy losses. Last but not least, it is proposed to use triplet-based scale parameters that characterize different tracking regimes to accelerate track fits and to optimize the design of future tracking detectors.</description>

      <title>Fisher's Mirage: Noise Tightening of Cosmological Constraints in Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically analyze the implications of statistical noise within numerical derivatives on simulation-based Fisher forecasts for large scale structure surveys. Noisy numerical derivatives resulting from a finite number of simulations, $N_{sims}$, act to bias the associated Fisher forecast such that the resulting marginalized constraints can be significantly tighter than the noise-free limit. We show the source of this effect can be traced to the influence of the noise on the marginalization process. Parameters such as the neutrino mass, $\M$, for which higher-order forward differentiation schemes are commonly used, are more prone to noise; the predicted constraints can be akin to those purely from a random instance of statistical noise even using $(1\mathrm{Gpc}/h)^{3}$ simulations with $N_{sims}=500$ realizations. We demonstrate how derivative noise can artificially reduce parameter degeneracies and seemingly null the effects of adding nuisance parameters to the forecast, such as HOD fitting parameters. We mathematically characterize these effects through a full statistical analysis, and demonstrate how confidence intervals for the true noise-free, $N_{sims} \rightarrow \infty$, Fisher constraints can be recovered even when noise comprises a consequential component of the measured signal. The findings and approaches developed here are important for ensuring simulation-based analyses can be accurately used to assess upcoming survey capabilities.</description>

      <title>How much longer do you have to drive than the crow has to fly?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When we travel by car from one location to another, our route is constrained by the road network. The resulting network distance is generally longer than the geodetic distance, i.e. the distance as the crow flies, between the two locations. We report a systematic relation between the statistical properties of these two distances. In empirical analyses for large motorway networks in various countries and areas, we work out distributions of network and geodetic distances and identify a surprisingly robust scaling property between them. A simple consequence is that we typically have to drive $1.3\pm0.1$ times longer than the crow flies. Moreover, we show that this scaling is not present in standard random networks; rather, it requires a certain non-randomness, namely adjacency. We develop a set of rules to build a realistic motorway network, also consistent with the scaling properties found empirically. We hypothesize that the scaling reflects, in a rather universal fashion, a compromise between two societal needs: high efficiency and accessibility on the one hand, and limitation of costs and other burdens on the other.</description>

      <title>Description length of canonical and microcanonical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-equivalence between the canonical and the microcanonical ensemble has been shown to arise for models defined by an extensive (i.e. scaling with the size of the system) number of constraints (e.g. the Configuration Model). Here, we compare the description length of binary canonical and microcanonical models in light of ensemble non-equivalence. Specifically, we consider the description length induced by the Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML), which consists of two terms, i.e. a model log-likelihood and its complexity. While the effects of ensemble non-equivalence on the log-likelihood term are well understood, its effects on the complexity term have not yet been systematically studied. Here, we find that i) microcanonical models are always more complex than their canonical counterparts, ii) the best-scoring model in terms of description length highly depends on the numerical values of the constraints, and iii) the difference between the canonical and the microcanonical description length is strongly influenced by the degree of non-equivalence, a result suggesting that non-equivalence should be taken into account when selecting models. Finally, we compare the NML-based approach to model selection with the Bayesian one in light of our results, showing that the Bayesian description length becomes much more sensitive to the choice of the prior when an extensive number of constraints is involved</description>

      <title>Dynamical Reversibility and A New Theory of Causal Emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of causal emergence based on effective information(EI) suggests that complex systems may exhibit a phenomenon called causal emergence(CE), where the macro-dynamics demonstrate a stronger causal effect than the micro-dynamics. However, a challenge in this theory is the dependence on the method used to coarse-grain the system. In this paper, we introduce a fresh concept of approximate dynamical reversibility and establish a novel framework for CE based on this and singular value decomposition. Our research not only reveals a strong correlation between the proximity of a Markov chain being dynamically reversible and EI in assessing causal effects across various scenarios but also demonstrates that EI is constrained by the logarithm of the approximate dynamical reversibility. Leveraging this concept, we present an innovative approach to quantifying CE that is agnostic to specific coarse-graining techniques and effectively captures the inherent characteristics of Markov dynamics. Through empirical evaluations on examples of boolean networks, cellular automata, and complex networks, we validate our refined CE definition.</description>

      <title>Liouville Flow Importance Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Liouville Flow Importance Sampler (LFIS), an innovative flow-based model for generating samples from unnormalized density functions. LFIS learns a time-dependent velocity field that deterministically transports samples from a simple initial distribution to a complex target distribution, guided by a prescribed path of annealed distributions. The training of LFIS utilizes a unique method that enforces the structure of a derived partial differential equation to neural networks modeling velocity fields. By considering the neural velocity field as an importance sampler, sample weights can be computed through accumulating errors along the sample trajectories driven by neural velocity fields, ensuring unbiased and consistent estimation of statistical quantities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LFIS through its application to a range of benchmark problems, on many of which LFIS achieved state-of-the-art performance.</description>
