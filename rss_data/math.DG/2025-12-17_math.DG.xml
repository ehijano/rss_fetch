      <title>Multiple Blow-Up Phenomena for $Q$-Curvature in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g_0)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $n \geq 25$ with positive Yamabe invariant $Y(M,g_0)&gt;0$ and positive fourth-order invariant $Y_4(M,g_0)&gt;0$. We show that, arbitrarily $C^1$-close to $g_0$, there exists a Riemannian metric such that, within its conformal class, one can find infinitely many smooth metrics with the same constant $Q$-curvature and arbitrarily large energy. Moreover, within this conformal class, there exists a sequence of smooth metrics with constant $Q$-curvature equal to $n(n^2-4)/8$ and unbounded volume. This extends to the $Q$-curvature setting the result previously obtained for the scalar curvature in Marques (2015) (see also Gond and Li (2025)). The proof is based on constructing small perturbations of multiple standard bubbles that are glued together.</description>

      <title>On the cohomology of $L^2$-harmonic forms of an incomplete Riemannian manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Cappell, Deturck, Gluch and Miller, we extend the notion of cohomology of harmonic forms (of a compact manifold with boundary) to the abstract setting of Hilbert complexes. Then, we present some geometric applications of our construction to incomplete Riemannian manifolds with particular interest to the case of smoothly stratified Thom-Mather spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the space of polynomially bounded ancient solutions to the biharmonic heat equation on a complete manifold with polynomial volume growth is bounded by the dimensions of spaces of polynomially bounded biharmonic functions. This generalizes the work of Colding and Minicozzi in [6] for ancient caloric functions.</description>

      <title>Homological Filling and Minimal Varifolds in Four-Dimensional Einstein Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the smallest area $A(M,g)$ of a 2-dimensional stationary integral varifold in a closed Einstein 4-manifold $(M^4,g)$ with $Ric_g = \lambda g, |\lambda|\leq 3, Vol(M,g)\geq v&gt;0, diam(M,g)\leq D, H_1(M;\mathbb{Z})=0.$ Building on the previous work on homological filling functions, we show that for every $(M^4,g)$ in this Einstein class, there is an upper bound $A(M,g)\leq F_{Ein}(v,D),$ where $F_{Ein}$ depends only on $(v,D)$ and on quantitative Sobolev and $\varepsilon$-regularity constants for Einstein metrics.</description>

      <title>The harmonic $2$-forms on $K3$ surfaces converging to a flat $4$-dimensional orbifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the asymptotic behavior of harmonic $2$-forms on $K3$ surfaces with Ricci-flat K\"ahler metrics, where metrics converge to the quotient of a flat $4$-torus by a finite group action. We can show that the space of anti-self-dual harmonic $2$ forms decomposes into two subspaces: one converges to the flat $2$-forms on the quotient of the torus, while the other converges to the first Chern forms of anti-self-dual connections on ALE spaces.</description>

      <title>A parabolic flow for the large volume heterotic $G_2$ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a geometric flow of conformally coclosed $G_2$-structures, whose fixed points are large volume solutions of the heterotic $G_2$ system, with vanishing scalar torsion class $\tau_0 = 0$. After conformal rescaling, it becomes a flow of coclosed $G_2$-structures, related to Grigorian's modified $G_2$ coflow, which is coupled to a flow for a dilaton function. Our main results establish fundamental short-time existence and Shi-type smoothing properties of this flow, as well as a classification of its fixed points. By a classical rigidity result in the string theory literature, the fixed points on a compact manifold correspond to torsion-free $G_2$-structures, that is, to metrics with holonomy contained in $G_2$. Thus, we establish in the affirmative a folklore question in the special holonomy community, about the existence of a well-posed flow for coclosed $G_2$-structures with fixed points given by torsion-free $G_2$-structures. The flow also satisfies a monotonicity formula for the $G_2$-dilaton functional (volume scale in string theory), which allows us to strengthen the rigidity result with an alternative proof. The monotonicity of the $G_2$-dilaton functional, combined with the Shi-type estimates, leads to a general result on the convergence of nonsingular solutions. A dimension reduction analysis reveals an interesting link with natural flows for $SU(3)$-structures, previously introduced in the literature.</description>

      <title>Higher Lefschetz formulas on {\Gamma}-proper manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a finitely generated discrete group acting properly and cocompactly on a smooth manifold M. By employing heat-kernel techniques we prove a geometric formula for the pairing of the index class associated to a $\Gamma$-equivariant Dirac operator $D$ with a delocalized cyclic cocycles $\tau$ in $HP^\bullet (\mathbb{C}\Gamma,\langle \gamma \rangle)$. Our formula takes place on the fixed point manifold $M^\gamma$ and should be regarded as a higher Lefschetz formula for $D$. The formula involves the Atiyah-Segal-Singer form and an explicit $Z_\gamma$-invariant form on $M^\gamma$ that is naturally associated to $\tau\in HP^\bullet (\mathbb{C}\Gamma,\langle \gamma \rangle)$</description>

      <title>Perplex Analysis and Geometry of Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a real-analytic framework, called perplex analysis, in which the complex, split-complex, and dual numbers arise as members of a single four-parameter family of two-dimensional commutative real algebras. Within this unified setting we define differentiability through a generalized Cauchy-Riemann structure, extending several features of complex geometry to a broader real-analytic context. Two main results illustrate the analytic and geometric scope of the theory: a Lojasiewicz gradient inequality for perplex-analytic functions, providing quantitative control of critical behavior; and a Milnor-Le type fibration theorem for nondegenerate algebras, describing the local topology of singularities. The framework reveals a continuous transition between complex and hyperbolic geometries, with the dual boundary exhibiting new infinitesimal phenomena linked to zero divisors. These results connect generalized complex geometry, hypercomplex analysis, and singularity theory within a single analytic formalism.</description>

      <title>Monge solutions and uniqueness in multi-marginal optimal transport with hierarchical jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Hierarchical Jump multi-marginal transport (HJMOT), a generalization of multi-marginal optimal transport where mass can "jump" over intermediate spaces via augmented isolated points. Established on Polish spaces, the framework guarantees the existence of Kantorovich solutions and, under sequential differentiability and a twist condition, the existence and uniqueness of Monge solutions. This core theory extends robustly to diverse settings, including smooth Riemannian manifolds, demonstrating its versatility as a unified framework for optimal transport across complex geometries.</description>

Abstract: We show the map $\sigma : T_g \to C_g$ sending a compact hyperbolic surface $X$ to a random simple closed geodesic on $X$ determines a proper embedding of Teichm\"uller space into the space of geodesic currents. The proof depends on a formula for the intersection number $i(C,C')$ of a pair of multicurves, expressed in terms of Dehn coordinates on $ML_g(\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize spin initial data sets that saturate the BPS bound in the asymptotically AdS setting. This includes both gravitational waves and rotating black holes in higher dimensions, and we establish a sharp dimension threshold in each case. A key ingredient in our argument is a theorem providing a general criterion for when an imaginary Killing spinor of mixed causal type can be replaced by one that is strictly timelike or null. Moreover, in analogy with the minimal surface method, we demonstrate that spinors can be used to construct a codimension-$2$ slicing.</description>

      <title>Inverse obstacle scattering regularized by the tangent-point energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the so-called tangent-point energy as Tikhonov regularizer for ill-conditioned inverse scattering problems in 3D. The tangent-point energy is a self-avoiding functional on the space of embedded surfaces that also penalizes surface roughness. Moreover, it features nice compactness and continuity properties. These allow us to show the well-posedness of the regularized problems and the convergence of the regularized solutions to the true solution in the limit of vanishing noise level. We also provide a reconstruction algorithm of iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton type. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our method is numerically feasible and effective in producing reconstructions of unprecedented quality.</description>

      <title>On a Complete Riemannian Metric on the Space of Embedded Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new strong Riemannian metric on the manifold of (parametrized) embedded curves of regularity $H^s$, $s\in(3/2,2)$. We highlight its close relationship to the (generalized) tangent-point energies and employ it to show that this metric is complete in the following senses: (i) bounded sets are relatively compact with respect to the weak $H^s$ topology; (ii) every Cauchy sequence with respect to the induced geodesic distance converges; (iii) solutions of the geodesic initial-value problem exist for all times; and (iv) there are length-minimizing geodesics between every pair of curves in the same path component (i.e., in the same knot class). As a by-product, we show $C^\infty$-smoothness of the tangent-point energies in the Hilbert case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the sum of the Morse index and the nullity of Willmore immersions of bounded energy is lower semi-continuous without assuming that the limiting immersion and the bubbles are free of branch points. Our proof is based on a refined analysis of the properties of two families of fourth-order differential operators with regular singularities that depend on a parameter equal to the order of the branch points. The most technical results that justify the length of the article are Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Rellich inequalities in degenerating annuli that are necessary to show that the eigenvalues of the index operator with respect to a suitable weight are bounded from below.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the graph Laplace operator near an isolated singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate asymptotics of the continuous graph Laplace operator on a smooth Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ admitting an isolated singularity $x$. We show that if the curvature function $\kappa$ doesn't grow too fast near $x$, then the graph Laplace operator at $x$ converges to the weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator as the bandwidth $t\downarrow 0.$ On the other hand, we also prove that if one locally modifies a given Riemannian metric across $x$ by a non-constant \textit{purely angular }conformal factor, then $\kappa$ grows too fast and the graph Laplace operator behaves like $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}})$ near $x$, as $t\downarrow 0$, given a mild condition on the angular conformal factor. We provide the Taylor expansion of the graph Laplace operator as $t\downarrow 0$ in specific cases. Numerical simulations at the end illustrate our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a closed Riemannian manifold, we construct a family of intrinsic Gaussian noises indexed by a regularity parameter $\alpha\geq0$ to study the well-posedness of the parabolic Anderson model. We show that with rough initial conditions, the equation is well-posed assuming non-positive curvature with a condition on $\alpha$ similar to that of Riesz kernel-correlated noise in Euclidean space. Non-positive curvature was used to overcome a new difficulty introduced by non-uniqueness of geodesics in this setting, which required exploration of global geometry. The well-posedness argument also produces exponentially growing in time upper bounds for the moments. Using Feynman-Kac formula for moments, we also obtain exponentially growing in time second moment lower bounds for our solutions with bounded initial condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Onsager reciprocal relations model physical irreversible processes from complex systems. Recently, it has been shown that Onsager principles for master equations on finite states introduce a class of Riemannian metrics in a probability simplex, named probability manifolds. We call these manifolds finite-state generalized Wasserstein-$2$ spaces. In this paper, we study geometric calculations on probability manifolds, in which we derive the Levi-Civita connection, gradient, Hessian, and parallel transport, and compute the Riemannian and sectional curvatures. We present two examples of geometric quantities in probability manifolds. These include Levi-Civita connections from the chemical monomolecular triangle reaction and sectional, Ricci, and scalar curvatures in Wasserstein space on a three-point lattice.</description>

Abstract: We will use the tools developed in [Rie24] to give a Morse-theoretic description of a string topology product on the homology of the space of paths in a manifold Y with endpoints in a submanifold X and a module structure on this homology over the Chas-Sullivan ring of Y . These operations have been defined and studied by Stegemeyer in [Ste25] in singular homology.</description>
