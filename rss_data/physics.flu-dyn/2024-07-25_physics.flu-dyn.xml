      <title>Schur Forms and Normal-Nilpotent Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real and complex Schur forms have been receiving increasing attention from the fluid mechanics community recently, especially related to vortices and turbulence. Several decompositions of the velocity gradient tensor, such as the triple decomposition of motion (TDM) and normal-nilpotent decomposition (NND), have been proposed to analyze the local motions of fluid elements. However, due to the existence of different types and non-uniqueness of Schur forms, as well as various possible definitions of NNDs, confusion has spread widely and is harming the research. This work aims to clean up this confusion. To this end, the complex and real Schur forms are derived constructively from the very basics, with special consideration for their non-uniqueness. Conditions of uniqueness are proposed. After a general discussion of normality and nilpotency, a complex NND and several real NNDs as well as normal-nonnormal decompositions are constructed, with a brief comparison of complex and real decompositions. Based on that, several confusing points are clarified, such as the distinction between NND and TDM, and the intrinsic gap between complex and real NNDs. Besides, The author proposes to extend the real block Schur form and its corresponding NNDs for the complex eigenvalue case to the real eigenvalue case. But their justification is left to further investigations.</description>

      <title>Velocity fluctuations for bubbly flows at small Re</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the effect of Reynolds number (Re) on the turbulence induced by the motion of bubbles in a quiescent Newtonian fluid at small Re. The energy spectra, $E(k)$, is determined from the decaying turbulence behind the bubble swarm obtained using particle image velocimetry (PIV). As the bubble Reynolds number decreases, the signature $k^{-3}$ of the energy spectra for the bubble induced turbulence is replaced by a scaling similar to the classical $k^{-5/3}$ Kolmogorov's scaling, where $k$ is the wavenumber. We find that for Re $&lt;$ $O$(100) the slope of the normalized energy spectra is no longer independent on the gas volume fraction. This is further corroborated using spatial correlation of the velocity vector behind the bubble swarm. Thus, we provide experimental evidence to the claim by \citet{mazzitelli2003effect} that at low Reynolds numbers the normalized energy spectra of the bubble induced turbulence will no longer show the $k^{-3}$ scaling because of the absence of bubble wake and that the energy spectra will depend on the number of bubbles, thus non-universal.</description>

      <title>Surfing vortex rings for energy-efficient propulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging background fluid flows for propulsion has the potential to enhance the range and speed of autonomous aerial and underwater vehicles. In this work, we demonstrate experimentally a fully autonomous strategy for exploiting vortex rings for energy-efficient propulsion. First, an underwater robot used an onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU) to sense the motion induced by the passage of a vortex ring generated by a thruster in a 13,000-liter water tank. In response to the sensed acceleration, an impulsive maneuver entrained the robot into the material boundary of the vortex ring. After entrainment, the robot was propelled across the tank without expending additional energy or control effort. By advecting with the vortex ring, the robot achieved a near five-fold reduction in the energy required to traverse the tank. Using the controlled finite-time Lyapunov exponent field and corresponding Lagrangian coherent structures, we analyze and explain the initial entrainment process and the sensitivity to the starting time and position of the surfing maneuver. Additionally, linear acceleration as sensed by the onboard IMU was found to correspond with the pressure gradient of the background flow, and rotational acceleration is suggested as a method for measuring the vorticity of the vortex ring. This study serves as a proof-of-concept demonstration of the potential for onboard inertial measurements to enable efficient interaction with background fluid flows.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of vortex pairing in transitional jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the onset of linear instabilities and their later nonlinear interactions in the shear layer of an initially-laminar jet using a combination of stability analysis and data from high-fidelity flow simulations. We provide a complete picture of the vortex-pairing process. Hydrodynamic instabilities initiate the transition to turbulence, causing the shear layer to spread rapidly. In this process, the shear layer rolls up to form vortices, accompanied by the exponential growth of the fundamental frequency. As the fundamental frequency grows, it gains energy from the mean flow. Subsequently, as it saturates and begins to decay, the fundamental vortices start to pair. During this vortex pairing process, the subharmonic vortex acquires energy both linearly from the mean flow and nonlinearly through a reverse cascade from the fundamental. The process concludes when the subharmonic vortex eventually saturates. Similarly, two subharmonic vortices merge to form a second subharmonic vortex. Our results confirm Kelly's (1967) hypothesis of a resonance mechanism between the fundamental and subharmonic, which supplies energy to the subharmonic. In this multi-tonal, convective-dominated flow, we clarify the ambiguity surrounding the fundamental frequency by demonstrating that the spatially most amplified frequency should be considered fundamental, rather than the structure associated with the spectral energy peak. For the initially-laminar jet considered here, the fundamental frequency corresponds to the fourth largest spectral peak, highlighting the important distinction between the energetically and dynamical significance of a tone. Despite its low energy, the fundamental frequency is dynamically dominant as it determines all other spectral peaks and supplies energy to the subharmonics through a reverse energy cascade.</description>

      <title>Interaction of water surface waves with periodic and quasiperiodic cylinder arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by transformation optics and photonic crystals, this paper presents a computational investigation into the interaction between water surface waves and array waveguides of cylinders with multiple previously unexplored lattice geometries, including, for the first time, quasiperiodic geometries. Extending beyond conventional square and hexagonal periodic arrays, transformation optics has opened up entirely new opportunities to investigate water wave propagation through arrays based on quasiperiodic lattices, and quasiperiodically arranged vacancy defects. Using the linear potential flow open-source code Capytaine, missing element and $\tau$-scaled Fibonacci square lattices, the Penrose lattice, hexagonal $H_{00}$ lattice and Amman-Beenker lattice are investigated. The existence of band gaps for all arrays is observed. An hexagonal lattice with vacancy defects transmits the least energy. Bragg diffraction consistent with rotational symmetry is observed from all arrays. Waves will distort significantly to achieve resonance with arrays, supporting transformation-based waveguides. The possible uses include adaptation to more versatile waveguides with applications such as offshore renewable energy and coastal defence.</description>

      <title>Vertical impact of a water jet on a hot plate from a growing drop to spray formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17185v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we experimentally investigate the impact of a submillimetric water jet on a horizontal surface heated well above the "static" Leidenfrost temperature of water. We observe the transition from a regime where a single drop grows at the impingement point to a regime of spray formation. The main control parameter appears to be the jet Weber number ($\We$). The first regime persists until $\We \lesssim 30$ whereas the spray formation occurs for $\We \gtrsim 40$. Surprisingly, we found no influence of the hot plate's temperature on the reported phenomena. We particularly focus on the second regime, where the liquid jet spreads on the plate, forming a liquid sheet that eventually lifts off and breaks into droplets. We characterized this regime by the radius $r_c$ of the liquid sheet when it is still in contact with the plate and the angle of ejection $\theta$ of the droplets. We further examine the ejected droplets by characterizing their speed and sizes. Simple models are proposed to predict the dependencies and order of magnitudes of $r_c$ and $\theta$. We also aim to predict the critical Weber number at which the transition between the two regimes occurs. Our models show reasonable agreement with our experimental data. Finally, we compare the energy transferred from the jet to the droplets with results reported in the literature for impacts on unheated surfaces, finding a difference of nearly a factor 2.</description>

      <title>Wind-farm wake recovery mechanisms in conventionally neutral boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic-aperture radar images and mesoscale model results show that wind-farm wakes behave very differently than single-turbine wakes, e.g. with wakes that seemingly narrow and do not disperse over long distances. In the current work, we aim at better understanding the physical mechanisms that govern wind-farm wake behaviour and recovery. Hence, we study the wake properties of a 1.6 GW wind-farm operating in conventionally neutral boundary layers with four capping-inversion heights, i.e. 203, 319, 507 and 1001 m. In shallow boundary layers, we find strong flow decelerations which reduce the Coriolis force magnitude, leading to an anticlockwise wake deflection in the Northern Hemisphere. In deep boundary layers, the vertical turbulent entrainment of momentum adds clockwise-turning flow from aloft into the wake region, leading to a faster recovery rate and a clockwise wake deflection. To estimate the wake properties, we develop a simple model that fits the velocity magnitude profiles along the spanwise direction. Based on this, we observe that the wake narrows along the downstream direction in all cases. Further, a detailed momentum budget analysis shows that the wake is mostly replenished by turbulent vertical entrainment in deep boundary layers. In shallow boundary layers, the capping inversion limits vertical motions and wakes are mostly replenished by mean flow entrainment in the spanwise direction. Moreover, in these cases, we observe a counterclockwise flow rotation near the left edge of the wake, which persists at each location downstream of the farm, giving rise to local strong streamwise velocity gradients along the spanwise direction.</description>

      <title>Extensions to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier Equations for Rarefied Transport: Variational Multiscale Moment Methods for the Boltzmann Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a fourth order entropy stable extension of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations into the transition regime of rarefied gases. We do this through a novel reformulation of the closure of conservation equations derived from the Boltzmann equation that subsumes existing methods such as the Chapman-Enskog expansion. We apply the linearized version of this extension to the stationary heat problem and the Poiseuille channel and compare our analytical solutions to asymptotic and numerical solutions of the linearized Boltzmann equation. In both model problems, our solutions compare remarkably well in the transition regime. For some macroscopic variables, this agreement even extends far beyond the transition regime.</description>

      <title>Upscaling transport in heterogeneous media featuring local-scale dispersion: flow channeling, macro-retardation and parameter prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many theoretical treatments of transport in heterogeneous Darcy flows consider advection only. When local-scale dispersion is neglected, flux-weighting persists over time; mean Lagrangian and Eulerian flow velocity distributions relate simply to each other and to the variance of the underlying hydraulic conductivity field. Local-scale dispersion complicates this relationship, potentially causing initially flux-weighted solute to experience lower-velocity regions as well as Taylor-type macrodispersion due to transverse solute movement between adjacent streamlines. To investigate the interplay of local-scale dispersion with conductivity log-variance, correlation length, and anisotropy, we perform a Monte Carlo study of flow and advective-dispersive transport in spatially-periodic 2D Darcy flows in large-scale, high-resolution multivariate Gaussian random conductivity fields. We observe flow channeling at all heterogeneity levels and quantify its extent. We find evidence for substantial effective retardation in the upscaled system, associated with increased flow channeling, and observe limited Taylor-type macrodispersion, which we physically explain. A quasi-constant Lagrangian velocity is achieved within a short distance of release, allowing usage of a simplified continuous-time random walk (CTRW) model we previously proposed in which the transition time distribution is understood as a temporal mapping of unit time in an equivalent system with no flow heterogeneity. The numerical data set is modeled with such a CTRW; we show how dimensionless parameters defining the CTRW transition time distribution are predicted by dimensionless heterogeneity statistics and provide empirical equations for this purpose.</description>

      <title>Application of Machine Learning and Convex Limiting to Subgrid Flux Modeling in the Shallow-Water Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a combination of machine learning and flux limiting for property-preserving subgrid scale modeling in the context of flux-limited finite volume methods for the one-dimensional shallow-water equations. The numerical fluxes of a conservative target scheme are fitted to the coarse-mesh averages of a monotone fine-grid discretization using a neural network to parametrize the subgrid scale components. To ensure positivity preservation and the validity of local maximum principles, we use a flux limiter that constrains the intermediate states of an equivalent fluctuation form to stay in a convex admissible set. The results of our numerical studies confirm that the proposed combination of machine learning with monolithic convex limiting produces meaningful closures even in scenarios for which the network was not trained.</description>

      <title>Existence and non-uniqueness of weak solutions with continuous energy to the 3D deterministic and stochastic Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuity of the kinetic energy is an important property of incompressible viscous fluid flows. We show that for any prescribed finite energy divergence-free initial data there exist infinitely many global in time weak solutions with smooth energy profiles to both the 3D deterministic and stochastic incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In the stochastic case the constructed solutions are probabilistically strong.
  Our proof introduces a new backward convex integration scheme with delicate selections of initial relaxed solutions, backward time intervals, and energy profiles. Our initial relaxed solutions satisfy a new time-dependent frequency truncated NSE, different from the usual approximations as it decreases the large Reynolds error near the initial time, which plays a key role in the construction.</description>

      <title>Breaking of a floating particle raft by water waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16188v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When particles of a few tens of microns are spread on the surface of water, they aggregate under the action of capillary forces and form a thin floating membrane, a particle raft. In a tank with a raft made of graphite powder, we generate in the laboratory gravity surface waves, whose wavelength {about 17 cm} is very large compared to the thickness of the raft {of order 10 microns}. For a sufficiently strong wave amplitude, the raft breaks up progressively by developing cracks and producing fragments whose sizes decrease on a time scale long compared to the period of the wave. We characterize the breaking mechanisms. Then, we investigate the area distribution of the fragments produced during the fragmentation process. The visual appearance of the fragments distributed in size and surrounded by open water bears a {notable} resemblance to the floes produced by the fracturing of sea ice by waves in the polar oceans. Fragmentation concepts and morphological tools built for sea ice floes can be applied to our macroscopic analog, on which the entire dynamic evolution is accessible. {However, the mechanic of the two systems differ, as our particle raft breaks due to the viscous stresses, whereas the sea-ice fractures due its bending by the waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14370v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new derivation of the kinetic equation for weak, non-hydrostatic internal gravity wave turbulence. The equation is equivalent to the one obtained by Caillol &amp; Zeitlin (2000), but it takes a canonical form. We show that it conserves the energy without involving the resonance condition in frequency, and look for the isotropic part of the steady, scale invariant solutions. We provide a parametrization of the resonant manifold of non-hydrostatic internal gravity wave triadic interactions. This allows us to simplify the collision integral, and to evaluate the transfer coefficients of all triadic interactions. In the hydrostatic limit, our equation is equivalent to the Hamiltonian description of Lvov &amp; Tabak (2001).</description>

      <title>Turbulent boundary layer response to uniform changes of the pressure force contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13067v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a turbulent boundary layer (TBL) with uniform pressure force variations, focusing on understanding its response to local pressure force, local pressure force variation (local disequilibrating effect), and upstream history. The studied flow starts as a zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG) TBL, followed by a uniform increase in the ratio of pressure force to turbulent force in the outer region and concludes with a uniform decrease of the same magnitude. The second zone includes a subzone with a diminishing adverse-pressure-gradient (APG), followed by an increasing favorable-pressure-gradient (FPG). In both subzones, the impact remains the same: mean momentum gain in the boundary layer and reduced turbulence. In the outer region, the mean flow responds to force balance changes with a considerable delay. The accumulated flow history effects lead to a FPG TBL at the domain's end with a momentum defect comparable to APG TBLs. Below $y^+=10$, the mean flow responds almost instantaneously to pressure force changes. In the overlap layer, the profiles deviate from the conventional logarithmic law of the ZPG TBL. Regarding the outer-layer turbulence, its subsequent decay is slower than its initial increase, the latter persisting even after the pressure force begins to decrease. As a result of the slow turbulence decay, the FPG TBL at the domain's end exhibits unusually high outer turbulence levels. Near the wall, turbulence responds with a delay to changes in the pressure force partly due to large-scale turbulence influence. This study underscores the complexity of the triple action of the pressure force.</description>

      <title>Long-time emergent dynamics of liquid films undergoing thermocapillary instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of viscous thin film flow has led to the development of highly nonlinear partial differential equations that model how the evolution of the film height is affected by different forces. We investigate a model of interaction between surface tension and the thermocapillary Marangoni effect, with a particular focus on the long-time limit. In this limit, the model predicts the creation of an infinite cascade of successively smaller satellite droplets near points where the film thickness vanishes. Motivated by recent progress on the analysis of discrete self-similarity in thin film equations, we compute solutions in a space- and time-rescaled coordinate system. Using this rescaled system we observe the dynamics much further in time than has previously been achieved. The observed behaviour is close to, but distinct from, previous observations of discretely self-similar thin film flows, in that the rescaled system does not settle down to a periodic solution, but instead has aspects that continue to evolve monotonically in scaled time. This discovery suggests there are as-yet unexplored ways in which discrete self-similarity may be exhibited.</description>

Abstract: Elastoinertial turbulence (EIT) is a chaotic flow resulting from the interplay between inertia and viscoelasticity in wall bounded shear flows. Understanding EIT is important because it is thought to set a limit on the effectiveness of turbulent drag reduction in polymer solutions. Here, we analyze simulations of two dimensional EIT in channel flow using Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD), discovering a family of traveling wave structures that capture the sheetlike stress fluctuations that characterize EIT. The frequency dependence of the leading SPOD mode contains distinct peaks and the mode structures corresponding to these peaks exhibit well defined traveling structures. The structure of the dominant traveling mode exhibits shift reflect symmetry similar to the viscoelasticity modified Tollmien Schlichting (TS) wave, where the velocity fluctuation in the traveling mode is characterized by large scale regular structures spanning the channel and the polymer stress field is characterized by thin, inclined sheets of high polymer stress localized at the critical layers near the channel walls. The traveling structures corresponding to the higher frequency modes have a very similar structure, but are nested in a region roughly bounded by the critical layer positions of the next lower frequency mode. A simple theory based on the idea that the critical layers of mode $\kappa$ form the "walls" for the structure of mode $\kappa+1$ yields quantitative agreement with the observed wave speeds and critical layer positions, indicating self similarity between the structures. The physical idea behind this theory is that the sheetlike localized stress fluctuations in the critical layer prevent velocity fluctuations from penetrating them.</description>

      <title>Numerical-experimental estimation of the deformability of human red blood cells from rheometrical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07143</link>

Abstract: The deformability of human red blood cells (RBCs), which comprise almost 99% of the cells in whole blood, is largely related not only to pathophysiological blood flow but also to the levels of intracellular compounds. Therefore, statistical estimates of the deformability of individual RBCs are of paramount importance in the clinical diagnosis of blood diseases. Although the micro-scale hydrodynamic interactions of individual RBCs lead to non-Newtonian blood rheology, there is no established method to estimate individual RBC deformability from the rheological data of RBC suspensions, and the possibility of this estimation has not been proven. To address this issue, we conducted an integrated analysis of a model of the rheology of RBC suspensions, coupled with macro-rheological data of human RBCs suspended in plasma. Assuming a non-linear curve of the relative viscosity of the suspensions as a function of the cell volume fraction, the statistical average of the membrane shear elasticity was estimated for individual intact RBCs or hardened RBCs. Both estimated values reproduced well the experimentally observed shear-thinning non-Newtonian behavior in these suspensions. We hereby conclude that our complementary approach makes it possible to estimate the statistical average of individual RBC deformability from macro-rheological data obtained with usual rheometric tests.</description>

      <title>Localized jammed clusters persist in shear-thickening suspension subjected to swirling excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic evolution of heterogeneity in shear-thickening suspensions subjected to swirling excitation with a free surface. The uniform state of such a system may lose its stability when the oscillation frequency is above a threshold, and density waves spontaneously form (Shi \textit{et al.} JFM 2024). Here, we report a novel state where jammed clusters emerge in high-density region of the density waves. The jammed cluster exhibits unique motion, creating downstream high-density regions distinct from previously reported state of density waves. Additionally, theoretical calculations show that reducing suspension thickness lowers the frequency and global concentration $\Phi$ threshold for the heterogeneity onset. Notably, the minimal $\Phi$ for instability can be lower than the onset of discontinuous shear thickening transition. We also highlight the role of the free surface in cluster growth and persistence.</description>
