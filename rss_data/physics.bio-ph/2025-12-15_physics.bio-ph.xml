      <title>Marrying critical oscillators with traveling waves shapes nonlinear sound processing in the cochlea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11646v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cochlea's capacity to process a broad range of sound intensities has been linked to nonlinear amplification by critical oscillators. However, while the increasing sensitivity of a critical oscillator upon decreasing the stimulus magnitude comes with proportionally sharper frequency tuning and slower responsiveness -- critical slowing down, the observed bandwidth of cochlear frequency tuning and the cochlear response time vary little with sound level. Because the cochlea operates as a distributed system rather than a single critical oscillator, it remains unclear whether criticality can serve as a fundamental principle for cochlear amplification. Here we tackle this challenge by integrating tonopically distributed critical oscillators in a traveling-wave model of the cochlea. Importantly, critical oscillators generically provide spatial buildup of energy gain from energy pumping into the waves and a key nonlinearity. In addition, our nonlinear model accounts for viscoelastic coupling between the oscillators. The model produces, with a single set of parameters, a family of cochlear tuning curves that quantitatively describe experimental data over a broad range of input levels. Overall, the interplay between generic nonlinear properties of local critical oscillators and distributed effects from traveling waves gives rise to a collective nonlinear response that preserves the power-law responsiveness afforded by criticality, but without paying the price of critical slowing down.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale tissue properties and electric fields in brain stimulation -- bridging the macroscopic and microscopic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16465v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in brain stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link macroscopic assumptions with underlying microscopic tissue structure. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Recent microscopic models have suggested substantial local E-field perturbations and could, in principle, inform mesoscale conductivity. However, the quantitative validity of microscopic models is limited by fixation-related tissue distortion and incomplete extracellular-space reconstruction. We outline approaches that bridge macro- and microscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions, providing a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural activation in brain stimulation.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of literature T1 mapping methods to the underlying magnetization transfer parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Magnetization transfer (MT) has been identified as the principal source of $T_1$ variability in the MRI literature. This study assesses the sensitivity of established $T_1$ mapping techniques to variations in the underlying MT parameters.
  Methods: For each $T_1$-mapping method, the observed $T_1$ was simulated as a function of the underlying MT parameters $p_i^\text{MT}$, corresponding to different brain regions of interest (ROIs) at 3T. As measures of sensitivity, the derivatives $\partial T_1^\text{observed} / \partial p_i^\text{MT}$ were computed and analyzed with a linear mixed-effects model as a function of $p_i^\text{MT}$, ROI, pulse sequence type (e.g., inversion recovery, variable flip angle), and the individual sequences.
  Results: The analyzed $T_1$-mapping sequences have a considerable sensitivity to changes in the semi-solid spin pool size $m_0^\text{s}$, $T_1^\text{f}$ of the free, $T_1^\text{s}$ of the semi-solid spin pool, and the (inverse) exchange rate $T_\text{x}$. All derivatives vary considerably with the underlying MT parameters and between pulse sequences. In general, the derivatives cannot be determined by the sequence type, but rather depend on the implementation details of the sequence. One notable exception is that variable-flip-angle methods are, in general, more sensitive to the exchange rate than inversion-recovery methods.
  Conclusion: Variations in the observed $T_1$ can be caused by several underlying MT parameters, and the sensitivity to each parameter depends on both the underlying MT parameters and the sequence.</description>

      <title>Many interacting particles in solution. I. Screening-ranged expansions of electrostatic potential and energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical many-body formalism for systems of spherical particles carrying arbitrary free charge distributions and interacting in a polarizable electrolyte solution, that we model within the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann framework. Building on the detailed spectral analysis of the associated nonstandard Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators developed in our companion study arXiv:2512.08684, we construct exact explicit expansions of the electrostatic potential and energy in ascending orders of Debye screening thereby obtaining systematic "screening-ranged" series for potentials and energies. These screening-ranged expansions provide a unified and tractable description of many-body electrostatics. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach by showing how it generalizes and improves upon both classical and modern methods, enabling rigorous treatment of heterogeneously charged systems (such as Janus particles) and accurate modeling of higher-order phenomena (such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, like-charge attraction) as well as yielding many-body generalizations to analytical explicit results previously known only in the two-body setting.</description>
