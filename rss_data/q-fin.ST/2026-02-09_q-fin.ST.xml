      <title>Insider Purchase Signals in Microcap Equities: Gradient Boosting Detection of Abnormal Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines whether SEC Form 4 insider purchase filings predict abnormal returns in U.S. microcap stocks. The analysis covers 17,237 open-market purchases across 1,343 issuers from 2018 through 2024, restricted to market capitalizations between \$30M and \$500M. A gradient boosting classifier trained on insider identity, transaction history, and market conditions at disclosure achieves AUC of 0.70 on out-of-sample 2024 data. At an optimized threshold of 0.20, precision is 0.38 and recall is 0.69. The distance from the 52-week high dominates feature importance, accounting for 36% of predictive signal. A momentum pattern emerges in the data: transactions disclosed after price appreciation exceeding 10% yield the highest mean cumulative abnormal return (6.3%) and the highest probability of outperformance (36.7%). This contrasts with the simple mean-reversion intuition often applied to post-run-up entries. The result is robust to winsorization and holds across subsamples. These patterns are consistent with slower information incorporation in illiquid markets, where trend confirmation may filter for higher-conviction insider signals.</description>

      <title>Credit Risk Estimation with Non-Financial Features: Evidence from a Synthetic Istanbul Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial exclusion constrains entrepreneurship, increases income volatility, and widens wealth gaps. Underbanked consumers in Istanbul often have no bureau file because their earnings and payments flow through informal channels. To study how such borrowers can be evaluated we create a synthetic dataset of one hundred thousand Istanbul residents that reproduces first quarter 2025 T\"U\.IK (TURKSTAT) census marginals and telecom usage patterns. Retrieval augmented generation feeds these public statistics into the OpenAI o3 model, which synthesises realistic yet private records. Each profile contains seven socio demographic variables and nine alternative attributes that describe phone specifications, online shopping rhythm, subscription spend, car ownership, monthly rent, and a credit card flag. To test the impact of the alternative financial data CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost are each trained in two versions. Demo models use only the socio demographic variables; Full models include both socio demographic and alternative attributes. Across five fold stratified validation the alternative block raises area under the curve by about one point three percentage and lifts balanced F 1 from roughly 0.84 to 0.95, a fourteen percent gain. We contribute an open Istanbul 2025 Q1 synthetic dataset, a fully reproducible modeling pipeline, and empirical evidence that a concise set of behavioural attributes can approach bureau level discrimination power while serving borrowers who lack formal credit records. These findings give lenders and regulators a transparent blueprint for extending fair and safe credit access to the underbanked.</description>
