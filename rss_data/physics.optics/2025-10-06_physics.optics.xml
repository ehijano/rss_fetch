      <title>Passive harmonic mode-locked laser on lithium niobate integrated photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mode-locked lasers (MLLs) are essential for a wide range of photonic applications, such as frequency metrology, biological imaging, and high-bandwidth coherent communications. The growing demand for compact and scalable photonic systems is driving the development of MLLs on various integrated photonics material platforms. Along these lines, developing MLLs on the emerging thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform holds the promise to greatly broaden the application space of MLLs by harnessing TFLN 's unique electro-optic (E-O) response and quadratic optical nonlinearity. Here, we demonstrate the first electrically pumped, self-starting passive MLL in lithium niobate integrated photonics based on its hybrid integration with a GaAs quantum-well gain medium and saturable absorber. Our demonstrated MLL generates 4.3-ps optical pulses centered around 1060 nm with on-chip peak power exceeding 44 mW. The pulse duration can be further compressed to 1.75 ps via linear dispersion compensation. Remarkably, passive mode-locking occurs exclusively at the second harmonic of the cavity free spectral range, exhibiting a high pulse repetition rate $\sim$20 GHz. We elucidate the temporal dynamics underlying this self-starting passive harmonic mode-locking behavior using a traveling-wave model. Our work offers new insights into the realization of compact, high-repetition-rate MLLs in the TFLN platform, with promising applications for monolithic ultrafast microwave waveform sampling and analog-to-digital conversion.</description>

      <title>Reversing Annealing-Induced Optical Loss in Diamond Microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge for quantum photonic technologies based on spin qubits is the creation of optically active defects in photonic resonators. Several of the most promising defects for quantum applications are hosted in diamond, and are commonly created through ion implantation and annealing at high temperatures and high vacuum. However, the impact of annealing on photonic resonator quality factor, a critical parameter governing their coupling to defects, has not been reported. In this work, we characterize the effect of annealing at temperatures &gt;1200{\deg}C in high vacuum on the quality factors of diamond microdisk resonators. We investigate the optical losses associated with a non-diamond layer formed during annealing, and use Raman spectroscopy to analyze the resonator surface morphology and demonstrate that tri-acid cleaning can restore their optical quality factors. These results show the viability of creating defects in pre-fabricated diamond resonators without degrading their optical properties.</description>

      <title>Curving the Trajectory of Light in Refraction Index Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work seeks to present an investigation about the trajectories followed by rays of light passing through refractive index gradients that was entirely carried by high school students. Such trajectories are curved, therefore contradicting the common sense that light should always travel along straight lines. This fact causes the formation of distorted and striated images, similarly to a type of mirage known as Fata Morgana. Using a rectangular aquarium containing solutions with different gradients of sugar or water with a temperature gradient, we analyzed the conditions for image inversion to occur. Also, we were able to reconstruct a distorted image through our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>XG-Attention-WGAN PIC: Utilizing XGboost-Attention-WGAN for Photonics Integrated Circuit Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) are fundamental for optical computing, communication, quantum information processing, and precision sensing. However, traditional numerical simulations for designing PIC components are computationally intensive and struggle with high-dimensional parameter spaces. This paper introduces XG-Attention-WGAN PIC, a novel framework that synergistically combines Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs) with eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to enhance parameter prediction and inverse design in PICs. We utilize Finite-Difference Time-Domain simulations to generate high-fidelity training data, which is augmented by WGAN-generated synthetic data, yielding a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.26089. When integrated with XGBoost, this error is reduced to 0.008. The integration of a 64-head self-attention mechanism within the WGAN generator significantly improves data quality and model efficiency over 1000 training epochs. Demonstrated on microring resonators, our approach not only achieves superior prediction accuracy and design optimization but also autonomously discovers a novel, experimentally realizable geometry with enhanced Q-factor performance. The proposed framework provides a scalable, data-driven strategy for developing high-performance PIC components, with promising implications for quantum computing and advanced optical systems.</description>

      <title>Advancing Plasmonic Computing with Single-Beam Logic Primitives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic logic circuits combine ultrafast operation with nanoscale integration, making them a strong candidate for next-generation optical computing. Realizing this potential, however, requires overcoming practical challenges such as bulky interferometric designs and reliance on secondary control signals. This work advances plasmonic logic by introducing a single-global threshold mechanism in plasmonic two-wire transmission lines, empowered with polarization modal selectivity and geometric tuning to enable versatile circuit functionality. The scheme embeds the control signal with a single laser beam, supporting six deterministic polarization states and eliminating the need for auxiliary inputs. With this framework, we experimentally demonstrate advanced logic operations, including a 2-bit comparator, parity checkers, and encoder/decoder circuits. The approach reduces circuit footprint by 67% and power consumption by 50% relative to state-of-the-art systems, while maintaining low latency and high stability. By unifying thresholding, polarization, and geometry into a compact, source-free scheme, this work pushes plasmonic nanocircuitry from device-level novelty toward scalable, energy-efficient architectures for next-generation optical processors.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution image projection over an extended depth of field using a diffractive decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image projection systems must be efficient in data storage, computation and transmission while maintaining a large space-bandwidth-product (SBP) at their output. Here, we introduce a hybrid image projection system that achieves extended depth-of-field (DOF) with improved resolution, combining a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based digital encoder with an all-optical diffractive decoder. A CNN-based encoder compresses input images into compact phase representations, which are subsequently displayed by a low-resolution (LR) projector and processed by an analog diffractive decoder for all-optical image reconstruction. This optical decoder is completely passive, designed to synthesize pixel super-resolved image projections that feature an extended DOF while eliminating the need for additional power consumption for super-resolved image reconstruction. Our pixel super-resolution (PSR) image projection system demonstrates high-fidelity image synthesis over an extended DOF of ~267xW, where W is the illumination wavelength, concurrently offering up to ~16-fold SBP improvement at each lateral plane. The proof of concept of this approach is validated through an experiment conducted in the THz spectrum, and the system is scalable across different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. This image projection architecture can reduce data storage and transmission requirements for display systems without imposing additional power constraints on the optical decoder. Beyond extended DOF PSR image projection, the underlying principles of this approach can be extended to various applications, including optical metrology and microscopy.</description>

      <title>Equilateral triangular waveguides, modal structure, attenuation characteristics and quality factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilateral triangular waveguides are one of the very few special kind of waveguides, whose field solutions can be constructed without necessarily solving the Maxwell's equations. Solutions can be obtained simply by superposing some plane wave solutions and requiring the solutions to obey the necessary boundary conditions for each modes, as would be expected of any Maxwell equation's solution or that of any Helmholtz equation resulting from the problem of Heat flow, membrane vibrations, etc. In fact, this was how one of the earlier solutions or eigen functions found by Gabriel Lam\'e, were obtained. Julian Schwinger, performed the same analysis, but used the superposition of complex exponential functions, in order to obtain the eigen functions of an equilateral triangular waveguide. The solutions exhibit other special symmetric properties that leave their solutions invariant and these special symmetries and applications, are what we investigate in this work, particularly as it relates to their attenuation characteristics and quality factors. Finally, by employing the number theory of Eisenstein integers or primes we have obtained a well ordered and more rigorous eigenvalues of the equilateral triangular waveguides, which is definitely something missing in the literature.</description>

      <title>Brilliant source of 19.2 attosecond soft X-ray pulses below the atomic unit of time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic correlations occur on attosecond timescales, dictating how chemical bonds form, energy flows, and materials respond to light. Capturing such many-body processes requires light pulses of similar duration. The soft X-ray water window is vital because it encompasses the principle absorption edges of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen that underpin chemistry, biology, and materials science. However, generating and characterising isolated attosecond pulses that reach into the soft X-ray water window has remained a challenge. We addressed this need and report an isolated attosecond soft X-ray pulse with a duration of 19.2 attoseconds. This pulse reaches into the water window and is shorter than the atomic unit of time (24.2 as). The pulse is supported by a spectrum centred at 243 eV, extending up to 390 eV, and crossing the carbon K-edge with record photon flux: 4.8x10$^10$ photons per second overall and 4.1x10$^9$ photons per second in a 10% bandwidth at the carbon K-shell edge (284 eV). Such an extremely short soft X-ray pulse combines extreme temporal resolution with a coherent ultrabroadband soft X-ray spectrum, opening new opportunities to study electron dynamics in atoms, molecules, and solids, disentangle many-body interactions in correlated systems, and follow non-adiabatic energy flow in molecular complexes. Our results establish a new benchmark for table-top attosecond technology and lay the foundation for its widespread application in science and technology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, binary $ZnSe:Fe^{2+}$ crystals and ternary $Zn_{1-x}Mg_{x}Se:Fe^{2+}$ crystals $(0 &lt; x &lt; 0.6)$ were grown by the vertical Bridgman method in graphite crucibles under high argon pressure. A comparative characterization of the structural, energetic, and optical parameters of the obtained crystals was performed. Theoretical explanations of the observed experimental characteristics, including the specific red-shift of the absorption and emission spectra with increasing solid-solution concentration, are provided. These results could be useful for the development of new laser media based on simple and complex AIIBVI crystals and for targeted engineering of their optical properties.</description>

      <title>Broadband-operational orbital angular momentum generation in nonlocal metasurfaces with maximum efficiency approaching 80%</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal metasurfaces provide a compact route to generating momentum-space optical vortices but are limited by steep dispersion typically associated with high-quality (Q) factor resonances, resulting in narrowband and inefficient operation. Here, we introduce a reflection-type nonlocal metasurface that hybrid-couples a bound state in the continuum (BIC) with two degeneracy points (DPs). This engineered interaction enables on-demand control of dispersion, radiative Q-factors, and polarization states of guided resonances, yielding quasi-flat dispersion and enhanced scattering strength. Full-wave simulations predict near-unity on-resonance conversion and overall efficiencies above 90%, representing a three- to fourfold efficiency improvement and more than fifteenfold bandwidth expansion over conventional designs. Experiments confirm broadband operation from 1480 to 1600 nm, achieving peak efficiency approaching 80% and orbital angular momentum (OAM) purity up to 91.7% under flat-top illumination, while suppressing edge effects and mitigating positional sensitivity and numerical-aperture (NA) dependence. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate direct conversion of zero-order Bessel beams into OAM Bessel (perfect vortex) beams with enhanced wavelength tunability, underscoring the versatility of this approach over diverse illumination conditions. This record-high performance establishes a practical and scalable pathway toward broadband, high-efficiency vortex generation, opening new opportunities across high-dimensional optical communications, advanced imaging, and quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Diffraction-limited operation of micro-metalenses: fundamental bounds and designed rules for pixel integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces provide a compact, flexible, and reliable solution for controlling the wavefront of light. In imaging systems, micro-lens arrays are integrated with pixel matrices to reduce optical crosstalk, enhance photon collection efficiency, and improve spatial resolution. However, as the aperture size of the photonic devices decreases, fundamental limitations associated with diffraction emerge. Here, we theoretically analyze and experimentally demonstrate that these constraints also affect the performance of small functionalized apertures, including metasurfaces and metalenses, emphasizing the increasing impact of diffraction at small pixel sizes. Despite their design versatility, our findings reveal the necessity of accounting for fundamental diffraction properties to optimize the performance of miniature optical metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Quantum Emission in Monolayer WSe2 Transferred onto InP Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localized quantum emitters in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently emerged as solid-state candidates for on-demand sources of single photons. Due to the role of strain in the site-selective creation of TMD emitters, their hybrid integration into photonic structures such as cavities and waveguides is possible using pick-and-place methods. Here we investigate quantum emission from a hybrid structure consisting of a monolayer of WSe2 interfaced with horizontally aligned InP nanowires (NWs). Our experiments reveal multiple narrow and bright emission peaks in the 715-785 nm spectral range and g(2)(0) as low as 0.049, indicating strong antibunching and good single photon purity. The faceted nature of III-V NWs provides unique opportunities for strain engineering, including the potential for placement of emitters on the top surface for optimal coupling. Our findings pave the way for realizing hybrid quantum light sources for integrated quantum photonics that could combine III-V quantum dots with TMD emitters into a single platform.</description>

      <title>Designing Coherent Optical Environment for Dynamic Optical Manipulation with a Simple Control Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for designing coherent optical environments that enable versatile and dynamic optical manipulation. In contrast to conventional material-based near-field platforms, our approach employs a structured coherent light field -- optimized via a back-propagation-based inverse design algorithm -- as the manipulation environment. This light-based platform allows a simple control beam, such as a single plane wave or a low-numerical-aperture Gaussian beam, to steer micro-objects effectively. By establishing a one-to-one correspondence between control beam parameters (e.g., phase/polarization of a plane wave) and particle trapping positions, our method enables real-time and versatile control of particles. A wide range of two- and three-dimensional trajectories -- including circles, squares, tree-like paths, and epicycle-deferent curves -- can be achieved solely by modulating the phase of the control beam. This design strategy for the structured-light environments offers a dynamically reconfigurable, all-optical, and contact-free platform for advanced optical manipulation in free space, with promising applications in nanorobotics, biological probing, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Unleashing HHG Efficiency: The Role of Driving Pulse Duration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High harmonic generation (HHG) is a crucial technology for compact, high-brightness extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and soft X-ray sources, which are key to advancing both fundamental and applied sciences. The availability of advanced driving lasers, with tunable wavelength, power, and pulse duration, opens new opportunities for optimizing HHG-based sources. While scaling laws for wavelength are well understood, this work focuses on how pulse duration impacts HHG efficiency and introduces a unified framework that links microscopic dynamics to macroscopic performance. We establish a practical scaling law for the single-atom dipole moment under phase-matching conditions, demonstrating a 1/t dependence at 515 nm wavelength. By connecting this microscopic scaling to macroscopic conversion efficiency, we provide clear guidelines for optimizing HHG output across different gases and driving wavelengths. Furthermore, we identify fundamental constraints, including the carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) walk-off, which limits efficiency at longer driver wavelengths and becomes especially significant for very short pulses. All predictions are based on simple, accessible formulas, eliminating the need for complex numerical simulations. Experiments confirm these predictions and highlight when short pulses are advantageous, particularly in scenarios where CEP walk-off and absorption effects are minimized. These findings offer practical principles for designing next-generation HHG sources, capable of Watt-level average power and extended spectral reach, enabling more versatile and powerful HHG-based XUV and soft X-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Optical Computing with Spectrally Multiplexed Features in Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved into a critical technology; however, electrical hardware struggles to keep pace with the exponential growth of AI models. Free space optical hardware provides alternative approaches for large-scale optical processing, and in-memory computing, with applications across diverse machine learning tasks. Here, we explore the use of broadband light scattering in free-space optical components, specifically complex media, which generate uncorrelated optical features at each wavelength. By treating individual wavelengths as independent predictors, we demonstrate improved classification accuracy through in-silico majority voting, along with the ability to estimate uncertainty without requiring access to the model's probability outputs. We further demonstrate that linearly combining multiwavelength features, akin to spectral shaping, enables us to tune output features with improved performance on classification tasks, potentially eliminating the need for multiple digital post-processing steps. These findings illustrate the spectral multiplexing or broadband advantage for free-space optical computing.</description>

      <title>Self-Image Multiplicity in a Concave Cylindrical Mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concave mirrors are fundamental optical elements, yet some easily observed behaviors are rarely addressed in standard textbooks, such as the formation of multiple reflected images. Here we investigate self-imaging -- where the observer is also the observed object -- using a concave cylindrical mirror. We predict the number of self-images visible from different observation points and classify space into regions by image count. We then test these predictions with an inexpensive stainless-steel concave cylindrical mirror commonly found in teaching labs. This activity links geometrical optics principles to direct observation and provides a ready-to-use classroom demonstration and student exercise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic platforms have emerged as versatile and powerful classical simulators of quantum dynamics, providing clean, controllable optical analogs of extended structured (i.e., crystalline) electronic systems. While most realizations to date have used only the fundamental mode in each site, recent advances in structured light - particularly the use of higher-order spatial modes, including those with orbital angular momentum - are enabling richer dynamics and new functionalities. These additional degrees of freedom facilitate the emulation of phenomena ranging from topological band structures and synthetic gauge fields to orbitronics. In this perspective, we discuss how exploiting the internal structure of higher-order modes is reshaping the scope and capabilities of photonic platforms for simulating quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Polaritonic spectra of optical Mie voids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The progress in understanding the optical and microscopic properties of polaritons relies on various optical cavities to confine electromagnetic radiation, which causes a demand for new platforms with higher $Q$-factors and better fabrication robustness. In this context, so called Mie voids -- spherical cavities inside a dielectric medium, where the light confinement occurs due to refractive index contrast at the air-dielectric interface -- present a substantial interest. Here, we theoretically study the resonant characteristics and polaritonic spectra of spherical Mie cavities loaded with resonant media, as well as address the inverted problem, where a Mie void is formed inside a resonant dispersive medium. We establish approximate analytical expressions for the $Q$-factors of Mie void cavities, find the parameter ranges of spherical voids leading to the regimes of weak and strong light-matter coupling and analyze the concomitant effects, such as $Q$-factor enhancement and spatial field localization, from the polaritonic perspective. Our result could be valuable for the design of new polaritonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a significant advancement in ultra low power light-by-light phase modulation using open semiconductor microcavities in the strong light-matter coupling regime. We achieve cross-phase modulation of up to 247$\pm$17 mrad per particle between laser beams attenuated to single-photon average intensities. This breakthrough extends the potential for quantum information processing and nonlinear quantum optics in strongly coupled light-matter systems, setting a new benchmark in the field without relying on atom-like emitters. Our findings suggest promising new avenues for scalable quantum optical technologies.</description>

      <title>Tamm Plasmon-Enhanced Widely Tunable Near-Infrared Nanolaser with Superior Efficiency and Output Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic resonances attract significant interest due to their ability to tightly confine electromagnetic fields. Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and localized surface plasmons (LSPs) are widely used in plasmonic nanolasers, but performance is often affected by coupling into reflective and transmissive directions and multiple far-field modes, mainly due to higher-order diffraction from the plasmonic crystal. Here, we utilize the Tamm plasmon mode at the interface between a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) and a metal layer to achieve lasing in the NIR region with wide tunability. Optical Tamm states are excited at the metal-DBR interface by a pump pulse, and emission is enhanced via extraordinary optical transmission through a metallic nanohole array, which suppresses higher-order diffraction and ensures a directional far-field pattern. A second DBR beneath the pump side further suppresses backward emission and enhances forward lasing intensity. The combination of Tamm plasmon excitation and dual-DBR feedback improves cavity response and overall lasing efficiency. This approach provides a cost-effective and versatile route to plasmonic nanolasers with enhanced efficiency, tunability, and integration potential for next-generation on-chip photonic and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Modeling Terahertz Propagation via Frequency-Domain Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) provides a non-invasive and label-free method for probing the internal structure and electromagnetic response of materials. Numerical simulation of THz-TDS can help understanding wave-matter interactions, guiding experimental design, and interpreting complex measurement data. However, existing simulation techniques face challenges in accurately modeling THz wave propagation with low computational cost. Additionally, conventional simulation solvers often require dense spatial-temporal discretization, which limits their applicability to large-scale and real-time scenarios. Simplified analytical models may neglect dispersion, multiple scattering, and boundary effects. To address these limitations, we establish a novel computational framework that integrates frequency-domain physics-informed neural networks (FD-PINNs) with less data-driven. To validate our proposed FD-PINNs, simulation results from finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) and time-domain (TD)-PINNs were used to compare with FD-PINNs. Finally, experimental results from THz-TDS systems were employed to further exhibit accurate reconstruction ability of FD-PINNs.</description>

      <title>Broadband Quantum Photon Source in Step-Chirped Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broadband nonlinear optical devices play a critical role in both classical and quantum optics. Here, we design and fabricate a 6.82-mm-long step-chirped periodically poled lithium niobate~(CPPLN) waveguide on lithium niobate on insulator, which enables quasi-phase matching over a broad bandwidth for second-harmonic generation~(SHG) and spontaneous parametric down-conversion~(SPDC). The SHG achieves an average efficiency of 54.4\%/W/cm$^2$ over the first-harmonic wavelength range of 1510~nm-1620~nm, paving the way for realizing SPDC across a wide range of pump wavelengths. For SPDC, by tuning the pump wavelength to 775~nm, 780~nm, and 785~nm, we achieve broadband photon-pair generation with a maximum full bandwidth and brightness up to 99~THz~(846~nm) and 20~GHz/mW/nm, respectively. Our findings provide an efficient and experiment-friendly approach for generating broadband photon pairs, which holds significant promise for advancing applications in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-Based Dual-Basis Polarization Beam Splitter for efficient entanglement witnessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement witnessing is essential for quantum technologies such as computing, key distribution, and networking. Conventional bulk-optics methods require sequential reconfiguration across multiple polarization bases, limiting efficiency and scalability. We propose a metasurface-based analyzer that performs dual-basis (\sigma_z and \sigma_y) projections simultaneously by mapping them to orthogonal spatial modes. This allows direct access to the commuting two-photon correlators \langle \sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z \rangle and \langle \sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y \rangle required for entanglement witnessing. The metasurface design employs meta-atoms engineered to impart independent linear and circular phase delays through anisotropy and geometric control, resulting in polarization-dependent beam deflection that separates H/V and R/L components. This approach halves the measurement overhead compared to sequential analysis while offering a compact, integrable platform for chip-scale quantum photonics. The proposed scheme provides a path toward efficient entanglement verification with applications in quantum key distribution, quantum repeaters, and scalable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian protection of states from decay in quasi-PT-symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a quasi-PT-symmetric system of two resonators, one of which interacts with a finite-size environment. The interaction with the environment leads to energy losses in the resonators, and the finite size of the environment leads to a non-Markovian dynamics of the relaxation process. We demonstrate that non-Markovian processes in the quasi-PT-symmetric system can make the states of the system infinitely living, loss-protected states, even in the absence of gain. There is a critical value of the interaction between the resonator and the environment below which any state of the system is loss-protected. When the interaction magnitude is greater than the critical value, depending on the coupling strength between the resonators, either one or both states are unprotected. We show that the boundaries of regions with different numbers of protected states are determined by the relaxation rates in the quasi-PT-symmetric system, calculated in the Markovian approximation. By changing the coupling strength between the resonators and the interaction magnitude between the resonator and the environment, the system switches between modes with two, one, or no loss-protected states. This makes it possible to realize stable PT-symmetric devices based on purely dissipative systems. The obtained results are applicable to quantum systems with single excitations, allowing the concept of PT symmetry to be extended to such systems.</description>

Abstract: Single-electron detectors are a key component of electron microscopes and advanced electron optics experiments. We present a YAG:Ce scintillator-based single-electron detector with a spatial resolution of 1 micrometer at an electron energy of 17 keV. Single-electron detection events are identified with an efficiency and purity larger than 0.8 at an electron energy of 17 keV, reaching 0.96 at 30 keV. We show that the detector enables electron diffraction studies with a sample-detector distance comparable to the mean free path of electrons at atmospheric pressure, potentially enabling atmospheric electron diffraction studies.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Frontiers of Light: Magnetized Plasma Lenses and Chirp Tailoring for Extreme Intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, an innovative scheme is proposed that exploits the response of magnetized plasmas to realize a refractive index exceeding unity for right circularly polarized (RCP) waves. Using two- and three-dimensional Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations with the OSIRIS 4.0 framework, it is shown that a shaped magnetized plasma lens (MPL) can act as a glass/solid-state-based convex lens, amplifying laser intensity via transverse focusing. Moreover, by integrating three key ingredients, a tailored plasma lens geometry, a spatially structured strong magnetic field, and a suitably chirped laser pulse, simultaneous focusing and compression of the pulse has been achieved. The simulations reveal up to a 100-fold increase in laser intensity, enabled by the combined action of the MPL and the chirped pulse profile. With recent advances in high-field magnet technology, shaped plasma targets, and controlled chirped laser systems, this approach offers a promising pathway toward experimentally reaching extreme intensities.</description>

      <title>Emission dynamics and spectrum of a nanoshell-based plasmonic nanolaser spaser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13812v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study theoretically the emission and lasing properties of a single nanoshell spaser nanoparticle, or plasmonic nanolaser, made of an active core (gain material) and a plasmonic metal shell. Based on an analytical framework coupling together time-dependent equations for the gain and the metal, we calculate the lasing threshold with the help of an instability analysis. We characterize the regime under the threshold, where the nanoshell behaves as an optical amplifier when excited by an incident probe field. We then investigate in depth the non-linear lasing regime above the threshold, under autonomous conditions (free lasing without external drive), by computing the system's dynamics both in the transient state and in the final steady state. We show that at threshold, the lasing starts at one frequency only, usually one of the plasmon resonances of the nanoshell; then as the gain is further raised, the emission widens to other frequencies. This differs significantly from previous findings in the literature, which found only one emission wavelength above threshold. We proceed to calculate the complete (maximal) emission spectrum of the nanolaser as well as its emission linewidth, both of which are evidenced to be affected by unusually strong frequency shifts (pull-out) effects. We find that the nanolaser emission is highly asymmetrical spectrally and only occurs on one side (high-frequency) of the plasmon resonance. Finally, we show that the spectral position of the emission line can be tuned across the whole visible range, by changing the geometrical aspect ratio of the nanoshell.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the optical properties of bi-isotropic materials under the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of axion electrodynamics. Four refractive indices associated with circularly polarized waves are achieved, implying circular birefringence with rotatory power endowed with double sign reversal, an exotic optical signature for chiral dielectrics. The Kerr rotation and ellipticity are analyzed, with an unusual observation of a giant rotation angle deprived of discontinuity. Anomalous enhanced reflectance (R greater than unity) is also reported, associated with negative refraction stemming from the anomalous transport properties. These effects constitute the singular optical signature of a nonequilibrium bi-isotropic medium with the AHE.</description>

      <title>Robust purely optical signatures of Floquet states in laser-dressed crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions can create non-equilibrium materials with on-demand novel functionalities. For periodically driven solids, the Floquet theorem provides the natural states to characterize the physical properties of these laser-dressed systems. However, signatures of the Floquet states are needed, as common experimental conditions, such as pulsed laser excitation and dissipative many-body dynamics, can disrupt their formation and survival. Here, we identify a tell-tale signature of Floquet states in the linear optical response of laser-dressed solids that remains prominent even in the presence of strong spectral congestion of bulk matter. To do so, we introduce a computationally efficient strategy based on the Floquet formalism to finally capture the full frequency-dependence in the optical response properties of realistic laser-dressed crystals, and use it investigate the Floquet engineering in a first-principle model for ZnO of full dimensionality. The computations reveal intense, spectrally isolated, laser-controllable, absorption/stimulated emission features at mid-infrared energies present for a wide range of laser-driving conditions that arise due to the hybridization of the Floquet states. As such, these spectral features open a purely optical pathway to investigate the birth and survival of Floquet states while avoiding the experimental challenges of fully reconstructing the band structure.</description>

      <title>HoToPy: A toolbox for X-ray holo-tomography in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Python toolbox for holographic and tomographic X-ray imaging. It comprises a collection of phase retrieval algorithms for the deeply holographic and direct contrast imaging regimes, including non-linear approaches and extended choices of regularization, constraint sets, and optimizers, all implemented with a unified and intuitive interface. Moreover, it features auxiliary functions for (tomographic) alignment, image processing, and simulation of imaging experiments. The capability of the toolbox is illustrated by the example of a catalytic nanoparticle, imaged in the deeply holographic regime at the 'GINIX' instrument of the P10 beamline at the PETRA III storage ring (DESY, Hamburg). Due to its modular design, the toolbox can be used for algorithmic development and benchmarking in a lean and flexible manner, or be interfaced and integrated in the reconstruction pipeline of other synchrotron or XFEL instruments for phase imaging based on propagation.</description>

      <title>THz-PINNs: Time-Domain Forward Modeling of Terahertz Spectroscopy with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is a powerful tool for extracting optical and electrical parameters, as well as probing internal structures and surface morphology of materials. However, conventional simulation techniques, such as the finite element method (FEM) and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD), face challenges in accurately modeling THz wave propagation. These difficulties arise from the broad operating bandwidth of THz-TDS (~0.1-10 THz), which demands extremely high temporal resolution to capture pulse dynamics and fine spatial resolution to resolve microstructures and interface effects. To address these limitations, we introduce physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) into THz-TDS modeling for the first time. Through a comprehensive analysis of forward problems in the time domain, we demonstrate the feasibility and potential of PINNs as a powerful framework for advancing THz wave simulation and analysis.</description>

      <title>Infrared Spectroradiometry of Lithium Benzoate from 21 to 235 THz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an extensive survey of the thermal radiation properties of lithium benzoate. We heated the sample from 313 to 553 K, just below the melting point, while performing an infrared spectroradiometry with an FT-IR spectrometer from 21 to 235 THz (700-7800 cm$^{-1}$). We have provided a detailed analysis of the infrared spectrum data and a comparison of the absorption spectrum of the same sample. It turned out that the recorded spectra are not only different from ordinary absorption spectra but also carry substantial information about the temperature dependence of the population of vibrationally excited states. We conclude by proposing a hypothesis on the thermal excitation mechanism of vibrational energy levels of molecules consistent with the distinct characteristics of the obtained infrared emission spectra.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Compact Passive Resonant Fiber Optic Gyroscope by Using Non-Reciprocal Polarization Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel passive resonant fiber-optic gyroscope (RFOG) design that achieves two true quadrature points at $\pi/2 $ and $3\pi/2$, enabling angular rotation measurement with maximum sensitivity. The use of a broadband light source, as demonstrated in previous studies, eliminates the need for precise frequency locking, while the resonant enhancement allows high sensitivity with significantly shorter fiber lengths. Building on this approach, the present work integrates a Non-Reciprocal Polarization Dependent Phase Shifter (NRPPS) into the broadband RFOG configuration, called NRPPS-RFOG, enabling truly passive operation without the need for active modulation-demodulation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the coupling ratio and NRPPS phase shift critically influence both sensitivity and linearity. An additional NRPPS section extends the measurable angular rotation range, addressing limitations arising from long fiber loops. The proposed design combines compactness, high performance, and low complexity, offering a practical path toward navigation grade RFOGs. These results highlight the potential of passive NRPPS-RFOGs for cost-effective, high-precision rotational sensing in demanding applications.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Spontaneous Emission Enhancement by Non-Hermitian Momentum-Space Bound States in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional Purcell theory emphasizes high quality factors (Q) for spontaneous emission (SE) enhancement in cavities, but overlooks collective Bloch mode effects in periodic nanostructures like photonic crystal slabs. We introduce a unified temporal coupled-mode framework to compute Purcell and photoluminescence factors through momentum-space integration, revealing anomalous SE enhancement by non-Hermitian momentum-space bound states in the continuum (BICs). In silicon gratings with comparable effective mode volumes, this yields substantial SE enhancement in low-Q regimes--defying the traditional high-Q paradigm and inversely correlated with system Q--while emission rates are stably twice the photoluminescence, eliminating critical coupling requirements. Unique spectral profiles, contradicting Lorentzian/Fano assumptions, arise from collective mode interactions. Full-wave simulations confirm these challenges to conventional wisdom, with non-Hermitian BICs outperforming high-Q designs across broad numerical apertures. This establishes a novel paradigm leveraging non-Hermiticity and topological protection for robust, bright emitters, redefining nanophotonic applications in lasers and light-emitting diodes</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Effect Improves Quantum Battery Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum battery (QB) is an application of quantum thermodynamics which uses quantum effects to store and transfer energy, overcoming the limitations of classical batteries and potentially improving performance. However, due to the interaction with the external environment, it will lead to decoherence and thus reduce the lifetime of QBs. Here, we propose suppressing the environmental dissipation in the energy-storage process of the QB by exploiting the electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) and bound states. By constructing a hybrid system composed of a four-level atom and a coupled-cavity array, two bound states are formed in the system when the energy of the QB is in the energy band of the cavity array. Due to the bound states and the EIT effect, the ambient dissipation is significantly suppressed, which improves the lifetime of the QB. In addition, we show that when the energy of the QB is in resonance with the cavity, the ergotropy of the QB reaches the maximum. Furthermore, there exists an optimal coupling strength between two neighbouring cavities which helps improve the performance of the QB. These discoveries may shed the light on the design of high-efficiency QBs.</description>

      <title>Interaction effects on electronic Floquet spectra: Excitonic effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering of electronic states by light is a central topic in modern experiments. However, the impact of many-body interactions on the single-electron properties remains unclear in this non-equilibrium situation. We propose that interaction effects could be reasonably understood by performing perturbative expansion in both the pump field and the electron-electron interaction when computing physical quantities. As an example, we apply this approach to semiconductors and show analytically that excitonic effects, i.e., effects of electron-hole interaction, lead to dramatic corrections to the single-electron Floquet spectra even when the excitons are only virtually excited by the pump light. We compute these effects in phosphorene and monolayer MoS$_2$ for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical experiments.</description>

      <title>Performance of multiple filter-cavity schemes for frequency-dependent squeezing in gravitational-wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave detectors use state-of-the-art quantum technologies to reduce the noise induced by vacuum fluctuations, via injection of squeezed states of light. Future detectors, such as Einstein Telescope, may require the use of two filter cavities or a 3-mirror coupled filter cavity to achieve a complex rotation of the squeezing ellipse, in order to reduce the quantum noise over the whole detector bandwidth. In this work, we compare the theoretical feasibility and performances of these two optical layouts and their resilience with respect to different degradation sources (optical losses, mismatching, locking precision), analytically and numerically. We extend previous analysis on squeezing degradation and find that the coupled cavity scheme provides similar or better performances than the two-cavity option, in terms of resilience with respect to imperfections and optical losses. We further highlight the role of mode-mismatch phases in limiting squeezing. Finally, we propose a possible two-step implementation scheme for Einstein Telescope using a single filter cavity that can be possibly upgraded into a coupled filter cavity.</description>

      <title>Harnessing multi-mode optical structure for chemical reactivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prospect of controlling chemical reactivity using frequency-tunable optical microcavities has materialized over the past decade, evolving into a fascinating yet challenging new field of polaritonic chemistry, a multidisciplinary domain at the intersection of quantum optics, chemical dynamics, and non-equilibrium many-body physics. While most theoretical efforts to date have focused on single-mode cavities, practical implementations in polaritonic chemistry typically involve planar optical cavities that support a series of equally spaced photon modes, determined by the cavity geometry. In this work, we present a numerically exact, fully quantum-mechanical study of chemical reactions in few-mode cavities, revealing two key scenarios by which multi-mode effects can enhance cavity-modified reactivity. The first scenario emerges when the free spectral range is comparable to the single-mode Rabi splitting. In such cases, hybridization between a rate-decisive molecular vibration and a central resonant cavity mode reshapes the resonance landscape, enabling additional reaction pathways mediated by adjacent cavity modes. The second scenario exploits the intrinsic anharmonicity of molecular vibrations, which gives rise to multiple dipole-allowed transitions with distinct energies. Under multi-mode strong coupling, where different cavity modes individually resonate with these distinct transitions, multi-photon processes involving sequential absorption across multiple modes become accessible. This leads to a nontrivial and non-additive rate enhancement via cascade-like vibrational ladder climbing. Together, these findings offer new strategies for tailoring chemical reactivity by harnessing the structural richness of multi-mode structure, offering valuable insights for optimal experimental designs in polaritonic catalysis.</description>

      <title>Advancing the hBN Defects Database through Photophysical Characterization of Bulk hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gained significant attention due to a wide range of defects that offer high quantum efficiency and single-photon purity at room temperature. Most theoretical studies on hBN defects simulate monolayers, as this is computationally cheaper than calculating bulk structures. However, most experimental studies are carried out on multilayer to bulk hBN, which creates additional possibilities for discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, we present an extended database of hBN defects that includes a comprehensive set of bulk hBN defects along with their excited-state photophysical properties. The database features over 120 neutral defects, systematically evaluated across charge states ranging from -2 to 2 (600 defects in total). For each defect, the most stable charge and spin configurations are identified and used to compute the zero-phonon line, photoluminescence spectrum, absorption spectrum, Huang-Rhys (HR) factor, interactive radiative lifetimes, transition dipole moments, and polarization characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the electron-phonon coupling strength is primarily influenced by the presence of vacancies, which tend to induce stronger lattice distortions and broaden phonon sidebands. Additionally, correlation analysis shows that while most properties are independent, the HR factor strongly correlates with the configuration coordinates. All data are publicly available at https://h-bn.info, along with a new application programming interface (API) to facilitate integration with machine learning workflows. This database is therefore designed to bridge the gap between theory and experiment, aid in the reliable identification of quantum emitters, and support the development of machine-learning-driven approaches in quantum materials research.</description>

      <title>Wavelength dependence of laser pulse filamentation in the close spectral vicinity of atomic resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation and nonlinear self-focusing of TW power laser pulses that create 10-m-scale, highly homogeneous plasma channels in rubidium vapor. Using computational solutions of the relevant propagation equations, we study the effects of the ionizing pulse central wavelength in relation to the resonance frequencies of atomic rubidium. Recent experiments show that pulse propagation and plasma channel creation is distinctly different for 780 nm laser pulses (resonant with the rubidium $D_2$ line) and 810 nm laser pulses. We study pulse propagation in a $\pm$30 nm range around the $D_2$ resonance and find that the results are distinctly different when tuning to sub-resonant wavelengths from those obtained for super-resonant wavelengths. For pulse wavelengths below the resonance the behavior is similar to the resonant case, characterized by strong self-focusing and a sharp plasma boundary. Pulse wavelengths above 780 nm on the other hand yield gradually weaker self-focusing and an increasingly diffuse plasma boundary. Our results suggest that the observed behavior can be attributed to an interplay between multiple factors: anomalous dispersion around atomic resonances, resonant transitions between excited states of Rb lying in the 740-780 nm range and wavelength-dependent multiphoton ionization rates.</description>

      <title>One- and two-dimensional solitons under the action of the inverted cubic-quintic nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The usual cubic-quintic (CQ) nonlinearity is proved to sustain one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) broad (flat-top) solitons. In this work, we demonstrate that 1D and 2D soliton families can be supported, in the semi-infinite bandgap (SIBG), by the interplay of a lattice potential and the nonlinearity including self-defocusing cubic and self-focusing quintic terms, with the sign combination inverted with respect to the usual CQ nonlinearity. The families include fundamental and dipole solitons in 1D, and fundamental, quadrupole, and vortex solitons in 2D. The power, shapes, and stability of the solitons are reported. The results are strongly affected by the positions of the solitons in SIBG, the families being unstable very close to or very far from the SIBG's edge. The inverted CQ nonlinearity, considered in this work, sustains sharp 1D and 2D stable solitons, which can be naturally used as bit pixels in photonic data-processing applications.</description>

      <title>Signal-to-noise and spatial resolution in in-line imaging. 3. Optimization using a simple model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of optimization of propagation-based phase-contrast imaging setups is considered in the case of projection X-ray imaging and three-dimensional tomography with phase retrieval. For two-dimensional imaging, a simple model for a homogeneous edge feature embedded in a bulk sample is used to obtain analytical expressions for the image intensity. This model allows for explicit optimization of the geometrical parameters of the imaging setup and the choice of X-ray energy that maximizes the image contrast or the contrast-to-noise ratio. We also consider the question of optimization of the biomedical X-ray imaging quality characteristic which balances the contrast-to-noise against the spatial resolution and the radiation dose. In the three-dimensional case corresponding to propagation-based phase-contrast tomography with phase retrieval according to Paganin's method, the optimization of the imaging setup is studied with respect to the source size, the detector resolution, the geometrical magnification and the X-ray energy.</description>
