      <title>PySEMTools: A library for post-processing hexahedral spectral element data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PySEMTools is a Python-based library for post-processing simulation data produced with high-order hexahedral elements in the context of the spectral element method in computational fluid dynamics. It aims to minimize intermediate steps typically needed when analyzing large files. Specifically, the need to use separate codebases (like the solvers themselves) at post-processing. For this effect, we leverage the use of message passing interface (MPI) for distributed computing to perform typical data processing tasks such as spectrally accurate differentiation, integration, interpolation, and reduced order modeling, among others, on a spectral element mesh. All the functionalities are provided in self-contained Python code and do not depend on the use of a particular solver. We believe that `PySEMTools` provides tools to researchers to accelerate scientific discovery and reduce the entry requirements for the use of advanced methods in computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Laser flash analysis using the Cattaneo heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal diffusivity of solid materials is commonly measured using laser flash analysis. This technique involves applying a heat pulse to the front surface of a small sample of the material and calculating the thermal diffusivity from the resulting increase in temperature on the back surface. Current formulas for the thermal diffusivity are based on the assumption that heat is transported within the sample according to the standard heat equation. While this assumption is valid in most practical cases, it admits the non-physical property of infinite propagation speed, that is, the heat pulse applied at the front surface is instantaneously perceived at the back surface. This paper carries out a mathematical analysis to determine the effect of replacing the standard heat equation in laser flash analysis by the Cattaneo heat equation, which exhibits finite propagation speed through the inclusion of a relaxation time in the Fourier law. The main results of the paper include (i) analytical insights into the spatiotemporal behaviour of temperature within the sample and (ii) analytical formulas for determining the thermal diffusivity and relaxation time of the sample. Numerical experiments exploring and verifying the analytical results are presented with supporting MATLAB code made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Accurate Modeling of LEGO-like vdW Heterostructures: Integrating Machine Learned with Anisotropic Interlayer Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the structural reconstruction and thermodynamic behavior of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures remains a significant challenge due to the limitations of conventional force fields in capturing their complex mechanical, thermal, electronic, and tribological properties. To address these limitations, we develop a hybrid framework that combines single-layer machine-learned potential ($s$MLP) with physics-based anisotropic interlayer potential (ILP), effectively decoupling intralayer and interlayer interactions. This $s$MLP+ILP approach modularizes the modeling of vdW heterostructures like assembling LEGOs, reducing the required training configurations by at least an order of magnitude compared to the pure MLP approach, while retaining predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. We validate our framework by accurately reproducing the mechanical properties of graphite, and resolving intricate Moir\'e patterns in graphene/$h$-BN bilayers and graphene/graphene/$h$-BN trilayer heterostructures, achieving excellent agreement with experimental observations. Leveraging the developed $s$MLP+ILP approach, we reveal the stacking order-dependent formation of Moir\'e superlattice in trilayer graphene/$h$-BN/MoS$_2$ heterostructures, demonstrating its ability to accurately model large-scale vdW systems comprising hundreds of thousands of atoms with near $ab$ $initio$ precision. These findings demonstrate that hybrid $s$MLP+ILP framework remarkably outperforms existing pure machine-learned or empirical potentials, offering a scalable and transferable solution for accurately and extensively modeling complex vdW materials across diverse applications, including sliding ferroelectricity, thermal management, resistive switching, and superlubric nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Tuning methods for multigap drift tube linacs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multigap cavities are used extensively in linear accelerators to achieve velocities up to a few percent of the speed of light, driving nuclear physics research around the world. Unlike for single-gap structures, there is no closed-form expression to calculate the output beam parameters from the cavity voltage and phase. To overcome this, we propose to use a method based on the integration of the first and second moments of the beam distribution through the axially symmetric time-dependent fields of the cavity. A beam-based calibration between the model's electric field scaling and the machine's rf amplitudes is presented, yielding a fast online energy change method, returning cavity amplitude and phase necessary for a desired output beam energy and energy spread. The method is validated with 23Na6+ beam energy measurements.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in Graph Neural Networks with Shallow Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have revolutionized materials discovery by providing accurate and efficient predictions of molecular and material properties. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art approach due to their ability to capture complex atomic interactions. However, GNNs often produce unreliable predictions when encountering out-of-domain data and it is difficult to identify when that happens. To address this challenge, we explore Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques, focusing on Direct Propagation of Shallow Ensembles (DPOSE) as a computationally efficient alternative to deep ensembles. By integrating DPOSE into the SchNet model, we assess its ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates across diverse Density Functional Theory datasets, including QM9, OC20, and Gold Molecular Dynamics. Our findings often demonstrate that DPOSE successfully distinguishes between in-domain and out-of-domain samples, exhibiting higher uncertainty for unobserved molecule and material classes. This work highlights the potential of lightweight UQ methods in improving the robustness of GNN-based materials modeling and lays the foundation for future integration with active learning strategies.</description>

      <title>A novel fast sweeping method for computing the attenuation operator $t^*$ in absorbing media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $t^*$ represents the total path attenuation and characterizes the amplitude decay of a propagating seismic wave. Calculating the attenuation operator $t^*$ is typically required in seismic attenuation tomography. Traditional methods for calculating $t^*$ require determining the ray path explicitly. However, ray tracing can be computationally intensive when processing large datasets, and conventional ray tracing techniques may fail even in mildly heterogeneous media. In this study, we propose a modified fast sweeping method (MFSM) to solve the governing equation for $t^*$ without explicitly calculating the ray path. The approach consists of two main steps. First, the traveltime field is calculated by numerically solving the eikonal equation using the fast sweeping method. Second, $t^*$ is computed by solving its governing equation with the MFSM, based on the discretization of the gradient of $t^*$ using an upwinding scheme derived from the traveltime gradient. The MFSM is rigorously validated through comparisons with analytical solutions and by examining $t^*$ errors under grid refinement in both simple and complex models. Key performance metrics, including convergence, number of iterations, and computation time, are evaluated. Two versions of the MFSM are developed for both Cartesian and spherical coordinate systems. We demonstrate the practical applicability of the developed MFSM in calculating $t^*$ in North Island, and discuss the method's efficiency in estimating earthquake response spectra.</description>

      <title>Phase field model of Coulomb explosion damage in solid induced by ultrashort laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much experimental evidence reveals that Coulomb explosion governs non-thermal material removal under femtosecond or even shorter laser pulses, and non-thermal laser damage has been a topic widely discussed. Nevertheless, there is still no continuum mechanical model capable of describing the evolution of such damage. In this study, we develop a model that characterizes solid damage through a phase field variable governed by Allen-Cahn dynamics. The parameter of the model is defined by a conceptual mechanism: during Coulomb explosion, electron pressure surpasses the interatomic barrier potential, dissociates material from the solid surface as small equivalent particles and resulting in localized damage. The numerical simulation validates the model's availability and demonstrate its ability to predict damage morphology under varying laser conditions. This work advances the understanding of non-thermal ablation and provides a tool for optimizing ultrafast laser processing.</description>

      <title>Practical Application of the Quantum Carleman Lattice Boltzmann Method in Industrial CFD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations are crucial in industrial applications but require extensive computational resources, particularly for extreme turbulent regimes. While classical digital approaches remain the standard, quantum computing promises a breakthrough by enabling a more efficient encoding of large-scale simulations with a limited number of qubits.
  This work presents a practical numerical assessment of a hybrid quantum-classical approach to CFD based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). The inherently non-linear LBM equations are linearized via a Carleman expansion and solved using the quantum Harrow Hassidim Lloyd algorithm (HHL). We evaluate this method on three benchmark cases featuring different boundary conditions, periodic, bounceback, and moving wall, using statevector emulation on high-performance computing resources.
  Our results confirm the validity of the approach, achieving median error fidelities on the order of $10^{-3}$ and success probabilities sufficient for practical quantum state sampling. Notably, the spectral properties of small lattice systems closely approximate those of larger ones, suggesting a pathway to mitigate one of HHL's bottlenecks: eigenvalue pre-evaluation.</description>

      <title>Can Neural Networks Bridge the Gap Between Lagrangian Mesh-Free Methods and High-Order Interpolants?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mesh-free numerical methods offer flexibility in discretising complex geometries, showing potential where mesh-based methods struggle. While high-order approximations can be obtained via consistency correction using linear systems, they remain prohibitively expensive in Lagrangian formulations, which often exhibit low-order convergence. Here, we explore the use of machine learning (ML) to bridge the gap between mesh-free Lagrangian simulations and high-order approximations. We develop strategies to couple data-driven models, in particular multilayer perceptrons and residual MLPs with the Local Anisotropic Basis Function Method (LABFM), as an exemplar high-order mesh-free method. In the first strategy, we use neural networks to surrogate the high-order kernel; in the second, we develop surrogate models for computing the solutions of dense, low-rank linear systems present in high-order mesh-free methods. Results from networks aimed at predicting support nodal weights yield a qualitative match with validation data, but fall short in eliminating lower-order errors due to inaccuracies in the ML-computed weights, and thus leading to divergent behaviour. Regarding the second strategy, the ML-computed solution vector generates residuals with mean absolute errors of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$. However, convergence studies reveal this level of accuracy to be insufficient, causing derivative operators to diverge at a lower resolution and achieve a lower accuracy than LABFM theoretically allows. Furthermore, there is marginal computational gain when computing the solution vector with neural networks compared to LU factorisation. These findings indicate that insufficient accuracy challenges both using neural networks as surrogates for high-order kernels and solve ill-conditioned linear systems, while the additional high computational cost systems further limits the latter's practicality.</description>

      <title>Chaotic advection in a steady three-dimensional MHD flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the 3D stationary flow of a weakly conducting fluid in a cubic cavity, driven by the Lorentz force created by two permanent magnets and a weak constant current. Our goal is to determine the conditions leading to efficient mixing within the cavity. The flow is composed of a large cell created by one side magnet, superposed to two cells created by a central magnet perpendicular to the first one. The overall structure of this flow, obtained here by solving the Stokes equations with Lorentz forcing, is similar to the tri-cellular model flow studied by Toussaint et. al. (Phys. Fluids. 7, 1995). Chaotic advection in this flow is analyzed by means of Poincar\'e sections, Lyapunov exponents and expansion entropies. In addition, we quantify the quality of mixing by computing contamination rates, homogeneity, as well as mixing times. We observe that, though individual vortices have poor mixing properties, the superposition of both flows creates chaotic streamlines and efficient mixing.</description>

      <title>Simulating the anharmonic phonon spectrum in critical systems: self-consistent phonons and temperature-dependent effective potential methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and simulating the thermodynamic and dynamical properties of materials affected by strong ionic anharmonicity is a central challenge in material science. Much interest is in material displaying critical displacive behaviour, such as near a ferroelectric transition, charge-density waves, or in general displacive second-order transitions. In these cases, molecular dynamics suffer from a critical slowdown and emergent long-range fluctuations of the order parameter. Two prominent methods have emerged to solve this issue: Self-consistent renormalization of the phonons like the Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) and Self-Consistent Phonons (SCP), and methods that fit the potential energy landscape from short molecular dynamics trajectories, like the Temperature-Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP). Despite their widespread use, the limitations of these methods are often overlooked in the proximity of critical points.
  Here, we establish a guiding rule set for the accuracy of each method on critical quantities: free energy for computing the phase diagrams, static correlation functions for inferring phase stability and critical behaviours, and dynamic correlation functions for vibrational spectra and thermal transport. Also, a new TDEP implementation is introduced to fix the calculation of dynamical spectra, restoring the correct perturbative limit violated by the standard TDEP approach.
  Results are benchmarked both against an exact one-dimensional anharmonic potential and two prototypical anharmonic crystals: the ferroelectric PbTe and the metal-halide perovskite CsSnI3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) method enhances optimization in variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) by incorporating geometric insights from the quantum state space through the Fubini-Study metric. In this work, we extend QNG by introducing higher-order integrators and geodesic corrections using the Riemannian Euler update rule and geodesic equations, deriving an updated rule for the Quantum Natural Gradient with Geodesic Correction (QNGGC). We also develop an efficient method for computing the Christoffel symbols necessary for these corrections, leveraging the parameter-shift rule to enable direct measurement from quantum circuits. Through theoretical analysis and practical examples, we demonstrate that QNGGC significantly improves convergence rates over standard QNG, highlighting the benefits of integrating geodesic corrections into quantum optimization processes. Our approach paves the way for more efficient quantum algorithms, leveraging the advantages of geometric methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Parameter Molecular MRI Quantification using Physics-Informed Self-Supervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biophysical model fitting plays a key role in obtaining quantitative parameters from physiological signals and images. However, the model complexity for molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often translates into excessive computation time, which makes clinical use impractical. Here, we present a generic computational approach for solving the parameter extraction inverse problem posed by ordinary differential equation (ODE) modeling coupled with experimental measurement of the system dynamics. This is achieved by formulating a numerical ODE solver to function as a step-wise analytical one, thereby making it compatible with automatic differentiation-based optimization. This enables efficient gradient-based model fitting, and provides a new approach to parameter quantification based on self-supervised learning from a single data observation. The neural-network-based train-by-fit pipeline was used to quantify semisolid magnetization transfer (MT) and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) amide proton exchange parameters in the human brain, in an in-vivo molecular MRI study (n = 4). The entire pipeline of the first whole brain quantification was completed in 18.3 $\pm$ 8.3 minutes. Reusing the single-subject-trained network for inference in new subjects took 1.0 $\pm$ 0.2 s, to provide results in agreement with literature values and scan-specific fit results.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the aerodynamic performance of the symmetric NACA 0018 airfoil under harmonic pitching motions at low Reynolds numbers, a regime characterized by the presence of laminar separation bubbles and their impact on aerodynamic forces. The analysis encompasses oscillation frequencies of 1 Hz, 2 Hz, and 13.3 Hz, with amplitudes of 4{\deg} and 8{\deg}, along with steady-state simulations conducted for angles of attack up to 20{\deg} to validate the numerical model. The results reveal that the Transition SST turbulence model provides improved predictions of aerodynamic forces at higher Reynolds numbers but struggles at lower Reynolds numbers, where laminar flow effects dominate. The inclusion of the 13.3 Hz frequency, relevant to Darrieus vertical-axis wind turbines, demonstrates the model's effectiveness in capturing dynamic hysteresis loops and reduced oscillations, contrasting with the \(k-\omega\) SST model. Comparisons with XFOIL further highlight challenges in accurately modeling laminar-to-turbulent transitions and dynamic flow phenomena. These findings offer valuable insights into the aerodynamic behavior of thick airfoils under low Reynolds number conditions and contribute to advancing the understanding of turbulence modeling, particularly in applications involving vertical-axis wind turbines.</description>
