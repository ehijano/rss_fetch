      <title>Explicit Upper Bounds on Decay Rates of Fourier Transforms of Self-similar Measures on Self-similar Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of Fourier transforms of probability measures on fractal sets plays an important role in recent research. Faster decay rates are known to yield enhanced results in areas such as metric number theory. This paper focuses on self-similar probability measures defined on self-similar sets. Explicit upper bounds are derived for their decay rates, improving upon prior research. These findings are illustrated with an application to sets of numbers whose digits in their L\"uroth representations are restricted to a finite set.</description>

      <title>Mutual Annihilation of Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of tiles in $\mathbb Z_n\times\mathbb Z_n$, the author observed an interesting phenomenon that if $(A,B)$ is a tiling pair with $|A|=|B|$, then sometimes $(A,B)$ is also a spectral pair and vice versa. Moreover, in such cases actually one of the components would have universality (i.e., it is the universal spectrum/tiling complement for its tiling complements/spectra). The purpose of this article is to investigate such a phenomenon. It turns out that this must be accompanied by a quite structural pattern, which shall be analyzed using the symplectic Fourier transform. Under such configuration it is shown that the phenomenon persists either (1) if $A$ is an order $n$ subgroup, or (2) if $n$ is a prime number and $A$ complements an order $n$ subgroup, or (3) if $n=p^2$, and $A$ complements the non-cyclic order $n$ subgroup.</description>

      <title>Failure of Orthogonality of Rounded Fourier Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to prove estimates for $$ \left| \sum_{k=1}^{n} \mbox{sign} \left( \cos \left( \frac{2\pi a}{n} k \right) \right) \mbox{sign} \left( \cos \left( \frac{2\pi b}{n} k \right) \right)\right|,$$ when $n$ is prime and $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$. We show that the expression can only be large if $a^{-1}b \in \mathbb{F}_n$ (or a small multiple thereof) is close to $1$. This explains some of the surprising line patterns in $A^T A$ when $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is the signed discrete cosine transform. Similar results seem to exist at a great level of generality.</description>

      <title>Higher order pointwise differential for distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of pointwise differentials for distributions is a way to extract local information of distributions by rescaling the distribution at a point. In this paper, we study the pointwise differentials for distributions corresponding to a negative order Sobolev functions. Our main results prove Borel regularity, Lusin approximation, rectifiability, and a Rademacher theorem for these pointwise differentials.</description>

      <title>Rough differential equations and planarly branched universal limit theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The universal limit theorem is a central result in rough path theory, which has been proved for: (i) rough paths with roughness $\frac{1}{3}&lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{2}$; (ii) geometric rough paths with roughness $0&lt; \alpha \leq 1$; (iii) branched rough paths with roughness $0&lt; \alpha \leq 1$. Planarly branched rough paths are natural generalizations of both rough paths and branched rough paths, in the sense that post-Lie algebras are generalizations of both Lie algebras and pre-Lie algebras. Here the primitive elements of the graded dual Hopf algebra of the Hopf algebra corresponding to the planarly branched rough paths (resp. rough paths, resp. branched rough paths) form a post-Lie (resp. Lie, resp. pre-Lie algebra). In this paper, we prove the universal limit theorem for planarly branched rough paths with roughness $\frac{1}{4}&lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{3}$, via the method of Banach fixed point theorem.</description>

      <title>Eigenfunctions expansion for discrete symplectic systems with general linear dependence on spectral parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenfunctions expansion for discrete symplectic systems on a finite discrete interval is established in the case of a general linear dependence on the spectral parameter as a significant generalization of the Expansion theorem given by Bohner, Do\v{s}l\'{y} and Kratz in [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 361 (2009), 3109--3123]. Subsequently, an integral representation of the Weyl--Titchmarsh $M({\lambda})$-function is derived explicitly by using a suitable spectral function and a possible extension to the half-line case is discussed. The main results are illustrated by several examples.</description>

      <title>Resolvent and spectrum for discrete symplectic systems in the limit point case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectrum of an arbitrary self-adjoint extension of the minimal linear relation associated with the discrete symplectic system in the limit point case is completely characterized by using the limiting Weyl--Titchmarsh $M_+(\lambda)$-function. Furthermore, a dependence of the spectrum on a boundary condition is investigated and, consequently, several results of the singular Sturmian theory are derived.</description>

      <title>Spaces of initial conditions for quartic Hamiltonian systems of Painlev\'e and quasi-Painlev\'e type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometric approach for Painlev\'e and quasi-Painlev\'e differential equations in the complex plane is applied to non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems, quartic in the dependent variables. By computing their defining manifolds (analogue of the Okamoto's space of initial conditions in the quasi-Painlev\'e case), we provide a classification of such systems. We distinguish the various cases by the possible leading-order behaviour at the movable singularities of the solutions, which are algebraic poles or ordinary poles. The principal cases are categorised by the initial base points of the system in the extended phase space $\mathbb{CP}^2$ and their multiplicities, arising from the coalescence of $4$ simple base points in the generic case. Through a successive degeneration (by setting certain coefficient functions in the Hamiltonian to $0$) and further coalescence of base points, all possible sub-cases of quartic Hamiltonian systems with the quasi-Painlev\'e property are obtained, and are characterised by their corresponding Newton polygons. As particular sub-cases we recover certain systems equivalent to known Painlev\'e equations, or variants thereof.</description>

      <title>Orthogonality of quasi-nature spectral polynomials of Jacobi and Laguerre type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the explicit expressions of coefficients involved in quasi Christoffel polynomials of order one and quasi-Geronimus polynomials of order one are determined for Jacobi polynomials. These coefficients are responsible for establishing the orthogonality of quasi-spectral polynomials of Jacobi polynomials. Additionally, the orthogonality of quasi-Christoffel Laguerre polynomials of order one is derived. In the process of achieving orthogonality, in both cases, one zero is located on the boundary of the support of the measure. This allows us to derive the chain sequence and minimal parameter sequence at the point lying at the end point of the support of the measure.
  Furthermore, the interlacing properties among the zeros of quasi-spectral orthogonal Jacobi polynomials and Jacobi polynomials are illustrated. Finally, we define the quasi-Christoffel polynomials of order one on the unit circle and analyze the location of their zeros for specific examples, as well as propose the problem in the general setup.</description>

      <title>Exponential Mixing Via Additive Combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the geodesic flow on a geometrically finite locally symmetric space of negative curvature is exponentially mixing with respect to the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure. The approach is based on constructing a suitable anisotropic Banach space on which the infinitesimal generator of the flow admits an essential spectral gap. A key step in the proof involves estimating certain oscillatory integrals against the Patterson-Sullivan measure. For this purpose, we prove a general result of independent interest asserting that the Fourier transform of measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ that do not concentrate near proper affine hyperplanes enjoy polynomial decay outside of a sparse set of frequencies. As an intermediate step, we show that the $L^q$-dimension ($1&lt;q\leq \infty$) of iterated self-convolutions of such measures tend towards that of the ambient space. Our analysis also yields that the Laplace transform of the correlation function of smooth observables extends meromorphically to the entire complex plane in the convex cocompact case and to a strip of explicit size beyond the imaginary axis in the case the manifold admits cusps.</description>

Abstract: On page 206 in his lost notebook, Ramanujan recorded an incomplete septic theta function identity. Motivated by the completion of this identity by the second author, we offer cubic and quintic analogues. Using the theory generated by these two analogues and Ramanujan's class invariants, we provide many evaluations for Ramanujan's most prominent theta function, $\varphi(q)$ in his notation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct two families of orthogonal polynomials associated with the universal central extensions of the superelliptic Lie algebras. These polynomials satisfy certain fourth order linear differential equations, and one of the families is a particular collection of associated ultraspherical polynomials. We show that the generating functions of the polynomials satisfy fourth order linear PDEs. Since these generating function can be represented by superelliptic integrals, we have examples of linear PDEs of fourth order with explicit solutions without complete integrability.</description>

Abstract: We show how the flow approach of Duch, with elementary differentials as coordinates, can be used to prove well-posedness for rough stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $H &gt; \frac{1}{4}$. A novelty appearing here is that we use coordinates for the flow that are indexed by trees rather than multi-indices.</description>
