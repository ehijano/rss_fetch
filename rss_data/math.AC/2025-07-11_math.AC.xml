      <title>Bounds for the change of the Weyr characteristic of matrix pencils after 1-rank perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complete characterization of the Kronecker structure of a matrix pencil perturbed by another pencil of rank one is known, and it is stated in terms of very involved conditions. This paper is devoted to, loosing accuracy, better understand the meaning of those conditions. The Kronecker structure of a pencil is determined by the sequences of the column and row minimal indices and of the partial multiplicities of the eigenvalues. We introduce the Weyr characteristic of a matrix pencil as the collection of the conjugate partitions of the previous sequences and provide bounds for the change of each one of the Weyr partitions when the pencil is perturbed by a pencil of rank one. For each one of the Weyr components, the resulting bounds are expressed only in terms of the corresponding component of the unperturbed pencil. In order to verify that the bounds are reachable, we also characterize the partitions of the Weyr characteristic of a pencil obtained from another one by removing or adding one row. The results hold for algebraically closed fields</description>

      <title>Linearizing Algebraic Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although algebraic matroids were discovered in the 1930s, interest in them was largely dormant until their recent use in applications of algebraic geometry. Because nonlinear algebra is computationally challenging, it is easier to work with an isomorphic linear matroid if one exists. We describe an explicit construction that produces a linear representation over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero starting with the data used in applications. We will also discuss classical examples of algebraic matroids in the modern language of polynomial ideals, illustrating how the existence of an isomorphic linear matroid depends on properties of the field.</description>

      <title>Betti numbers of fold products of linear forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ideals generated by fold products of linear forms are generalizations of powers of defining ideals of star configurations, or of Veronese type ideals, and in this paper we study their Betti numbers. In earlier work, the authors together with Yu Xie showed that these ideals have linear graded free resolution, and in this paper we take the study of the homological information about these ideals to the next natural level.</description>

      <title>The integro-differential closure of a commutative differential ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An integro-differential ring is a differential ring that is closed under an integration operation satisfying the fundamental theorem of calculus. Via the Newton--Leibniz formula, a generalized evaluation is defined in terms of integration and differentiation. The induced evaluation is not necessarily multiplicative, which allows to model functions with singularities and leads to generalized shuffle relations. In general, not every element of a differential ring has an antiderivative in the same ring. Starting from a commutative differential ring and a direct decomposition into integrable and non-integrable elements, we construct the free integro-differential ring. This integro-differential closure contains all nested integrals over elements of the original differential ring. We exhibit the relations satisfied by generalized evaluations of products of nested integrals. Investigating these relations of constants, we characterize in terms of Lyndon words certain evaluations of products that determine all others. We also analyze the relation of the free integro-differential ring with the shuffle algebra. To preserve integrals in the original differential ring for computations in its integro-differential closure, we introduce the notion of quasi-integro-differential rings and give an adapted construction of the free integro-differential ring. Finally, in a given integro-differential ring, we consider the internal integro-differential closure of a differential subring and identify it as quotient of the free integro-differential ring by certain constants.</description>

      <title>Matrix invertible extensions over commutative rings. Part II: determinant liftability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A unimodular $2\times 2$ matrix $A$ with entries in a commutative ring $R$ is called weakly determinant liftable if there exists a matrix $B$ congruent to $A$ modulo $R\det(A)$ and $\det(B)=0$; if we can choose $B$ to be unimodular, then $A$ is called determinant liftable. If $A$ is extendable to an invertible $3\times 3$ matrix $A^+$, then $A$ is weakly determinant liftable. If $A$ is simple extendable (i.e., we can choose $A^+$ such that its $(3,3)$ entry is $0$), then $A$ is determinant liftable. We present necessary and/or sufficient criteria for $A$ to be (weakly) determinant liftable and we use them to show that if $R$ is a $\Pi_2$ ring in the sense of Part I (resp.\ is a pre-Schreier domain), then $A$ is simply extendable (resp.\ extendable) iff it is determinant liftable (resp.\ weakly determinant liftable). As an application we show that each $J_{2,1}$ domain (as defined by Lorenzini) is an elementary divisor domain.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic Samuel functions and applications to resolution of singularities techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the asymptotic Samuel function to define the Samuel slope of a Noetherian local ring, and we prove that it characterizes regularity in the case of local excellent rings. In addition, we introduce a second invariant that refines the Samuel slope using generic linear cuts, the refined Samuel slope.
  We show that both, the Samuel slope and the refined Samuel slope, are connected to invariants coming from resolution of singularities.</description>

      <title>The Newton-Puiseux algorithm and effective algebraic series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00875v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explain how to encode an algebraic series by a finite amount of data, namely its minimal polynomial, a total order and its first terms with respect to this order, and how to do effective arithmetic on the level of these encodings. The reasoning is based on the Newton-Puiseux algorithm and an effective equality test for algebraic series. We also explain how to derive information about the support of an algebraic series, that is, the vertices and bounded faces of the convex hull of its support. Furthermore, we show how to identify the polynomial and rational solutions of a polynomial equation.</description>
