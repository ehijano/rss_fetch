      <title>Aerial Relay to Achieve Covertness and Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a delay-tolerant unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relayed covert and secure communication framework is investigated. In this framework, a legitimate UAV serves as an aerial relay to realize communication when the direct link between the terrestrial transmitter and receiver is blocked and also acts as a friendly jammer to suppress the malicious nodes presented on the ground. Subsequently, considering the uncertainty of malicious nodes' positions, a robust fractional programming optimization problem is built to maximize energy efficiency by jointly optimizing the trajectory of the UAV, the transmit power of the transmitter, and the time-switching factor. For the extremely complicated covert constraint, Pinsker's inequality, Jensen's inequality, and the bisection search method are employed to construct a tractable shrunken one. After this, an alternate optimization-based algorithm is proposed to solve the fractional programming optimization problem. To achieve low complexity, we design the primal-dual search-based algorithm and the successive convex approximation-based algorithm, respectively, for each sub-problem. Numerical results show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Utility Tradeoff Based on $\alpha$-lift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information density and its exponential form, known as lift, play a central role in information privacy leakage measures. $\alpha$-lift is the power-mean of lift, which is tunable between the worst-case measure max-lift ($\alpha=\infty$) and more relaxed versions ($\alpha&lt;\infty$). This paper investigates the optimization problem of the privacy-utility tradeoff where $\alpha$-lift and mutual information are privacy and utility measures, respectively. Due to the nonlinear nature of $\alpha$-lift for $\alpha&lt;\infty$, finding the optimal solution is challenging. Therefore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to estimate the optimal utility for each value of $\alpha$, inspired by the optimal solution for $\alpha=\infty$. In proposing the algorithm, we prove and use the convexity of $\alpha$-lift with respect to the lift.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Placement on Transmission in Distributed Computing of Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a distributed setting, where a user seeks to compute a linearly-separable Boolean function of degree $M$ from $N$ servers, each with a cache size $M$. Exploiting the fundamental concepts of sensitivity and influences of Boolean functions, we devise a novel approach to capture the interplay between dataset placement across servers and server transmissions and to determine the optimal solution for dataset placement that minimizes the communication cost. In particular, we showcase the achievability of the minimum average joint sensitivity, $\frac{N}{2^{M-1}}$, as a measure for the communication cost.</description>

      <title>Linear Codes from Projective Linear Anticodes Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An anticode ${\bf C} \subset {\bf F}_q^n$ with the diameter $\delta$ is a code in ${\bf F}_q^n$ such that the distance between any two distinct codewords in ${\bf C}$ is at most $\delta$. The famous Erd\"{o}s-Kleitman bound for a binary anticode ${\bf C}$ of the length $n$ and the diameter $\delta$ asserts that $$|{\bf C}| \leq \Sigma_{i=0}^{\frac{\delta}{2}} \displaystyle{n \choose i}.$$ In this paper, we give an antiGriesmer bound for $q$-ary projective linear anticodes, which is stronger than the above Erd\"{o}s-Kleitman bound for binary anticodes. The antiGriesmer bound is a lower bound on diameters of projective linear anticodes. From some known projective linear anticodes, we construct some linear codes with optimal or near optimal minimum distances. A complementary theorem constructing infinitely many new projective linear $(t+1)$-weight code from a known $t$-weight linear code is presented. Then many new optimal or almost optimal few-weight linear codes are given and their weight distributions are determined. As a by-product, we also construct several infinite families of three-weight binary linear codes, which lead to $l$-strongly regular graphs for each odd integer $l \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Smart Wireless Environment Enhanced Telecommunications: A Network Stabilisation Paradigm for Mobile Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the uncontrolled and complex real-life radio propagation environments, Claude Shannon's information theory of communications describes fundamental limits to state-of-the-art 5G radio access network (RAN) capacity, with respect to fixed radio resource usage. Fortunately, recent research has found that a holographic metasurface-based new physical layer architecture may hold the key to overcome these fundamental limits of current mobile networks under a new paradigm, smart wireless environment (SWE), where the long-standing challenge of mobile communications, fading channel hostility, may be solved, leading to a step-change boost in network performance and user experience. Despite recent research activities in SWE, the best way to implement it as a network operator remains an open challenge. In this industrial review, we adopt a novel yet realistic mobile channel stabilisation perspective for network operators to understand this paradigm shift. More specifically, we provide a technical analysis of the synergy between key next-gen mobile network enablers, e.g., holographic metasurface, wireless sensing, and machine intelligence, as well as of how this synergy leads to a robust future RAN architecture. Against the as yet unclear theoretical boundaries and low technology readiness level (TRL) of SWE enhanced telecommunications, we conclude by identifying critical challenges in future commercial deployments.</description>

      <title>Integrated Near Field Sensing and Communications Using Unitary Approximate Message Passing Based Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the utilization of large antenna arrays at base stations (BSs) and the operations of wireless communications in high frequency bands, mobile terminals often find themselves in the near-field of the array aperture. In this work, we address the signal processing challenges of integrated near-field localization and communication in uplink transmission of an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where the BS performs joint near-field localization and signal detection (JNFLSD). We show that JNFLSD can be formulated as a matrix factorization (MF) problem with proper structures imposed on the factor matrices. Then, leveraging the variational inference (VI) and unitary approximate message passing (UAMP), we develop a low complexity Bayesian approach to MF, called UAMP-MF, to handle a generic MF problem. We then apply the UAMP-MF algorithm to solve the JNFLSD problem, where the factor matrix structures are fully exploited. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Analysis of Homogeneous Wireless Networks Assisted by Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the impact of the existence of multiple IRSs in a homogeneous wireless network, in which all BSs, users (U), and IRSs are spatially distributed by an independent homogeneous PPP, with density $\lambda_{{\rm BS}}\rm{[BS/m^2]}$, $\lambda_{{\rm U}}\rm{[U/m^2]}$, and $\lambda_{{\rm IRS}}\rm{[IRS/m^2]}$, respectively. We utilize a uniformly random serving strategy for BS and IRS to create stochastic symmetry in the network. We analyze the performance of the network and study the effect of the existence of the IRS on the network performance. To this end, for a typical user in the system, we derive analytical upper and lower bounds on the expectation of the power (second statistical moment) of the desired signal and the interference caused by BSs and other users. After that, we obtain analytical upper bounds on the decay of the probability of the power of the desired signal and the interference for the typical user (which results in a lower bound for the cumulative distribution function (CDF)). Moreover, we derive upper bounds on the decay of the probability of the capacity of one typical user, which results in a lower bound for the outage probability. In the numerical results, we observe that the numerical calculation of the power of the desired signal and the interference is near the derived lower bounds and we show that the increment of the parameter ${(\lambda_{\rm IRS})}$ causes increment in powers of both the desired and interference signals. We also observe that the increment of the parameter ${\lambda_{\rm IRS}}$ causes the decrement of outage probability.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Channel Prediction for RIS-assisted MIMO Systems With Channel Aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a promising technology to enhance the performance of sixth-generation (6G) and beyond communication systems. The passive nature of RISs and their large number of reflecting elements pose challenges to the channel estimation process. The associated complexity further escalates when the channel coefficients are fast-varying as in scenarios with user mobility. In this paper, we propose an extended channel estimation framework for RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) integrated with an autoregressive (AR) predictor. The implemented framework is designed for identifying the aging pattern and predicting enhanced estimates of the wireless channels in correlated fast-fading environments. Insightful simulation results demonstrate that our proposed CNN-AR approach is robust to channel aging, exhibiting a high-precision estimation accuracy. The results also show that our approach can achieve high spectral efficiency and low pilot overhead compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Robust Image Semantic Coding with Learnable CSI Fusion Masking over MIMO Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though achieving marvelous progress in various scenarios, existing semantic communication frameworks mainly consider single-input single-output Gaussian channels or Rayleigh fading channels, neglecting the widely-used multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, which hinders the application into practical systems. One common solution to combat MIMO fading is to utilize feedback MIMO channel state information (CSI). In this paper, we incorporate MIMO CSI into system designs from a new perspective and propose the learnable CSI fusion semantic communication (LCFSC) framework, where CSI is treated as side information by the semantic extractor to enhance the semantic coding. To avoid feature fusion due to abrupt combination of CSI with features, we present a non-invasive CSI fusion multi-head attention module inside the Swin Transformer. With the learned attention masking map determined by both source and channel states, more robust attention distribution could be generated. Furthermore, the percentage of mask elements could be flexibly adjusted by the learnable mask ratio, which is produced based on the conditional variational interference in an unsupervised manner. In this way, CSI-aware semantic coding is achieved through learnable CSI fusion masking. Experiment results testify the superiority of LCFSC over traditional schemes and state-of-the-art Swin Transformer-based semantic communication frameworks in MIMO fading channels.</description>

      <title>On functions of low differential uniformity in characteristic 2: A close look (I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new concept, the APN-defect, which can be thought of as measuring the distance of a given function $G:\mathbb{F}_{2^n} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ to the set of almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions. This concept is motivated by the detailed analysis of the differential behaviour of non-APN functions (of low differential uniformity) $G$ using the so-called difference squares. We describe the relations between the APN-defect and other recent concepts of similar nature. Upper and lower bounds for the values of APN-defect for several classes of functions of interest, including Dembowski-Ostrom polynomials are given. Its exact values in some cases are also calculated. The difference square corresponding to a modification of the inverse function is determined, its APN-defect depending on $n$ is evaluated and the implications are discussed.
  In the forthcoming second part of this work we further examine modifications of the inverse function. We also study modifications of classes of functions of low uniformity over infinitely many extensions of $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$. We present quantitative results on their differential behaviour, especially in connection with their APN-defects.</description>

      <title>Transfer Entropy in Graph Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) are Graph Neural Networks where the convolutions are applied over a graph. In contrast to Convolutional Neural Networks, GCN's are designed to perform inference on graphs, where the number of nodes can vary, and the nodes are unordered. In this study, we address two important challenges related to GCNs: i) oversmoothing; and ii) the utilization of node relational properties (i.e., heterophily and homophily). Oversmoothing is the degradation of the discriminative capacity of nodes as a result of repeated aggregations. Heterophily is the tendency for nodes of different classes to connect, whereas homophily is the tendency of similar nodes to connect. We propose a new strategy for addressing these challenges in GCNs based on Transfer Entropy (TE), which measures of the amount of directed transfer of information between two time varying nodes. Our findings indicate that using node heterophily and degree information as a node selection mechanism, along with feature-based TE calculations, enhances accuracy across various GCN models. Our model can be easily modified to improve classification accuracy of a GCN model. As a trade off, this performance boost comes with a significant computational overhead when the TE is computed for many graph nodes.</description>

      <title>Transformers Provably Learn Sparse Token Selection While Fully-Connected Nets Cannot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transformer architecture has prevailed in various deep learning settings due to its exceptional capabilities to select and compose structural information. Motivated by these capabilities, Sanford et al. proposed the sparse token selection task, in which transformers excel while fully-connected networks (FCNs) fail in the worst case. Building upon that, we strengthen the FCN lower bound to an average-case setting and establish an algorithmic separation of transformers over FCNs. Specifically, a one-layer transformer trained with gradient descent provably learns the sparse token selection task and, surprisingly, exhibits strong out-of-distribution length generalization. We provide empirical simulations to justify our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>The geometry of efficient codes: how rate-distortion trade-offs distort the latent representations of generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living organisms rely on internal models of the world to act adaptively. These models cannot encode every detail and hence need to compress information. From a cognitive standpoint, information compression can manifest as a distortion of latent representations, resulting in the emergence of representations that may not accurately reflect the external world or its geometry. Rate-distortion theory formalizes the optimal way to compress information, by considering factors such as capacity limitations, the frequency and the utility of stimuli. However, while this theory explains why the above factors distort latent representations, it does not specify which specific distortions they produce. To address this question, here we systematically explore the geometry of the latent representations that emerge in generative models that operate under the principles of rate-distortion theory ($\beta$-VAEs). Our results highlight that three main classes of distortions of internal representations -- prototypization, specialization, orthogonalization -- emerge as signatures of information compression, under constraints on capacity, data distributions and tasks. These distortions can coexist, giving rise to a rich landscape of latent spaces, whose geometry could differ significantly across generative models subject to different constraints. Our findings contribute to explain how the normative constraints of rate-distortion theory distort the geometry of latent representations of generative models of artificial systems and living organisms.</description>

      <title>DiffCom: Channel Received Signal is a Natural Condition to Guide Diffusion Posterior Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end visual communication systems typically optimize a trade-off between channel bandwidth costs and signal-level distortion metrics. However, under challenging physical conditions, this traditional discriminative communication paradigm often results in unrealistic reconstructions with perceptible blurring and aliasing artifacts, despite the inclusion of perceptual or adversarial losses for optimizing. This issue primarily stems from the receiver's limited knowledge about the underlying data manifold and the use of deterministic decoding mechanisms. To address these limitations, this paper introduces DiffCom, a novel end-to-end generative communication paradigm that utilizes off-the-shelf generative priors and probabilistic diffusion models for decoding, thereby improving perceptual quality without heavily relying on bandwidth costs and received signal quality. Unlike traditional systems that rely on deterministic decoders optimized solely for distortion metrics, our DiffCom leverages raw channel-received signal as a fine-grained condition to guide stochastic posterior sampling. Our approach ensures that reconstructions remain on the manifold of real data with a novel confirming constraint, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the generated outcomes. Furthermore, DiffCom incorporates a blind posterior sampling technique to address scenarios with unknown forward transmission characteristics. Extensive experimental validations demonstrate that DiffCom not only produces realistic reconstructions with details faithful to the original data but also achieves superior robustness against diverse wireless transmission degradations. Collectively, these advancements establish DiffCom as a new benchmark in designing generative communication systems that offer enhanced robustness and generalization superiorities.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Ill-conditioned Hankel Matrix Recovery via Structured Newton-like Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the robust Hankel recovery problem, which simultaneously removes the sparse outliers and fulfills missing entries from the partial observation. We propose a novel non-convex algorithm, coined Hankel Structured Newton-Like Descent (HSNLD), to tackle the robust Hankel recovery problem. HSNLD is highly efficient with linear convergence, and its convergence rate is independent of the condition number of the underlying Hankel matrix. The recovery guarantee has been established under some mild conditions. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show the superior performance of HSNLD against state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Image and Video Tokenization with Binary Spherical Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new transformer-based image and video tokenizer with Binary Spherical Quantization (BSQ). BSQ projects the high-dimensional visual embedding to a lower-dimensional hypersphere and then applies binary quantization. BSQ is (1) parameter-efficient without an explicit codebook, (2) scalable to arbitrary token dimensions, and (3) compact: compressing visual data by up to 100$\times$ with minimal distortion. Our tokenizer uses a transformer encoder and decoder with simple block-wise causal masking to support variable-length videos as input. The resulting BSQ-ViT achieves state-of-the-art visual reconstruction quality on image and video reconstruction benchmarks with 2.4$\times$ throughput compared to the best prior methods. Furthermore, by learning an autoregressive prior for adaptive arithmetic coding, BSQ-ViT achieves comparable results on video compression with state-of-the-art video compression standards. BSQ-ViT also enables masked language models to achieve competitive image synthesis quality to GAN- and diffusion-based methods.</description>

      <title>Grant Free MIMO-NOMA with Differential Modulation for Machine Type Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.07097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a challenging scenario of machine type communications, where we assume internet of things (IoT) devices send short packets sporadically to an access point (AP) and the devices are not synchronized in the packet level. High transmission efficiency and low latency are concerned. Motivated by the great potential of multiple-input multiple-output non-orthogonal multiple access (MIMO-NOMA) in massive access, we design a grant-free MIMO-NOMA scheme, and in particular differential modulation is used so that expensive channel estimation at the receiver (AP) can be bypassed. The receiver at AP needs to carry out active device detection and multi-device data detection. The active user detection is formulated as the estimation of the common support of sparse signals, and a message passing based sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm is designed to solve the problem. Due to the use of differential modulation, we investigate the problem of non-coherent multi-device data detection, and develop a message passing based Bayesian data detector, where the constraint of differential modulation is exploited to drastically improve the detection performance, compared to the conventional non-coherent detection scheme. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed active device detector and non-coherent multi-device data detector.</description>

      <title>Limiting Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An aperiodic binary sequence of length $\ell$ is a doubly infinite sequence $f=\ldots,f_{-1},f_0,f_1,\ldots$ with $f_j \in \{-1,1\}$ when $0 \leq j &lt; \ell$ and and $f_j=0$ otherwise. Various problems in engineering and natural science demand binary sequences that do not resemble translates of themselves. The autocorrelation of $f$ at shift $s$ is the dot product of $f$ with the sequence obtained by translating $f$ by $s$ places. The demerit factor of $f$ is the sum of the squares of the autocorrelations at all nonzero shifts for the sequence obtained by normalizing $f$ to unit Euclidean norm. Low demerit factor therefore indicates low self-similarity under translation. We endow the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ with uniform probability measure and consider the distribution of their demerit factors. Earlier works used combinatorial techniques to find exact formulas for the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution as a function of $\ell$. These revealed that for $\ell \geq 4$, the $p$th central moment of this distribution is strictly positive for every $p \geq 2$. This article shows that every $p$th central moment is a quasi-polynomial function of $\ell$ with rational coefficients divided by $\ell^{2 p}$. It also shows that, in the limit as $\ell$ tends to infinity, the $p$th standardized moment is the same as that of the standard normal distribution.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of an IRS on the Out-of-Band Performance in Sub-6 GHz &amp; mmWave Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) were introduced to enhance the performance of wireless communication systems. However, from a service provider's viewpoint, a concern with the use of an IRS is its effect on out-of-band (OOB) quality of service. Specifically, if two operators, say X and Y, provide services in a given geographical area using non-overlapping frequency bands, and if operator X uses an IRS to enhance the spectral efficiency (SE) of its users (UEs), does it degrade the performance of UEs served by operator Y? We answer this by analyzing the average and instantaneous performances of the OOB operator considering both sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands. Specifically, we derive the ergodic sum SE achieved by the operators under round-robin scheduling. We also derive the outage probability and analyze the change in the SNR caused by the IRS at an OOB UE using stochastic dominance theory. Surprisingly, even though the IRS is randomly configured from operator Y's point of view, the OOB operator still benefits from the presence of the IRS, witnessing a performance enhancement for free in both sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands. This is because the IRS introduces additional paths between the transmitter and receiver, increasing the overall signal power arriving at the UE and providing diversity benefits. Finally, we show that the use of opportunistic scheduling schemes can further enhance the benefit of the uncontrolled IRS at OOB UEs. We numerically illustrate our findings and conclude that an IRS is always beneficial to every operator, even when the IRS is deployed &amp; controlled by only one operator.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models for Accurate Channel Distribution Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10505v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong generative models can accurately learn channel distributions. This could save recurring costs for physical measurements of the channel. Moreover, the resulting differentiable channel model supports training neural encoders by enabling gradient-based optimization. The initial approach in the literature draws upon the modern advancements in image generation, utilizing generative adversarial networks (GANs) or their enhanced variants to generate channel distributions. In this paper, we address this channel approximation challenge with diffusion models (DMs), which have demonstrated high sample quality and mode coverage in image generation. In addition to testing the generative performance of the channel distributions, we use an end-to-end (E2E) coded-modulation framework underpinned by DMs and propose an efficient training algorithm. Our simulations with various channel models show that a DM can accurately learn channel distributions, enabling an E2E framework to achieve near-optimal symbol error rates (SERs). Furthermore, we examine the trade-off between mode coverage and sampling speed through skipped sampling using sliced Wasserstein distance (SWD) and the E2E SER. We investigate the effect of noise scheduling on this trade-off, demonstrating that with an appropriate choice of parameters and techniques, sampling time can be significantly reduced with a minor increase in SWD and SER. Finally, we show that the DM can generate a correlated fading channel, whereas a strong GAN variant fails to learn the covariance. This paper highlights the potential benefits of using DMs for learning channel distributions, which could be further investigated for various channels and advanced techniques of DMs.</description>

      <title>AFDM-SCMA: A Promising Waveform for Massive Connectivity over High Mobility Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM)-empowered sparse code multiple access (SCMA) system, referred to as AFDM-SCMA, for supporting massive connectivity in high-mobility environments. First, by placing the sparse codewords on the AFDM chirp subcarriers, the input-output (I/O) relation of AFDM-SCMA systems is presented. Next, we delve into the generalized receiver design, chirp rate selection, and error rate performance of the proposed AFDM-SCMA. The proposed AFDM-SCMA is shown to provide a general framework and subsume the existing OFDM-SCMA as a special case. Third, for efficient transceiver design, we further propose a class of sparse codebooks for simplifying the I/O relation, referred to as I/O relation-inspired codebook design in this paper. Building upon these codebooks, we propose a novel iterative detection and decoding scheme with linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator for both downlink and uplink channels based on orthogonal approximate message passing principles. Our numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AFDM-SCMA systems over OFDM-SCMA systems in terms of the error rate performance. We show that the proposed receiver can significantly enhance the error rate performance while reducing the detection complexity.</description>

      <title>Contraction of Markovian Operators in Orlicz Spaces and Error Bounds for Markov Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel concept of convergence for Markovian processes within Orlicz spaces, extending beyond the conventional approach associated with $L_p$ spaces. After showing that Markovian operators are contractive in Orlicz spaces, our key technical contribution is an upper bound on their contraction coefficient, which admits a closed-form expression. The bound is tight in some settings, and it recovers well-known results, such as the connection between contraction and ergodicity, ultra-mixing and Doeblin's minorisation. Specialising our approach to $L_p$ spaces leads to a significant improvement upon classical Riesz-Thorin's interpolation methods. Furthermore, by exploiting the flexibility offered by Orlicz spaces, we can tackle settings where the stationary distribution is heavy-tailed, a severely under-studied setup. As an application of the framework put forward in the paper, we introduce tighter bounds on the mixing time of Markovian processes, better exponential concentration bounds for MCMC methods, and better lower bounds on the burn-in period. To conclude, we show how our results can be used to prove the concentration of measure phenomenon for a sequence of Markovian random variables.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks intending to effectively balance sensing and communication (S&amp;C) performance at the network level. Through the simultaneous utilization of multi-point (CoMP) coordinated joint transmission and distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar techniques, we propose a cooperative networked ISAC scheme to enhance both S&amp;C services. Then, the tool of stochastic geometry is exploited to capture the S&amp;C performance, which allows us to illuminate key cooperative dependencies in the ISAC network. Remarkably, the derived expression of the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the localization accuracy unveils a significant finding: Deploying $N$ ISAC transceivers yields an enhanced sensing performance across the entire network, in accordance with the $\ln^2N$ scaling law. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to the time-sharing scheme, the proposed cooperative ISAC scheme can effectively improve the average data rate and reduce the CRLB.</description>

      <title>Cooperative ISAC Networks: Performance Analysis, Scaling Laws and Optimization</title>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks are investigated with the objective of effectively balancing the sensing and communication (S&amp;C) performance at the network level. Through the simultaneous utilization of multi-point (CoMP) coordinated joint transmission and distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar techniques, we propose an innovative networked ISAC scheme, where multiple transceivers are employed for collaboratively enhancing the S&amp;C services. Then, the potent tool of stochastic geometry is exploited for characterizing the S&amp;C performance, which allows us to illuminate the key cooperative dependencies in the ISAC network and optimize salient network-level parameters. Remarkably, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) expression of the localization accuracy derived unveils a significant finding: Deploying N ISAC transceivers yields an enhanced average cooperative sensing performance across the entire network, in accordance with the ln^2N scaling law. Crucially, this scaling law is less pronounced in comparison to the performance enhancement of N^2 achieved when the transceivers are equidistant from the target, which is primarily due to the substantial path loss from the distant base stations (BSs) and leads to reduced contributions to sensing performance gain. Moreover, we derive a tight expression of the communication rate, and present a low-complexity algorithm to determine the optimal cooperative cluster size. Based on our expression derived for the S&amp;C performance, we formulate the optimization problem of maximizing the network performance in terms of two joint S&amp;C metrics. To this end, we jointly optimize the cooperative BS cluster sizes and the transmit power to strike a flexible tradeoff between the S&amp;C performance.</description>

      <title>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) for the oil and gas industry: a review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00594v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is set to profoundly impact the oil and gas industry by introducing unprecedented efficiencies and innovations. This paper explores AGI's foundational principles and its transformative applications, particularly focusing on the advancements brought about by large language models (LLMs) and extensive computer vision systems in the upstream sectors of the industry. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has already begun reshaping the oil and gas landscape, offering enhancements in production optimization, downtime reduction, safety improvements, and advancements in exploration and drilling techniques. These technologies streamline logistics, minimize maintenance costs, automate monotonous tasks, refine decision-making processes, foster team collaboration, and amplify profitability through error reduction and actionable insights extraction. Despite these advancements, the deployment of AI technologies faces challenges, including the necessity for skilled professionals for implementation and the limitations of model training on constrained datasets, which affects the models' adaptability across different contexts. The advent of generative AI, exemplified by innovations like ChatGPT and the Segment Anything Model (SAM), heralds a new era of high-density innovation. These developments highlight a shift towards natural language interfaces and domain-knowledge-driven AI, promising more accessible and tailored solutions for the oil and gas industry. This review articulates the vast potential AGI holds for tackling complex operational challenges within the upstream oil and gas industry, requiring near-human levels of intelligence. We discussed the promising applications, the hurdles of large-scale AGI model deployment, and the necessity for domain-specific knowledge in maximizing the benefits of these technologies.</description>

      <title>Local Properties of Reed-Solomon Codes and Random Linear Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the list-decodability and list-recoverability of two code ensembles: random linear codes and random Reed-Solomon codes. Inspired by the existing research about local properties of random code ensembles over small alphabets, we develop a new framework to study a similar family of properties over larger alphabets, such as in the case of Reed-Solomon codes. We introduce the notion of local coordinate-wise linear (LCL) properties, which encompasses various natural properties including list-decodability and list-recoverability.
  Our main contributions are threefold: (1) we establish a threshold theorem for LCL properties of random linear codes, identifying a critical rate below which these codes almost surely satisfy a given property and above which they almost surely do not; (2) we use this framework to prove that random linear codes are essentially optimally list-decodable and list-recoverable in the large alphabet regime; and (3) we demonstrate a reduction from random linear codes to random Reed-Solomon codes, showing that Reed-Solomon codes inherit the LCL properties of linear codes with similar rates. We conclude that random Reed-Solomon codes, with alphabet size that may be as small as linear in the code length, are also optimally list-decodable and list-recoverable.
  For list-recovery, our results about both ensembles constitute a significant leap from the best previously known bounds. For list-decodability, we recover recent theorems via a more direct approach, avoiding reliance on complex external results.</description>

Abstract: 6DMA (six-dimensional movable antenna) is a new and revolutionizing technology that fully exploits the wireless channel spatial variation at the transmitter/receiver by flexibly adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations of distributed antennas/antenna surfaces (arrays). In this article, we provide an overview of 6DMA for unveiling its great potential in wireless networks, including its motivation and competitive advantages over existing technologies, system/channel modeling, and practical implementation. In particular, we present a variety of 6DMA-enabled performance enhancement in terms of array gain, spatial multiplexing, interference suppression, and geometric gain. Furthermore, we illustrate the main applications of 6DMA in wireless communication and sensing, and elaborate their design challenges as well as promising solutions. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the significant capacity improvement of 6DMA-aided communication in wireless network.</description>

      <title>Data-dependent Generalization Bounds via Variable-Size Compressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish novel data-dependent upper bounds on the generalization error through the lens of a "variable-size compressibility" framework that we introduce newly here. In this framework, the generalization error of an algorithm is linked to a variable-size 'compression rate' of its input data. This is shown to yield bounds that depend on the empirical measure of the given input data at hand, rather than its unknown distribution. Our new generalization bounds that we establish are tail bounds, tail bounds on the expectation, and in-expectations bounds. Moreover, it is shown that our framework also allows to derive general bounds on any function of the input data and output hypothesis random variables. In particular, these general bounds are shown to subsume and possibly improve over several existing PAC-Bayes and data-dependent intrinsic dimension-based bounds that are recovered as special cases, thus unveiling a unifying character of our approach. For instance, a new data-dependent intrinsic dimension-based bound is established, which connects the generalization error to the optimization trajectories and reveals various interesting connections with the rate-distortion dimension of a process, the R\'enyi information dimension of a process, and the metric mean dimension.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Attributed Graph Alignment with Vanishing Edge Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph alignment refers to the task of finding the vertex correspondence between two correlated graphs of $n$ vertices. Extensive study has been done on polynomial-time algorithms for the graph alignment problem under the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph pair model, where the two graphs are Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs with edge probability $q_\mathrm{u}$, correlated under certain vertex correspondence. To achieve exact recovery of the correspondence, all existing algorithms at least require the edge correlation coefficient $\rho_\mathrm{u}$ between the two graphs to be \emph{non-vanishing} as $n\rightarrow\infty$. Moreover, it is conjectured that no polynomial-time algorithm can achieve exact recovery under vanishing edge correlation $\rho_\mathrm{u}&lt;1/\mathrm{polylog}(n)$. In this paper, we show that with a vanishing amount of additional \emph{attribute information}, exact recovery is polynomial-time feasible under \emph{vanishing} edge correlation $\rho_\mathrm{u} \ge n^{-\Theta(1)}$. We identify a \emph{local} tree structure, which incorporates one layer of user information and one layer of attribute information, and apply the subgraph counting technique to such structures. A polynomial-time algorithm is proposed that recovers the vertex correspondence for most of the vertices, and then refines the output to achieve exact recovery. The consideration of attribute information is motivated by real-world applications like LinkedIn and Twitter, where user attributes like birthplace and education background can aid alignment.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of parameter estimation in a high-dimensional generalized linear model. Spectral methods obtained via the principal eigenvector of a suitable data-dependent matrix provide a simple yet surprisingly effective solution. However, despite their wide use, a rigorous performance characterization, as well as a principled way to preprocess the data, are available only for unstructured (i.i.d.\ Gaussian and Haar orthogonal) designs. In contrast, real-world data matrices are highly structured and exhibit non-trivial correlations. To address the problem, we consider correlated Gaussian designs capturing the anisotropic nature of the features via a covariance matrix $\Sigma$. Our main result is a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of spectral estimators. This allows us to identify the optimal preprocessing that minimizes the number of samples needed for parameter estimation. Surprisingly, such preprocessing is universal across a broad set of statistical models, which partly addresses a conjecture on optimal spectral estimators for rotationally invariant designs. Our principled approach vastly improves upon previous heuristic methods, including for designs common in computational imaging and genetics. The proposed methodology, based on approximate message passing, is broadly applicable and opens the way to the precise characterization of spiked matrices and of the corresponding spectral methods in a variety of settings.</description>

      <title>Robust IRS-Element Activation for Energy Efficiency Optimization in IRS-Assisted Communication Systems With Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided communication system with single-antenna transmitter and receiver, under imperfect channel state information (CSI). More specifically, we deal with the robust selection of binary (on/off) states of the IRS elements in order to maximize the worst-case energy efficiency (EE), given a bounded CSI uncertainty, while satisfying a minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In addition, we consider not only continuous but also discrete IRS phase shifts. First, we derive closed-form expressions of the worst-case SNRs, and then formulate the robust (discrete) optimization problems for each case. In the case of continuous phase shifts, we design a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that is theoretically guaranteed to achieve the global maximum with polynomial complexity $O(L\,{\log L})$, where $L$ is the number of IRS elements. In the case of discrete phase shifts, we develop a convex-relaxation-based method (CRBM) to obtain a feasible (sub-optimal) solution in polynomial time $O(L^{3.5})$, with a posteriori performance guarantee. Furthermore, numerical simulations provide useful insights and confirm the theoretical results. In particular, the proposed algorithms are several orders of magnitude faster than the exhaustive search when $L$ is large, thus being highly scalable and suitable for practical applications. Moreover, both algorithms outperform a baseline scheme, namely, the activation of all IRS elements.</description>

      <title>Community detection in the hypergraph stochastic block model and reconstruction on hypertrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the weak recovery problem on the $r$-uniform hypergraph stochastic block model ($r$-HSBM) with two balanced communities. In this model, $n$ vertices are randomly divided into two communities, and size-$r$ hyperedges are added randomly depending on whether all vertices in the hyperedge are in the same community. The goal of weak recovery is to recover a non-trivial fraction of the communities given the hypergraph. Pal and Zhu (2021); Stephan and Zhu (2022) established that weak recovery is always possible above a natural threshold called the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold. For assortative models (i.e., monochromatic hyperedges are preferred), Gu and Polyanskiy (2023) proved that the KS threshold is tight if $r\le 4$ or the expected degree $d$ is small. For other cases, the tightness of the KS threshold remained open.
  In this paper we determine the tightness of the KS threshold for a wide range of parameters. We prove that for $r\le 6$ and $d$ large enough, the KS threshold is tight. This shows that there is no information-computation gap in this regime and partially confirms a conjecture of Angelini et al. (2015). On the other hand, we show that for $r\ge 5$, there exist parameters for which the KS threshold is not tight. In particular, for $r\ge 7$, the KS threshold is not tight if the model is disassortative (i.e., polychromatic hyperedges are preferred) or $d$ is large enough. This provides more evidence supporting the existence of an information-computation gap in these cases.
  Furthermore, we establish asymptotic bounds on the weak recovery threshold for fixed $r$ and large $d$. We also obtain a number of results regarding the broadcasting on hypertrees (BOHT) model, including the asymptotics of the reconstruction threshold for $r\ge 7$ and impossibility of robust reconstruction at criticality.</description>

      <title>Quantum Wiretap Channel Coding Assisted by Noisy Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the private classical capacity of a quantum wiretap channel, where the users (sender Alice, receiver Bob, and eavesdropper Eve) have access to the resource of a shared quantum state, additionally to their channel inputs and outputs. An extreme case is maximal entanglement or a secret key between Alice and Bob, both of which would allow for onetime padding the message. But here both the wiretap channel and the shared state are general. In the other extreme case that the state is trivial, we recover the wiretap channel and its private capacity [N. Cai, A. Winter and R. W. Yeung, Probl. Inform. Transm. 40(4):318-336, 2004]. We show how to use the given resource state to build a code for secret classical communication. Our main result is a lower bound on the assisted private capacity, which asymptotically meets the multi-letter converse and which encompasses all sorts of previous results as special cases.</description>
