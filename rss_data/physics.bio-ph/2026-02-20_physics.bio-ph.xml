      <title>Tunable asymmetric swimming in biflagellate microswimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biological microswimmers can modulate their swimming gait to achieve directional control of motility, especially when performing steering towards specific directional cues. This can be achieved without the need for obvious morphological or structural asymmetries in the form of the organism, or in the number or organisation of propulsion-generating appendages such as cilia. In this work, we identify and validate a core principle of asymmetric turning in biflagellate microswimmers: propulsive forces interact constructively to drive translation whilst interacting destructively to drive rotation. We explore the ramifications of this tunable biflagellar swimming mechanism across a range of systems, from a simple, back-of-the-envelope model to a detailed computational representation of an exemplar swimmer. This leads to a markedly general quantitative relation between key drivers of asymmetry, such as ciliary beat frequency, and the curvature of emergent trajectories. We discuss how the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which actuates its two cilia in a symmetric breaststroke for forward swimming, may exploit this feature for phototaxis. Finally, we validate our predictions in a Chlamydomonas-inspired robophysical model, implementing closed-loop control to achieve phototactic turning.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Effects of Incident Angle and Lateral Conduction in Electromagnetic Skin Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previously we derived the leading term asymptotic solution of temperature distribution in skin heating by an electromagnetic beam at an arbitrary incident angle. The asymptotic analysis is based on that the penetration depth of the beam into skin is much smaller than the size of beam cross-section. It allows arbitrary incident angle. We expand the temperature in powers of the small depth to lateral scale ratio. The incident angle affects all terms in the expansion while the lateral heat conduction appears only in terms of positive even powers. The previously obtained leading term solution captures only the main effect of incident angle. The main effect of lateral heat conduction is contained in the second order term, which is mathematically negligible in the limit of small depth to lateral scale ratio. At a moderate length scale ratio (e.g., 0.1), however, the contribution from lateral conduction is quite significant and needs to be included in a meaningful approximate solution. In this study, we derive closed form analytical expressions for the first order and the second order terms in the asymptotic expansion. The resulting asymptotic solution is capable of predicting the temperature distribution accurately including the effects of both incident angle and lateral heat conduction even at a moderate length scale ratio.</description>

      <title>How Molecular Motors' Interaction Shapes Flagellar Beat and Its Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of flagellar beating for micro-swimmers, such as flagellated cells, sperms and microalgae, is dominated by a feedback mechanism between flagellar shape and the rate of activation/de-activation of the $N \gg 1$ driving molecular motors. In the context of the so-called rigid filament models, where the axoneme is described by a single degree of freedom $X(t)$, we investigate the effect of direct coupling between the activity dynamics of adjacent motors, parametrized by $K \ge 0$. A functional Fokker-Planck equation for $X$ and the state of the $N$ motors is obtained. In the limit of small coupling $K \ll 1$, we derive a system of equations governing the dynamics of the Fourier modes of the active motor density, obtaining estimates for several observables and the fluctuations' quality factor $Q$. For larger $K$ we resort to numerical simulations. The effect of introducing the coupling $K&gt;0$ is to increase characteristic times and the beating period. Moreover at large $K$s the limit cycle becomes bi-stable, with abrupt avalanches of the motor dynamics. Increasing $K$ is similar to what observed in the case $K=0$ when the confining elastic force is strongly reduced. The quality factor of fluctuations has a non-monotonic behavior: it first increases with $K$, then decreases. This is accompanied by the reduction and eventual disappearance of regions where the fraction of activated motor is nor $0$ neither $1$.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal air flow properties in a 3D personalised model of the human lung</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-scale lung model to investigate spatio-temporal distributions of ventilation variables. Lung envelope and large airway geometries are derived from CT scans; smaller airways are generated using a physiologically consistent algorithm. Tissue mechanics is modeled using nonlinear elasticity under small deformations, coupled with local air pressure from fluid dynamics within the bronchial tree. Airflow accounts for inertia and static airway compliance. Simulations employ finite elements. Using this model, we explore spatio-temporal airflows and shear stresses distributions.</description>

      <title>Tracking phase synchronization between flagella in the time-frequency domain resolves photophobic response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unicellular microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CR) is well known for its bi-flagellated swimming in response to light stimuli. This work aims to study the resynchronization of CR flagella after a high light intensity stimulus, known as photoshock. The synchronization is estimated thanks to a quantity defined as the Phase Synchronization Index (PSI). The originality of this approach is to perform a time-frequency computation of a complex PSI based on continuous wavelet transform. Thanks to this analysis, we distinguish three swimming stages involving different frequency bands and phase shifts: synchronized breaststroke swimming, undulatory backward swimming, and resynchronization. This approach also reveals the presence of signal harmonics that set the photoshock response, independently of cell variability. Our results suggest that CR modulates the balance between spectral beating modes, providing a mechanism for robust adaptation to sudden environmental stresses.</description>

      <title>Self-Assembled hBN Wrinkles as Planar Optofluidic Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optically accessible, scalable planar nanofluidic channels are attractive for studying transport and localization under confinement. Two dimensional (2D) materials provide large area, atomically flat interfaces for generating such platforms, yet achieving long range one-dimensional (1D) confinement with top-down nanofabrication remains challenging because it requires reproducible nanoscale feature control over extended distances, high yield, and low nonspecific adsorption of analytes under aqueous conditions. Here we demonstrate that thermally induced wrinkling of exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) produces self-assembled, liquid-accessible, channel-like networks through a lithography-free process. By varying flake thickness and substrate choice, we quantify statistical trends in wrinkle density and morphology, thereby establishing a practical fabrication design space. Atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy reveal wrinkle-derived geometries with vertical confinement ranging from &lt;2 nm to &gt;100 nm depending on flake thickness and substrate. We further employ time-sequence optical imaging upon droplet-contact, which together with Raman mapping of the water OH-stretch band and capacitance-gradient mapping (dC/dz) by scanning dielectric microscopy (KPFM-based) measurements, demonstrates liquid infiltration and long-term liquid retention within the wrinkle network for more than 10 h. We finally show a proof-of-concept biomolecule confinement application in which we integrate a graphene overlayer as a background suppression interface, enabling wide-field fluorescence localization of ATTO647N labeled DNA along hBN wrinkle-induced nanochannels. Overall, this work establishes self-assembled hBN wrinkles as a scalable, and optically addressable planar nanofluidic platform for confinement of fluids and biomolecules.</description>
