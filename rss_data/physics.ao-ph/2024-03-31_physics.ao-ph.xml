      <title>Available potential vorticity and the wave-vortex decomposition for arbitrary stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a rotating non-hydrostatic flow with arbitrary stratification and argue that 1) the appropriate form of potential vorticity (PV) for this system is in terms of isopycnal deviation and 2) the decomposition into energetically orthogonal solutions is fundamentally a PV-inversion.
  The new closed-form expression for available potential vorticity (APV) is expressed in terms of isopycnal deviation, following the ideas in Wagner &amp; Young (2015). This form of APV linearizes to quasigeostrophic PV (QGPV) after discarding the nonlinear stretching term and a height nonlinearity, the latter of which is not present in constant stratification. This formulation leads to positive definite definitions of potential enstrophy and total energy expressed in terms of isopycnal deviation, from which the quadratic versions emerge at lowest order. It is exactly these quantities diagonalized by the linear eigenmodes.
  Internal-gravity waves, geostrophic motions, inertial oscillations, and a mean density anomaly form the energetically and enstrophically orthogonal constituents of flow. The complete state of the fluid can be represented in terms of these physically realizeable modes and determined from the derived projection operators using the horizontal velocity and density anomaly. The projection of the fluid state onto the non-hydrostatic wave modes, reveals that one must first account for the PV portion of the flow before recovering the wave solutions.
  We apply the physical insights of the decomposition to a mesoscale eddy showing how strict adherence to adiabatic rearrangement places strong constraints on the vertical structure of such eddies, including a skew towards stronger cyclonic eddies in the upper water-column. Finally, the expression for APV is shown to reproduce the height nonlinearity of shallow-water PV, a well know feature that breaks the cyclone-anticyclone symmetry in QGPV.</description>

      <title>Potential quantum advantage for simulation of fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of turbulent fluid dynamics needs to either parameterize turbulence-which introduces large uncertainties-or explicitly resolve the smallest scales-which is prohibitively expensive. Here we provide evidence through analytic bounds and numerical studies that a potential quantum exponential speedup can be achieved to simulate the Navier-Stokes equations governing turbulence using quantum computing. Specifically, we provide a formulation of the lattice Boltzmann equation for which we give evidence that low-order Carleman linearization is much more accurate than previously believed for these systems and that for computationally interesting examples. This is achieved via a combination of reformulating the nonlinearity and accurately linearizing the dynamical equations, effectively trading nonlinearity for additional degrees of freedom that add negligible expense in the quantum solver. Based on this we apply a quantum algorithm for simulating the Carleman-linearized lattice Boltzmann equation and provide evidence that its cost scales logarithmically with system size, compared to polynomial scaling in the best known classical algorithms. This work suggests that an exponential quantum advantage may exist for simulating fluid dynamics, paving the way for simulating nonlinear multiscale transport phenomena in a wide range of disciplines using quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Seismic and acoustic signals from the 2014 'Interstellar Meteor'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a thorough analysis of seismic and acoustic data from the so-called `Interstellar Meteor' which entered the Earth's atmosphere off the coast of Papua New Guinea on 2014-01-08. We conclude that both previously-reported seismic signals are spurious -- one has characteristics suggesting a local vehicular-traffic based origin; whilst the other is statistically indistinguishable from the background noise. As such, previously-reported localisations based on this data are spurious. Analysis of acoustic data provides a best fit location estimate which is very far ($\sim$170~km) from the reported fireball location. Accordingly, we conclude that material recovered from the seafloor and purported to be from the meteor is almost certainly unrelated to it, and is likely of more mundane (non-interstellar) origin.</description>
