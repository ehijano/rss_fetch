      <title>Isoparametric hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{S}^{n}\times \mathbb{R}^{m}$ and $\mathbb{H}^{n}\times \mathbb{R}^{m}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first show that every isoparametric hypersurface in $\mathbb{S}^{n}\times \mathbb{R}^{m}$ or $\mathbb{H}^{n}\times \mathbb{R}^{m}$ possesses a constant angle function with respect to the canonical product structure. Exploiting this rigidity, we achieve a complete classification of isoparametric and homogeneous hypersurfaces in these product spaces. Furthermore, in the product of any two real space forms, we prove that a hypersurface with both constant angle and constant principal curvatures must be isoparametric. Consequently, for hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{S}^{n}\times \mathbb{R}^{m}$ and $\mathbb{H}^{n}\times \mathbb{R}^{m}$, the conditions of having constant angle and constant principal curvatures are equivalent to being isoparametric.</description>

      <title>Completeness conditions for spacetimes with low-regularity metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Beem's three completeness notions -- finite compactness, timelike Cauchy completeness, and Condition A -- originally defined for spacetimes, to Lorentzian length spaces and study their relationships.
  We prove that finite compactness implies timelike Cauchy completeness and that
  timelike Cauchy completeness implies Condition A for globally hyperbolic Lorentzian length spaces.
  Furthermore, for globally hyperbolic $C^{1}$-spacetimes under suitable assumptions
  ensuring good behavior of causal geodesics, we show that the three conditions are equivalent.
  These results can be regarded as a Hopf-Rinow type theorem for low-regularity Lorentzian geometry.
  The appendix presents examples of $C^{1}$-spacetimes -- where geodesic uniqueness may fail -- in which causal geodesics nevertheless behave well, illustrating the scope of our results.</description>

      <title>On two notions of curvature on singular surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the equivalence of two distinct notions of curvature bounds on singular surfaces. The first notion involves inequalities of the form $\omega\geq\kappa\mu$ (resp. $\omega\leq\kappa\mu$) where $\omega$ is the curvature measure and $\mu$ the Hausdorff measure. The second notion is the classical Alexandrov curvature bound CBB (resp. CAT). We demonstrate that these two definitions are, in fact, equivalent. Specifically, we fill an important gap in the theory by showing that the inequalities imply the corresponding Alexandrov CBB (resp. CAT) bound. One striking application of our result is that, in combination with a result of Petrunin, the lower bound $\omega\geq\kappa\mu$ implies $RCD(\kappa, 2)$.</description>

      <title>Pairs of Embedded Spheres with Pinched Prescribed Mean Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assume $h$ is a positive function on the unit three-sphere which satisfies the pinching condition $h &lt; h_0 \approx 0.547$. We prove the existence of at least two embedded two-spheres with prescribed mean curvature $h$. The same result holds for sign-changing functions $h$ satisfying $\vert h\vert &lt; h_0$ under a mild assumption on the zero set.</description>

      <title>Liouville theorem for biharmonic functions on manifolds of nonnegative Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend Yau's celebrated Liouville theorem to the biharmonic case. Namely, we show that in a complete Riemannian manifold with a pole, nonnegative Ricci curvature and such that the geodesic spheres centered at the pole are mean-convex (or if the square of the distance function from the pole is convex), any biharmonic function of subquadratic growth must be harmonic, and hence, any biharmonic function of sublinear growth must be constant. Our proof relies on a new local $L^2$ estimate for the Laplacian of biharmonic functions combined with a mean value inequality. Examples where our theorem applies include hypersurfaces of positive sectional curvature in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and manifolds with a pole of nonnegative Ricci curvature whose curvature decays at infinity rapidly enough.</description>

      <title>Harmonic maps into principal bundles and generalized magnetic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study harmonic mappings from a Riemannian manifold $N$ into a principal $G$-bundle $P$ endowed with a $G$-invariant Riemannian metric (i.e. a Kaluza-Klein metric). These morphisms are called Kaluza-Klein harmonic maps and naturally lead to the notion of generalized magnetic maps for an arbitrary gauge group $G$, which are just their projections onto the base manifold of $P$ and might provide a geometric formulation for the magnetic interaction of extended objects modelled by $N$ under the action of a generalized Lorentz force. We provide a characterization of Kaluza-Klein harmonic maps and show that the space of generalized magnetic maps is a quotient of the space of Kaluza-Klein harmonic maps under an equivalence relation generated by an appropriate gauge group. We establish a necessary condition that they must satisfy, the gauge variation formula and the harmonic gauge fixing equation, also providing a main existence theorem for them. After analyzing how they are influenced by the geometry of the fibers of the principal bundle, we construct several instances of generalized magnetic maps, including two non-trivial one-parameter families of examples based on $\alpha$-twisted spherical harmonic immersions with values in the complex $S^{3}\longrightarrow S^{2}$ and quaternionic $S^{7}\longrightarrow S^{4}$ Hopf fibrations, proving that among them the unique uncharged ones are the standard Clifford torus and the standard spherical harmonic immersion of $ S^3\times S^3$ into $S^7$.</description>

      <title>On the parity of the Betti numbers of 3-manifolds with a parallel vector field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of whether a closed, orientable manifold can admit a nonzero vector field that is parallel with respect to some Riemannian metric is a classical problem in Differential Geometry, first posed by S. S. Chern [11]. In this work, we provide a complete answer to Chern's question in dimension three. Specifically, we show that a closed, orientable 3-manifold admits a nonzero parallel vector field with respect to some Riemannian metric if and only if it is a K\"ahler mapping torus. Furthermore, we prove that the Betti numbers of any such 3-manifold are necessarily odd. A full classification of these manifolds is also obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Laguerre isotropic hypersurfaces in the Euclidean space, which are hypersurfaces whose Laguerre form is zero and the eigenvalues of the Laguerre tensor are constant and equal to $\lambda\geq 0$. We prove a rigidity theorem for the L-isotropic hypersurfaces parametrized by lines of curvature. Moreover, we study the hypersurfaces that are L-isotropic and L-isoparametric simultaneously and we show that for such a hypersurface $\lambda=0$. We obtain necessary conditions for the existence of L-isotropic hypersurfaces with $\lambda &gt; 0$ and we prove that a certain function, determined by the radii of curvature of the hypersurface, is bounded above by ${1}/{2\lambda}$.</description>

      <title>Doubling Argument of the Hessian Estimate for the Special Lagrangian Equation on General Phases with Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a doubling argument to obtain Hessian estimates for the special Lagrangian equation under general phase constraints. In particular, our approach does not rely on the Michael-Simon mean value inequality. As an intermediate step, we also establish Alexandrov-type theorems, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Towards Constructing Geodesic Nets with Four Boundary Vertices and an Increasing Number of Balanced Vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a geodesic net in the plane with four boundary (unbalanced) vertices that has 25 balanced vertices and that is irreducible, i.e. it does not contain nontrivial subnets.
  This net is novel and remarkable for several reasons: (1) It increases the previously known maximum for balanced vertices of nets of this kind from 16 to 25. (2) It is, to our knowledge, the first such net that includes balanced vertices whose incident edges are not exhibiting symmetries of any kind. (3) The approach taken in the construction is quite promising as it might have the potential for generalization. This would allow to construct a series of irreducible geodesic nets with four boundary vertices and an arbitrary number of balanced vertices, answering a conjecture that the number of balanced vertices is in fact unbounded for nets with four boundary vertices. This would stand in stark contrast to the previously proven theorem that for three boundary vertices, there can be at most one single balanced vertex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we study the structure of solutions to the one-phase Bernoulli problem that are modeled either infinitesimally or at infinity by one-homogeneous solutions with an isolated singularity. In particular, we prove a uniqueness of blowups result under a natural symmetry condition on the one-homogeneous solution (\`a la Allard--Almgren) and we prove a rigidity result at infinity (\`a la Simon--Solomon) under additional constraints on the linearized operator around the one-homogeneous solution (which are satisfied by the only known examples of minimizing one-homogeneous solutions). We believe these are the first uniqueness of blow-up/blow-down results at singular points for non-minimizing solutions to the one-phase problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the functional of total variation of maps from an interval into a Riemannian submanifold of $\mathbb R^N$. We define a notion of strong solution to the system of equations corresponding to the $L^2$-gradient flow of this functional. We prove global existence of strong solutions for initial data of bounded variation. We show that the solutions satisfy a variational equality, and deduce uniqueness in the case of non-positive sectional curvature. We prove convergence of strong solutions to a constant map in finite time.</description>

      <title>Higher Cheeger ratios of features in Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates links between the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, and the higher Cheeger constants of smooth Riemannian manifolds, possibly weighted and/or with boundary. The higher Cheeger constants give a loose description of the major geometric features of a manifold. We give a constructive upper bound on the higher Cheeger constants, in terms of the eigenvalue of any eigenfunction with the corresponding number of nodal domains. Specifically, we show that for each such eigenfunction, a positive-measure collection of its superlevel sets have their Cheeger ratios bounded above in terms of the corresponding eigenvalue.
  Some manifolds have their major features entwined across several eigenfunctions, and no single eigenfunction contains all the major features. In this case, there may exist carefully chosen linear combinations of the eigenfunctions, each with large values on a single feature, and small values elsewhere. We can then apply a soft-thresholding operator to these linear combinations to obtain new functions, each supported on a single feature. We show that the Cheeger ratios of the level sets of these functions also give an upper bound on the Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalues. We extend these level set results to nonautonomous dynamical systems, and show that the dynamic Laplacian eigenfunctions reveal sets with small dynamic Cheeger ratios.</description>

      <title>The Hasse Principle for Geometric Variational Problems: An Illustration via Area-minimizing Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21045v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod n homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}$. As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod n homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected, area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated, and products of area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically area-minimizing. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</description>

      <title>Weak immersions with second fundamental form in a critical Sobolev space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the analysis of Lipschitz immersions of $n$-dimensional manifolds into $\mathbb{R}^d$ having their second fundamental forms bounded in the critical Sobolev space $W^{\frac{n}{2}-1,2}$ in dimension $n\geq 4$ even and any codimension. We prove that, while such a weak immersion is not necessary $C^1$, it generates a $C^1$ differential structure on the domain. More precisely, for any such an immersion, there is an atlas in which the first fundamental form is continuous and the transition maps are $C^1$. We prove that this $C^1$ structure is diffeomorphic to the original one. This result is the starting point of the analysis of the behavior of sequences of weak immersions with second fundamental forms uniformly bounded in the critical Sobolev space $W^{\frac{n}{2}-1,2}$. In the second part of the paper we establish a weakly sequential closure theorem for such sequences. This analysis is motivated by the study of conformally invariant Lagrangian of immersions in dimension larger than two such as generalized Willmore energies, for instance the Graham--Reichert functional obtained in the computation of renormalized volumes of five-dimensional minimal submanifolds of the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{d+1}$.</description>

Abstract: The classical Bach tensor in four dimensions can be expressed as a linear combination of two independent, symmetric, divergence-free, quadratic in curvature tensors U and V. Several classification results for gradient-shrinking Ricci solitons have been obtained under the assumption that the Bach tensor vanishes. We define a Bach-like tensor to be any other linear combination of U and V. We prove that, except along the Bach line, the vanishing of a Bach-like tensor forces a four-dimensional complete gradient-shrinking Ricci soliton to be either Einstein or isometric to the Gaussian soliton. Finally, we show that Bach-like tensors arise as Euler-Lagrange equations of a two-parameter family of quadratic curvature functionals and compute the corresponding first and second variation formulas.</description>

      <title>Explicit Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff Radii in Special Banach--Malcev Algebras of Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish explicit convergence radii for the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff (BCH) series in special Banach--Malcev algebras of shifts-those embeddable into a Banach alternative algebra. Under the continuity estimate $\|[x,y]\|\leq B\|x\|\|y\|$, the series converges absolutely whenever $B(\|x\|+\|y\|)&lt;1/(4K)$, where $K\geq1$ bounds the absolute BCH coefficients. The constant $1/(4K)$ stems from a Catalan-number majorization and is sharp in the exponential-weight model. We compute $B$ explicitly for operator, exponential, polynomial, damped, and tree-like shift algebras, including the non-Lie split-octonionic (Zorn) algebra ($B=2$, $\rho=1/(8K)$). All results require the speciality assumption; the framework does not apply to general Malcev algebras. Geometrically, $\rho=1/(4KB)$ is the analyticity radius of the induced Moufang loop; numerically, it governs stability of BCH-type integrators.</description>

      <title>Contact Wasserstein Geodesics for Non-Conservative Schr\"odinger Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger Bridge provides a principled framework for modeling stochastic processes between distributions; however, existing methods are limited by energy-conservation assumptions, which constrains the bridge's shape preventing it from model varying-energy phenomena. To overcome this, we introduce the non-conservative generalized Schr\"odinger bridge (NCGSB), a novel, energy-varying reformulation based on contact Hamiltonian mechanics. By allowing energy to change over time, the NCGSB provides a broader class of real-world stochastic processes, capturing richer and more faithful intermediate dynamics. By parameterizing the Wasserstein manifold, we lift the bridge problem to a tractable geodesic computation in a finite-dimensional space. Unlike computationally expensive iterative solutions, our contact Wasserstein geodesic (CWG) is naturally implemented via a ResNet architecture and relies on a non-iterative solver with near-linear complexity. Furthermore, CWG supports guided generation by modulating a task-specific distance metric. We validate our framework on tasks including manifold navigation, molecular dynamics predictions, and image generation, demonstrating its practical benefits and versatility.</description>
