      <title>Merger Analysis with Latent Price</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard empirical tools for merger analysis assume price data, which may not be readily available. This paper characterizes sufficient conditions for identifying the unilateral effects of mergers without price data. I show that revenues, margins, and revenue diversion ratios are sufficient for identifying the gross upward pricing pressure indices, impact on consumer/producer surplus, and compensating marginal cost reductions associated with a merger. I also describe assumptions on demand that facilitate the identification of revenue diversion ratios and merger simulations. I use the proposed framework to evaluate the Staples/Office Depot merger (2016).</description>

      <title>Liquidity Jump, Liquidity Diffusion, and Wash Trading of Crypto Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that the liquidity of an asset includes two components: liquidity jump and liquidity diffusion. We find that the liquidity diffusion has a higher correlation with crypto washing trading than the liquidity jump. We demonstrate that the treatment of washing trading significantly reduces the liquidity diffusion, but only marginally reduces the liquidity jump. We find that the ARMA-GARCH/EGARCH models are highly effective in modeling the liquidity-adjusted return with and without treatment on wash trading. We argue that treatment on wash trading is unnecessary in modeling established crypto assets that trade in mainstream exchanges, even if these exchanges are unregulated.</description>

      <title>Lorenz map, inequality ordering and curves based on multidimensional rearrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a multivariate extension of the Lorenz curve based on multivariate rearrangements of optimal transport theory. We define a vector Lorenz map as the integral of the vector quantile map associated with a multivariate resource allocation. Each component of the Lorenz map is the cumulative share of each resource, as in the traditional univariate case. The pointwise ordering of such Lorenz maps defines a new multivariate majorization order, which is equivalent to preference by any social planner with inequality averse multivariate rank dependent social evaluation functional. We define a family of multi-attribute Gini index and complete ordering based on the Lorenz map. We propose the level sets of an Inverse Lorenz Function as a practical tool to visualize and compare inequality in two dimensions, and apply it to income-wealth inequality in the United States between 1989 and 2022.</description>

      <title>require: Package dependencies for reproducible research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to conduct reproducible research in Stata is often limited by the lack of version control for community-contributed packages. This article introduces the require command, a tool designed to ensure Stata package dependencies are compatible across users and computer systems. Given a list of Stata packages, require verifies that each package is installed, checks for a minimum or exact version or package release date, and optionally installs the package if prompted by the researcher.</description>

      <title>Inference in Auctions with Many Bidders Using Transaction Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers inference in first-price and second-price sealed-bid auctions in empirical settings where we observe auctions with a large number of bidders. Relevant applications include online auctions, treasury auctions, spectrum auctions, art auctions, and IPO auctions, among others. Given the abundance of bidders in each auction, we propose an asymptotic framework in which the number of bidders diverges while the number of auctions remains fixed. This framework allows us to perform asymptotically exact inference on key model features using only transaction price data. Specifically, we examine inference on the expected utility of the auction winner, the expected revenue of the seller, and the tail properties of the valuation distribution. Simulations confirm the accuracy of our inference methods in finite samples. Finally, we also apply them to Hong Kong car license auction data.</description>

      <title>CAVIAR: Categorical-Variable Embeddings for Accurate and Robust Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social science research often hinges on the relationship between categorical variables and outcomes. We introduce CAVIAR, a novel method for embedding categorical variables that assume values in a high-dimensional ambient space but are sampled from an underlying manifold. Our theoretical and numerical analyses outline challenges posed by such categorical variables in causal inference. Specifically, dynamically varying and sparse levels can lead to violations of the Donsker conditions and a failure of the estimation functionals to converge to a tight Gaussian process. Traditional approaches, including the exclusion of rare categorical levels and principled variable selection models like LASSO, fall short. CAVIAR embeds the data into a lower-dimensional global coordinate system. The mapping can be derived from both structured and unstructured data, and ensures stable and robust estimates through dimensionality reduction. In a dataset of direct-to-consumer apparel sales, we illustrate how high-dimensional categorical variables, such as zip codes, can be succinctly represented, facilitating inference and analysis.</description>

      <title>Extract Mechanisms from Heterogeneous Effects: Identification Strategy for Mediation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding causal mechanisms is essential for explaining and generalizing empirical phenomena. Causal mediation analysis offers statistical techniques to quantify mediation effects. However, existing methods typically require strong identification assumptions or sophisticated research designs. We develop a new identification strategy that simplifies these assumptions, enabling the simultaneous estimation of causal and mediation effects. The strategy is based on a novel decomposition of total treatment effects, which transforms the challenging mediation problem into a simple linear regression problem. The new method establishes a new link between causal mediation and causal moderation. We discuss several research designs and estimators to increase the usability of our identification strategy for a variety of empirical studies. We demonstrate the application of our method by estimating the causal mediation effect in experiments concerning common pool resource governance and voting information. Additionally, we have created statistical software to facilitate the implementation of our method.</description>
