      <title>FOS: A fully integrated open-source program for Fast Optical Spectrum calculations of nanoparticle media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FOS, which means light in Greek, is an open-source program for Fast Optical Spectrum calculations of nanoparticle media. This program takes the material properties and a description of the system as input, and outputs the spectral response including the reflectance, absorptance, and transmittance. Previous open-source codes often include only one portion of what is needed to calculate the spectral response of a nanoparticulate medium, such as Mie theory or a Monte Carlo method. FOS is designed to provide a convenient fully integrated format to remove the barrier as well as providing a significantly accelerated implementation with compiled Python code, parallel processing, and pre-trained machine learning predictions. This program can accelerate optimization and high throughput design of optical properties of nanoparticle or nanocomposite media, such as radiative cooling paint and solar heating liquids, allowing for the discovery of new materials and designs. FOS also enables convenient modeling of lunar dust coatings, combustion particulates, and many other particulate systems. In this paper we discuss the methodology used in FOS, features of the program, and provide four case studies.</description>

      <title>Mixed Steklov-Neumann problem: asymptotic analysis and applications to diffusion-controlled reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many first-passage processes in complex media and related diffusion-controlled reactions can be described by means of eigenfunctions of the mixed Steklov-Neumann problem. In this paper, we investigate this spectral problem in a common setting when a small target or escape window (with Steklov condition) is located on the reflecting boundary (with Neumann condition). We start by inspecting two basic settings: an arc-shaped target on the boundary of a disk and a spherical-cap-shaped target on the boundary of a ball. We construct the explicit kernel of an integral operator that determines the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and deduce their asymptotic behavior in the small-target limit. By relating the limiting kernel to an appropriate Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, we extend these asymptotic results to other bounded domains with smooth boundaries. A straightforward application to first-passage processes is presented; in particular, we revisit the small-target behavior of the mean first-reaction time on perfectly or partially reactive targets, as well as for more sophisticated surface reactions that extend the conventional narrow escape problem.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Construction of High-Fidelity Graph Deep Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become an indispensable tool in large-scale atomistic simulations because of their ability to reproduce ab initio potential energy surfaces (PESs) very accurately at a fraction of computational cost. For computational efficiency, the training data for most MLPs today are computed using relatively cheap density functional theory (DFT) methods such as the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional. Meta-GGAs such as the recently developed strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) functional have been shown to yield significantly improved descriptions of atomic interactions for diversely bonded systems, but their higher computational cost remains an impediment to their use in MLP development. In this work, we outline a data-efficient multi-fidelity approach to constructing Materials 3-body Graph Network (M3GNet) interatomic potentials that integrate different levels of theory within a single model. Using silicon and water as examples, we show that a multi-fidelity M3GNet model trained on a combined dataset of low-fidelity GGA calculations with 10% of high-fidelity SCAN calculations can achieve accuracies comparable to a single-fidelity M3GNet model trained on a dataset comprising 8x the number of SCAN calculations. This work paves the way for the development of high-fidelity MLPs in a cost-effective manner by leveraging existing low-fidelity datasets.</description>

      <title>The role of sputtered atom and ion energy distribution in films deposited by Physical Vapor Deposition: A molecular dynamics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of copper film growth with a constant energy neutral beam, thermal evaporation, dc magnetron sputtering, high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiP-IMS), and bipolar HiPIMS, through molecular dynamics simulations. Experimentally determined energy distribution functions were utilized to model the deposition processes. Our results indicate significant differences in the film quality, growth rate, and substrate erosion between the various physical vapor deposition techniques. Bipolar HiPIMS shows the potential for improved film structure under certain conditions, albeit with increased substrate erosion. Bipolar +180 V HiPIMS with 10% Cu + ions exhibited the best film properties in terms of crystallinity and atomic stress among the PVD processes investigated.</description>

      <title>Single MRT-featured Lattice Boltzmann Method (SmrtLBM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel single MRT-featured lattice Boltzmann method (SmrtLBM) is introduced. The intricate algorithm of the multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) collision operator is reimagined and distilled into a streamlined, single-relaxation-time-like scheme. This innovation preserves the simplicity and efficiency of the conventional single-relaxation-time approach while inheriting the enhanced stability characteristic of the MRT techniques, making it a powerful tool for simulating complex fluid flows. Rigorous numerical testing on cavity flows demonstrates that SmrtLBM accurately captures complex flow characteristics, even in challenging high Reynolds number regimes where precision and stability are crucial. Compared to the traditional single-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method, this model offers superior stability and accurate solutions for difficult flows. The SmrtLBM marks a breakthrough in complex fluid simulation through a simple method, offering a new level of efficiency and reliability in tackling challenging flow problems.</description>

      <title>Two-stage initial-value iterative physics-informed neural networks for simulating solitary waves of nonlinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new two-stage initial-value iterative neural network (IINN) algorithm for solitary wave computations of nonlinear wave equations based on traditional numerical iterative methods and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Specifically, the IINN framework consists of two subnetworks, one of which is used to fit a given initial value, and the other incorporates physical information and continues training on the basis of the first subnetwork. Importantly, the IINN method does not require any additional data information including boundary conditions, apart from the given initial value. Corresponding theoretical guarantees are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our IINN method. The proposed IINN method is efficiently applied to learn some types of solutions in different nonlinear wave equations, including the one-dimensional (1D) nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (NLS) equation (with and without potentials), the 1D saturable NLS equation with PT -symmetric optical lattices, the 1D focusing-defocusing coupled NLS equations, the KdV equation, the two-dimensional (2D) NLS equation with potentials, the 2D amended GP equation with a potential, the (2+1)-dimensional KP equation, and the 3D NLS equation with a potential. These applications serve as evidence for the efficacy of our method. Finally, by comparing with the traditional methods, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed IINN method.</description>

      <title>Multi-frequency Neural Born Iterative Method for Solving 2-D Inverse Scattering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a deep learning-based imaging method for addressing the multi-frequency electromagnetic (EM) inverse scattering problem (ISP). By combining deep learning technology with EM physical laws, we have successfully developed a multi-frequency neural Born iterative method (NeuralBIM), guided by the principles of the single-frequency NeuralBIM. This method integrates multitask learning techniques with NeuralBIM's efficient iterative inversion process to construct a robust multi-frequency Born iterative inversion model. During training, the model employs a multitask learning approach guided by homoscedastic uncertainty to adaptively allocate the weights of each frequency's data. Additionally, an unsupervised learning method, constrained by the physical laws of ISP, is used to train the multi-frequency NeuralBIM model, eliminating the need for contrast and total field data. The effectiveness of the multi-frequency NeuralBIM is validated through synthetic and experimental data, demonstrating improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency for solving ISP. Moreover, this method exhibits strong generalization capabilities and noise resistance. The multi-frequency NeuralBIM method explores a novel inversion method for multi-frequency EM data and provides an effective solution for the electromagnetic ISP of multi-frequency data.</description>

      <title>The qspec Python package: A physics toolbox for laser spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of experimental results with Python often requires writing many code scripts which all need access to the same set of functions. In a common field of research, this set will be nearly the same for many users. The qspec Python package was developed to provide functions for physical formulas, simulations and data analysis routines widely used in laser spectroscopy and related fields. Most functions are compatible with numpy arrays, enabling fast calculations with large samples of data. A multidimensional linear regression algorithm enables a King plot analyses over multiple atomic transitions. A modular framework for constructing lineshape models can be used to fit large sets of spectroscopy data. A simulation module within the package provides user-friendly methods to simulate the coherent time-evolution of atoms in electro-magnetic fields without the need to explicitly derive a Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Causality-guided adaptive sampling method for physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to purely data-driven methods, a key feature of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) - a proven powerful tool for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) - is the embedding of PDE constraints into the loss function. The selection and distribution of collocation points for evaluating PDE residuals are critical to the performance of PINNs. Furthermore, the causal training is currently a popular training mode. In this work, we propose the causality-guided adaptive sampling (Causal AS) method for PINNs. Given the characteristics of causal training, we use the weighted PDE residuals as the indicator for the selection of collocation points to focus on areas with larger PDE residuals within the regions being trained. For the hyper-parameter $p$ involved, we develop the temporal alignment driven update (TADU) scheme for its dynamic update beyond simply fixing it as a constant. The collocation points selected at each time will be released before the next adaptive sampling step to avoid the cumulative effects caused by previously chosen collocation points and reduce computational costs. To illustrate the effectiveness of the Causal AS method, we apply it to solve time-dependent equations, including the Allen-Cahn equation, the NLS equation, the KdV equation and the mKdV equation. During the training process, we employe a time-marching technique and strictly impose the periodic boundary conditions by embedding the input coordinates into Fourier expansion to mitigate optimization challenges. Numerical results indicate that the predicted solution achieves an excellent agreement with the ground truth. Compared to a similar work, the causal extension of R3 sampling (Causal R3), our proposed Causal AS method demonstrates a significant advantage in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Radiative hydrodynamic equations with nonequilibrium radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a kinetic model for the coupled evolution of radiation, electrons, and ions in a radiation plasma system. The model is solved using two methods. The gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) for electron and ion hydrodynamics and the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) for non-equilibrium radiative transfer. The UGKS accurately captures multiscale photon transport from free streaming to diffusion across varying fluid opacities. This approach enables the scheme to model equilibrium plasma with non-equilibrium radiation transport. The model is validated through several test cases, including radiative transfer in kinetic and diffusion regimes, Marshak wave, Radiative shock, 3T double lax shock tube problem, two-dimensional Sedov blast wave, and two-dimensional tophat based problem. These tests demonstrate the current scheme's capability to handle diverse radiation plasma scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Broadband Multipole Method for Accelerated Mutual Coupling Analysis of Large Irregular Arrays Including Rotated Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical method for the analysis of mutual coupling effects in large, dense and irregular arrays with identical antennas. Building on the Method of Moments (MoM), our technique employs a Macro Basis Function (MBF) approach for rapid direct inversion of the MoM impedance matrix. To expedite the reduced matrix filling, we propose an extension of the Steepest-Descent Multipole expansion which remains numerically stable and efficient across a wide bandwidth. This broadband multipole-based approach is well suited to quasi-planar problems and requires only the pre-computation of each MBF's complex patterns, resulting in low antenna-dependent pre-processing costs. The method also supports arrays with arbitrarily rotated antennas at low additional cost. A simulation of all embedded element patterns of irregular arrays of 256 complex log-periodic antennas completes in just 10 minutes per frequency point on a current laptop, with an additional minute per new layout.</description>

      <title>A fast solver for the spatially homogeneous electron Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical method for the velocity-space, spatially homogeneous, collisional Boltzmann equation for electron transport in low-temperature plasma (LTP) conditions. Modeling LTP plasmas is useful in many applications, including advanced manufacturing, material processing, semiconductor processing, and hypersonics, to name a few. Most state-of-the-art methods for electron kinetics are based on Monte-Carlo sampling for collisions combined with Lagrangian particle-in-cell methods. We discuss an Eulerian solver that approximates the electron velocity distribution function using spherical harmonics (angular components) and B-splines (energy component). Our solver supports electron-heavy elastic and inelastic binary collisions, electron-electron Coulomb interactions, steady-state and transient dynamics, and an arbitrary nmber of angular terms in the electron distribution function. We report convergence results and compare our solver to two other codes: an in-house particle Monte-Carlo ethod; and Bolsig+, a state-of-the-art Eulerian solver for electron transport in LTPs. Furthermore, we use our solver to study the relaxation time scales of the higher-order anisotropic correction terms. Our code is open-source and provides an interface that allows coupling to multiphysics simulations of low-temperature plasmas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide code to solve the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations for the nucleon transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs), which encode nucleon transverse spin structure. Though codes are widely available for the evolution of unpolarized and polarized PDFs, there are no recent codes publicly available for the transversity PDF. Here, we present Python code which implements two methods of solving the leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) approximations of the DGLAP equations for the transversity PDF, and we highlight the theoretical differences between the two.</description>

      <title>Boundaries of universality of thermal collisions for atom-atom scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal rate coefficients for some atomic collisions have been observed to be remarkably independent of the details of interatomic interactions at short range. This makes these rate coefficients universal functions of the long-range interaction parameters and masses, which was previously exploited to develop a self-defining atomic sensor for ambient pressure. Here, we employ rigorous quantum scattering calculations to examine the response of thermally averaged rate coefficients for atom-atom collisions to changes in the interaction potentials. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the universality, and the boundaries thereof, by treating the quantum scattering observables as probabilistic predictions determined by a distribution of interaction potentials. We show that there is a characteristic change of the resulting distributions of rate coefficients, separating light, few-electron atoms and heavy, polarizable atoms. We produce diagrams that illustrate the boundaries of the thermal collision universality at different temperatures and provide guidance for future experiments seeking to exploit the universality.</description>

      <title>Prediction of excitable wave dynamics using machine learning</title>

Abstract: Excitable systems, including cardiac tissue, can exhibit a variety of dynamics with different complexity, ranging from a single, stable spiral to spiral defect chaos (SDC), during which spiral waves are continuously formed and destroyed. Cardiac models typically involve a large number of variables and can be time-consuming to simulate. Here we trained a deep-learning (DL) model using snapshots from a single variable, obtained by simulating a single quasi-periodic spiral wave and spiral defect chaos (SDC) using a generic cardiac model. Using the trained DL model, we predicted the dynamics in both cases, using timesteps that are much larger than required for the simulations of the underlying equations. We show that the DL model is able to predict the trajectory of a quasi-periodic spiral wave and that the SDC activaton patterns can be predicted for approximately one Lyapunov time. Furthermore, we show that the DL model accurately captures the statistics of termination events in SDC, including the mean termination time. Finally, we show that a DL model trained using a specific domain size is able to replicate termination statistics on larger domains, resulting in significant computational savings.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Phonon Thermal Conductivity Prediction by an Order of Magnitude Through Machine Learning-Assisted Extraction of Anharmonic Force Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The calculation of material phonon thermal conductivity from density functional theory calculations requires computationally expensive evaluation of anharmonic interatomic force constants and has remained a computational bottleneck in the high-throughput discovery of materials. In this work, we present a machine learning-assisted approach for the extraction of anharmonic force constants through local learning of the potential energy surface. We demonstrate our approach on a diverse collection of 220 ternary materials for which the total computational time for anharmonic force constants evaluation is reduced by more than an order of magnitude from 480,000 cpu-hours to less than 12,000 cpu-hours while preserving the thermal conductivity prediction accuracy to within 10%. Our approach removes a major hurdle in computational thermal conductivity evaluation and will pave the way forward for the high-throughput discovery of materials.</description>

      <title>Electronvolt energy resolution with broadband ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ptychography is a scanning coherent diffraction imaging technique successfully applied in the electron, visible and x-ray regimes. One of the distinct features of ptychography with respect to other coherent diffraction techniques is its capability of dealing with partial spatial and temporal coherence via the reconstruction algorithm. Here we focus on the temporal and clarify the constraints which affect the energy resolution limits of the ptychographic algorithms. Based on this, we design and perform simulations for a broadband ptychography in the hard x-ray regime, which enables an energy resolution down to 1 eV. We benchmark the simulations against experimental ptychographic data of an NMC battery cathode material, attaining an energy resolution of 5 eV. We review the results, discuss the limitations, and provide guidelines for future broadband ptychography experiments, its prospective application for single acquisition x-ray absorption near edge structure imaging, magnetic dichroism imaging, and potential impact on achieving diffraction limited resolutions.</description>

      <title>Suppression of soliton collapses, modulational instability, and rogue-wave excitation in two-L\'evy-index fractional Kerr media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: s in laser systems with two fractional-dispersion/diffraction terms, quantified by their L\'{e}vy indices, $\alpha_{1}\, \alpha_{2}\in (1, 2]$, and self-focusing or defocusing Kerr nonlinearity. Some fundamental solitons are obtained by means of the variational approximation, which are verified by comparison with numerical results. We find that the soliton collapse, exhibited by the one-dimensional cubic fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with only one L\'{e}vy index $\alpha =1$, can be suppressed in the two-L\'{e}vy-index fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger system. Stability of the solitons is also explored against collisions with Gaussian pulses and adiabatic variation of the system parameters. Modulation instability of continuous waves is investigated in the two-L\'{e}vy-index system too. In particular, the modulation instability may occur in the case of the defocusing nonlinearity when two diffraction coefficients have opposite signs. Using results for the modulation instability, we produce first- and second-order rogue waves on top of continuous waves, for both signs of the Kerr nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>A Roadmap to Holographic Focused Ultrasound Approaches to Generate Thermal Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In therapeutic focused ultrasound (FUS), such as thermal ablation and hyperthermia, effective acousto-thermal manipulation requires precise targeting of complex geometries, sound wave propagation through irregular structures and selective focusing at specific depths. Acoustic holographic lenses (AHLs) provide a distinctive capability to shape acoustic fields into precise, complex and multifocal FUS-thermal patterns. Acknowledging the under-explored potential of AHLs in shaping ultrasound-induced heating, this study introduces a roadmap for acousto-thermal modeling in the design of AHLs. Three primary modeling approaches are studied and contrasted using four distinct shape groups for the imposed target field. They include pressure-based (BSC-TR and ITER-TR), temperature-based (IHTO-TR), and machine learning (ML)-based (GaN and Feat-GAN) methods. New metrics including image quality, thermal efficiency, control, and computational time are introduced. The importance of evaluating target pattern complexity, thermal and pressure requirements, and computational resources is highlighted for selecting the appropriate methods. For lightly heterogeneous media and targets with lower pattern complexity, BSC-TR combined with error diffusion algorithms provides an effective solution. As pattern complexity increases, ITER-TR becomes more suitable, enabling optimization through iterative forward and backward propagations controlled by different error metrics. IHTO-TR is recommended for highly heterogeneous media, particularly in applications requiring thermal control and precise heat deposition. GaN is ideal for rapid solutions that account for acousto-thermal effects, especially when model parameters and boundary conditions remain constant. In contrast, Feat-GaN is effective for moderately complex shape groups and applications where model parameters must be adjusted.</description>

      <title>Computing virtual dark-field X-ray microscopy images of complex discrete dislocation structures from large-scale molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) is a novel diffraction-based imaging technique that non-destructively maps the local deformation from crystalline defects in bulk materials. While studies have demonstrated that DFXM can spatially map 3D defect geometries, it is still challenging to interpret DFXM images of the high dislocation density systems relevant to macroscopic crystal plasticity. This work develops a scalable forward model to calculate virtual DFXM images for complex discrete dislocation (DD) structures obtained from atomistic simulations. Our new DD-DFXM model integrates a non-singular formulation for calculating the local strain from the DD structures and an efficient geometrical optics algorithm for computing the DFXM image from the strain. We apply the model to complex DD structures obtained from a large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of compressive loading on a single-crystal silicon. Simulated DFXM images exhibit prominent feature contrast for dislocations between the multiple slip systems, demonstrating the DFXM's potential to resolve features from dislocation multiplication. The integrated DD-DFXM model provides a toolbox for DFXM experimental design and image interpretation in the context of bulk crystal plasticity for the breadth of measurements across shock plasticity and the broader materials science community.</description>

      <title>Robust analytic continuation using sparse modeling approach imposed by semi-positive definiteness for multi-orbital systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytic continuation (AC) from imaginary-time Green's function to spectral function is essential in the numerical analysis of dynamical properties in quantum many-body systems. However, this process faces a fundamental challenge: it is an ill-posed problem, leading to unstable spectra against the noise in the Green's function. This instability is further complicated in multi-orbital systems with hybridization between spin-orbitals, where off-diagonal Green's functions yield a spectral matrix with off-diagonal elements, necessitating the matrix's semi-positive definiteness to satisfy the causality. We propose an advanced AC method using sparse modeling for multi-orbital systems, which reduces the effect of noise and ensures the matrix's semi-positive definiteness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by contrasting it with the conventional sparse modeling method, focusing on handling Green's functions with off-diagonal elements, thereby demonstrating our proposed method's enhanced stability and precision.</description>

      <title>Learning out-of-time-ordered correlators with classical kernel methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-Time Ordered Correlators (OTOCs) are widely used to investigate information scrambling in quantum systems. However, directly computing OTOCs with classical computers is often impractical. This is due to the need to simulate the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, which entails exponentially-scaling computational costs with system size. Similarly, exact simulation of the dynamics with a quantum computer (QC) will generally require a fault-tolerant QC, which is currently beyond technological capabilities. Therefore, alternative approaches are needed for computing OTOCs and related quantities. In this study, we explore four parameterised sets of Hamiltonians describing quantum systems of interest in condensed matter physics. For each set, we investigate whether classical kernel methods can accurately learn the XZ-OTOC as well as a particular sum of OTOCs, as functions of the Hamiltonian parameters. We frame the problem as a regression task, generating labelled data via an efficient numerical algorithm that utilises matrix product operators to simulate quantum many-body systems, with up to 40 qubits. Using this data, we train a variety of standard kernel machines and observe that the best kernels consistently achieve a high coefficient of determination ($R^2$) on the testing sets, typically between 0.9 and 0.99, and almost always exceeding 0.8. This demonstrates that classical kernels supplied with a moderate amount of training data can be used to closely and efficiently approximate OTOCs and related quantities for a diverse range of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Boron Isotope Effects on Raman Scattering in Bulk BN, BP, and BAs: A Density-Functional Theory Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For many materials, Raman spectra are intricately structured and provide valuable information about compositional stoichiometry and crystal quality. Here we use density-functional theory calculations, mass approximation, and the Raman intensity weighted $\Gamma$-point density of state approach to analyze Raman scattering and vibrational modes in zincblende, wurtzite, and hexagonal BX (X = N, P, and As) structures. The influence of crystal structure and boron isotope disorder on Raman line shapes is examined. Our results demonstrate that long-range Coulomb interactions significantly influence the evolution of Raman spectra in cubic and wurtzite BN compounds. With the evolution of the compositional rate from $^{11}$B to $^{10}$B, a shift toward higher frequencies, as well as the maximum broadening and asymmetry of the Raman peaks, is expected around the 1:1 ratio. The calculated results are in excellent agreement with the available experimental data. This study serves as a guide for understanding how crystal symmetry and isotope disorder affect phonons in BX compounds, which are relevant to quantum single-photon emitters, heat management, and crystal quality assessments.</description>

      <title>Burst-tree structure and higher-order temporal correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding characteristics of temporal correlations in time series is crucial for developing accurate models in natural and social sciences. The burst-tree decomposition method was recently introduced to reveal higher-order temporal correlations in time series in a form of an event sequence, in particular, the hierarchical structure of bursty trains of events for the entire range of timescales [Jo et al., Sci.~Rep.~\textbf{10}, 12202 (2020)]. Such structure has been found to be simply characterized by the burst-merging kernel governing which bursts are merged together as the timescale for detecting bursts increases. In this work, we study the effects of kernels on the higher-order temporal correlations in terms of burst size distributions, memory coefficients for bursts, and the autocorrelation function. We employ several kernels, including the constant, additive, and product kernels as well as those inspired by the empirical results. We find that kernels with preferential mixing lead to the heavy-tailed burst size distributions, while kernels with assortative mixing lead to positive correlations between burst sizes. The decaying exponent of the autocorrelation function depends not only on the kernel but also on the power-law exponent of the interevent time distribution. In addition, thanks to the analogy to the coagulation process, analytical solutions of burst size distributions for some kernels could be obtained.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Ab Initio Hagedorn Wavepacket Dynamics: Single Vibronic Level Fluorescence Spectra of Difluorocarbene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hagedorn wavepackets have been used with local harmonic approximation to partially capture the anharmonic effects on single vibronic level (SVL) spectra in model potentials. To make the Hagedorn approach practical for realistic anharmonic polyatomic molecules, here we combine local harmonic Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics with on-the-fly ab initio dynamics. We then test this method by computing the SVL fluorescence spectra of difluorocarbene, a small, floppy molecule with a very anharmonic potential energy surface. Our time-dependent approach obtains the emission spectra of all initial vibrational levels from a single anharmonic semiclassical wavepacket trajectory without the need to fit individual anharmonic vibrational wavefunctions and to calculate the Franck--Condon factors for all vibronic transitions. We show that, whereas global harmonic models are inadequate for CF$_2$, the spectra computed with the on-the-fly local harmonic Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics agree well with experimental data, especially for low initial excitations.</description>

      <title>Creation of an Fe$_3$P Schreibersite Density Functional Tight Binding Model for Astrobiological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mineral schreibersite, e.g., Fe$_3$P, is commonly found in iron-rich meteorites and could have served as an abiotic phosphorus source for prebiotic chemistry. However, atomistic calculations of its degradation chemistry generally require quantum simulation approaches, which can be too computationally cumbersome to study sufficient time and length scales for this process. In this regard, we have created a computationally efficient semi-empirical quantum Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) model for iron and phosphorus-containing materials by adopting an existing semi-automated workflow that represents many-body interactions by linear combinations of Chebyshev polynomials. We have utilized a relatively small training set to optimize a DFTB model that is accurate for schreibersite physical and chemical properties, including its bulk properties, surface energies, and water absorption. We then show that our model shows strong transferability to several iron phosphide solids as well as multiple allotropes of iron metal. Our resulting DFTB parameterization will allow us to interrogate schreibersite aqueous decomposition at longer time and length scales than standard quantum approaches, allowing for investigations of its role in prebiotic chemistry on early Earth.</description>

      <title>On the design space between molecular mechanics and machine learning force fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A force field as accurate as quantum mechanics (QM) and as fast as molecular mechanics (MM), with which one can simulate a biomolecular system efficiently enough and meaningfully enough to get quantitative insights, is among the most ardent dreams of biophysicists -- a dream, nevertheless, not to be fulfilled any time soon. Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) represent a meaningful endeavor towards this direction, where differentiable neural functions are parametrized to fit ab initio energies, and furthermore forces through automatic differentiation. We argue that, as of now, the utility of the MLFF models is no longer bottlenecked by accuracy but primarily by their speed (as well as stability and generalizability), as many recent variants, on limited chemical spaces, have long surpassed the chemical accuracy of $1$ kcal/mol -- the empirical threshold beyond which realistic chemical predictions are possible -- though still magnitudes slower than MM. Hoping to kindle explorations and designs of faster, albeit perhaps slightly less accurate MLFFs, in this review, we focus our attention on the design space (the speed-accuracy tradeoff) between MM and ML force fields. After a brief review of the building blocks of force fields of either kind, we discuss the desired properties and challenges now faced by the force field development community, survey the efforts to make MM force fields more accurate and ML force fields faster, envision what the next generation of MLFF might look like.</description>

      <title>Embedding theory contributions to average atom models for warm dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling in the warm dense matter regime is a persistent challenge with the most detailed models such as quantum molecular dynamics and path integral Monte Carlo being immensely computationally expensive. Density functional theory (DFT)-based average atom models (AAM) offer significant speed-ups in calculation times while still retaining fair accuracy in evaluating equations of state, mean ionizations, and more. Despite their success, AAMs struggle to precisely account for electronic interactions -- in particular, they do not account for effects on the kinetic energy arising from overlaps in neighboring atom densities. We aim to enhance these models by including such interactions via the non-additive kinetic potential $v^{\rm nadd}$ as in DFT embedding theories. $v^{\rm nadd}$ can be computed using Thomas-Fermi, von Weizs\"acker, or more sophisticated kinetic energy functionals. The proposed model introduces $v^{\rm nadd}$ as a novel interaction term in existing ion-correlation models, which include interactions beyond the central atom. We have applied this model to hydrogen at 5 eV and densities ranging 0.008 to 0.8 g/cm$^3$, and investigated the effects of $v^{\rm nadd}$ on electron densities, Kohn-Sham energy level shifts, mean ionization, and total energies.</description>

      <title>Accurate Computation of Quantum Excited States with Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a variational Monte Carlo algorithm for estimating the lowest excited states of a quantum system which is a natural generalization of the estimation of ground states. The method has no free parameters and requires no explicit orthogonalization of the different states, instead transforming the problem of finding excited states of a given system into that of finding the ground state of an expanded system. Expected values of arbitrary observables can be calculated, including off-diagonal expectations between different states such as the transition dipole moment. Although the method is entirely general, it works particularly well in conjunction with recent work on using neural networks as variational Ans\"atze for many-electron systems, and we show that by combining this method with the FermiNet and Psiformer Ans\"atze we can accurately recover vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths on a range of molecules. Our method is the first deep learning approach to achieve accurate vertical excitation energies, including challenging double excitations, on benzene-scale molecules. Beyond the chemistry examples here, we expect this technique will be of great interest for applications to atomic, nuclear and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>A Python GPU-accelerated solver for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and applications to many-body cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TorchGPE is a general-purpose Python package developed for solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). This solver is designed to integrate wave functions across a spectrum of linear and non-linear potentials. A distinctive aspect of TorchGPE is its modular approach, which allows the incorporation of arbitrary self-consistent and time-dependent potentials, e.g., those relevant in many-body cavity QED models. The package employs a symmetric split-step Fourier propagation method, effective in both real and imaginary time. In our work, we demonstrate a significant improvement in computational efficiency by leveraging GPU computing capabilities. With the integration of the latter technology, TorchGPE achieves a substantial speed-up with respect to conventional CPU-based methods, greatly expanding the scope and potential of research in this field.</description>

      <title>Flow control by a hybrid use of machine learning and control theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flow control has a great potential to contribute to the sustainable society through mitigation of environmental burden. However, high dimensional and nonlinear nature of fluid flows poses challenges in designing efficient control laws. This paper aims to propose a hybrid method (i.e., machine learning and control theory) for feedback control of fluid flows. We propose a partially nonlinear linear-system extraction autoencoder (pn-LEAE), which consists of convolutional neural networks-based autoencoder (CNN-AE) and a custom layer to extract a low-dimensional latent dynamics. This pn-LEAE basically extracts a linear dynamical system so that the modern control theory can easily be applied, but at the same time, it is designed to capture a nonlinear development of the latent dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the linear system extracted by the pn-LEAE, as well as the designed control law's effectiveness for a flow around a circular cylinder at the Reynolds number of ${\rm Re}_{D}=100$. This is the first attempt utilizing CNN-AE for linearization of fluid flows involving transient development to design a feedback control law.</description>

      <title>Density-Matrix Mean-Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean-field theories have proven to be efficient tools for exploring diverse phases of matter, complementing alternative methods that are more precise but also more computationally demanding. Conventional mean-field theories often fall short in capturing quantum fluctuations, which restricts their applicability to systems with significant quantum effects. In this article, we propose an improved mean-field theory, density-matrix mean-field theory (DMMFT). DMMFT constructs effective Hamiltonians, incorporating quantum environments shaped by entanglements, quantified by the reduced density matrices. Therefore, it offers a systematic and unbiased approach to account for the effects of fluctuations and entanglements in quantum ordered phases. As demonstrative examples, we show that DMMFT can not only quantitatively evaluate the renormalization of order parameters induced by quantum fluctuations, but can also detect the topological quantum phases. Additionally, we discuss the extensions of DMMFT for systems at finite temperatures and those with disorders. Our work provides an efficient approach to explore phases exhibiting unconventional quantum orders, which can be particularly beneficial for investigating frustrated spin systems in high spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>pyMSER -- An open-source library for automatic equilibration detection in molecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated molecular simulations are used extensively for predicting material properties. Typically, these simulations exhibit two regimes: a dynamic equilibration part, followed by a steady state. For extracting observable properties, the simulations must first reach a steady state so that thermodynamic averages can be taken. However, as equilibration depends on simulation conditions, predicting the optimal number of simulation steps a priori is impossible. Here, we demonstrate the application of the Marginal Standard Error Rule (MSER) for automatically identifying the optimal truncation point in Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. This novel automatic procedure determines the point in which steady state is reached, ensuring that figures-of-merits are extracted in an objective, accurate, and reproducible fashion. In the case of GCMC simulations of gas adsorption in metal-organic frameworks, we find that this methodology reduces the computational cost by up to 90%. As MSER statistics are independent of the simulation method that creates the data, this library is, in principle, applicable to any time series analysis in which equilibration truncation is required. The open-source Python implementation of our method, pyMSER, is publicly available for reuse and validation at https://github.com/IBM/pymser.</description>

      <title>Input gradient annealing neural network for solving low-temperature Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel yet simple deep learning approach, called input gradient annealing neural network (IGANN), for solving stationary Fokker-Planck equations. Traditional methods, such as finite difference and finite elements, suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Neural network based algorithms are meshless methods, which can avoid the curse of dimensionality. However, at low temperature, when directly solving a stationary Fokker-Planck equation with more than two metastable states in the generalized potential landscape, the small eigenvalue introduces numerical difficulties due to a large condition number. To overcome these problems, we introduce the IGANN method, which uses a penalty of negative input gradient annealing during the training. We demonstrate that the IGANN method can effectively solve high-dimensional and low-temperature Fokker-Planck equations through our numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Quantum Monte Carlo Algorithm for Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy in Spin Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum magic, or nonstabilizerness, provides a crucial characterization of quantum systems, regarding the classical simulability with stabilizer states. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient algorithm for computing stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, one of the measures for quantum magic, in spin systems with sign-problem free Hamiltonians. This algorithm is based on the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the path integral of the work between two partition function ensembles and it applies to all spatial dimensions and temperatures. We demonstrate this algorithm on the one and two dimensional transverse field Ising model at both finite and zero temperatures and show the quantitative agreements with tensor-network based algorithms. Furthermore, we analyze the computational cost and provide both analytical and numerical evidences for it to be polynomial in system size.</description>

      <title>Path-based packing of icosahedral shells into multi-component aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-component aggregates are being intensively researched in various fields because of their highly tunable properties and wide applications. Due to the complex configurational space of these systems, research would greatly benefit from a general theoretical framework for the prediction of stable structures, which, however, is largely incomplete at present. Here we propose a general theory for the construction of multi-component icosahedral structures by assembling concentric shells of different chiral and achiral types, consisting of particles of different sizes. By mapping shell sequences into paths in the hexagonal lattice, we establish simple and general rules for designing a wide variety of magic icosahedral structures, and we evaluate the optimal size-mismatch between particles in the different shells. The predictions of our design strategy are confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations for several multi-component atomic clusters and nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>PINNs-MPF: A Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework for Multi-Phase-Field Simulation of Interface Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to handle MultiPhase-Field simulations of microstructure evolution. It has been showcased that a combination of optimization techniques extended and adapted from the PINNs literature, and the introduction of specific techniques inspired by the MPF Method background, is required. The numerical resolution is realized through a multi-variable time-series problem by using fully discrete resolution. Within each interval, space, time, and phases are treated separately, constituting discrete subdomains. An extended multi-networking concept is implemented to subdivide the simulation domain into multiple batches, with each batch associated with an independent Neural Network trained to predict the solution. To ensure efficient interaction across different phasesand in the spatio-temporal-phasic subdomain, a Master NN handles efficient interaction among the multiple networks, as well as the transfer of learning in different directions. A set of systematic simulations with increasing complexity was performed, that benchmarks various critical aspects of MPF simulations, including different geometries, types of interface dynamics and the evolution of an interfacial triple junction. A comprehensive approach is adopted to specifically focus the attention on the interfacial regions through an automatic and dynamic meshing process, significantly simplifying the tuning of hyper-parameters and serving as a fundamental key for addressing MPF problems using Machine Learning. The pyramidal training approach is proposed to the PINN community as a dual-impact method: it facilitates the initialization of training and allows an extended transfer of learning. The proposed PINNs-MPF framework successfully reproduces benchmark tests with high fidelity and Mean Squared Error loss values ranging from 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-6}$ compared to ground truth solutions.</description>

      <title>Neuroevolution of Decentralized Decision-Making in N-Bead Swimmers Leads to Scalable and Robust Collective Locomotion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many microorganisms swim by performing larger non-reciprocal shape deformations that are initiated locally by molecular motors. However, it remains unclear how decentralized shape control determines the movement of the entire organism. Here, we investigate how efficient locomotion emerges from coordinated yet simple and decentralized decision-making of the body parts using neuroevolution techniques. Our approach allows us to investigate optimal locomotion policies for increasingly large microswimmer bodies, with emerging long-wavelength body shape deformations corresponding to surprisingly efficient swimming gaits. The obtained decentralized policies are robust and tolerant concerning morphological changes or defects and can be applied to artificial microswimmers for cargo transport or drug delivery applications without further optimization "out of the box". Our work is of relevance to understanding and developing robust navigation strategies of biological and artificial microswimmers and, in a broader context, for understanding emergent levels of individuality and the role of collective intelligence in Artificial Life.</description>

      <title>Predicting doping strategies for ternary nickel-cobalt-manganese cathode materials to enhance battery performance using graph neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exceptional electrochemical performance of lithium-ion batteries has spurred considerable interest in advanced battery technologies, particularly those utilizing ternary nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) cathode materials, which are renowned for their robust electrochemical performance and structural stability. Building upon this research, investigators have explored doping additional elements into NCM cathode materials to further enhance their electrochemical performance and structural integrity. However, the multitude of doping strategies available for NCM battery systems presents a challenge in determining the most effective approach. In this study, we elucidate the potential of ternary NCM systems as cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. We compile a comprehensive database of lithium-ion batteries employing NCM systems from various sources of prior research and develop a corresponding data-driven model utilizing graph neural networks to predict optimal doping strategies. Our aim is to provide insights into the NCM-based battery systems for both fundamental understanding and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Force-Guided Bridge Matching for Full-Atom Time-Coarsened Dynamics of Peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are irreplaceable and ubiquitous in fields of materials science, chemistry, pharmacology just to name a few. Conventional MD simulations are plagued by numerical stability as well as long equilibration time issues, which limits broader applications of MD simulations. Recently, a surge of deep learning approaches have been devised for time-coarsened dynamics, which learns the state transition mechanism over much larger time scales to overcome these limitations. However, only a few methods target the underlying Boltzmann distribution by resampling techniques, where proposals are rarely accepted as new states with low efficiency. In this work, we propose a force-guided bridge matching model, FBM, a novel framework that first incorporates physical priors into bridge matching for full-atom time-coarsened dynamics. With the guidance of our well-designed intermediate force field, FBM is feasible to target the Boltzmann-like distribution by direct inference without extra steps. Experiments on small peptides verify our superiority in terms of comprehensive metrics and demonstrate transferability to unseen peptide systems.</description>
