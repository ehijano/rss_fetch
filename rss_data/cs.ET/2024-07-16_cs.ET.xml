      <title>Power-Area Efficient Serial IMPLY-based 4:2 Compressor Applied in Data-Intensive Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The data transfer between a processor and memory has become a design bottleneck in data-intensive applications. Processing-In-Memory (PIM) is a practical approach to overcome the memory wall bottleneck. The 4:2 compressor is suitable for implementing the processor's crucial arithmetic circuits, including multiplier. Some area-efficient memristive structures, like Material Implication (IMPLY) in serial architecture, are compatible with the crossbar array. This paper proposes a serial memristive IMPLY-based 4:2 compressor, which is applied to present new 4-bit and 8-bit multipliers. The proposed circuits are evaluated regarding latency, area, and energy consumption. Compared to the existing serial compressor, the proposed 4:2 compressor's algorithm improves the area, energy consumption, and speed by 36%, 17%, and 15%, respectively. The proposed 4-bit and 8-bit multipliers are improved by 7.3% and 10%, respectively, regarding the latency, and reduced energy consumption by up to 12%, compared to the serial multiplier based on a 4:2 compressor with XOR/MUX design.</description>

      <title>Factors that Contribute to the Success of a Software Organisation's DevOps Environment: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research assesses the aspects of software organizations' DevOps environments and identifies the factors contributing to these environments' success. DevOps is a recent concept, and many organizations are moving from old-style software development methods to agile approaches such as DevOps. However, there is no comprehensive information on what factors impact the success of the DevOps environment once organizations adopt it. This research focused on addressing this gap through a systematic literature review. The systematic review consisted of 33 articles from five selected search systems and databases from 2015 to 2021. Based on the included articles, 15 factors were identified and grouped into four categories: Collaborative Culture, Organizational Aspects, Tooling and Technology, and Continuous Practices. In addition, this research proposes a DevOps environment success factors model to potentially contribute to DevOps research and practice. Recommendations are made for additional research on the effectiveness of the proposed model and its success factors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Reconstruction from Power Side-Channel Attacks on Quantum Computer Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interest in quantum computing has grown rapidly in recent years, and with it grows the importance of securing quantum circuits. A novel type of threat to quantum circuits that dedicated attackers could launch are power trace attacks. To address this threat, this paper presents first formalization and demonstration of using power traces to unlock and steal quantum circuit secrets. With access to power traces, attackers can recover information about the control pulses sent to quantum computers. From the control pulses, the gate level description of the circuits, and eventually the secret algorithms can be reverse engineered. This work demonstrates how and what information could be recovered. This work uses algebraic reconstruction from power traces to realize two new types of single trace attacks: per-channel and total power attacks. The former attack relies on per-channel measurements to perform a brute-force attack to reconstruct the quantum circuits. The latter attack performs a single-trace attack using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming optimization. Through the use of algebraic reconstruction, this work demonstrates that quantum circuit secrets can be stolen with high accuracy. Evaluation on 32 real benchmark quantum circuits shows that our technique is highly effective at reconstructing quantum circuits. The findings not only show the veracity of the potential attacks, but also the need to develop new means to protect quantum circuits from power trace attacks. Throughout this work real control pulse information from real quantum computers is used to demonstrate potential attacks based on simulation of collection of power traces.</description>

      <title>On when is Reservoir Computing with Cellular Automata Beneficial?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir Computing with Cellular Automata (ReCA) is a relatively novel and promising approach. It consists of 3 steps: an encoding scheme to inject the problem into the CA, the CA iterations step itself and a simple classifying step, typically a linear classifier. This paper demonstrates that the ReCA concept is effective even in arguably the simplest implementation of a ReCA system. However, we also report a failed attempt on the UCR Time Series Classification Archive where ReCA seems to work, but only because of the encoding scheme itself, not in any part due to the CA. This highlights the need for ablation testing, i.e., comparing internally with sub-parts of one model, but also raises an open question on what kind of tasks ReCA is best suited for.</description>

      <title>AI-Based Copyright Detection Of An Image In a Video Using Degree Of Similarity And Image Hashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expanse of information available over the internet makes it difficult to identify whether a specific work is a replica or a duplication of a protected work, especially if we talk about visual representations. Strategies are planned to identify the utilization of the copyrighted image in a report. Still, we want to resolve the issue of involving a copyrighted image in a video and a calculation that could recognize the degree of similarity of the copyrighted picture utilized in the video, even for the pieces of the video that are not featured a lot and in the end perform characterization errands on those edges. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are vital to address this problem. Numerous associations have been creating different calculations to screen the identification of copyrighted work. This work means concentrating on those calculations, recognizing designs inside the information, and fabricating a more reasonable model for copyrighted image classification and detection. We have used different algorithms like- Image Processing, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Image hashing, etc. Keywords- Copyright, Artificial Intelligence(AI), Copyrighted Image, Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), Image processing, Degree of similarity, Image Hashing.</description>

      <title>Towards Enabling 5G-NTN Satellite Communications for Manned and Unmanned Rotary Wing Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite Communications (SatCom) are a backbone of worldwide development. In contrast with the past, when the GEO satellites were the only means for such connectivity, nowadays the multi-orbital connectivity is emerging, especially with the use of satellite constellations. Simultaneously, SatCom enabled the so-called In-Flight Connectivity, while with the advent of 5G-NTN, the development of this market is being accelerated. However, there are still various missing points before such a technology becomes mainstream, especially in the case of Rotary Wing Aircraft (RWA). Indeed, due to their particular characteristics, such as the low altitude flights and the blade interference, there are still open challenges. In this work, an End-to-End (E2E) analysis for the performance of SatCom under 5G-NTN for manned and unmanned RWA is performed. Various scenarios are examined, and related requirements are shown. The effects of blades and other characteristics of the RWA are established, and simulations for these cases are developed. Results along with related discussion are presented, while future directions for development are suggested. This work is part of the ESA ACROSS-AIR project.</description>

      <title>Parallel Ising Annealer via Gradient-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising annealer is a promising quantum-inspired computing architecture for combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce an Ising annealer based on the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which updates the variables of all dimensions in parallel. The main innovation is the fusion of an approximate gradient-based approach into the Ising annealer which introduces significant acceleration and allows a portable and scalable implementation on the commercial FPGA. Comprehensive simulation and hardware experiments show that the proposed Ising annealer has promising performance and scalability on all types of benchmark problems when compared to other Ising annealers including the state-of-the-art hardware. In particular, we have built a prototype annealer which solves Ising problems of both integer and fraction coefficients with up to 200 spins on a single low-cost FPGA board, whose performance is demonstrated to be better than the state-of-the-art quantum hardware D-Wave 2000Q and similar to the expensive coherent Ising machine. The sub-linear scalability of the annealer signifies its potential in solving challenging combinatorial optimization problems and evaluating the advantage of quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>The Feasibility of a Smart Contract "Kill Switch"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of blockchain technology and its adoption across various sectors have raised critical discussions about the need for regulatory mechanisms to ensure consumer protection, maintain financial stability, and address privacy concerns without compromising the foundational principles of decentralization and immutability inherent in blockchain platforms. We examine the existing mechanisms for smart contract termination across several major blockchain platforms, including Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Cardano, Solana, Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, IOTA, Apotos, and Sui. We assess the compatibility of these mechanisms with the requirements of the EU Data Act, focusing on aspects such as consumer protection, error correction, and regulatory compliance. Our analysis reveals a diverse landscape of approaches, from immutable smart contracts with built-in termination conditions to upgradable smart contracts that allow for post-deployment modifications. We discuss the challenges associated with implementing the so-called smart contract "kill switches," such as the balance between enabling regulatory compliance and preserving the decentralized ethos, the technical feasibility of such mechanisms, and the implications for security and trust in the ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Network Quality-of-Service on Metaverse Virtual Reality User Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metaverse virtual reality (VR) applications enable users to socialise, work, entertain, and study online with immersive experiences beyond the classic PC-based interactions. While the 360-degree immersion enables users to be fully engaged in a virtual scenario, suboptimal Quality-of-Experience (QoE) like poorly displayed 3D graphics, disruptive loading time, or motion lagging caused by degraded network Quality-of-Service (QoS) can be perceived by users much worse (such as dizziness) than a monitor visualisation. This paper empirically measures user QoE of metaverse VR caused by network QoS. Specifically, by focusing on both public social hubs and private user-created events in three popular metaverse VR applications (Rec Room, VRChat and MultiverseVR), we first identify three metrics, including environment freeze level, peripheral content loading time, and control response time, that describe metaverse user experience. By tuning three network QoS parameters (bandwidth, latency, and packet loss), we benchmark each QoE metric's level from excellent to unplayable. Key insights are revealed, such as freeze of metaverse virtual environment is resilient to latency but sensitive to packet loss, and private user-created events demand better network conditions than public social hubs, providing a reference for ISPs to optimise their network QoS for superlative metaverse user experience.</description>

      <title>On the Efficacy of Surface Codes in Compensating for Radiation Events in Superconducting Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliability is fundamental for developing large-scale quantum computers. Since the benefit of technological advancements to the qubit's stability is saturating, algorithmic solutions, such as quantum error correction (QEC) codes, are needed to bridge the gap to reliable computation. Unfortunately, the deployment of the first quantum computers has identified faults induced by natural radiation as an additional threat to qubits reliability. The high sensitivity of qubits to radiation hinders the large-scale adoption of quantum computers, since the persistence and area-of-effect of the fault can potentially undermine the efficacy of the most advanced QEC.
  In this paper, we investigate the resilience of various implementations of state-of-the-art QEC codes to radiation-induced faults. We report data from over 400 million fault injections and correlate hardware faults with the logical error observed after decoding the code output, extrapolating physical-to-logical error rates. We compare the code's radiation-induced logical error rate over the code distance, the number and role in the QEC of physical qubits, the underlying quantum computer topology, and particle energy spread in the chip. We show that, by simply selecting and tuning properly the surface code, thus without introducing any overhead, the probability of correcting a radiation-induced fault is increased by up to 10\%. Finally, we provide indications and guidelines for the design of future QEC codes to further increase their effectiveness against radiation-induced events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12437v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital MemComputing machines (DMMs), which employ nonlinear dynamical systems with memory (time non-locality), have proven to be a robust and scalable unconventional computing approach for solving a wide variety of combinatorial optimization problems. However, most of the research so far has focused on the numerical simulations of the equations of motion of DMMs. This inevitably subjects time to discretization, which brings its own (numerical) issues that would be otherwise absent in actual physical systems operating in continuous time. Although hardware realizations of DMMs have been previously suggested, their implementation would require materials and devices that are not so easy to integrate with traditional electronics. Addressing this, our study introduces a novel hardware design for DMMs, utilizing readily available electronic components. This approach not only significantly boosts computational speed compared to current models but also exhibits remarkable robustness against additive noise. Crucially, it circumvents the limitations imposed by numerical noise, ensuring enhanced stability and reliability during extended operations. This paves a new path for tackling increasingly complex problems, leveraging the inherent advantages of DMMs in a more practical and accessible framework.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel quantum-inspired algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and some of its variations using tensor networks. This approach consists on the simulated initialization of a quantum system with superposition of all possible combinations, an imaginary time evolution, a projection, and lastly a partial trace to search for solutions. This is a heuristically approximable algorithm to obtain approximate solutions with a more affordable computational cost. We adapt it to different generalizations of the TSP and apply it to the job reassignment problem, a real productive industrial case.</description>

Abstract: SARComm is a novel wireless communication system that enables passive satellite backscatter connectivity using existing spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signals. We demonstrate that SAR signals from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 satellite, used to image Earth's terrain, can be leveraged to enable low-power ground-to-satellite communication. This paper presents the first cooperative, on-the-ground target that modulates SAR backscatter to send information bits and analyzes how to extract them from publicly available Sentinel-1 datasets. To demonstrate the system, we evaluate the effectiveness of modulating the radar cross section of corner reflectors both mechanically and electronically to encode data bits, develop a deployment algorithm to optimize corner reflector placement, and present a SAR processing pipeline to enable communication.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Evolution for Sustainable Smart Ecosystems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smart ecosystems are the drivers of modern society. They control infrastructures of socio-techno-economic importance, ensuring their stable and sustainable operation. Smart ecosystems are governed by digital twins -- real-time virtual representations of physical infrastructure. To support the open-ended and reactive traits of smart ecosystems, digital twins need to be able to evolve in reaction to changing conditions. However, digital twin evolution is challenged by the intertwined nature of physical and software components, and their individual evolution. As a consequence, software practitioners find a substantial body of knowledge on software evolution hard to apply in digital twin evolution scenarios and a lack of knowledge on the digital twin evolution itself. The aim of this paper, consequently, is to provide software practitioners with tangible leads toward understanding and managing the evolutionary concerns of digital twins. We use four distinct digital twin evolution scenarios, contextualized in a citizen energy community case to illustrate the usage of the 7R taxonomy of digital twin evolution. By that, we aim to bridge a significant gap in leveraging software engineering practices to develop robust smart ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Toward Practical Benchmarks of Ising Machines: A Case Study on the Quadratic Knapsack Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization has wide applications from industry to natural science. Ising machines bring an emerging computing paradigm for efficiently solving a combinatorial optimization problem by searching a ground state of a given Ising model. Current cutting-edge Ising machines achieve fast sampling of near-optimal solutions of the max-cut problem. However, for problems with additional constraint conditions, their advantages have been hardly shown due to difficulties in handling the constraints. In this work, we focus on benchmarks of Ising machines on the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP). To bring out their practical performance, we propose fast two-stage post-processing for Ising machines, which makes handling the constraint easier. Simulation based on simulated annealing shows that the proposed method substantially improves the solving performance of Ising machines and the improvement is robust to a choice of encoding of the constraint condition. Through evaluation using an Ising machine called Amplify Annealing Engine, the proposed method is shown to dramatically improve its solving performance on the QKP. These results are a crucial step toward showing advantages of Ising machines on practical problems involving various constraint conditions.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) amalgamates quantum computing paradigms with machine learning models, providing significant prospects for solving complex problems. However, with the expansion of numerous third-party vendors in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era of quantum computing, the security of QML models is of prime importance, particularly against reverse engineering, which could expose trained parameters and algorithms of the models. We assume the untrusted quantum cloud provider is an adversary having white-box access to the transpiled user-designed trained QML model during inference. Reverse engineering (RE) to extract the pre-transpiled QML circuit will enable re-transpilation and usage of the model for various hardware with completely different native gate sets and even different qubit technology. Such flexibility may not be obtained from the transpiled circuit which is tied to a particular hardware and qubit technology. The information about the number of parameters, and optimized values can allow further training of the QML model to alter the QML model, tamper with the watermark, and/or embed their own watermark or refine the model for other purposes. In this first effort to investigate the RE of QML circuits, we perform RE and compare the training accuracy of original and reverse-engineered Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) of various sizes. We note that multi-qubit classifiers can be reverse-engineered under specific conditions with a mean error of order 1e-2 in a reasonable time. We also propose adding dummy fixed parametric gates in the QML models to increase the RE overhead for defense. For instance, adding 2 dummy qubits and 2 layers increases the overhead by ~1.76 times for a classifier with 2 qubits and 3 layers with a performance overhead of less than 9%. We note that RE is a very powerful attack model which warrants further efforts on defenses.</description>

      <title>What Do People Think about Sentient AI?</title>

Abstract: With rapid advances in machine learning, many people in the field have been discussing the rise of digital minds and the possibility of artificial sentience. Future developments in AI capabilities and safety will depend on public opinion and human-AI interaction. To begin to fill this research gap, we present the first nationally representative survey data on the topic of sentient AI: initial results from the Artificial Intelligence, Morality, and Sentience (AIMS) survey, a preregistered and longitudinal study of U.S. public opinion that began in 2021. Across one wave of data collection in 2021 and two in 2023 (total N = 3,500), we found mind perception and moral concern for AI well-being in 2021 were higher than predicted and significantly increased in 2023: for example, 71% agree sentient AI deserve to be treated with respect, and 38% support legal rights. People have become more threatened by AI, and there is widespread opposition to new technologies: 63% support a ban on smarter-than-human AI, and 69% support a ban on sentient AI. Expected timelines are surprisingly short and shortening with a median forecast of sentient AI in only five years and artificial general intelligence in only two years. We argue that, whether or not AIs become sentient, the discussion itself may overhaul human-computer interaction and shape the future trajectory of AI technologies, including existential risks and opportunities.</description>
