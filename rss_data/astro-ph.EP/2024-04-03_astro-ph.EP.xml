      <title>Polarimetric differential imaging with VLT/NACO. A comprehensive PDI pipeline for NACO data (PIPPIN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed diversity of exoplanets can possibly be traced back to the planet formation processes. Planet-disk interactions induce sub-structures in the circumstellar disk that can be revealed via scattered light observations. However, a high-contrast imaging technique such as polarimetric differential imaging (PDI) must first be applied to suppress the stellar diffraction halo. In this work we present the PDI PiPelIne for NACO data (PIPPIN), which reduces the archival polarimetric observations made with the NACO instrument at the Very Large Telescope. Prior to this work, such a comprehensive pipeline to reduce polarimetric NACO data did not exist. We identify a total of 243 datasets of 57 potentially young stellar objects observed before NACO's decommissioning. The PIPPIN pipeline applies various levels of instrumental polarisation correction and is capable of reducing multiple observing setups, including half-wave plate or de-rotator usage and wire-grid observations. A novel template-matching method is applied to assess the detection significance of polarised signals in the reduced data. In 22 of the 57 observed targets, we detect polarised light resulting from a scattering of circumstellar dust. The detections exhibit a collection of known sub-structures, including rings, gaps, spirals, shadows, and in- or outflows of material. Since NACO was equipped with a near-infrared wavefront sensor, it made unique polarimetric observations of a number of embedded protostars. This is the first time detections of the Class I objects Elia 2-21 and YLW 16A have been published. Alongside the outlined PIPPIN pipeline, we publish an archive of the reduced data products, thereby improving the accessibility of these data for future studies.</description>

      <title>A recipe for eccentricity and inclination damping for partial gap opening planets in 3D disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper we showed that, like the migration speed, the eccentricity damping efficiency is modulated linearly by the depth of the partial gap a planet carves in the disk surface density profile, resulting in less efficient $e$-damping compared to the prescription commonly used in population synthesis works. Here, we extend our analysis to 3D, refining our $e$-damping formula and studying how the inclination damping efficiency is also affected. We perform high resolution 3D locally isothermal hydrodynamical simulations of planets with varying masses embedded in disks with varying aspect ratios and viscosities. We extract the gap profile and orbital damping timescales for fixed eccentricities and inclinations up to the disk scale height. The limit in gap depths below which vortices appear, in the low-viscosity case, happens roughly at the transition between classical type-I and type-II migration regimes. The orbital damping timescales can be described by two linear trends with a break around gap depths $\sim80\%$ and with slopes and intercepts depending on the eccentricity and inclination. These trends are understood on physical grounds and are reproduced by simple fitting formulas whose error is within the typically uncertainty of type-I torque formulas. Thus, our recipes for the gap depth and orbital damping efficiencies yield a simple description for planet-disk interactions to use in N-body codes in the case of partial gap opening planets that is consistent with high-resolution 3D hydro-simulations. Finally, we show examples of how our novel orbital damping prescription can affect the outcome of population synthesis experiments.</description>

      <title>NLTE modelling of water-rich exoplanet atmospheres. Cooling and heating rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrogen and water molecules respond very differently to the collisional-radiative processes taking place in planetary atmospheres. Naturally, the question arises whether H2O-rich atmospheres are more (or less) resilient to long-term mass loss than H2-dominated ones if they radiate away the incident stellar energy more (or less) efficiently. If confirmed, the finding would have implications on our understanding of the evolution of sub-Neptune exoplanets. As a key step towards answering this question, we present a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model of H2O for the atmospheric region where the gas accelerates to escape the planet and conditions relevant to close-in sub-Neptunes. Our exploratory calculations for isothermal gas composed of H2, H2O and e- reveal that: 1) In the pressure region ~1e-2 - 1e-4 dyn cm-2 where the stellar extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) photons are typically deposited in the atmosphere, H2O is in rotational LTE but vibrational NLTE. Vibrational LTE is facilitated by high H2O abundances and fractional ionizations, and we report critical densities for the LTE-NLTE transition; 2) Vibrational cooling may locally dominate over rotational cooling, partly because of the comparatively small opacities of ro-vibrational lines; 3) Even low H2O abundances notably enhance the cooling, foreseeably offsetting some of the stellar heating; 4) Heating due to the deposition of stellar infrared (IR) photons is significant at pressures &gt;=0.1 dyn cm-2. We estimate the contribution of H2O excitation to the internal energy of the gas and speculate on the photodissociation from the excited vibrational states. Ultimately, our findings motivate the consideration of NLTE in the mass loss rate calculations of H2O-rich atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Data availability and requirements relevant for the Ariel space mission and other exoplanet atmosphere applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this white paper is to provide a snapshot of the data availability and data needs primarily for the Ariel space mission, but also for related atmospheric studies of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. It covers the following data-related topics: molecular and atomic line lists, line profiles, computed cross-sections and opacities, collision-induced absorption and other continuum data, optical properties of aerosols and surfaces, atmospheric chemistry, UV photodissociation and photoabsorption cross-sections, and standards in the description and format of such data. These data aspects are discussed by addressing the following questions for each topic, based on the experience of the "data-provider" and "data-user" communities: (1) what are the types and sources of currently available data, (2) what work is currently in progress, and (3) what are the current and anticipated data needs. We present a GitHub platform for Ariel-related data, with the goal to provide a go-to place for both data-users and data-providers, for the users to make requests for their data needs and for the data-providers to link to their available data. Our aim throughout the paper is to provide practical information on existing sources of data whether in databases, theoretical, or literature sources.</description>

      <title>Measuring White Dwarf Variability from Sparsely Sampled Gaia DR3 Multi-Epoch Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarf stars are ubiquitous in the Galaxy, and are essential to understanding stellar evolution. While most white dwarfs are photometrically stable and reliable flux standards, some can be highly variable, which can reveal unique details about the endpoints of low-mass stellar evolution. In this study we characterize a sample of high-confidence white dwarfs with multi-epoch photometry from Gaia Data Release 3. We compare these Gaia light curves with light curves from the Zwicky Transiting Facility and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to see when Gaia data independently can accurately measure periods of variability. From this sample, 105 objects have variability periods measured from the Gaia light curves independently, with periods as long as roughly 9.5 d and as short as 256.2 s (roughly 4 min), including seven systems with periods shorter than 1000 s. We discover 86 new objects from the 105 target sample, including pulsating, spotted, and binary white dwarfs, and even a new 68.4 min eclipsing cataclysmic variable. The median amplitude of the absolute photometric variability we confirm from Gaia independently is 1.4%, demonstrating that Gaia epoch photometry is capable of measuring short-term periods even when observations are sparse.</description>

      <title>Signals for invisible matter from solar-terrestrial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The composition of the dark universe although hypothesised, remains one of the biggest mysteries in modern physics. On smaller scales, there are various solar puzzling phenomena which known physics cannot explain like the coronal heating problem, the origin of sunspots, the trigger mechanism of solar flares, but also the open issue since the 1850's on the planetary impact of the active Sun. At the same time, several terrestrial observations in the dynamic Earth's atmosphere such as the ionospheric ionisation around December are unexpected within conventional physics. Following this work, the suggested common solution of all these conventionally unexplained phenomena is based on an external triggering caused by low-speed streaming constituents from the dark sector, being gravitationally focused or deflected by the Sun and the orbiting planets. Evidence in support of this hypothesis and on the existence of one or more streams or clusters has been provided based on a coincidence analysis of long-term astrophysical and planetary datasets. Of note, the planetary correlation is the novel key signature. Finally, a redefined strategy for direct Dark Matter searches focused on streaming Dark Matter is proposed. This novel procedure has been successfully implemented in the CAST-CAPP detector at CERN searching for Dark Matter axions.</description>

      <title>Full orbital solutions in pre-main sequence high-order multiple systems: GG Tau Ab and UX Tau B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-order multiple (triple and beyond) systems are relatively common. Their interaction with circumstellar and circumbinary material can have a large impact on the formation and evolution of planetary systems and depends on their orbital properties. GG\,Tau and UX\,Tau are two pre-main sequence high-order multiple systems in which the tightest pair has a projected separation of $\approx5$--20\,au. Characterizing precisely their orbits is crucial to establish their long-term stability, to predict the dynamics and evolution of circumstellar matter, and to evaluate the potential for planet formation in such systems. We combine existing astrometric measurements with previously unpublished high-resolution observations of the GG\,Tau\,Ab and UX\,Tau\,B pairs and perform Keplerian orbital fits. For GG\,Tau\,Ab the data presented here represent the first detection of orbital motion. For both systems they yield dramatic increases in orbital coverage ($\gtrsim60\%$ and $\approx100\%$ for UX\,Tau\,B and GG\,Tau\,Ab, for orbital periods of $\approx32$ and $\approx8$\,yr, respectively) and allow us to obtain well-constrained orbital fits, including dynamical masses with $\lesssim10\%$ and $\lesssim7\%$ random and systematic uncertainties. We find that both GG\,Tau\,A and UX\,Tau\,A--B likely form stable hierarchical systems, although one possible deprojection solution for GG\,Tau is strongly misaligned and could experience von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations. We further find that the UX\,Tau\,B orbit is much more eccentric than the GG\,Tau\,Ab one, possibly explaining the lack of circumstellar material in the former. The newly-determined orbits revive the question of the dynamical fate of gas and dust in these two hierarchical systems and should spur new dedicated simulations to assess the long-term evolution of the systems and the dynamical perturbations imposed by the close binaries they host.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Legacy survey of Class 0/I disks in Corona australis, Aquila, chaMaeleon, oPhiuchus north, Ophiuchus, Serpens (CAMPOS). I. Evolution of Protostellar disk radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We surveyed nearly all the embedded protostars in seven nearby clouds (Corona Australis, Aquila, Chamaeleon I &amp; II, Ophiuchus North, Ophiuchus, Serpens) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at 1.3mm observations with a resolution of 0.1". This survey detected 184 protostellar disks, 90 of which were observed at a resolution of 14-18 au, making it one of the most comprehensive high-resolution disk samples across various protostellar evolutionary stages to date. Our key findings include the detection of new annular substructures in two Class I and two Flat-spectrum sources, while 21 embedded protostars exhibit distinct asymmetries or substructures in their disks. We find that protostellar disks have a substantially large variability in their radii across all classes. In particular, the fraction of large disks with sizes above 40 au decreases with the protostellar evolutionary stage. Compiling the literature data, we discovered an increasing trend of the gas disk radii to dust disk radii ratio ($R_{\rm gas,Kep}/R_{\rm mm}$) with increasing bolometric temperature (${\rm T}_{\rm bol}$). Our results indicate that the dust and gas disk radii decouple during the early Class I stage. We find that Class 0 dust disk size resembled the gas disk size, enabling a direct comparison between models and observational data at the earliest stages of protostellar evolution. We show that the distribution of radii in the 52 Class 0 disks in our sample is in high tension with various disk formation models, indicating that protostellar disk formation remains an unsolved question.</description>
