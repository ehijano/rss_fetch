      <title>FinReflectKG -- MultiHop: Financial QA Benchmark for Reasoning with Knowledge Graph Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-hop reasoning over financial disclosures is often a retrieval problem before it becomes a reasoning or generation problem: relevant facts are dispersed across sections, filings, companies, and years, and LLMs often expend excessive tokens navigating noisy context. Without precise Knowledge Graph (KG)-guided selection of relevant context, even strong reasoning models either fail to answer or consume excessive tokens, whereas KG-linked evidence enables models to focus their reasoning on composing already retrieved facts. We present FinReflectKG - MultiHop, a benchmark built on FinReflectKG, a temporally indexed financial KG that links audited triples to source chunks from S&amp;P 100 filings (2022-2024). Mining frequent 2-3 hop subgraph patterns across sectors (via GICS taxonomy), we generate financial analyst style questions with exact supporting evidence from the KG. A two-phase pipeline first creates QA pairs via pattern-specific prompts, followed by a multi-criteria quality control evaluation to ensure QA validity. We then evaluate three controlled retrieval scenarios: (S1) precise KG-linked paths; (S2) text-only page windows centered on relevant text spans; and (S3) relevant page windows with randomizations and distractors. Across both reasoning and non-reasoning models, KG-guided precise retrieval yields substantial gains on the FinReflectKG - MultiHop QA benchmark dataset, boosting correctness scores by approximately 24 percent while reducing token utilization by approximately 84.5 percent compared to the page window setting, which reflects the traditional vector retrieval paradigm. Spanning intra-document, inter-year, and cross-company scopes, our work underscores the pivotal role of knowledge graphs in efficiently connecting evidence for multi-hop financial QA. We also release a curated subset of the benchmark (555 QA Pairs) to catalyze further research.</description>

      <title>Joint Bidding on Intraday and Frequency Containment Reserve Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As renewable energy integration increases supply variability, battery energy storage systems (BESS) present a viable solution for balancing supply and demand. This paper proposes a novel approach for optimizing battery BESS participation in multiple electricity markets. We develop a joint bidding strategy that combines participation in the primary frequency reserve market with continuous trading in the intraday market, addressing a gap in the extant literature which typically considers these markets in isolation or simplifies the continuous nature of intraday trading. Our approach utilizes a mixed integer linear programming implementation of the rolling intrinsic algorithm for intraday decisions and state of charge recovery, alongside a learned classifier strategy (LCS) that determines optimal capacity allocation between markets. A comprehensive out-of-sample backtest over more than one year of historical German market data validates our approach: The LCS increases overall profits by over 4% compared to the best-performing static strategy and by more than 3% over a naive dynamic benchmark. Crucially, our method closes the gap to a theoretical perfect foresight strategy to just 4%, demonstrating the effectiveness of dynamic, learning-based allocation in a complex, multi-market environment.</description>

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of VaR Models: Historical Simulation, GARCH-Based Monte Carlo, and Filtered Historical Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report presents a comprehensive evaluation of three Value-at-Risk (VaR) modeling approaches: Historical Simulation (HS), GARCH with Normal approximation (GARCH-N), and GARCH with Filtered Historical Simulation (FHS), using both in-sample and multi-day forecasting frameworks. We compute daily 5 percent VaR estimates using each method and assess their accuracy via empirical breach frequencies and visual breach indicators. Our findings reveal severe miscalibration in the HS and GARCH-N models, with empirical breach rates far exceeding theoretical levels. In contrast, the FHS method consistently aligns with theoretical expectations and exhibits desirable statistical and visual behavior. We further simulate 5-day cumulative returns under both GARCH-N and GARCH-FHS frameworks to compute multi-period VaR and Expected Shortfall. Results show that GARCH-N underestimates tail risk due to its reliance on the Gaussian assumption, whereas GARCH-FHS provides more robust and conservative tail estimates. Overall, the study demonstrates that the GARCH-FHS model offers superior performance in capturing fat-tailed risks and provides more reliable short-term risk forecasts.</description>

      <title>Joint Stochastic Optimal Control and Stopping in Aquaculture: Finite-Difference and PINN-Based Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a joint stochastic optimal control and stopping (JCtrlOS) problem motivated by aquaculture operations, where the objective is to maximize farm profit through an optimal feeding strategy and harvesting time under stochastic price dynamics. We introduce a simplified aquaculture model capturing essential biological and economic features, distinguishing between biologically optimal and economically optimal feeding strategies. The problem is formulated as a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman variational inequality and corresponding free boundary problem. We develop two numerical solution approaches: First, a finite difference scheme that serves as a benchmark, and second, a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)-based method, combined with a deep optimal stopping (DeepOS) algorithm to improve stopping time accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate that while finite differences perform well in medium-dimensional settings, the PINN approach achieves comparable accuracy and is more scalable to higher dimensions where grid-based methods become infeasible. The results confirm that jointly optimizing feeding and harvesting decisions outperforms strategies that neglect either control or stopping.</description>

      <title>Efficient and accurate simulation of the stochastic-alpha-beta-rho model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an efficient, accurate and reliable simulation scheme for the stochastic-alpha-beta-rho (SABR) model. The two challenges of the SABR simulation lie in sampling (i) integrated variance conditional on terminal volatility and (ii) terminal forward price conditional on terminal volatility and integrated variance. For the first sampling procedure, we sample the conditional integrated variance using the moment-matched shifted lognormal approximation. For the second sampling procedure, we approximate the conditional terminal forward price as a constant-elasticity-of-variance (CEV) distribution. Our CEV approximation preserves the martingale condition and precludes arbitrage, which is a key advantage over Islah's approximation used in most SABR simulation schemes in the literature. We then adopt the exact sampling method of the CEV distribution based on the shifted-Poisson mixture Gamma random variable. Our enhanced procedures avoid the tedious Laplace inversion algorithm for sampling integrated variance and non-efficient inverse transform sampling of the forward price in some of the earlier simulation schemes. Numerical results demonstrate our simulation scheme to be highly efficient, accurate, and reliable.</description>

      <title>MarketSenseAI 2.0: Enhancing Stock Analysis through LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MarketSenseAI is a novel framework for holistic stock analysis which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to process financial news, historical prices, company fundamentals and the macroeconomic environment to support decision making in stock analysis and selection. In this paper, we present the latest advancements on MarketSenseAI, driven by rapid technological expansion in LLMs. Through a novel architecture combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation and LLM agents, the framework processes SEC filings and earnings calls, while enriching macroeconomic analysis through systematic processing of diverse institutional reports. We demonstrate a significant improvement in fundamental analysis accuracy over the previous version. Empirical evaluation on S\&amp;P 100 stocks over two years (2023-2024) shows MarketSenseAI achieving cumulative returns of 125.9% compared to the index return of 73.5%, while maintaining comparable risk profiles. Further validation on S\&amp;P 500 stocks during 2024 demonstrates the framework's scalability, delivering a 33.8% higher Sortino ratio than the market. This work marks a significant advancement in applying LLM technology to financial analysis, offering insights into the robustness of LLM-driven investment strategies.</description>
