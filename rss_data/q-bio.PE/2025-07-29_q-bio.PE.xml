      <title>Metrics for classes of semi-binary phylogenetic networks using $\mu$-representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are useful in representing the evolutionary history of taxa. In certain scenarios, one requires a way to compare different networks. In practice, this can be rather difficult, except within specific classes of networks. In this paper, we derive metrics for the class of \emph{orchard networks} and the class of \emph{strongly reticulation-visible} networks, from variants of so-called \emph{$\mu$-representations}, which are vector representations of networks. For both network classes, we impose degree constraints on the vertices, by considering \emph{semi-binary} networks.</description>

      <title>Metaconcepts of rooted tree balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measures of tree balance play an important role in many different research areas such as mathematical phylogenetics or theoretical computer science. Typically, tree balance is quantified by a single number which is assigned to the tree by a balance or imbalance index, of which several exist in the literature. Most of these indices are based on structural aspects of tree shape, such as clade sizes or leaf depths. For instance, indices like the Sackin index, total cophenetic index, and $\widehat{s}$-shape statistic all quantify tree balance through clade sizes, albeit with different definitions and properties.
  In this paper, we formalize the idea that many tree (im)balance indices are functions of similar underlying tree shape characteristics by introducing metaconcepts of tree balance. A metaconcept is a function $\Phi_f$ that depends on a function $f$ capturing some aspect of tree shape, such as balance values, clade sizes, or leaf depths. These metaconcepts encompass existing indices but also provide new means of measuring tree balance. The versatility and generality of metaconcepts allow for the systematic study of entire families of (im)balance indices, providing deeper insights that extend beyond index-by-index analysis.</description>
