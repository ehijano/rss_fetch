      <title>A Review of Electromagnetic Elimination Methods for low-field portable MRI scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of both conventional and deep learning methods for eliminating electromagnetic interference (EMI) in MRI systems. We explore the underlying principles and implementation of traditional analytical and adaptive EMI elimination techniques, as well as cutting-edge deep learning approaches. Through a detailed comparison, the strengths and limitations of each method are highlighted. Recent advancements in active EMI elimination utilizing multiple external EMI receiver coils and analytical techniques are discussed alongside the superior performance of deep learning methods, which leverage neural networks trained on extensive MRI data. While deep learning methods demonstrate significant improvements in EMI suppression, enhancing diagnostic capabilities and accessibility of MRI technology, they also introduce potential security and safety concerns, especially in production and commercial applications. This study underscores the need to address these challenges to fully realize the benefits of deep learning in EMI elimination. The findings suggest a balanced approach, combining the reliability of conventional methods with the advanced capabilities of deep learning, to develop more robust and effective EMI suppression strategies in MRI systems.</description>

      <title>SideEye: A Side-Looking Catheter for Fenestrated Endovascular Aneurysm Repair Procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair remains a technically challenging procedure in the presence of complex anatomy, as it increases the difficulty of target vessel cannulation and prolongs procedure time and fluoroscopy radiation exposure. This paper aims to design, develop, and assess a novel steerable catheter, the SideEye, and compare its performance with conventional catheters in a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm phantom model. Users were asked to perform target vessel cannulation under fluoroscopic guidance using the SideEye and conventional non-steerable and steerable catheters. The experiment was divided into two cases based on the stent graft orientation (aligned and misaligned). Total procedure times, individual target vessel cannulation times, and exposure times were analyzed and compared in each case. In the misaligned case, the average cannulation times of all target vessels were $703 \pm 274$ s using the non-steerable catheter, $517 \pm 309$ s using the steerable catheter, and $199 \pm 91.0$ s using the SideEye. The average exposure times were $12 \pm 4.6$ min using the non-steerable catheter, $8.6 \pm 4.1$ min using the steerable catheter, and $3.0 \pm 1.1$ min using the SideEye. Target vessel cannulation using the SideEye significantly reduced procedure time and overall exposure time, compared to conventional devices.</description>

      <title>Diagnosis Assistant for Liver Cancer Utilizing a Large Language Model with Three Types of Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liver cancer has a high incidence rate, but primary healthcare settings often lack experienced doctors. Advances in large models and AI technologies offer potential assistance. This work aims to address limitations in liver cancer diagnosis models, such as poor understanding of medical images, insufficient consideration of liver blood vessels, and ensuring accurate medical information. We propose a specialized diagnostic assistant to improve the diagnostic capabilities of less experienced doctors. Our framework combines large and small models, using optimized small models for precise patient image perception. Specifically, a segmentation network iteratively removes ambiguous pixels for liver tumor segmentation, and a multi-scale, multi-level differential network segments liver vessels. Features from these segmentations and medical records form a patient's personalized knowledge base. For diagnosis, Chain of Thought (COT) technology designs prompts mimicking experienced doctors' thought patterns, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology provides answers based on reliable domain knowledge and trusted cases. Our small model methods improve liver tumor and vessel segmentation performance, resulting in more accurate information extraction. The large model component scores over 1 point higher on a 10-point scale in evaluations by doctors compared to control methods. Our method enhances semantic perception of medical images, improves classification of ambiguous pixels, and optimizes small object perception. It considers blood vessel positions for specific treatments and improves response credibility and interpretability by mimicking experienced doctors' thought processes using reliable resources. This approach has been recognized by doctors and benefits liver cancer auxiliary diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Data-driven imaging geometric recovery of ultrahigh resolution robotic micro-CT for in-vivo and other applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an ultrahigh-resolution (50\mu m\) robotic micro-CT design for localized imaging of carotid plaques using robotic arms, cutting-edge detector, and machine learning technologies. To combat geometric error-induced artifacts in interior CT scans, we propose a data-driven geometry estimation method that maximizes the consistency between projection data and the reprojection counterparts of a reconstructed volume. Particularly, we use a normalized cross correlation metric to overcome the projection truncation effect. Our approach is validated on a robotic CT scan of a sacrificed mouse and a micro-CT phantom scan, both producing sharper images with finer details than that prior correction.</description>

      <title>In vivo and in vitro study of resorbable magnesium wires for medical implants: Mg purity, surface quality, Zn alloying and polymer coating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnesium is an excellent material in terms of biocompatibility and its corrosion products can serve as an active source for new bone formation. However, localized corrosion and H2 generation limit the potential of Mg-based implants. Utilizing low-alloyed Mg-Zn wires can strongly reduce problems with large H2 bubbles and improve the mechanical properties considerably while maintaining excellent long-term biocompatibility. Acidic pickling and a polymer coating can be effectively used to lower the rate of in vivo degradation. In this work, microstructural, mechanical, and in vitro characterization of 250 um and 300 um extruded wires made from ultra-pure Mg, commercially pure Mg, Mg-0.15Zn, Mg-0.4Zn and Mg-1Zn was performed. Additionally, Mg-0.4Zn wires together with a variant coated with a copolymer of L-lactide and {\epsilon}-caprolactone were tested in vivo on artificially damaged Wistar rat femurs. Based on the observed Mg-induced osteogenesis, polymer-coated Mg wires with a small addition of Zn are a perspective material for bone-support applications, such as cerclage and fixation wires.</description>

      <title>Fast 3D 31P B1+ mapping with a weighted stack of spiral trajectory at 7 Tesla</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (31P MRS) enables non-invasive assessment of energy metabolism, yet its application is hindered by sensitivity limitations. To overcome this, often high magnetic fields are used, leading to challenges such as spatial B_1^+ inhomogeneity and therefore the need for accurate flip angle determination in accelerated acquisitions with short repetition times (T_R). In response to these challenges, we propose a novel short T_R and look-up table-based Double-Angle Method for fast 3D 31P B_1^+ mapping (fDAM). Methods: Our method incorporates 3D weighted stack of spiral gradient echo acquisitions and a frequency-selective pulse to enable efficient B_1^+ mapping based on the phosphocreatine signal at 7T. Protocols were optimised using simulations and validated through phantom experiments. The method was validated in phantom experiments and skeletal muscle applications using a birdcage 1H/31P volume coil. Results: The results of fDAM were compared to the classical DAM (cDAM). A good correlation (r=0.94) was obtained between the two B_1^+ maps. A 3D 31P B_1^+ mapping in the human calf muscle was achieved in about 10 min using a birdcage volume coil, with a 20% extended coverage relative to that of the cDAM (24 min). fDAM also enabled the first full brain coverage 31P 3D B_1^+ mapping in approx. 10 min using a 1 Tx/ 32 Rx coil. Conclusion: fDAM is an efficient method for 31P 3D B_1^+ mapping, showing promise for future applications in rapid 31P MRSI.</description>

      <title>On the mechanics of inhaled bronchial transmission of pathogenic microdroplets generated from the upper respiratory tract, with implications for infection onset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Could the microdroplets formed by viscoelastic stretching and break-up of mucosal liquids in the upper respiratory tract (URT), when inhaled further downwind, explain the brisk pace at which deep lung infections emerge following onset of initial infection at the URT? While it is well-established that particulates inhaled from outside can possibly penetrate to the lower airway only if they are &lt; 5 microns, the fate of particulates (many &gt; 5-microns in diameter) sheared away from the intra-URT mucosa during inhalation remains an open question. These particulates predominantly originate at the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngeal chamber with the vocal folds. To resolve the posed question, this study considers a CT-based 3D anatomical airway reconstruction and isolates the tract from the laryngeal vocal fold region, mapping the entire tracheal cavity and concluding at generation 2 of the tracheobronchial tree. Through the delineated geometry, airflow simulation is conducted using the LES scheme to replicate relaxed inhalation at 15 L/min. Against the ambient air flux, numerical experiments have been performed to monitor the transport of liquid particulates with diameters 1-30 microns, bearing physical properties akin to aerosolized mucus with embedded virions. The full-scale numerical transmission trends to the lower airway were found consistent with the findings from a reduced-order mathematical model that conceptualized the impact of intra-airway vortex instabilities on local particle transport through point vortex idealization in an anatomy-guided 2D potential flow domain. The results collectively demonstrate markedly elevated trends of deep lung penetration by the URT-derived particulates, even if they are as large as 10- and 15 microns. The high viral load carried by such droplets to the bronchial spaces could mechanistically explain the accelerated seeding of infection in the lungs.</description>
