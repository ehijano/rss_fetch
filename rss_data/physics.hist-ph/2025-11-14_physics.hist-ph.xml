      <title>We Have Never Been Sophisticated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many philosophers of physics maintain that a physical theory that exhibits (certain kinds of) symmetries is flawed, on the grounds that such theories posit "excess structure". In an influential paper, Dewar [2019, "Sophistication about Symmetries", \emph{Brit. J. Phil. Sci.} \textbf{70}: 485-521] introduces a distinction between "reduction" and "sophistication" as alternative ways of removing excess structure. In this paper we re-examine the distinction as Dewar draws it, and we argue that there is no physically or philosophically important distinction between what Dewar calls "reduction" and what he calls "internal sophistication". We then argue that there are multiple notions of "reduction" in the literature that ought to be distinguished, both in motivation and in outcome.</description>

      <title>Zeno's paradox and black hole information loss problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a conceptual parallel between the black hole information problem and Zeno's paradox, highlighting the role of limiting procedures that turn formally infinite constructions into finite physical observables. Building on the replica--wormhole paradigm, we move beyond unitarity restoration to formulate a quantitative notion of irreversibility in Hawking radiation. Our main result is a modular thermodynamic framework for black-hole evaporation, in which modular entropy, entanglement capacity, and relative entropy assume thermodynamic roles. The monotonicity of relative entropy furnishes a generalized second law that determines the arrow of evolution in replica space. We further resolve the apparent tension between the replica method and the quantum no-cloning theorem by interpreting replicas as ensemble representations rather than physical copies of an unknown state, thereby clarifying the operational meaning of gravitational path integrals. A key message of this work is that non-additivity in Tsallis statistics provides an information-theoretic analogue of the correlations induced by replica wormholes.</description>

      <title>From Heisenberg and Schr\"odinger to the P vs. NP Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This essay offers an epistemological reinterpretation of the foundational divide between matrix mechanics and wave mechanics. Though formally equivalent, the two theories embody distinct modes of knowing: procedural construction and recognitional verification. These epistemic architectures anticipate, in philosophical form, the logical asymmetry expressed by the P versus NP problem in computational complexity. Here, the contrast between efficient generation and efficient recognition is treated not as a mathematical taxonomy but as a framework for understanding how knowledge is produced and validated across physics, computation, and cognition. The essay reconstructs the mathematical history of quantum mechanics through the original derivations of Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Pascual Jordan, Paul Dirac, Erwin Schr\"odinger, Paul Ehrenfest, and Wolfgang Pauli, culminating in John von Neumann's unification of both approaches within the formalism of Hilbert space. By juxtaposing Heisenberg's algorithmic formalism with Schr\"odinger's representational one, it argues that their divergence reveals a structural feature of scientific reasoning itself-the enduring tension between what can be procedurally constructed and what can only be recognized.</description>
