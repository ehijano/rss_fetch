      <title>Probing the magnetic ground state and magnetoelastic coupling in double perovskite ruthenate: Ca2ScRuO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruthenates, materials with a single magnetic Ruthenium (Ru) atom, often display an exotic array of ground states ranging from superconductivity to altermagnetism. In this work, we investigated the magnetic ground state of a least explored member of the 4d3 double perovskite ruthenate series A2ScRuO6 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba): Ca2ScRuO6. Interestingly, temperature-dependent bulk susceptibility curve shows ferrimagnetic-like behaviour above the magnetic ordering at around 40 K, which were corroborated by the identification of the mixed valence states, Ru5+ and Ru4+ via X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Structural analysis further revealed atomic-site exchange between the Ru and Sc sites, which results in the Ru mixed valence states. Neutron powder diffraction measurements detected the presence of magnetic Bragg peaks at a low temperature near 4 K and a moderate magnetoelastic coupling near the ordering temperature of 40 K. However, the corresponding symmetry analysis shows a weak Type I antiferromagnetic ground state with a reduced magnetic moment of 1.1{\mu}B/Ru atom. Our findings establish an unusual magnetic ground state in the Mott insulating Ca2ScRuO6, where a long range ordered antiferromagnet coexists with small magnetic clusters, which manifests a ferrimagnetic-like high temperature inverse magnetic susceptibility. This system presents a unique platform to study long-range magnetic order in the presence of antisite disorder.</description>

      <title>Spin-density wave of ferrimagnetic building blocks masking the ferromagnetic quantum-critical point in NbFe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the metallic magnet NbFe2, the low temperature threshold of ferromagnetism can be investigated by varying the Fe concentration within a narrow homogeneity range. NbFe2 is one of a number of compounds where modulated order is found to mask the ferromagnetic quantum critical point. However, here we report the rare case where the masking modulated magnetic order has been fully refined. Spherical neutron polarimetry and high-intensity single-crystal neutron diffraction reveal the first case of a longitudinal spin-density wave masking the ferromagnetic quantum critical point. The spin-density wave is characterised by a large-wavelength incommensurate modulation of its low average moment. It is formed from ferrimagnetic building blocks with antiparallel ferromagnetic sheets. The existence of ferromagnetic sheets and cancellation of the magnetisation only over mesoscopic length scales show local similarity between the spin-density wave and the ferromagnetic parent phase and indicate the spin-density wave's unconventional nature as emerging from underlying ferromagnetic quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Topological physics in quantum critical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology forms a cornerstone in modern condensed matter and statistical physics, offering a new framework to classify the phases and phase transitions beyond the traditional Landau paradigm. However, it is widely believed that topological properties are destroyed when the bulk energy gap closes, making it highly nontrivial to consider topology in gapless quantum critical systems. To address these challenges, recent advancements have sought to generalize the notion of topology to systems without a bulk energy gap, including quantum critical points and critical phases, collectively referred to as gapless symmetry-protected topological states. Extending topology to gapless quantum critical systems challenges the traditional belief in condensed matter physics that topological edge states are typically tied to the presence of a bulk energy gap. Furthermore, it suggests that topology plays a crucial role in classifying quantum phase transitions even if they belong to the same universality class, fundamentally enriching the textbook understanding of phase transitions. Given its importance, here we give a pedagogical review of the current progress of topological physics in quantum critical systems. We introduce the topological properties of quantum critical points and generalize them to stable critical phases, both for noninteracting and interacting systems. Additionally, we discuss further generalizations and future directions, including higher dimensions, nonequilibrium phase transitions, and realizations in modern experiments.</description>

      <title>About the origin of the magnetic ground state of Tb$_{2}$Ir$_{2}$O$_{7}$</title>

Abstract: Magnetic-rare-earth pyrochlore iridates exhibit a rich variety of unconventional phases, driven by the complex interactions within and between the rare-earth and the iridium sublattices. In this study, we investigate the peculiar magnetic state of Tb$_{2}$Ir$_{2}$O$_{7}$, where a component of the Tb$^{3+}$ moment orders perpendicular to its local Ising anisotropy axis. By means of neutron diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering down to dilution temperatures, complemented by specific heat measurements, we show that this intriguing magnetic state is fully established at 1.5 K and we characterize its excitation spectrum across a broad range of energies. Our calculations reveal that bilinear interactions between Tb$^{3+}$ ions subjected to the Ir molecular field capture several key features of the experiments, but need to be supplemented to fully reproduce the observed behavior.</description>

      <title>Pauli stabilizer formalism for topological quantum field theories and generalized statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum field theory (TQFT) provides a unifying framework for describing topological phases of matter and for constructing quantum error-correcting codes, playing a central role across high-energy physics, condensed matter, and quantum information. A central challenge is to formulate topological order on the lattice and to extract the properties of topological excitations from microscopic Hamiltonians. In this work, we construct new classes of lattice gauge theories as Pauli stabilizer models, realizing a wide range of TQFTs in general spacetime dimensions. We develop a lattice description of the resulting extended excitations and systematically determine their generalized statistics.
  Our main example is the $(4+1)$D \emph{fermionic-loop toric code}, obtained by condensing the $e^2 m^2$-loop in the $(4+1)$D $\mathbb{Z}_4$ toric code. We show that the loop excitation exhibits fermionic loop statistics: the 24-step loop-flipping process yields a phase of $-1$. Our Pauli stabilizer models realize all twisted 2-form gauge theories in $(4+1)$D, the higher-form Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT classified by $H^{5}(B^{2}G, U(1))$. % Beyond $(4+1)$D, the fermionic-loop toric codes form a family of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in arbitrary dimensions featuring fermionic loop excitations, realized as explicit Pauli stabilizer codes using $\mathbb{Z}_4$ qudits. % Finally, we develop a Pauli-based framework that defines generalized statistics for extended excitations in any dimension, yielding computable lattice unitary processes to detect nontrivial generalized statistics. For example, we propose anyonic membrane statistics in $(6+1)$D, as well as fermionic membrane and volume statistics in arbitrary dimensions. We construct new families of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders: the \emph{fermionic-membrane toric code} and the \emph{fermionic-volume toric code}.</description>

      <title>Bridging Commutant and Polynomial Methods for Hilbert Space Fragmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum model exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) if its Hilbert space decomposes into exponentially many dynamically disconnected subspaces, known as Krylov subspaces. A model may however have different HSFs depending on the method for identifying them. Here we establish a connection between two vastly distinct methods recently proposed for identifying HSF: the commutant algebra (CA) method and integer characteristic polynomial factorization (ICPF) method. For a Hamiltonian consisting of operators admitting rational number matrix representations, we prove a theorem that, if its center of commutant algebra have all eigenvalues being rational, the HSF from the ICPF method must be equal to or finer than that from the CA method. We show that this condition is satisfied by most known models exhibiting HSF, for which we demonstrate the validity of our theorem. We further discuss representative models for which ICPF and CA methods yield different HSFs. Our results may facilitate the exploration of a unified definition of HSF.</description>

      <title>Tiling by Near Coincidence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e patterns of twisted and scaled bilayers have recently emerged as a fertile source of quasiperiodic order in two-dimensional materials. Inspired by these systems, we introduce the \emph{near-coincidence method} for generating quasiperiodic tilings of the plane. The method is intuitive -- admitting pairs of nearly coincident points from superimposed layers -- yet rigorous, as it maps naturally to the well-established cut-and-project formalism. It reproduces classical tilings, including the Ammann--Beenker, the Niizeki--G\"ahler, and the square and hexagonal Fibonacci tilings. It also uncovers new tilings not likely to arise in conventional constructions, with relative frequencies of local configurations that may take transcendental values. The near-coincidence method is algorithmically simple and already realized in an application that generates tilings from specified layer parameters and coincidence conditions. Future extensions include trilayer systems, where preliminary results yield dodecagonal order with square layers, and very small twist angles, where the method may capture the giant moir\'e patterns of bilayer and trilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Magnon Superlattices around Skyrmions in Frustrated Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic and stable magnetic textures offer a powerful platform for controlling magnon states in the broader context of spin electronics. In this work, we uncover a novel class of dynamical, crystal-like localization patterns in real space, arising from the hybridization of magnons with topologically non-trivial spin textures that possess helicity as an internal degree of freedom. By tuning the magnon wavelength to match the size of these textures, specifically, atomic-scale skyrmions in centrosymmetric frustrated magnets, we achieve strong interference effects. This leads to the emergence of magnon superlattices, shaped by the internal skyrmion structure and the underlying Mexican-hat magnon dispersion. Furthermore, helicity-driven nonlinear dynamics give rise to dispersive magnon bands with nontrivial Chern numbers within the first magnon gap. These findings provide fundamental insights into magnon behavior in complex spin environments and establish frustrated magnets as a versatile platform for manipulating spin excitations at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for dissipative photons from higher-form symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in generalized symmetries have provided new insights into quantum field theories. Within this framework, photons can be understood as Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with a spontaneously broken higher-form symmetry. In this work, we develop an effective field theory that builds on this symmetry structure to describe the real-time dynamics of photons in insulating media at finite temperature. Combining the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism with the generalized coset construction, we formulate a symmetry-based effective action that incorporates both conservative and dissipative effects. The effective theory implements the dynamical Kubo-Martin-Schwinger symmetry, ensuring consistency with the fluctuation-dissipation relation and Onsager's reciprocal relations. Within this framework, we derive the entropy current associated with dissipative photon dynamics and demonstrate the non-negativity of its divergence, in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. We also clarify the symmetry origin of the gauge redundancy in the unbroken phase within the Schwinger-Keldysh framework, relating it to strong and weak realizations of higher-form symmetries. Our results provide a model-independent effective description of photon dynamics in insulating media at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Nematic-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity in CuxTiSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay among electronic nematicity, charge density wave, and superconductivity in correlated electronic systems has induced extensive research interest. Here, we discover the existence of nematic fluctuations in TiSe2 single crystal and investigate its evolution with Cu intercalation. It is observed that the elastoresistivity coefficient mEg exhibits a divergent temperature dependence following a Curie-Weiss law at high temperature. Upon Cu intercalation, the characteristic temperature T* of nematic fluctuation is progressively suppressed and becomes near zero when the superconductivity is optimized. Further intercalation of Cu leads to the sign change of T* and the suppression of superconductivity. These results strongly indicate that nematic phase transition may play a vital role in enhancing superconductivity in CuxTiSe2. Therefore, CuxTiSe2 provides a unique material platform to explore the nematic-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum-critical transport in marginal Fermi liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11982v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Kubo response functions to calculate the electrical and thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient at low temperatures and frequencies in the quantum-critical region for fermions on a lattice. The theory uses scattering of the fermions with the previously derived collective fluctuations due to topological defects of the quantum XY model coupled to fermions. The microscopic model is applicable to the fluctuations of the loop-current order in cuprates as well as to a class of quasi-two-dimensional heavy-fermion and other metallic antiferromagnets, and proposed recently also for the possible loop-current order in Moir\'{e} twisted bi-layer graphene and bilayer WSe$_2$. All these metals have a linear-in-temperature electrical resistivity in the quantum-critical region of their phase diagrams, often termed ``Planckian" resistivity. The solution of the Kubo equation for transport shows that vertex renormalizations to the external fields, beside those caused by Aslamazov-Larkin (A-L) processes, are absent. A-L appears as an Umklapp scattering matrix, which gives a temperature-independent multiplicative factor for the electrical resistivity but does not affect the thermal conductivity. We also show that the mass renormalization which gives a logarithmic enhancement of the marginal Fermi-liquid specific heat does not appear in the electrical resistivity and, more remarkably, in the thermal conductivity. On the other hand the mass renormalization $\propto \ln \omega_c/T$ appears in the Seebeck coefficient. We also discuss in detail the conservation laws which play a crucial role in all transport properties. We calculate exactly, the numerical coefficients of the transport properties for a circular Fermi surface. The leading temperature dependences is shown to remain the same for a general Fermi surface, but it is too messy to calculate the numerical coefficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17121v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We broaden the scope of quantum field theory by introducing a general class of discrete gauge theories that realize either topological order or fracton behavior across dimensions. We start from translation-invariant systems endowed with unconventional charge-conservation laws, which we term \textit{exponential polynomial symmetries}. Gauging these symmetries yields $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theories in 2D that exhibit topological order whose quasiparticles have constrained mobility and whose ground-state degeneracy shows ultraviolet (UV) dependence. These features are reminiscent of spatial symmetry-enriched topological order, wherein quasiparticle excitations transform nontrivially under lattice translations. We further propose a Chern-Simons variant that produces non-CSS stabilizer codes and outline a framework for exponentially symmetric subsystem SPT phases. Finally, we extend this gauging procedure to 3D, obtaining new variants of fracton topological order.</description>

      <title>Charge pumps, boundary modes, and the necessity of unnecessary criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We link the presence of "unnecessary" quantum critical surfaces within a single gapped phase of matter to the non-trivial topology of families of gapped Hamiltonians that encircle the critical surface. We study a specific set of one-dimensional spin models where each such family forms a one-parameter loop in a two-dimensional phase diagram. Foliating the non-critical region by such loops identifies "radial" and "angular" coordinates in the phase diagram that respectively parametrize different families and different members of a single family. We show that each one-parameter family is a generalized Thouless charge pump, all with the same topological index, and hence the gapped phase undergoes one or more nontrivial boundary phase transitions as we vary the angular coordinate in a loop through members of one family. Tuning the radial coordinate generates loci of boundary critical points that terminate at endpoints of the bulk unnecessary critical line within the gapped phase. We discuss broader implications of our results and possible extensions to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Particle-hole Symmetric Slave Boson Method for the Mixed Valence Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an analytic slave boson method for treating the finite $U$ Anderson impurity model. Our approach introduces two bosons to track both $Q\rightleftharpoons Q\pm1$ valence fluctuations and reduces to a single symmetric $s$-boson in the effective action, encoding all the high energy atomic physics information in the boson's kinematics, while the low energy part of the action remains unchanged across finite $U$, infinite $U$, and Kondo limits. We recover the infinite $U$ and Kondo limit actions from our approach and show that the Kondo resonance already develops in the normal state when the slave boson has yet to condense. We show that the slave rotor and $s$-boson have the same algebraic structure, and we establish a unified functional integral framework connecting the $s$-boson and slave rotor representations for the single impurity Anderson model.</description>

      <title>Signatures of three-dimensional photo-induced superconductivity in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00514v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical excitation of large-amplitude apical oxygen phonon oscillations has been shown to renormalize the electronic properties of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, inducing a superconducting-like optical response above equilibrium $T_C$. All of the evidence collected so far has been based on the changes of the THz frequency $c$-axis response. In these measurements, the capacitive interlayer coupling was seen to transform into a superconducting-like inductive response. This assignment was strengthened by recent measurements of ultrafast magnetic field expulsion. Here, we report an experimental determination of the transient in-plane optical properties, which has so far been elusive due to the high equilibrium reflectivity and the need to evaluate minute changes in the optical response. We report the appearance of a photo-induced in-plane optical gap $2\Delta\simeq30$ cm$^{-1}$ and a divergent imaginary conductivity, both consistent with photo-induced superconductivity. A global fit to these data suggests that in- and out-of-plane electronic properties never completely equilibrate during the dynamics.</description>

      <title>A non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with the energy levels of free parafermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a parent Hermitian tight-binding model on a bipartite lattice with chiral symmetry, we theoretically generate non-Hermitian models for free fermions with $p$ orbitals per unit cell satisfying a complex generalization of chiral symmetry. The $p$ complex energy bands in $k$ space are given by a common $k$-dependent real factor, determined by the bands of the parent model, multiplied by the $p$th roots of unity. When the parent model is the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, the single-particle energy levels are the same as those of free parafermion solutions to Baxter's non-Hermitian clock model. This construction relies on fully unidirectional hopping to create Bloch Hamiltonians with the form of generalized permutation matrices, but we also describe the effect of partial unidirectional hopping. For fully bidirectional hopping, the Bloch Hamiltonians are Hermitian and may be separated into even and odd parity blocks with respect to inversion of the orbitals within the unit cell. Partially unidirectional hopping breaks the inversion symmetry and mixes the even and odd blocks, and the real energy spectrum evolves into a complex one as the degree of unidirectionality increases, with details determined by the topology of the parent model and the number of orbitals per unit cell, $p$. We describe this process in detail for $p=3$ and $p=4$ with the SSH model. We also apply our approach to graphene, and show that $AA$-stacked bilayer graphene evolves into a square root Hamiltonian of monolayer graphene with the introduction of unidirectional hopping. We show that higher-order exceptional points occur at edge states and solitons in the non-Hermitian SSH model, and at the Dirac point of non-Hermitian graphene.</description>

      <title>Clifford Circuits Augmented Grassmann Matrix Product States</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in combining Clifford circuits with tensor-network (TN) methods have shown that classically simulable disentanglers can suppress substantial portions of the entanglement structure, effectively alleviating the bond-dimension bottleneck in TN simulations. In this work, we develop a variational TN framework based on Grassmann tensor networks, which natively encode fermionic statistics while preserving locality. By incorporating locally defined Clifford circuits within the fermionic formalism, we simulate benchmark models including the tight-binding and $t$-$V$ models. Our results show that Clifford disentangling removes the classically simulable component of entanglement, leading to a reduced bond dimension and improved accuracy in ground-state energy estimates. Interestingly, once the natural Grassmann-evenness requirement of the fermionic formulation is taken into account and Clifford gates with identical entanglement action are grouped together, the original set of 11520 two-qubit Clifford gates reduces to only 12 distinct gates. This strong reduction leads to a more efficient disentangling scheme within the fermionic framework. These findings highlight the potential of Clifford-augmented Grassmann TNs as a scalable and accurate tool for studying strongly correlated fermionic systems, particularly in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Temperature and Pressure Dependent Vibrational Properties of Pristine and Doped Vacancy-Ordered Double Perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21810</link>

Abstract: Understanding lattice dynamics and structural transitions in vacancy-ordered double perovskites is crucial for developing lead-free optoelectronic materials, yet the role of dopants in modulatingthese properties remains poorly understood. We investigate the vibrational and optical properties of pristine and Antimony(Sb)-doped Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$ vacancy-ordered double perovskite through temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy (4-273 K), high-pressure studies (0- \~30 GPa), ambient powder XRD, and photoluminescence measurements. Sb doping improves phase purity, reducing impurity-related Raman modes present in pristine samples. Most notably, Sb-doped samples exhibit an anomalous Raman mode M$_1$ appearing exclusively below 100 K at 314-319 cm$^{-1}$, accompanied by changes in the temperature coefficient $\chi$ and anharmonic constant $A$ across this threshold. This behavior is absent in pristine Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$. While these observations suggest possible structural changes at low temperature, the origin of the M$_1$ mode remains unclear and may arise from disorder-activated vibrations, symmetry breaking, or dopant-induced local distortions. Low-temperature structural characterization is needed to confirm the nature of this transition. Photoluminescence shows broad self-trapped exciton emission at 448 nm with broader FWHM in Sb-doped samples (164.73 nm) compared to Bi-doped samples (138.2 nm), consistent with enhanced structural disorder. High-pressure Raman measurements reveal continuous mode hardening to 30 GPa with no phase transitions. These results demonstrate that Sb doping modulates the vibrational properties of Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$, though further investigation is required to establish the underlying mechanisms.</description>
