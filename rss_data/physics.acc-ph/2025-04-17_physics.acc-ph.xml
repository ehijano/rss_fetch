      <title>Tuning methods for multigap drift tube linacs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multigap cavities are used extensively in linear accelerators to achieve velocities up to a few percent of the speed of light, driving nuclear physics research around the world. Unlike for single-gap structures, there is no closed-form expression to calculate the output beam parameters from the cavity voltage and phase. To overcome this, we propose to use a method based on the integration of the first and second moments of the beam distribution through the axially symmetric time-dependent fields of the cavity. A beam-based calibration between the model's electric field scaling and the machine's rf amplitudes is presented, yielding a fast online energy change method, returning cavity amplitude and phase necessary for a desired output beam energy and energy spread. The method is validated with 23Na6+ beam energy measurements.</description>

      <title>Chaos indicators for non-linear dynamics in circular particle accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The understanding of non-linear effects in circular storage rings and colliders based on superconducting magnets is a key issue for the luminosity the beam lifetime optimisation. A detailed analysis of the multidimensional phase space requires a large computing effort when many variants of the magnetic lattice, representing the realisation of magnetic errors or configurations for performance optimisation, have to be considered. Dynamic indicators for chaos detection have proven to be very effective in finding and distinguishing the weakly-chaotic regions of phase space where diffusion takes place and regions that remain stable over time scales in the order of multiple hours of continuous operation. This paper explores the use of advanced chaos indicators, including the Fast Lyapunov Indicator with Birkhoff weights and the Reverse Error Method, in realistic lattice models for the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Their convergence, predictive power, and potential to define a magnetic lattice quality factor linked to long-term dynamic aperture are assessed. The results demonstrate the efficiency of these indicators in identifying chaotic dynamics, offering valuable insights of these chaos indicators for optimising accelerator lattices with reduced computational cost compared to the classical approach based on CPU-demanding long-term tracking campaigns.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of integrated luminosity in a circular collider with application to the LHC Run 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular collider designs are tailored to maximise luminosity delivered to experimental detectors, effectively utilising the charged beams that have been accelerated for collisions. In reality, the key metric for the effective operation of a circular collider is the integrated luminosity provided to the experiments, which can significantly differ from the theoretical capability regarding instantaneous luminosity of the accelerator. Several factors influence the collection of integrated luminosity, with the most critical being the duration of each physics fill. This paper presents and examines strategies for determining optimal fill durations based on actual fill conditions, applying these methods to public luminosity data measured by the ATLAS detector during the LHC Run~2, covering the physics runs from 2016 to 2018.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Electromagnetic Fields in RF Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work introduced a systematic method for designing so-called azimuthally modulated RF cavities that support transverse magnetic modes composed of user-desired multipoles, enabling precision control of the magnitude and orientation of multipolar components in RF cavity design. This paper extends this method to practical implementation by deriving the multipolar expansion of the longitudinal electric field in such RF cavities with beam pipes, as well as the momentum change of ultra-relativistic particles traversing these modes. The derived equations explicitly show the radial variation of the change in longitudinal and transverse momentum follows a polynomial rather than Bessel-function relationship. The expression for the longitudinal electric field is then compared to a field map obtained from the 3D electromagnetic simulation of an azimuthally modulated cavity designed to support a mode composed of monopole, dipole, and quadrupole components. Beam dynamics studies are presented to assess the derived expressions for the change in momentum, including the effects of relaxing the ultra-relativistic assumption. Finally, two example applications are presented: the first demonstrates the removal of unwanted transverse multipoles to create a multipole-free accelerating structure with a single-port coupler, whereas the second illustrates the synthesis of desired multipoles to create an RF cavity that transforms the transverse distribution of a beam from Gaussian to uniform.</description>

      <title>Lessons from commissioning of the cryogenic system for the Short-Baseline Neutrino Detector at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Results from commissioning and first year of operations of the cryogenic system of the Short-Baseline Neutrino Detector (SBND) and its membrane cryostat installed at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory are described. The SBND detector is installed in a 200 m$^3$ membrane cryostat filled with liquid argon, which serves both as target and as active media. For the correct operation of the detector, the liquid argon must be kept in very stable thermal conditions while the contamination of electronegative impurities must be consistently kept at the level of small fractions of parts per billion. The detector is operated in Booster Neutrino Beams (BNB) at Fermilab for the search of sterile neutrinos and measurements of neutrino-argon cross sections. The cryostat and the cryogenic systems also serve as prototypes for the much larger equipment to be used for the LBNF/DUNE experiment. Since its installation in 2018-2023 and cooldown in spring of 2024, the cryostat and the cryogenic system have been commissioned to support the detector operations. The lessons learned through installation, testing, commissioning, cooldown, and initial operations are described.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Transport of Radioactive Ion Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beams of radioactive heavy ions allow researchers to study rare and unstable atomic nuclei, shedding light into the internal structure of exotic nuclei and on how chemical elements are formed in stars. However, the extraction and transport of radioactive beams rely on time-consuming expert-driven tuning methods, where hundreds of parameters are manually optimized. Here, we introduce a system that employs Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically utilizing Bayesian Optimization, to assist in the transport process of radioactive beams. We apply our methodology to real-life scenarios showing advantages when compared with standard tuning methods. This AI-assisted approach can be extended to other radioactive beam facilities around the world to improve operational efficiency and enhance scientific output.</description>
