      <title>A survey for variable stars with small telescopes: IX - Evolution of Spot Properties on YSOs in IC5070</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spot properties on 32 periodic young stellar objects in IC 5070. Long term, $\sim$5 yr, light curves in the $V$, $R$, and $I$-bands are obtained through the HOYS (Hunting Outbursting Young Stars) citizen science project. These are dissected into six months long slices, with 3 months oversampling, to measure 234 sets of amplitudes in all filters. We fit 180 of these with reliable spot solutions. Two thirds of spot solutions are cold spots, the lowest is 2150 K below the stellar temperature. One third are warm spots that are above the stellar temperature by less than $\sim$2000 K. Cold and warm spots have maximum surface coverage values of 40 percent, although only 16 percent of warm spots are above 20 percent surface coverage as opposed to 60 percent of the cold spots. Warm spots are most likely caused by a combination of plages and low density accretion columns, most common on objects without inner disc excess emission in $K-W2$. Five small hot spot solutions have $&lt;3$ percent coverage and are 3000 - 5000 K above the stellar temperature. These are attributed to accretion, and four of them occur on the same object. The majority of our objects are likely to be accreting. However, we observe very few accretion hot spots as either the accretion is not stable on our timescale or the photometry is dominated by other features. We do not identify cyclical spot behaviour on the targets. We additionally identify and discuss a number of objects that have interesting amplitudes, phase changes, or spot properties.</description>

      <title>Optical Spectroscopy of Classical Be Stars in Old Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed the optical spectroscopy of 16 classical Be stars in 11 open clusters older than 100 Myr. Ours is the first spectroscopic study of classical Be stars in open clusters older than 100 Myr. We found that the H alpha emission strength of most of the stars is less than 40 Angstrom, in agreement with previous studies. Our analysis further suggests that one of the stars, KW97 35 12, might be a weak H alpha emitter in nature, showing H alpha equivalent width of negative 0.5 Angstrom. Interestingly, we also found that the newly detected classical Be star LS III 47 37b might be a component of the possible visual binary system LS III 47 37, where the other companion is also a classical Be star. Hence, the present study indicates the possible detection of a binary Be system. Moreover, it is observed that all 16 stars exhibit a lesser number of emission lines compared to classical Be stars younger than 100 Myr. Furthermore, the spectral type distribution analysis of B type and classical Be stars for the selected clusters points out that the existence of CBe stars can depend on the spectral type distribution of B type stars present in these clusters.</description>

      <title>Multiple Outflows around a Single Protostar IRAS 15398$-$3359</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of our mosaic observations of a single Class 0 protostar IRAS 15398$-$3359 with Atacama Compact Array (ACA) in the CO $J=2\mbox{-}1$ line. The new observations covering a $\sim\!2'$ square region revealed elongated redshifted and blueshifted components, which are located at distances of $\sim\!30''\mbox{-}75''$ on the northern and southern sides of the protostar, respectively, in addition to the previously observed primary and secondary outflows. These elongated components exhibit Hubble-law like velocity structures, i.e., an increase of velocity with increasing distance from the protostar, suggesting that it is the third outflow associated with the protostar. Besides, a new redshifted component is detected at radii of $\sim\!40''\mbox{-}75''$ on the northwestern side of the protostar. This redshifted component also exhibits a Hubble-law like velocity profile, which could be the counterpart of the secondary outflow mostly detected at blueshifted velocities in a previous study. The three outflows are all misaligned by $\sim\!20\mbox{-}90^\circ$, and the dynamical timescale of the primary outflow is shorter than those of the other outflows approximately by an order of magnitude. These facts hint that the outflow launch direction has significantly changed with time. The outflow direction may change if the rotational axis and the magnetic field are misaligned, or if the dense core is turbulent. We favor the second scenario as the origin of the multiple outflows in IRAS 15398$-$3359 based on a comparison between the observational results and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Solar chromospheric heating by magnetohydrodynamic waves: dependence on magnetic field inclination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proposed mechanism for solar chromospheric heating is that magnetohydrodynamic waves propagate upward along magnetic field lines and dissipate their energy in the chromosphere. In particular, compressible magneto-acoustic waves may contribute to the heating. Theoretically, the components below the cutoff frequency cannot propagate into the chromosphere; however, the cutoff frequency depends on the inclination of the magnetic field lines. In this study, using high temporal cadence spectral data of IRIS and Hinode SOT spectropolarimeter (SP) in plages, we investigated the dependence of the low-frequency waves on magnetic-field properties and quantitatively estimated the amount of energy dissipation in the chromosphere. The following results were obtained: (a) The amount of energy dissipated by the low-frequency component (3--6 mHz) increases with the field inclination below 40 degrees, whereas it is decreased as a function of the field inclination above 40 degrees. (b) The amount of the energy is enhanced toward $10^4 W/m^2$, which is the energy required for heating in the chromospheric plage regions, when the magnetic field is higher than 600 G and inclined more than 40 degree. (c) In the photosphere, the low-frequency component has much more power in the magnetic field inclined more and weaker than 400 G. The results suggest that the observed low-frequency components can bring the energy along the magnetic field lines and that only a specific range of the field inclination angles and field strength may allow the low-frequency component to bring the sufficient amount of the energy into the chromosphere.</description>

      <title>s-process Enriched Evolved Binaries in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-asymptotic giant branch stars (post-AGB) in binary systems, with typical orbital periods between ~100 to ~1000 days, result from a poorly understood interaction that terminates their precursory AGB phase. The majority of these binaries display a photospheric anomaly called 'chemical depletion', thought to arise from an interaction between the circumbinary disc and the post-AGB star, leading to the reaccretion of pure gas onto the star, devoid of refractory elements due to dust formation. In this paper, we focus on a subset of chemically peculiar binary post-AGBs in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) whose high-resolution optical spectroscopic study revealed a carbon and s-process enrichment, contrary to the commonly observed photospheric chemical depletion. Using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and period-luminosity-colour (PLC) relation methods, we determine the luminosity of the targets ($2700-8300L_{\odot}$), which enables confirmation of their evolutionary phase and estimation of initial masses (as a function of metallicity) ($1-2.5M_{\odot}$). In conjunction with predictions from dedicated ATON stellar evolutionary models, our results indicate a predominant intrinsic enrichment of carbon and s-process elements in our binary post-AGB targets. We qualitatively rule out extrinsic enrichment and inherited s-process enrichment from the host galaxy as plausible explanations for the observed overabundances. Our chemically peculiar subset of intrinsic carbon and s-process enriched binary post-AGBs also hints at potential variation in the efficiency of chemical depletion between stars with C-rich and O-rich circumbinary disc chemistries. However, critical observational studies of circumbinary disc chemistry are necessary to address gaps in our current understanding of disc-binary interactions inducing chemical depletion in binary post-AGB systems.</description>

      <title>Small-scale magnetic flux emergence preceding a chain of energetic solar atmospheric events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in instrumentation have revealed a multitude of small-scale EUV events in the solar atmosphere. Our aim is to employ high-resolution magnetograms to gain a detailed understanding of the magnetic origin of such phenomena. We have used coordinated observations from SST, IRIS, and SDO to analyze an ephemeral magnetic flux emergence episode and the following chain of small-scale energetic events. These unique observations clearly link these phenomena together. The high-resolution (0."057/pixel) magnetograms obtained with SST/CRISP allows us to reliably measure the magnetic field at the photosphere and detect the emerging bipole that causes the subsequent eruptive atmospheric events. Notably, this small-scale emergence episode remains indiscernible in the lower resolution SDO/HMI magnetograms (0."5/pixel). We report the appearance of a dark bubble in Ca II K related to the emerging bipole, a sign of the canonical expanding magnetic dome predicted in flux emergence simulations. Evidences of reconnection are also found: first through an Ellerman bomb, and later by the launch of a surge next to a UV burst. The UV burst exhibits a weak EUV counterpart in the coronal SDO/AIA channels. By calculating DEM, its plasma is shown to reach a temperature beyond 1 MK and have densities between the upper chromosphere and transition region. Our study showcases the importance of high-resolution magnetograms to unveil the mechanisms triggering phenomena such as EBs, UV bursts, and surges. This could hold implications for small-scale events akin to those recently reported in EUV using Solar Orbiter. The finding of temperatures beyond 1 MK in the UV burst plasma strongly suggests that we are examining analogous features. Therefore, we signal caution regarding drawing conclusions from full-disk magnetograms that lack the necessary resolution to reveal their true magnetic origin.</description>

      <title>Radiative loss and ion-neutral collisional effects in astrophysical plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the role of radiative cooling in a two-fluid model consisting of coupled neutrals and charged particles. We first analyze the linearized two-fluid equations where we include radiative losses in the energy equation for the charged particles. In a 1D geometry for parallel propagation and in the limiting cases of weak and strong coupling, it can be shown analytically that the instability conditions for the thermal mode and the sound waves, the isobaric and isentropic criteria, respectively, remain unchanged with respect to one-fluid radiative plasmas. For the parameters considered in this paper, representative for the solar corona, the radiative cooling produces growth of the thermal mode and damping of the sound waves. When neutrals are included and are sufficiently coupled to the charges, the thermal mode growth rate and the wave damping both reduce by the same factor, which depends on the ionization fraction only. For a heating function which is constant in time, we find that the growth of the thermal mode and the damping of the sound waves are slightly larger. The numerical calculation of the eigenvalues of the general system of equations in a 3D geometry confirm the analytic results. We then run 2D fully nonlinear simulations which give consistent results: a higher ionization fraction or lower coupling will increase the growth rate. The magnetic field contribution is negligible in the linear phase. Ionization-recombination effects might play an important role because the radiative cooling produces a large range of temperatures in the system. In the numerical simulation, after the first condensation phase, when the minimum temperature is reached, the fraction of neutrals increases four orders of magnitude because of the recombination.</description>

      <title>Elastic and breaking properties of epitaxial face-centered crystals in neutron star crusts and white dwarf cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystallization of dense matter in neutron star crusts and white dwarf cores may be similar to epitaxial crystal growth in terrestrial laboratories. However in stellar crystals, the spacing between horizontal planes has to gradually increase with the outward movement of the crystallization front, tracing decrease of the electron density. This process produces Coulomb crystals with stretched rather than cubic elementary cells. We extend the analysis of the elastic and breaking properties of such crystals to the face-centered (fc) lattice. Shear deformations orthogonal to the stretch direction have been studied for 22 crystallographic shear planes. A common property for all these planes is a reduction and eventual nulling of the breaking shear strain with deviation from the unstretched configuration. The effective shear moduli for deformations orthogonal to the stretch direction have been calculated. It is possible that the epitaxial crystallization in compact stars results in a formation of large-scale crystallites or, at least, in growth of the whole crystallization front perpendicular to particular crystallographic planes. For fc structure growth orthogonal to the $\{111\}$ planes, we expect that, at any density, $\sim 5\%$ ($\sim 0.5\%$) of crystallite height is occupied by layers one (two) orders of magnitude weaker than the bulk of the crystallite. This may be important for realistic modeling of crustquakes on neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Seven new triply eclipsing triple star systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have identified nearly a hundred close triply eclipsing hierarchical triple star systems from data taken with the space telescope TESS. These systems are noteworthy in that we can potentially determine their dynamical and astrophysical parameters with a high precision. In the present paper, we report the comprehensive study of seven new compact triply eclipsing triple star systems taken from this larger sample: TICs 133771812, 176713425, 185615681, 287756035, 321978218, 323486857, and 650024463. Most of the data for this study come from TESS observations, but two of them have Gaia measurements of their outer orbits, and we obtained supplemental radial velocity (RV) measurements for three of the systems. The eclipse timing variation curves extracted from the TESS data, the photometric light curves, the RV points, and the spectral energy distribution (SED) are combined in a complex photodynamical analysis to yield the stellar and orbital parameters of all seven systems. Four of the systems are quite compact with outer periods in the range of 41-56 days. All of the systems are substantially flat, with mutual inclination angles of &lt; ~2 degrees. Including the systems reported in this work, we have now studied in considerable detail some 30 triply eclipsing triples with TESS, and are accumulating a meaningful census of these systems.</description>

      <title>Long-term double synchronization in close-in gas giant planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters, orbiting their host stars at extremely close distances, undergo tidal evolution, with some being engulfed by their stars due to angular momentum exchanges induced by tidal forces. However, achieving double synchronization can prolong their survival. Using the MESA stellar evolution code, combined with the magnetic braking model of Matt et al. (2015), we calculate 25,000 models with different metallicity and study how to attain the conditions that trigger the long-term double synchronization. Our results indicate that massive planets orbiting stars with lower convective turnover time are easier to achieve long-term double synchronization. The rotation angular velocity at the equilibrium point ($\Omega_{\mathrm{sta}}$) is almost equal to orbital angular velocity of planet ($\mathrm{n}$) for the majority of the main sequence lifetime if a system has undergone a long-term double synchronization, regardless of their state at this moment. We further compared our results with known parameters of giant planetary systems and found that those systems with larger planetary masses and lower convective turnover time seem to be less sensitive to changes in the tidal quality factor $Q'_{_*}$. We suggest that for systems that fall on the state of $\Omega_{\mathrm{sta}} \approx n$, regardless of their current state, the synchronization will persist for a long time if orbital synchronization occurs at any stage of their evolution. Our results can be applied to estimate whether a system has experienced long-term double synchronization in the past or may experience it in the future.</description>

      <title>Periodicity of sub-pulses in a radio pulsar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsars are known to manifest complex phenomena, such as nulling, sub-pulse drifting, and periodicity. Within the purview of this investigation, we have harnessed the wavelet analysis technique to scrutinize the multifaceted periodicities and sub-pulse drifting characteristics exhibited by PSR J1926-0652, discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Our analysis draws upon the rich dataset acquired from the FAST ultra-wide-bandwidth receiver (UWB), meticulously examining pulse attributes encompassing an entire pulse. It is notable that the pulse apex recurrently manifests approximately every 17.11 times the pulsar's period P, individual sub-pulses exhibit a drifting phenomenon, with a phase decrement of approximately $1.04^\circ$ over each P. Intriguingly, the central phase of each sub-pulse track gradually increments over temporal evolution. Furthermore, the relative offset distribution between successive sub-pulse tracks emanating from the trailing and leading components remains comparatively stable, with a central tendency of approximately $\sim$6.87$\pm$2.56 P. Most notably, derived from the outcomes of wavelet analysis, we ascertain a negative correlation of -0.98 between the periods of sub-pulses and their drifting rates, alongside the intrinsic period of sub-pulses identified at 28.14 seconds.</description>

      <title>Narrow absorption lines from intervening material in supernovae I. Measurements and temporal evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Narrow absorption features in nearby supernova (SN) spectra are a powerful diagnostic of the slow-moving material in the line of sight: they are extensively used to infer dust extinction from the host galaxies, and they can also serve in the detection of circumstellar material originating from the SN progenitor and present in the vicinity of the explosion. Despite their wide use, very few studies have examined the biases of the methods to characterize narrow lines, and not many statistical analyses exist. This is the first paper of a series in which we present a statistical analysis of narrow lines of SN spectra of various resolutions. We develop a robust automated methodology to measure the equivalent width (EW) and velocity of narrow absorption lines from intervening material in the line of sight of SNe, including Na I D , Ca II H&amp;K, K i and diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs). We carefully study systematic biases in heterogeneous spectra from the literature by simulating different signal-to-noise, spectral resolution, slit size and orientation and present the real capabilities and limitations of using low- and mid-resolution spectra to study these lines. In particular, we find that the measurement of the equivalent width of the narrow lines in low-resolution spectra is highly affected by the evolving broad P-Cygni profiles of the SN ejecta, both for core-collapse and type Ia SNe, inducing a conspicuous apparent evolution. We present thus an easy way to detect and exclude those cases to obtain more robust and reliable measurements. Finally, after considering all possible effects, we analyse the temporal evolution of the narrow features in a large sample of nearby SNe to detect any possible variation in their EWs over time. We find no time evolution of the narrow line features in our large sample for all SN types</description>

Abstract: 'Debris disks' are collections of small bodies around stars, such as the Asteroid Belt and Kuiper Belt in our Solar System. These disks are composed of objects smaller than planets, including asteroids, comets, dust, and dwarf planets. We detect debris disks around a significant fraction of stars, and these disks appear to be common components of planetary systems. Extrasolar debris disks have a broad range of locations, shapes and features. This chapter provides an introduction to debris disks around main-sequence stars. It summarises our understanding of the field, and covers a wide range of concepts from observations and theory. It describes how we detect extrasolar debris disks, what we see, and what these observations tell us. It also describes how debris disks evolve, and how they interact with planets. The chapter concludes by discussing several unsolved questions in debris-disk science.</description>

      <title>Abundance stratification in type Ia supernovae -- VII. The peculiar, C-rich iPTF16abc: highlighting diversity among luminous events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12043</link>

Abstract: Observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe\,Ia) reveal diversity, even within assumed subcategories. Here, the composition of the peculiar iPTF16abc (SN\,2016bln) is derived by modeling a time series of optical spectra. iPTF16abc's early spectra combine traits of SNe 1999aa and 1991T known for weak \SiII\ $\lambda$ 6355 and prominent \FeIII\ features. However, it differs with weak early \FeIII\ lines, and persistent \CII\ lines post-peak. It also exhibits a weak \CaII\ H\&amp;K feature aligning it with SN\,1991T, an observation supported by their bolometric light curves. The early attenuation of \FeIII\ results from abundance effect. The weakening of the \SiII\ $\lambda$ 6355 line, stems from silicon depletion in the outer shells, a characteristic shared by both SNe 1999aa and 1991T, indicating a common explosion mechanism that terminates nuclear burning at around 12000 \kms\, unseen in normal events. Beneath a thin layer of intermediate mass elements (IMEs) with a total mass of 0.18 \Msun, extends a \Nifs\ rich shell totaling 0.76 \Msun\ and generating a bolometric luminosity as high as ${L_{\mathrm{peak}}}=1.60 \pm 0.1 \times$ $10^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Inner layers, typical of SNe\,Ia, hold neutron-rich elements, (\Feff\ and \Nife), totaling 0.20 M${\odot}$. Stable iron, exceeding solar abundance, and carbon, coexist in the outermost layers, challenging existing explosion models. The presence of carbon down to $v\approx$ 9000\,\kms, totalling $\sim$ 0.01 \Msun\, unprecedented in this class, links iPTF16abc to SN\,2003fg-like events. The retention of 91T-like traits in iPTF16abc underscores its importance in understanding the diversity of SNe\,Ia.</description>

      <title>Interacting supernovae from wide massive binary systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many supernovae (SNe) imply an interaction of the SN ejecta with matter (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. This suggests that many massive stars may undergo various degrees of envelope stripping shortly before exploding, and produce a considerable diversity in their pre-explosion CSM properties. We explore a generic set of ~100 detailed massive binary evolution models to characterize the amount of envelope stripping and the expected CSM configurations. Our binary models were computed with the MESA stellar evolution code, considering an initial primary star mass of 12.6 Msun, and focus on initial orbital periods above 500 d. We compute these models up to the time of the primary's iron core collapse. We find that Roche lobe overflow often leads to incomplete stripping of the mass donor, resulting in a large variety of pre-SN envelope masses. Many of our models' red supergiant (RSG) donors undergo core collapse during Roche lobe overflow, with mass transfer and thus system mass loss rates of up to 0.01 Msun/yr at that time. The corresponding CSM densities are similar to those inferred for Type IIn SNe like 1998S. In other cases, the mass transfer turns unstable, leading to a common envelope phase at such late time that the mass donor explodes before the common envelope is fully ejected or the system has merged. We argue that this may cause significant pre-SN variability, as for example in SN 2020tlf. Other models suggest a common envelope ejection just centuries before core collapse, which may lead to the strongest interactions, as in superluminous Type IIn SNe like 1994W, or 2006gy. Wide massive binaries offer a natural framework to understand a broad range of hydrogen-rich interacting SNe. On the other hand, the flash features observed in many Type IIP SNe, like in SN 2013fs, may indicate that RSG atmospheres are more extended than currently assumed.</description>

      <title>WTP$\,$10aaauow: Discovery of a new FU Ori outburst towards the RCW$\,$49 star-forming region in NEOWISE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10832v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-amplitude accretion outbursts in young stars are expected to play a central role in proto-stellar assembly. Outburst identification historically has taken place using optical techniques, but over the past decade especially, systematic infrared searches have also become possible with increasing discovery of outburst events located in heavily dust-obscured regions of the Galactic plane. Here, we present the discovery of WTP10aaauow, a large-amplitude mid-infrared (MIR) outburst identified in a systematic search of NEOWISE data using image subtraction techniques designed to recover transients in dense Galactic stellar fields. The new outburst is located towards the RCW 49 star-forming region, and estimated to be at a distance of $\approx4$ kpc via Gaia parallax measurement. Concurrent with the MIR brightening by which it was discovered, we show that the source underwent a $\sim5$ mag outburst in the optical and near-infrared (NIR) bands as well. WTP10aaauow reached a peak luminosity of $\approx260$ L$_\odot$ in 2014-2015, followed by a slow decline over the next 7 years. Analysis of the pre- and post-outburst spectral energy distributions reveal a pre-outburst stellar photosphere at a temperature of $3600-4000$ K, surrounded by a likely two-component dust structure similar to that of a flat spectrum or Class I type YSO. We present optical and NIR follow-up spectroscopy of the source, that show a GK-type spectrum in the optical bands exhibiting complex line profiles in strong absorption features, and evidence for a wind reaching a terminal velocity of $\approx 400$ km s$^{-1}$. The NIR bands are characterized by a cooler M-type spectrum exhibiting a forest of atomic and molecular features. All together, the spectra demonstrate that WTP10aaauow is an FU Ori type outburst. Ongoing systematic infrared searches will continue to reveal the extent of this population in the Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>Formation of long-period post-common-envelope binaries I. No extra energy is needed to explain oxygen-neon white dwarfs paired with AFGK-type main-sequence stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this first in a series of papers related to long-period post-common-envelope (CE) binaries, we investigated whether extra energy is required or not to explain the currently known post-CE binaries with sufficiently long orbital periods consisting of oxygen-neon white dwarfs with AFGK-type main-sequence star companions. We carried out binary population simulations with the BSE code and searched for their formation pathways. Unlike what has been claimed for a long time, we show that all such post-CE binaries can be explained by assuming inefficient CE evolution, which is consistent with results achieved for the remaining post-CE binaries. There is therefore no need for an extra energy source. We also found that for CE efficiency close to 100%, post-CE binaries hosting oxygen-neon white dwarfs with orbital periods as long as a thousand days can be explained. For all known systems we found formation pathways consisting of CE evolution triggered when a highly evolved (i.e. the envelope mass being comparable to the core mass) thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch star fills its Roche lobe at an orbital period of several thousand days. Due to the sufficiently low envelope mass and sufficiently long orbital period, the resulting post-CE orbital period can easily be several tens of days. We conclude that the known post-CE binaries with oxygen-neon white dwarfs and AFGK-type main-sequence stars can be explained without invoking any energy source other than orbital and thermal energy. Our results strengthen the idea that the most common formation pathway of the overall population of post-CE binaries hosting white dwarfs is through inefficient CE evolution.</description>

      <title>The POKEMON Speckle Survey of Nearby M Dwarfs. III. The Stellar Multiplicity Rate of M Dwarfs within 15 pc</title>

Abstract: M dwarfs are ubiquitous in our galaxy, and the rate at which they host stellar companions, and the properties of these companions, provides a window into the formation and evolution of the star(s), and of any planets that they may host. The Pervasive Overview of 'Kompanions' of Every M dwarf in Our Neighborhood (POKEMON) speckle survey of nearby M dwarfs is volume-limited from M0V through M9V out to 15 pc, with additional targets at larger distances. In total, 1125 stars were observed, and 455 of these are within the volume-limited, 15-pc sample of M-dwarf primaries. When we combine the speckle observations with known companions from the literature, we find that the stellar multiplicity rate of M dwarfs within 15 pc is 23.5% plus or minus 2.0%, and that the companion rate is 28.8% plus or minus 2.1%. We also find that the projected separation distribution for multiples that are known to host planets peaks at 198 au, while the distribution for multiples that are not yet known to host planets peaks at 5.57 au. This result suggests that the presence of close-in stellar companions inhibits the formation of M-dwarf planetary systems, similar to what has been found for FGK stars.</description>

      <title>Parallel Diffusion Coefficient of Energetic Charged Particles in the Inner Heliosphere from the Turbulent Magnetic Fields Measured by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion coefficients of energetic charged particles in turbulent magnetic fields are a fundamental aspect of diffusive transport theory but remain incompletely understood. In this work, we use quasi-linear theory to evaluate the spatial variation of the parallel diffusion coefficient $\kappa_\parallel$ from the measured magnetic turbulence power spectra in the inner heliosphere. We consider the magnetic field and plasma velocity measurements from Parker Solar Probe made during Orbits 5-13. The parallel diffusion coefficient is calculated as a function of radial distance from 0.062 to 0.8 AU, and the particle energy from 100 keV to 1GeV. We find that $\kappa_\parallel$ increases exponentially with both heliocentric distance and energy of particles. The fluctuations in $\kappa_\parallel$ are related to the episodes of large-scale magnetic structures in the solar wind. By fitting the results, we also provide an empirical formula of $\kappa_{\parallel}=(5.16\pm1.22) \times 10^{18} \: r^{1.17\pm0.08} \: E^{0.71\pm 0.02} \; (cm^2/s)$ in the inner heliosphere which can be used as a reference in studying the transport and acceleration of solar energetic particles as well as the modulation of cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>SOLARNET Metadata Recommendations for Solar Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.12139v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior to the EU Horizon 2020 and FP7 SOLARNET projects, metadata descriptions of Solar observations were only standardized for space-based observations, but the standards have been mostly within a single space mission at a time, at times with significant differences between different mission standards. In the context of ground-based Solar observations, data has typically not been made freely available to the general research community, resulting in an even greater lack of standards for metadata descriptions. This situation makes it difficult to construct multi-instrument archives/virtual observatories with anything more than the most basic metadata available for searching, as well as making it difficult to write generic software for instrument-agnostic data analysis. This document describes the metadata recommendations developed under the SOLARNET EU project, which aims foster more collaboration and data sharing between both ground-based and space-based Solar observatories. The recommendations will be followed by data pipelines developed under the SOLARNET project as well as e.g. the Solar Orbiter SPICE pipeline and the SST CHROMIS/CRISP common pipeline. These recommendations are meant to function as a common reference to which even existing diverse data sets may be related, for ingestion into solar virtual observatories and for analysis by generic software.</description>

      <title>Radial and Non-Radial Oscillations of Inverted Hybrid Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the radial and non-radial oscillations of Cross stars (CrSs), i.e., stars with a quark matter crust and a hadronic matter core in an inverted order compared to conventional hybrid stars. We draw comparisons of their oscillation modes with those of neutron stars, quark stars, and conventional hybrid stars. We find that the stellar stability analysis from the fundamental mode of radial oscillations, and the $g$, $f$ modes of non-radial oscillations are quite similar to those of conventional hybrid stars. However, due to the inverted stellar structure, the first non-radial $p$ mode of CrSs behaves in an inverted way and sits in a higher frequency domain compared to that of conventional hybrid stars. These results provide a direct way to discriminate CrSs from other types of compact stars via gravitational-wave probes. Specifically, compact stars emitting $g$-mode gravitational waves within the $0.5$-$1$ kHz range should be CrSs or conventional hybrid stars rather than neutron stars or pure quark stars, and a further GW detection of the first $p$ mode above 8 kHz or an identification of a decreasing trend of frequencies versus star masses associated with it will help identify the compact object to be a CrS rather than a conventional hybrid star.</description>

      <title>Eccentric Gas Disk Orbiting the White Dwarf SDSS J1228+1040</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal pollution onto white dwarfs is a wide-spread phenomenon that remains puzzling. Some of these white dwarfs also harbour gaseous debris disks. Emission lines from these disks open a unique window to the physical properties of the polluting material, lending insights to their origin. We model the emission line kinematics for the gas disk around SDSS J1228+1040, a system that has been monitored for over two decades. We show that the disk mass is strongly peaked at 1 solar radius (modulo the unknown inclination), and the disk eccentricity decreases from a value of 0.44 at the inner edge, to nearly zero at the outer edge. This eccentricity profile is exactly what one expects if the disk is in a global eccentric mode, precessing rigidly under general relativity and gas pressure. The precession period is about two decades. We infer that the mass of the gas disk is roughly equivalent to that of a 50-km rocky body, while the mass of the accompanying dust disk is likely insignificant. The disk eccentricity confirms an origin in tidal disruption, while the short disk diffusion time suggests that the disruption event happened a few centuries ago. Moreover, we argue that the initial orbit for the disrupted body, and that of its putative planetary perturber, fall within an AU around the white dwarf. The total mass of the source population is likely orders of magnitude more massive than our own Asteroid belt, and does not seem to exist around main-sequence stars.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Effect on Potential Barrier for Nucleosynthesis II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of magnetic fields on the potential barrier between two interacting nuclei. We addressed this by solving the Boltzmann equation and Maxwell's theory in the presence of a magnetic field, resulting in the determination of magnetized permittivity. Additionally, we derived the magnetized Debye potential, which combines the conventional Debye potential with an additional magnetic component. We then compared the Boltzmann approach with the Debye method. Both methods consistently demonstrate that magnetic fields increase permittivity. This enhanced permittivity leads to a reduction in the potential barrier, consequently increasing the reaction rate for nucleosynthesis. Furthermore, the dependence on temperature and electron density in each approach is consistent. Our findings suggest that magnetized plasmas, which have existed since the Big Bang, have played a crucial role in nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Dark Dragon Breaks Magnetic Chain: Dynamical Substructures of IRDC G28.34 Form in Supported Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have comprehensively studied the multi-scale physical properties of the infrared dark cloud (IRDC) G28.34 (the Dragon cloud) with dust polarization and molecular line data from Planck, FCRAO-14m, JCMT, and ALMA. We find that the averaged magnetic fields of clumps tend to be either parallel with or perpendicular to the cloud-scale magnetic fields, while the cores in clump MM4 tend to have magnetic fields aligned with the clump fields. Implementing the relative orientation analysis (for magnetic fields, column density gradients, and local gravity), Velocity Gradient Technique (VGT), and modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) analysis, we find that: G28.34 is located in a trans-to-sub-Alfv\'{e}nic environment ($\mathcal{M}_{A}=0.74$ within $r=15$ pc); the magnetic field is effectively resisting gravitational collapse in large-scale diffuse gas, but is distorted by gravity within the cloud and affected by star formation activities in high-density regions; and the normalized mass-to-flux ratio tends to increase with increasing density and decreasing radius. Considering the thermal, turbulent, and magnetic supports, we find that the environmental gas of G28.34 is in a super-virial (supported) state, the infrared dark clumps may be in a near-equilibrium state, and core MM4-core4 is in a sub-virial (gravity-dominant) state. In summary, we suggest that magnetic fields dominate gravity and turbulence in the cloud environment at large scales, resulting in relatively slow cloud formation and evolution processes. Within the cloud, gravity could overwhelm magnetic fields and turbulence, allowing local dynamical star formation to happen.</description>
