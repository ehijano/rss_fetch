      <title>A Domain Knowledge Informed Approach for Anomaly Detection of Electric Vehicle Interior Sounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of anomalies in automotive cabin sounds is critical for ensuring vehicle quality and maintaining passenger comfort. In many real-world settings, this task is more appropriately framed as an unsupervised learning problem rather than the supervised case due to the scarcity or complete absence of labeled faulty data. In such an unsupervised setting, the model is trained exclusively on healthy samples and detects anomalies as deviations from normal behavior. However, in the absence of labeled faulty samples for validation and the limited reliability of commonly used metrics, such as validation reconstruction error, effective model selection remains a significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, a domain-knowledge-informed approach for model selection is proposed, in which proxy-anomalies engineered through structured perturbations of healthy spectrograms are used in the validation set to support model selection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a high-fidelity electric vehicle dataset comprising healthy and faulty cabin sounds across five representative fault types viz., Imbalance, Modulation, Whine, Wind, and Pulse Width Modulation. This dataset, generated using advanced sound synthesis techniques, and validated via expert jury assessments, has been made publicly available to facilitate further research. Experimental evaluations on the five fault cases demonstrate the selection of optimal models using proxy-anomalies, significantly outperform conventional model selection strategies.</description>

      <title>Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Field-of-View Enhanced Signal-Dependent Binauralization of Moving Talkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13548v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel mixture of experts framework for field-of-view enhancement in binaural signal matching. Our approach enables dynamic spatial audio rendering that adapts to continuous talker motion, allowing users to emphasize or suppress sounds from selected directions while preserving natural binaural cues. Unlike traditional methods that rely on explicit direction-of-arrival estimation or operate in the Ambisonics domain, our signal-dependent framework combines multiple binaural filters in an online manner using implicit localization. This allows for real-time tracking and enhancement of moving sound sources, supporting applications such as speech focus, noise reduction, and world-locked audio in augmented and virtual reality. The method is agnostic to array geometry offering a flexible solution for spatial audio capture and personalized playback in next-generation consumer audio devices.</description>

      <title>Neural Speech Separation with Parallel Amplitude and Phase Spectrum Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes APSS, a novel neural speech separation model with parallel amplitude and phase spectrum estimation. Unlike most existing speech separation methods, the APSS distinguishes itself by explicitly estimating the phase spectrum for more complete and accurate separation. Specifically, APSS first extracts the amplitude and phase spectra from the mixed speech signal. Subsequently, the extracted amplitude and phase spectra are fused by a feature combiner into joint representations, which are then further processed by a deep processor with time-frequency Transformers to capture temporal and spectral dependencies. Finally, leveraging parallel amplitude and phase separators, the APSS estimates the respective spectra for each speaker from the resulting features, which are then combined via inverse short-time Fourier transform (iSTFT) to reconstruct the separated speech signals. Experimental results indicate that APSS surpasses both time-domain separation methods and implicit-phase-estimation-based time-frequency approaches. Also, APSS achieves stable and competitive results on multiple datasets, highlighting its strong generalization capability and practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Noise Supervised Contrastive Learning and Feature-Perturbed for Anomalous Sound Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13853v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomalous sound detection aims to detect unknown anomalous sounds by training a model using only normal audio data. Despite advancements in self-supervised methods, the issue of frequent false alarms when handling samples of the same type from different machines remains unresolved. This paper introduces a novel training technique called one-stage supervised contrastive learning (OS-SCL), which significantly addresses this problem by perturbing features in the embedding space and employing a one-stage noisy supervised contrastive learning approach. On the DCASE 2020 Challenge Task 2, it achieved 94.64\% AUC, 88.42\% pAUC, and 89.24\% mAUC using only Log-Mel features. Additionally, a time-frequency feature named TFgram is proposed, which is extracted from raw audio. This feature effectively captures critical information for anomalous sound detection, ultimately achieving 95.71\% AUC, 90.23\% pAUC, and 91.23\% mAUC.

      <title>RFM-Editing: Rectified Flow Matching for Text-guided Audio Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in text-to-audio generation. However, text-guided audio editing remains in its early stages. This task focuses on modifying the target content within an audio signal while preserving the rest, thus demanding precise localization and faithful editing according to the text prompt. Existing training-based and zero-shot methods that rely on full-caption or costly optimization often struggle with complex editing or lack practicality. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end efficient rectified flow matching-based diffusion framework for audio editing, and construct a dataset featuring overlapping multi-event audio to support training and benchmarking in complex scenarios. Experiments show that our model achieves faithful semantic alignment without requiring auxiliary captions or masks, while maintaining competitive editing quality across metrics.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Evaluation of CNN-Based Audio Tagging Models on Resource-Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in audio tagging tasks. However, deploying these models on resource-constrained devices like the Raspberry Pi poses challenges related to computational efficiency and thermal management. In this paper, a comprehensive evaluation of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for audio tagging on the Raspberry Pi is conducted, encompassing all 1D and 2D models from the Pretrained Audio Neural Networks (PANNs) framework, a ConvNeXt-based model adapted for audio classification, as well as MobileNetV3 architectures. In addition, two PANNs-derived networks, CNN9 and CNN13, recently proposed, are also evaluated. To enhance deployment efficiency and portability across diverse hardware platforms, all models are converted to the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format. Unlike previous works that focus on a single model, our analysis encompasses a broader range of architectures and involves continuous 24-hour inference sessions to assess performance stability. Our experiments reveal that, with appropriate model selection and optimization, it is possible to maintain consistent inference latency and manage thermal behavior effectively over extended periods. These findings provide valuable insights for deploying audio tagging models in real-world edge computing scenarios.</description>

      <title>AnyAccomp: Generalizable Accompaniment Generation via Quantized Melodic Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singing Accompaniment Generation (SAG) is the process of generating instrumental music for a given clean vocal input. However, existing SAG techniques use source-separated vocals as input and overfit to separation artifacts. This creates a critical train-test mismatch, leading to failure on clean, real-world vocal inputs. We introduce AnyAccomp, a framework that resolves this by decoupling accompaniment generation from source-dependent artifacts. AnyAccomp first employs a quantized melodic bottleneck, using a chromagram and a VQ-VAE to extract a discrete and timbre-invariant representation of the core melody. A subsequent flow-matching model then generates the accompaniment conditioned on these robust codes. Experiments show AnyAccomp achieves competitive performance on separated-vocal benchmarks while significantly outperforming baselines on generalization test sets of clean studio vocals and, notably, solo instrumental tracks. This demonstrates a qualitative leap in generalization, enabling robust accompaniment for instruments - a task where existing models completely fail - and paving the way for more versatile music co-creation tools.

      <title>Enhancing Speaker-Independent Dysarthric Speech Severity Classification with DSSCNet and Cross-Corpus Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dysarthric speech severity classification is crucial for objective clinical assessment and progress monitoring in individuals with motor speech disorders. Although prior methods have addressed this task, achieving robust generalization in speaker-independent (SID) scenarios remains challenging. This work introduces DSSCNet, a novel deep neural architecture that combines Convolutional, Squeeze-Excitation (SE), and Residual network, helping it extract discriminative representations of dysarthric speech from mel spectrograms. The addition of SE block selectively focuses on the important features of the dysarthric speech, thereby minimizing loss and enhancing overall model performance. We also propose a cross-corpus fine-tuning framework for severity classification, adapted from detection-based transfer learning approaches. DSSCNet is evaluated on two benchmark dysarthric speech corpora: TORGO and UA-Speech under speaker-independent evaluation protocols: One-Speaker-Per-Severity (OSPS) and Leave-One-Speaker-Out (LOSO) protocols. DSSCNet achieves accuracies of 56.84% and 62.62% under OSPS and 63.47% and 64.18% under LOSO setting on TORGO and UA-Speech respectively outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Upon fine-tuning, the performance improves substantially, with DSSCNet achieving up to 75.80% accuracy on TORGO and 68.25% on UA-Speech in OSPS, and up to 77.76% and 79.44%, respectively, in LOSO. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of DSSCNet for fine-grained severity classification across diverse dysarthric speech datasets.</description>

      <title>Invisible Ears at Your Fingertips: Acoustic Eavesdropping via Mouse Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern optical mouse sensors, with their advanced precision and high responsiveness, possess an often overlooked vulnerability: they can be exploited for side-channel attacks. This paper introduces Mic-E-Mouse, the first-ever side-channel attack that targets high-performance optical mouse sensors to covertly eavesdrop on users. We demonstrate that audio signals can induce subtle surface vibrations detectable by a mouse's optical sensor. Remarkably, user-space software on popular operating systems can collect and broadcast this sensitive side channel, granting attackers access to raw mouse data without requiring direct system-level permissions. Initially, the vibration signals extracted from mouse data are of poor quality due to non-uniform sampling, a non-linear frequency response, and significant quantization. To overcome these limitations, Mic-E-Mouse employs a sophisticated end-to-end data filtering pipeline that combines Wiener filtering, resampling corrections, and an innovative encoder-only spectrogram neural filtering technique. We evaluate the attack's efficacy across diverse conditions, including speaking volume, mouse polling rate and DPI, surface materials, speaker languages, and environmental noise. In controlled environments, Mic-E-Mouse improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by up to +19 dB for speech reconstruction. Furthermore, our results demonstrate a speech recognition accuracy of roughly 42% to 61% on the AudioMNIST and VCTK datasets. All our code and datasets are publicly accessible on https://sites.google.com/view/mic-e-mouse.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Low-Rank Adapter Experts in Generalizable Audio Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models such as Wav2Vec2 excel at representation learning in speech tasks, including audio deepfake detection. However, after being fine-tuned on a fixed set of bonafide and spoofed audio clips, they often fail to generalize to novel deepfake methods not represented in training. To address this, we propose a mixture-of-LoRA-experts approach that integrates multiple low-rank adapters (LoRA) into the model's attention layers. A routing mechanism selectively activates specialized experts, enhancing adaptability to evolving deepfake attacks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms standard fine-tuning in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, reducing equal error rates relative to baseline models. Notably, our best MoE-LoRA model lowers the average out-of-domain EER from 8.55\% to 6.08\%, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving generalizable audio deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>DSpAST: Disentangled Representations for Spatial Audio Reasoning with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning about spatial audio with large language models requires a spatial audio encoder as an acoustic front-end to obtain audio embeddings for further processing. Such an encoder needs to capture all information required to detect the type of sound events, as well as the direction and distance of their corresponding sources. Accomplishing this with a single audio encoder is demanding as the information required for each of these tasks is mostly independent of each other. As a result, the performance obtained with a single encoder is often worse than when using task-specific audio encoders. In this work, we present DSpAST, a novel audio encoder based on SpatialAST that learns disentangled representations of spatial audio while having only 0.2% additional parameters. Experiments on SpatialSoundQA with the spatial audio reasoning system BAT demonstrate that DSpAST significantly outperforms SpatialAST.</description>

      <title>Network representations reveal structured uncertainty in music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music, as a structured yet perceptually rich experience, can be modeled as a network to uncover how humans encode and process auditory information. While network-based representations of music are increasingly common, the impact of feature selection on structural properties and cognitive alignment remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluated eight network models, each constructed from symbolic representations of piano compositions using distinct combinations of pitch, octave, duration, and interval, designed to be representative of existing approaches in the literature. By comparing these models through topological metrics, entropy analysis, and divergence with respect to inferred cognitive representations, we assessed both their structural and perceptual efficiency. Our findings reveal that simpler, feature-specific models better match human perception, whereas complex, multidimensional representations introduce cognitive inefficiencies. These results support the view that humans rely on modular, parallel cognitive networks--an architecture consistent with theories of predictive processing and free energy minimization. Moreover, we find that musical networks are structurally organized to guide attention toward transitions that are both uncertain and inferable. The resulting structure concentrates uncertainty in a few frequently visited nodes, creating local entropy gradients that alternate between stable and unpredictable regions, thereby enabling the expressive dynamics of tension and release that define the musical experience. These findings show that network structures make the organization of uncertainty in music observable, offering new insight into how patterned flows of expectation shape perception, and open new directions for studying how musical structures evolve across genres, cultures, and historical periods through the lens of network science.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Implicit Neural Network for Binaural Audio Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity binaural audio synthesis is crucial for immersive listening, but existing methods require extensive computational resources, limiting their edge-device application. To address this, we propose the Lightweight Implicit Neural Network (LINN), a novel two-stage framework. LINN first generates initial estimates using a time-domain warping, which is then refined by an Implicit Binaural Corrector (IBC) module. IBC is an implicit neural network that predicts amplitude and phase corrections directly, resulting in a highly compact model architecture. Experimental results show that LINN achieves statistically comparable perceptual quality to the best-performing baseline model while significantly improving computational efficiency. Compared to the most efficient existing method, LINN achieves a 72.7% reduction in parameters and significantly fewer compute operations (MACs). This demonstrates that our approach effectively addresses the trade-off between synthesis quality and computational efficiency, providing a new solution for high-fidelity edge-device spatial audio applications.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Fourier-based Network for Binaural Speech Enhancement with Spatial Cue Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binaural speech enhancement faces a severe trade-off challenge, where state-of-the-art performance is achieved by computationally intensive architectures, while lightweight solutions often come at the cost of significant performance degradation. To bridge this gap, we propose the Global Adaptive Fourier Network (GAF-Net), a lightweight deep complex network that aims to establish a balance between performance and computational efficiency. The GAF-Net architecture consists of three components. First, a dual-feature encoder combining short-time Fourier transform and gammatone features enhances the robustness of acoustic representation. Second, a channel-independent globally adaptive Fourier modulator efficiently captures long-term temporal dependencies while preserving the spatial cues. Finally, a dynamic gating mechanism is implemented to reduce processing artifacts. Experimental results show that GAF-Net achieves competitive performance, particularly in terms of binaural cues (ILD and IPD error) and objective intelligibility (MBSTOI), with fewer parameters and computational cost. These results confirm that GAF-Net provides a feasible way to achieve high-fidelity binaural processing on resource-constrained devices.</description>

      <title>CS-FLEURS: A Massively Multilingual and Code-Switched Speech Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present CS-FLEURS, a new dataset for developing and evaluating code-switched speech recognition and translation systems beyond high-resourced languages. CS-FLEURS consists of 4 test sets which cover in total 113 unique code-switched language pairs across 52 languages: 1) a 14 X-English language pair set with real voices reading synthetically generated code-switched sentences, 2) a 16 X-English language pair set with generative text-to-speech 3) a 60 {Arabic, Mandarin, Hindi, Spanish}-X language pair set with the generative text-to-speech, and 4) a 45 X-English lower-resourced language pair test set with concatenative text-to-speech. Besides the four test sets, CS-FLEURS also provides a training set with 128 hours of generative text-to-speech data across 16 X-English language pairs. Our hope is that CS-FLEURS helps to broaden the scope of future code-switched speech research. Dataset link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/byan/cs-fleurs.</description>

      <title>Video-Foley: Two-Stage Video-To-Sound Generation via Temporal Event Condition For Foley Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foley sound synthesis is crucial for multimedia production, enhancing user experience by synchronizing audio and video both temporally and semantically. Recent studies on automating this labor-intensive process through video-to-sound generation face significant challenges. Systems lacking explicit temporal features suffer from poor alignment and controllability, while timestamp-based models require costly and subjective human annotation. We propose Video-Foley, a video-to-sound system using Root Mean Square (RMS) as an intuitive condition with semantic timbre prompts (audio or text). RMS, a frame-level intensity envelope closely related to audio semantics, acts as a temporal event feature to guide audio generation from video. The annotation-free self-supervised learning framework consists of two stages, Video2RMS and RMS2Sound, incorporating novel ideas including RMS discretization and RMS-ControlNet with a pretrained text-to-audio model. Our extensive evaluation shows that Video-Foley achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio-visual alignment and controllability for sound timing, intensity, timbre, and nuance. Source code, model weights and demos are available on our companion website. (https://jnwnlee.github.io/video-foley-demo)</description>

      <title>Spike Encoding for Environmental Sound: A Comparative Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer energy efficient processing suitable for edge applications, but conventional sensor data must first be converted into spike trains for neuromorphic processing. Environmental sound, including urban soundscapes, poses challenges due to variable frequencies, background noise, and overlapping acoustic events, while most spike based audio encoding research has focused on speech. This paper analyzes three spike encoding methods, Threshold Adaptive Encoding (TAE), Step Forward (SF), and Moving Window (MW) across three datasets: ESC10, UrbanSound8K, and TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes. Our multiband analysis shows that TAE consistently outperforms SF and MW in reconstruction quality, both per frequency band and per class across datasets. Moreover, TAE yields the lowest spike firing rates, indicating superior energy efficiency. For downstream environmental sound classification with a standard SNN, TAE also achieves the best performance among the compared encoders. Overall, this work provides foundational insights and a comparative benchmark to guide the selection of spike encoders for neuromorphic environmental sound processing.</description>

      <title>ECHO: Frequency-aware Hierarchical Encoding for Variable-length Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-trained foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in audio, vision and language, yet their potential for general machine signal modeling with arbitrary sampling rates-covering acoustic, vibration, and other industrial sensor data-remains under-explored. In this work, we propose a novel foundation model ECHO that integrates an advanced band-split architecture with frequency positional embeddings, enabling spectral localization across arbitrary sampling configurations. Moreover, the model incorporates sliding patches to support inputs of variable length without padding or cropping, producing a concise embedding that retains both temporal and spectral fidelity and naturally extends to streaming scenarios. We evaluate our method on various kinds of machine signal datasets, including previous DCASE task 2 challenges (2020-2025), and widely-used industrial signal corpora. Experimental results demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance in machine signal anomaly detection and fault classification, confirming the effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed model. We open-sourced ECHO on https://github.com/yucongzh/ECHO.</description>

      <title>Omni-CLST: Error-aware Curriculum Learning with guided Selective chain-of-Thought for audio question answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid progress of large audio-language models (LALMs), audio question answering (AQA) has emerged as a challenging task requiring both fine-grained audio understanding and complex reasoning. While current methods mainly rely on constructing new datasets via captioning or reasoning traces, existing high-quality AQA data remains underutilized. To address this, we propose Omni-CLST, an error-aware Curriculum Learning framework with guided Selective Chain-of-Thought. The framework efficiently leverages existing high-quality dataset through two key strategies: an error-aware curriculum that organizes samples by difficulty, and a guided thought dropout mechanism that focuses reasoning on challenging cases. Experiments show that Omni-CLST achieves 73.80% on MMAU-mini and a new state of the art of 64.30% on MMAR, demonstrating robust generalization in multimodal audio-language understanding.</description>

      <title>KALL-E:Autoregressive Speech Synthesis with Next-Distribution Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce KALL-E, a novel autoregressive (AR) language model for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis that operates by predicting the next distribution of continuous speech frames. Unlike existing methods, KALL-E directly models the continuous speech distribution conditioned on text, eliminating the need for any diffusion-based components. Specifically, we utilize a Flow-VAE to extract a continuous latent speech representation from waveforms, instead of relying on discrete speech tokens. A single AR Transformer is then trained to predict these continuous speech distributions from text, optimizing a Kullback-Leibler divergence loss as its objective. Experimental results demonstrate that KALL-E achieves superior speech synthesis quality and can even adapt to a target speaker from just a single sample. Importantly, KALL-E provides a more direct and effective approach for utilizing continuous speech representations in TTS.</description>

      <title>MAVL: A Multilingual Audio-Video Lyrics Dataset for Animated Song Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18614v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lyrics translation requires both accurate semantic transfer and preservation of musical rhythm, syllabic structure, and poetic style. In animated musicals, the challenge intensifies due to alignment with visual and auditory cues. We introduce Multilingual Audio-Video Lyrics Benchmark for Animated Song Translation (MAVL), the first multilingual, multimodal benchmark for singable lyrics translation. By integrating text, audio, and video, MAVL enables richer and more expressive translations than text-only approaches. Building on this, we propose Syllable-Constrained Audio-Video LLM with Chain-of-Thought SylAVL-CoT, which leverages audio-video cues and enforces syllabic constraints to produce natural-sounding lyrics. Experimental results demonstrate that SylAVL-CoT significantly outperforms text-based models in singability and contextual accuracy, emphasizing the value of multimodal, multilingual approaches for lyrics translation.</description>

      <title>Empathy Omni: Enabling Empathetic Speech Response Generation through Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can now interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models only convert response content into speech without fully capturing the rich emotional cues in user queries, where the same sentence may convey different meanings depending on the expression. Emotional understanding is thus essential for improving human-machine interaction. Most empathetic speech LLMs rely on massive datasets, demanding high computational cost. A key challenge is to build models that generate empathetic responses with limited data and without large-scale training. To this end, we propose Emotion Omni, a model that understands emotional content in user speech and generates empathetic responses. We further developed a data pipeline to construct a 200k emotional dialogue dataset supporting empathetic speech assistants. Experiments show that Emotion Omni achieves comparable instruction-following ability without large-scale pretraining, while surpassing existing models in speech quality (UTMOS:4.41) and empathy (Emotion GPT Score: 3.97). These results confirm its improvements in both speech fidelity and emotional expressiveness. Demos are available at https://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/.</description>
