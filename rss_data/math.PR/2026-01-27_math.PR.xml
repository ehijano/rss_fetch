      <title>Beyond Wald's Equation and the Optional Sampling Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the perspective of expectations of randomly stopped sums, Wald's equation and the Optional Sampling Theorem identify situations in which the stopping time can be decoupled from the stopping place, acting as if the two were independent. Herein we consider arbitrary mean zero Martingales and their extended-valued stopping times, proving two fundamental theorems and a general corollary. Examples, counter-examples and discussion are also included.
  The first theorem establishes conditions under which a stopped martingale's expected value can be characterized by a finite real number, also yielding a new expectation limit. Two corollaries and an application provide information on the rate of decay of the tail probability of the stopping time.
  The second theorem provides sufficient conditions to ensure that an extended-valued stopping time is finite with probability one. We demonstrate these results through various examples and explore their implications for different families of martingales. Our findings extend classical results in martingale theory and provide new insights into the behavior of stopped martingales, especially when the expected values are the stopped Martingale on the set where the extended-valued stopping time $T$ is finite is different from the expected value of the Martingale at time 1.</description>

      <title>Conditional Reflected Backward Stochastic Differential Equations with Two Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the doubly conditional reflected backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), where constraints are made on the conditional expectation of the first component of the solution with respect to a general subfiltration. With the help of the Skorokhod problem on a time-dependent interval and the Dynkin game in a general framework, we establish the existence and uniqueness result under the Mokobodski condition for the obstacles. The relation between the conditional expectation of the solution and the value function of a certain Dynkin game with partial information is obtained. As a by-product, we obtain a weaker version of the comparison theorem. Finally, we provide an application to the starting and stopping problem in reversible investments under partial information.</description>

      <title>Planar diffusions with a point interaction on a finite time horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The skew-product diffusion [Ann. Appl. Probab. 35, 3150--3214 (2025)] and exponentially tilted planar Brownian motion [Electron. J. Probab. 30, 1--97 (2025)] are canonical examples of planar diffusions with a point interaction at the origin in the sense that their drifts are singular only at the origin and allow visits there with positive probability. However, in this article we propose an axiomatic framework for such diffusions on a finite time horizon. We isolate admissibility conditions and additional regularity hypotheses on a general driving family under which the associated diffusion, constructed as a Doob transform of point-interaction Schr\"odinger semigroup kernels, exhibits the same point interaction structure. In particular, for the ground-state driving family, we obtain a heuristic alternative construction of the skew-product diffusion based on Kolmogorov continuity arguments. We also consider formal applications of this framework to some driving families generated by measures, including the Lebesgue-driven diffusion, which is the exponentially tilted planar Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and Long-Time Stability of Multivariate Ensemble Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17392v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a self contained stochastic perturbation theory for discrete generation and multivariate Ensemble Kalman filters. Unlike their continuous-time counterparts, discrete EnKF algorithms are defined through a two steps prediction update mechanism and exhibit non Gaussian fluctuations, even in linear settings. In the multivariate case, these fluctuations take the form of non central Wishart type perturbations, which significantly complicate the mathematical analysis. We establish non asymptotic, time-uniform stability and error estimates for the ensemble covariance matrix processes under minimal structural assumptions on the signal observation model, allowing for possibly unstable dynamics. Our results quantify the impact of ensemble size, dimension, and observation noise, and provide explicit bounds on the propagation of stochastic errors over long time horizons. The analysis relies on a detailed study of stochastic Riccati difference equations driven by matrix-valued noncentral Wishart fluctuations. Beyond their relevance to data assimilation, these results contribute to the probabilistic understanding of ensemble-based filtering methods in high dimension and offer new tools for the analysis of interacting particle systems with matrix-valued dynamics.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for some transform orders based on the quantile density ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on providing sufficient conditions for some transform orders for which the quantile densities ratio is non-monotone and, therefore, the convex transform order does not hold. These results are interesting for comparing random variables with a non-explicit expression of their quantile functions or they are computationally complex. In addition, the main results are applied to compare two Tukey generalized distributed random variables and to establish new relationships among non-monotone and positive aging notions.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional and planar random motions with variable propagation speeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study univariate and planar random motions with variable propagation speeds. We first consider motions with space-varying velocity, which can be reduced to constant-velocity motions by means of suitable nonlinear transformations. We examine a special case of a motion which is confined within the unit interval. To provide a general expression of the moments of this process, we introduce a new family of polynomials which generalize the classical Euler polynomials. We then examine a planar extension of this process which moves along orthogonal directions. A process with velocity depending on the direction is also examined, and its mean conditional on the initial direction and the number of direction changes is given in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions. We conjecture that, in the hydrodynamic limit, this process is absorbed at a point in an arbitrarily small time. We finally study a motion with time-dependent velocity. We prove that this process can be represented as an integral with respect to a standard telegraph process, and we obtain its covariance function explicitly. Moreover, we show that this process behaves as a It\^{o} integral with respect to Brownian motion in the hydrodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Exact Recovery in the Geometric Hidden Community Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hidden community problems, such as community detection in the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), submatrix localization, and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ synchronization, have received considerable attention in the probability, statistics, and information-theory literature. Motivated by transitive behavior in social networks, which tend to exhibit high triangle density, recent works have considered hidden community models in spatially-embedded networks. In particular, Baccelli and Sankararaman proposed the Geometric SBM, a spatially-embedded analogue of the standard SBM with dramatically more triangles. In this paper, we consider the problem of exact recovery for the Geometric Hidden Community Model (GHCM) of Gaudio, Guan, Niu, and Wei, which generalizes the Geometric SBM to allow for arbitrary pairwise observation distributions. Under mild technical assumptions, we find the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery in the ``distance-dependent'' GHCM, which allows the pairwise distributions to depend on distance as well as community labels, thus completing the picture of exact recovery in spatially-embedded hidden community models.</description>

      <title>Balanced weighted Motzkin paths: Pearson structure and saddlepoint asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse weighted Motzkin paths with step multiplicities that vary linearly with height. In the balanced case the associated exponential generating function satisfies a Pearson-type PDE, and solving by characteristics yields closed expressions in all drift regimes. These formulas reveal a moving algebraic singularity that governs both local and global behaviour. Locally this gives a Gaussian central window for the terminal-height distribution, while globally we identify an explicit limit cumulant generating function and prove an $n$-speed large-deviation principle. For finite $n$, Daniels' lattice saddlepoint approximation provides a single formula that is accurate across the full range of $k$; in all quadratic regimes it achieves a uniform interior relative error of order $n^{-1}$. The results link Pearson geometry with uniform saddlepoint methods and extend naturally to other weighted path models and tridiagonal recurrences.</description>

      <title>A note on continuous data assimilation for stochastic convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations in 2D and 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous data assimilation (CDA) methods, such as the nudging algorithm introduced by Azouani, Olson, and Titi (AOT), have proven to be highly effective in deterministic settings for asymptotically synchronizing approximate solutions with observed dynamics. In this note, we introduce and analyze an algorithm for CDA for the two- and three-dimensional stochastic convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations (CBFEs) driven by either additive or multiplicative Gaussian noise. The model is believed to provide an accurate description when the flow velocity exceeds the regime of validity of Darcy's law and the porosity remains moderately large. We derive sufficient conditions on the nudging parameter and the spatial resolution of observations that ensure convergence of the assimilated solution to the true stochastic flow. We demonstrate convergence in the mean-square sense, and additionally establish pathwise convergence in the presence of additive noise. The CBFEs, also known as Navier-Stokes equations with damping, exhibit enhanced stability properties due to the presence of nonlinear damping term. In particular, we show that nonlinear damping not only enables the implementation of CDA in three dimensions but also yields improved convergence results in two dimensions when compared to the classical Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Doeblin's condition, $\rho$-mixing and spectra of convolution operators on the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of Markov operators $P_\mu$ defined by convolution with a probability measure $\mu$ on the unit circle $\mathbb T$. We prove that when $\mu$ is adapted, $P_\mu$ satisfies Doeblin's condition if and only if some power $\mu^k$ is non-singular. We give an example of a symmetric probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb T$, such that the reversible stationary chain induced by $P_\mu$ is $\rho$-mixing, but $P_\mu$
  does not satisfy Doeblin's condition. We look at the spectra of $P_\mu$ in the different $L_p$ spaces when $P_\mu$ is, or is not, $\rho$-mixing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the central limit theorem of the additive functional of the nearest-neighbor zero-range process given in \cite{Quastel2002} to the long-range case. Our main results show that in several cases the limit processes are driven by fractional Brownian motions with Hurst parameters in $(1/2, 3/4]$. A local central limit theorem of the long-range random walk and a relaxation to equilibrium theorem of the long-range zero-range process play the key roles in the proofs of our main results.</description>

      <title>A PDE Derivation of the Schr\"odinger--Bass Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short paper announces the main results of \cite{SBB2026}, where the Schr\"odinger--Bass Bridge (SBB) problem is introduced and studied in full generality. Here we provide a direct PDE derivation of the SBB system in dimension one, showing how the optimal coupling problem that interpolates between the classical Schr\"odinger bridge and the Bass martingale transport can be solved explicitly via Legendre transforms and the heat equation. A key insight is that the optimal SBB process is a Stretched Schr\"odinger Bridge: the composition of a monotone transport map with a Schr\"odinger bridge. This extends the stretched Brownian motion representation of Bass martingales to the semimartingale setting and provides a unified framework that recovers both the Sinkhorn algorithm (in the limit $\beta \to \infty$) and the Bass construction (as $\beta \to 0$). We refer to \cite{SBB2026} for complete proofs, the multidimensional setting, strong duality, dual attainment, and further developments.</description>

      <title>Once-reinforced random walk in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the once-reinforced random walk on $\mathbb Z^d$, which is a self-interacting walk that has a higher probability to cross edges that were already visited. We prove that the walk is transient when $d\ge 6$ and when the reinforcement is small, establishing a conjecture of Sidoravicius in these dimensions. Moreover, in this case we prove that the walk behaves diffusively and can be coupled with Brownian motion.
  One of the main ideas in the proof is a certain capacity estimate which shows that the trajectory of the walk is nowhere heavy. We also use a game-theoretic-type ingredient that we call ``the demon" to force spatial independence in the process.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and weak mixing for group-indexed infinitely divisible stationary processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for an arbitrary indexing group, every ergodic infinitely divisible stationary process that is separable in probability is weakly mixing. This shows that, as in the well-known case of Gaussian stationary processes, ergodicity implies weak mixing is intrinsic to infinite divisibility, removing all structural assumptions on the group from prior results. The main ingredient is a general construction of stochastically continuous extensions for separable in probability stationary processes, reducing the problem to stochastically continuous processes indexed by Polish groups and then to countable groups, where we combine the Maruyama representation with an ergodicity criterion for Poisson suspensions.</description>

      <title>A new fine-scale Berry-Esseen-type Gumbel-limit theorem for multivariate maxima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $d \geq 2$ and i.i.d. $d$-dimensional observations $\mathbf{X}^{(1)}, \mathbf{X}^{(2)}, \ldots$ with independent Exponential$(1)$ coordinates, let $\varphi_n$ denote the minimum $\ell^1$-norm among the maxima of $\{\mathbf{X}^{(1)}, \ldots, \mathbf{X}^{(n)}\}$. (A _maximum_ from this set is an observation $\mathbf{X}^{(k)}$ with $1 \leq k \leq n$ such that $\mathbf{X}^{(k)} \not\prec \mathbf{X}^{(i)}$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$, where $\mathbf{x} \prec \mathbf{y}$ means that $x_j &lt; y_j$ for $1 \leq j \leq d$.) Key roles in the study of multivariate Pareto records are played by $\varphi_n$ and by the more easily handled maximum with the maximum $\ell^1$-norm. Fill, Naiman, and Sun (2024) proved that \[ \varphi_n = \ln n - \ln \ln \ln n - \ln(d - 1) + O_{\mathrm{p}}\!\left( \frac{1}{\ln \ln n} \right), \] where $Z_n = O_{\mathrm{p}}(a_n)$ means that $Z_n / a_n$ is bounded in probability, and conjectured that \[ (\ln \ln n) \left(\varphi_n - [\ln n - \ln \ln \ln n - \ln(d - 1)] \right) \] has a nondegenerate limiting distribution, suggesting that the limiting distribution might be that of $ - G$, where $G$ has a Gumbel distribution with location $ - \frac{\ln[(d - 1)!]}{d - 1}$ and scale $\frac{1}{d - 1}$. In the present paper we prove a Berry-Esseen-type theorem for this convergence in distribution, thereby establishing a very sharp result for $\varphi_n$.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for non linear (compound marked) Hawkes processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we fill a gap in the literature on Hawkes processes. In particular, we derive a CLT for a non linear compound marked Hawkes process. We also provide an upper bound on the convergence rate using the functional 1-Wasserstein distance. This result is obtained by discretizing the time line and reducing the problem to the quantification of the distance between finite marginal vectors, as well as between the discretized process and the original one.</description>

      <title>Functional Large Deviations for Wide Deep Neural Networks with Gaussian Initialization and Lipschitz Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a functional large deviation principle for fully connected multi-layer perceptrons with i.i.d. Gaussian weights (LeCun initialization) and general Lipschitz activation functions, including therefore the popular case of ReLU. The large deviation principle holds for the entire network output process on any compact input set. The proof combines exponential tightness for recursively defined processes, finite-dimensional large deviations, and the Dawson-G\"artner theorem, extending existing results beyond finite input sets and less general activations.</description>

      <title>On the inclusion of bounded harmonic functions of random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the conditions under which the space of bounded harmonic functions of a probability measure $\mu$ on a group $G$ is contained in that of another measure $\theta$. We establish that asymptotic commutativity, defined by the condition $\|\mu^{*t}*\theta - \theta*\mu^{*t}\|_{TV} \to 0$ as $t \to \infty$, is sufficient to guarantee the inclusion $H^\infty(G, \mu) \subseteq H^\infty(G, \theta)$, provided $\theta$ is absolutely continuous with respect to a convex combination of convolution powers of $\mu$. By employing martingale convergence techniques rather than ergodic-theoretic arguments, we demonstrate that this result holds without topological assumptions on $G$ (such as local compactness) and extends to general Markov chains. Furthermore, utilizing hitting models for the Poisson boundary, we characterise the inclusion $H^\infty(G, \mu) \subseteq H^\infty(G, \theta)$ as equivalent to the asymptotic invariance of $\theta$ under $\mu$ in the weak* topology. We apply these results to provide a probabilistic proof of the Choquet-Deny theorem for nilpotent groups, among other applications.</description>

      <title>Validity of the stochastic Ginzburg-Landau approximation in higher space dimensions -A Wiener algebra approach-</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an anisotropic $d$-dimensional Swift-Hohenberg model $ \mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^2) $-close to the first instability, where $ 0 &lt; \varepsilon \ll 1 $ is a small perturbation parameter. This model for pattern formation is perturbed with additive noise in time and space. By a multiple scaling ansatz we derive a stochastic $ d $-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau equation for the approximate description of the bifurcating solutions. We prove the validity of the approximation by this amplitude equation on its natural time scale in case of $ d $-dimensional periodic domains of length $ \mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon) $ for the Swift-Hohenberg model under suitable conditions on the additive noise. In detail, we prove the validity of this approximation for noise whose set of Fourier coefficients with respect to $ x $ is in $ \ell^1 $ for fixed $ t \geq 0 $. Moreover, we improve existing approximation results in the sense that the stable part of the noise can be larger.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a pedagogical probabilistic exploration of the Newton-Girard identities. We show that the coefficients in these classical relations between power sums and elementary symmetric polynomials can be interpreted as the stable limits of integrals over the unit cube, and as ratios of moments of simple probability distributions. Several classes of integrals are studied, including trigonometric and multiplicative forms. In addition, we discuss the spectral implications via the Le Verrier-Souriau-Faddeev algorithm and Random Matrix Theory, providing a unified framework for the asymptotic algebraic behavior of these identities. While the identities are classical, the probabilistic interpretation of the limits of their normalized forms is the specific focus of the present work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a Poisson approximation result for dependent thinnings of Gibbs point processes as well as qualitative and quantitative central limit theorems for geometric functionals of Gibbs point processes in increasing observation windows. The present paper extends prior work on finite-range Gibbs processes to processes with repulsive pairwise interaction of unbounded interaction range as well as processes on marked Euclidean space. The proofs rely on coupling different Gibbs processes using the disagreement coupling technique, which we generalize to infinite-volume domains under a suitable non-percolation condition. For the case of repulsive pairwise interactions, we introduce a version of disagreement coupling that constructs the Gibbs process by thinning a random connection model thus making previous approximation methods more flexible.</description>

      <title>The Blown Lead Paradox: Conditional Laws for the Running Maximum of Binary Doob Martingales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Live win-probability forecasts are now ubiquitous in sports broadcasts, and retrospective commentary often cites the largest win probability attained by a team that ultimately loses as evidence of a "collapse." Interpreting such extrema requires a reference distribution under correct specification. Modeling the forecast sequence as the Doob martingale of conditional win probabilities for a binary terminal outcome, we derive sharp distributional laws for its path maximum, including the conditional law given an eventual loss. In discrete time, we quantify explicit correction terms (last-step crossings and overshoots); under continuous-path regularity these corrections disappear, yielding exact identities. We further obtain closed-form distributions for two extensions: the maximal win probability attained by the eventual loser in a two-player game and the minimal win probability attained by the eventual winner in an n-player game. The resulting formulas furnish practical benchmarks for diagnosing sequential forecast calibration.</description>

      <title>Weighted Birkhoff averages: Deterministic and probabilistic perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03210v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we survey physically related applications of a class of weighted quasi-Monte Carlo methods from a theoretical, deterministic perspective, and establish quantitative universal rapid convergence results via various regularity assumptions. Specifically, we introduce weighting with compact support to the Birkhoff ergodic averages of quasi-periodic, almost periodic, and periodic systems, thereby achieving universal rapid convergence, including both arbitrary polynomial and exponential types. This is in stark contrast to the typically slow convergence in classical ergodic theory. As new contributions, we not only discuss more general weighting functions but also provide quantitative improvements to existing results; the explicit regularity settings facilitate the application of these methods to specific problems. We also revisit the physically related problems and, for the first time, establish universal exponential convergence results for the weighted computation of Fourier coefficients, in both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional cases. In addition to the above, we explore results from a probabilistic perspective, including the weighted strong law of large numbers and the weighted central limit theorem, by building upon the historical results.</description>

      <title>Superpixel-Based Image Segmentation Using Squared 2-Wasserstein Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient method for image segmentation in the presence of strong inhomogeneities. The approach can be interpreted as a two-level clustering procedure: pixels are first grouped into superpixels via a linear least-squares assignment problem, which can be viewed as a special case of a discrete optimal transport (OT) problem, and these superpixels are subsequently greedily merged into object-level segments using the squared 2-Wasserstein distance between their empirical distributions. In contrast to conventional superpixel merging strategies based on mean-color distances, our framework employs a distributional OT distance, yielding a mathematically unified formulation across both clustering levels. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this perspective leads to improved segmentation accuracy on challenging images while retaining high computational efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an intrinsic reconstruction of Riemannian geometry from a symmetric, strongly local diffusion semigroup. Starting from a diffusion operator and its associated first- and second-order diffusion calculus, we recover the full weighted Riemannian structure of the underlying manifold. In particular, we show that the carre du champ determines a unique smooth Riemannian metric, that the iterated carre du champ encodes curvature, and that the symmetry of the diffusion fixes the Levi-Civita connection and reference measure. As a consequence, the diffusion semigroup determines the global Riemannian manifold uniquely up to isometry. The results provide an information-theoretic perspective on differential geometry in which geometric structure emerges from the intrinsic behavior of diffusion, without assuming any prior metric or coordinate description.</description>

      <title>A New Look at the Ensemble Kalman Filter for Inverse Problems: Duality, Non-Asymptotic Analysis and Convergence Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents new results and understanding of the Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for inverse problems. In particular, using a Lagrangian dual perspective we show that EnKF can be derived from the sample average approximation (SAA) of the Lagrangian dual function. The beauty of this new duality perspective is that it facilitates us to prove and numerically verify a novel non-asymptotic convergence result for the EnKF. Motivated by the new perspective, we also present a new convergence improvement strategy for the Ensemble Kalman Inversion Algorithm (EnKI), which is an iterative version of the EnKF for inverse problems. In particular, we propose an adaptive multiplicative correction to the sample covariance matrix at each iteration and we call this new algorithm as EnKI-MC (I). Based on the new duality perspective, we derive an expression for the optimal correction factor at each iteration of the EnKI algorithm to accelerate the convergence. In addition, we also consider an ensemble specific multiplicative covariance correction strategy (EnKI-MC (II)) where a different correction is employed for each ensemble. By viewing EnKI through the lens of fixed-point iteration, we also provide theoretical results that guarantees the convergence of EnKI-MC (I) algorithm. Numerical investigations for the deconvolution problem, initial condition inversion in advection-convection problem, initial condition inversion in a Lorenz 96 model, and inverse problem constrained by elliptic partial differential equation are conducted to verify the non-asymptotic results for EnKF and to assess the performance of convergence improvement strategies for EnKI. The numerical results suggest that the proposed strategies for EnKI not only led to faster convergence in comparison to the currently employed techniques but also better quality solutions at termination of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Multivariate R\'enyi divergences characterise betting games with multiple lotteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an operational interpretation of the multivariate R\'enyi divergence in terms of economic-theoretic tasks based on betting, risk aversion, and multiple lotteries. We show that the multivariate R\'enyi divergence $D_{\underline{\alpha}}(\vec{P}_X)$ of probability distributions $\vec{P}_X =(p^{(0)}_X,\dots,p^{(d)}_X)$ and real-valued orders $\underline{\alpha} = (\alpha_0, \dots, \alpha_d)$ quantifies the economic-theoretic value that a rational agent assigns to $d$ lotteries with odds $o^{(k)}_X \propto (p_X^{(k)})^{-1}$ ($k=1,\dots,d$) on a random event described by $p^{(0)}_X$. In particular, when the odds are fair and the rational agent maximises over all betting strategies, the economic-theoretic value (the isoelastic certainty equivalent) that the agent assigns to the lotteries is exactly given by $w^{\mathrm{ICE}}_{\underline{R}}=\exp[D_{\underline{\alpha}}(\vec{P}_X)]$, where $\underline{R}=(R_1,\dots,R_d)$ is a risk-aversion vector with $R_k = 1+\alpha_k/\alpha_0$ being the risk-aversion parameter for lottery $k$. Furthermore, we introduce a new conditional multivariate R\'enyi divergence that characterises a generalised scenario where the agent uses side information. We prove that this new quantity satisfies a data processing inequality which can be interpreted as the increment in the economic-theoretic value provided by side information; crucially, such a data processing inequality is a consequence of the agent's economic-theoretically consistent risk-averse attitude towards every lottery and vice versa. Finally, we apply these results to the resource theory of informative measurements in general probabilistic theories (GPTs). By establishing quantitative connections between information theory, physics, and economics, our framework provides a novel operational foundation for quantum state betting games with multiple lotteries in the realm of quantum resource theories.</description>

      <title>Scaling Effects and Uncertainty Quantification in Neural Actor Critic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the neural Actor Critic algorithm using shallow neural networks for both the Actor and Critic models. The focus of this work is twofold: first, to compare the convergence properties of the network outputs under various scaling schemes as the network width and the number of training steps tend to infinity; and second, to provide precise control of the approximation error associated with each scaling regime. Previous work has shown convergence to ordinary differential equations with random initial conditions under inverse square root scaling in the network width. In this work, we shift the focus from convergence speed alone to a more comprehensive statistical characterization of the algorithm's output, with the goal of quantifying uncertainty in neural Actor Critic methods. Specifically, we study a general inverse polynomial scaling in the network width, with an exponent treated as a tunable hyperparameter taking values strictly between one half and one. We derive an asymptotic expansion of the network outputs, interpreted as statistical estimators, in order to clarify their structure. To leading order, we show that the variance decays as a power of the network width, with an exponent equal to one half minus the scaling parameter, implying improved statistical robustness as the scaling parameter approaches one. Numerical experiments support this behavior and further suggest faster convergence for this choice of scaling. Finally, our analysis yields concrete guidelines for selecting algorithmic hyperparameters, including learning rates and exploration rates, as functions of the network width and the scaling parameter, ensuring provably favorable statistical behavior.</description>

Also, we show that the average hitting times can be expressed in terms of the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers in general.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove that biorthogonal ensembles on the real line with a specific derivative structure admit an explicit correlation kernel of double contour integral form. We will demonstrate that this expression is a valuable starting point for asymptotic analysis and that our class of biorthogonal ensembles admits a large variety of limit kernels, by proving that two new classes of limit kernels can occur. The first type is a deformation of the hard edge Bessel kernel which arises in polynomial ensembles describing the eigenvalues of the sum of two random matrices, while the second type arises for Muttalib-Borodin type deformations of polynomial ensembles.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Transition to Intermittency for a Stochastic Heat Equation Driven by the Square of a Gaussian Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spatial behavior of the solution $\psi(x,t)$ to the stochastic heat equation $\partial_t\psi(x,t)-\frac{1}{2}\partial^2_{x^2} \psi(x,t)=g\, S(x,t)^2\, \psi(x,t)$, with $0\le t\le T$, $x\in\mathbb{R}$, and $\psi(x,0)=1$. Here, $g&gt;0$ is a coupling constant and $S(x,t)$ is a stationary, homogeneous, and ergodic Gaussian field. Focusing on $\mathcal{E}(x,g)\equiv \psi(x,T)$ at a finite time $T&gt;0$, we identify the critical coupling $g_c(T)$ above which the average of $\mathcal{E}(0,g)$ diverges. We show that in the subcritical regime $g&lt;g_c(T)$, $\mathcal{E}(x,g)$ is spatially ergodic, with no intermittency, while in the supercritical regime $g&gt;g_c(T)$ it becomes spatially intermittent and loses ergodicity. Our results differ from the extensively studied case where $S(x,t)^2$ is replaced by $S(x,t)$, in which intermittency appears only asymptotically as $T\to +\infty$, with no finite-time intermittency.</description>

      <title>Sampling Sphere Packings with Continuum Glauber Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a spectral gap for Continuum Glauber dynamics on the hard sphere model assuming strong spatial mixing, thereby extending the range of parameters in which Continuum Glauber is provably rapidly mixing. To do this, we introduce continuous extensions of spectral independence and negative fields localization. Our techniques apply to general Gibbs point processes with finite-range repulsive pair potentials. As a corollary, we improve the threshold up to which packings of a fixed number of spheres can be sampled from a bounded domain.</description>

      <title>Sparse random graphs with many triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.06526v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph in the sparse regime in the limit as the number of vertices $n$ tends to infinity. We are interested in what this graph looks like when it contains many triangles, in two settings. First, we derive asymptotically sharp bounds on the probability that the graph contains a large number of triangles. We show that conditionally on this event, with high probability the graph contains an almost complete subgraph, i.e., the triangles form a near-clique, and has the same local limit as the original Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph. Second, we derive asymptotically sharp bounds on the probability that the graph contains a large number of vertices that are part of a triangle. If order $n$ vertices are in triangles, then the local limit (provided it exists) is different from that of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph. Our results shed light on the challenges that arise in the description of real-world networks, which often are sparse, yet highly clustered, and on exponential random graphs, which often are used to model such networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09596v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a proof of the convergence of the BHZ renormalized model associated with the generalized (KPZ) equation that does not require the full strength of the BPHZ renormalisation. Our approach is based on a convenient form of chaos decomposition. The other key ingredient is a generalisation of the Hairer-Quastel convergence theorem for Feynman diagrams with certain decorations encoding Taylor remainders. With these ideas we are able to construct the model for the generalised KPZ equation.</description>

Abstract: We solve the classical conformal welding problem for a composition of two random homeomorphisms generated by independent Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures with small parameter values. In other words, given two such measures on the boundary of the unit disk we show that there exist conformal maps to complementary domains on the Riemann sphere such that the pushforward of the normalised measures agree on their common boundary.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the partition function for $\beta$-ensembles at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the real $\beta$-ensemble (or 1D log-gas) of dimension $N$ in the high-temperature regime, \textit{i.e.} where the inverse temperature $\beta$ scales as $N\beta=2P$ with $P$ a fixed positive parameter. We establish the large-$N$ asymptotic expansion at all orders of the partition function:
  \begin{equation*}
  Z_N[V]=\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}\prod_{i&lt;j}^{N}\left |x_i-x_j\right|^{\frac{2P}{N}}\cdot\prod_{i=1}^{N}e^{-V(x_i)} \mathrm{d}x_i
  \end{equation*}
  for $V(x)=x^2+\phi(x)$ with $\phi$ a bounded smooth function, and identify the first two terms of this expansion.
  In this regime, the energy no longer dominates the entropy, as in the fixed-$\beta$ case, but rather scales at the same order in $N$. Consequently, at large $N$, the system is macroscopically described by the so-called\textit{ thermal equilibrium measure} which is supported on the entire real line.
  Our proof relies on the loop equations method, previously applied in the fixed-$\beta$ setting in \cite{BoG1,BoG2}, and provides the first example in which this approach can be successfully implemented using the thermal equilibrium measure. This requires a detailed understanding of both the thermal equilibrium measure and the associated master operator, an unbounded differential operator, leading to several new analytical challenges.
  In this setting, we carry out a technically involved analysis to obtain precise estimates for the inverse of the master operator in suitable functional norms. In addition we establish, through subtle operator arguments, a crucial continuity property of the equilibrium density with respect to the potential dependence. These two results constitute the main novelties of the paper and allow us to exhibit a new class of multiple integrals for which such an expansion can be obtained, while providing a deeper understanding of the thermal equilibrium measure and its properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The embedding problem of Markov transition matrices into continuous-time Markov semigroups is a classic problem that regained a lot of impetus and activities in recent years. We consider it here for the following generalisation of the well-known coupon collection process: from a finite set of distinct objects, a subset is drawn repeatedly according to some probability distribution, independently and with replacement, and each time united with the set of objects sampled so far. We derive and interpret properties of and explicit conditions for the resulting discrete-time Markov chain to be representable within a semigroup or a flow of a continuous-time process of the same type.</description>

Abstract: We study the probability distribution of the number of common zeros of a system of $m$ random $n$-variate polynomials over a finite commutative ring $R$. We compute the expected number of common zeros of a system of polynomials over $R$. Then, in the case that $R$ is a field, under a necessary-and-sufficient condition on the sample space, we show that the number of common zeros is binomially distributed.</description>

      <title>The Critical 2d Stochastic Heat Flow and Related Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, we review recent progress in the study of the stochastic heat equation and its discrete analogue, the directed polymer model, in spatial dimension 2. It was discovered that a phase transition emerges on an intermediate disorder scale, with Edwards-Wilkinson (Gaussian) fluctuations in the sub-critical regime. In the critical window, a unique scaling limit has been identified and named the critical 2d stochastic heat flow. This gives a meaning to the solution of the stochastic heat equation in the critical dimension 2, which lies beyond existing solution theories for singular SPDEs. We outline the proof ideas, introduce the key ingredients, and discuss related literature on disordered systems and singular SPDEs. A list of open questions is also provided.</description>

      <title>A phase transition for a spatial host-parasite model with extreme host immunities on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and $\mathbb{T}_d$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a model of a parasite population invading spatially distributed immobile hosts on a graph, which is a modification of the frog model. Each host has an unbreakable immunity against infection with a certain probability $1-p$ and parasites move as simple symmetric random walks attempting to infect any host they encounter and subsequently reproduce themselves. We show that, on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d\ge 2$ and the $d$-regular tree $\mathbb{T}_d$ with $d\ge 3$, the survival probability of parasites exhibits a phase transition at a critical value of $p_c\in(0,1)$. Also, we show that adding vertices and edges to the underlying graph can, in general, both increase or decrease the value of $p_c$. Finally, we show that on quasi-vertex-transitive graphs, with probability $1$, a fixed vertex is only visited finitely often by a parasite under mild assumptions on the offspring distribution of parasites.</description>

Abstract: We establish a non-explosion result for rough differential equations (RDEs) in which the noise and drift coefficients, together with their derivatives, may grow unboundedly at infinity. In addition, we prove the existence of a global bi-continuous solution flow for stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Finally, the non-explosion results for RDEs are shown to be sharp by constructing counterexamples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a structured population consisting of $d$ colonies, with migration rates proportional to a positive parameter $K$. We sample $N_K$ individuals, distributed evenly across the $d$ colonies, and trace their ancestral lineages backward in time. Within each colony, we assume that any pair of ancestral lineages coalesces at a constant rate, as in Kingman's coalescent. We identify each ancestral lineage with the set, or block, of its sampled descendants, and we encode the state of the system using a $d$-dimensional vector of empirical measures; the $i$-th component records the blocks present in colony $i$ together with the initial locations of the lineages composing each block.
  We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of the process of empirical measures as $K \to \infty$. We consider two regimes: the critical sampling regime, where $N_K \sim K$, and the large-sample regime, where $N_K \gg K$. After an appropriate time rescaling, we show that the process of empirical measures converges to the solution of a $d$-dimensional coagulation equation. In the critical sampling regime, the solution can be represented in terms of a multi-type branching process. In the large-sample regime, the solution can be represented in terms of the entrance law of a multi-type continuous-state branching process.</description>

Abstract: In 1975, G. P\'olya suggested that if two proofreaders found $a$ and $b$ errors in a text, of which $c$ errors were found by both of them, then a reasonable approximation of the unknown number $e$ of all errors is $e\approx ab/c$. We justify this formula by constructing a realistic model of proofreaders and estimating the efficiency of this model with the help of the bound on large deviations in the Probabilistic Method. In conclusion we discuss the distinction between realistic and probabilistic models of problems.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a framework for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with interaction on compact, connected, $d$-dimensional manifolds. For SDEs whose drift and diffusion coefficients may depend on both the state variable and the empirical distribution, we establish existence and uniqueness of strong solutions under general regularity assumptions. We study the associated measure valued process on the Wasserstein space over the manifold, deriving an explicit It\^o Wiener decomposition. We prove Malliavin differentiability of the solution and, using directional derivatives in the Wasserstein space, establish smooth dependence of the solution on the measure component for a class of coefficients.</description>

      <title>Navier-Stokes Equations with Fractional Dissipation and Associated Doubly Stochastic Yule Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a probabilistic structure known as self-similar doubly stochastic Yule (DSY) cascade associated with the deterministic Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with fractional dissipation $(-\Delta)^\gamma$. Interestingly, such a structure is well-defined only in the scaling-supercritical regime $\gamma\in(\frac{1}{2},\frac{d+2}{4})$. We then characterize parametric regions of $(d,\gamma)$ that correspond to the non-explosive, explosive, and hyperexplosive behavior of the DSY cascade. Stochastic solution processes are constructed recursively, and their expectations yield solutions to the fractional NSE whenever these expectations exist. Explosion and geometric properties of the DSY cascade are then exploited to establish non-uniqueness and finite-time blowup results for a scalar partial differential equation associated with the fractional NSE thanks to a majorization principle for stochastic solution processes. In the special case $d=2$, we derive a closed form for the solution process and prove the finite-time loss of integrability of the solution process for sufficiently large initial data. Notably, this lack of integrability does not necessarily imply finite-time blowup of solutions to the fractional NSE. Indeed, for vortex-flow initial data, we show that the solution can be continued beyond the time of integrability breakdown by employing a notion of averaging.</description>

Abstract: We review our joint work on the scaling limits of disordered systems, linking the notion of disorder relevance/irrelevance to that of sub/super-criticality of singular SPDEs. This line of research culminated in the construction of the Critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF), a universal process which provides a non-trivial solution to the Stochastic Heat Equation in dimension 2, a critical singular SPDE that lies beyond the reach of existing solution theories. The SHF also offers a rare example of a non-Gaussian scaling limit for a disordered system at its phase transition point in the critical dimension.</description>

      <title>Existence and sharpness of the phase transition for the frog model on transitive graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a slight modification of the frog model. For a given graph, each vertex has $\mathrm{Poisson}(\lambda)$ particles (or frogs). At time zero, only the particles at the origin are active, and all the other particles are sleeping. Each active particle performs an independent, continuous-time simple random walk, becoming inactive after time $t$. Once an active frog jumps to a vertex, it activates all of its particles. The survival of active particles can be studied as a dependent percolation model with two parameters $\lambda$ and $t$. In the present work, we establish the existence of a phase transition with respect to each parameter for non-amenable graphs of bounded degrees and quasi-transitive graphs of superlinear polynomial growth, as well as prove the sharpness of the phase transition for transitive graphs.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory for Markov chains with transition matrix admitting a stochastic bidiagonal factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently established spectral Favard theorem for bounded banded matrices admitting a positive bidiagonal factorization is applied to a broader class of Markov chains with bounded banded transition matrices, extending beyond the classical birth-and-death setting, to those that allow a positive stochastic bidiagonal factorization. In the finite case, the Karlin-McGregor spectral representation is derived. The recurrence of the Markov chain is established, and explicit formulas for the stationary distributions are provided in terms of orthogonal polynomials. Analogous results are obtained for the countably infinite case. In this setting, the chain is not necessarily recurrent, and its behavior is characterized in terms of the associated spectral measure. Finally, ergodicity is examined through the presence of a mass at $1$ in the spectral measure, corresponding to the eigenvalue $1$ with both right and left eigenvectors.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Wasserstein regularization, defective local concentration and a cutoff criterion beyond non-negative curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Notions of positive curvature have been shown to imply many remarkable properties for Markov processes, in terms, e.g., of regularization effects, functional inequalities, mixing time bounds and, more recently, the cutoff phenomenon. In this work, we are interested in a relaxed variant of Ollivier's coarse Ricci curvature, where a Markov kernel $P$ satisfies only a weaker Wasserstein bound $W_p(\mu P, \nu P) \leq K W_p(\mu,\nu)+M$ for constants $M\ge 0, K\in [0,1], p \ge 1$. Under appropriate additional assumptions on the one-step transition measures $\delta_x P$, we establish (i) a form of local concentration, given by a defective Talagrand inequality, and (ii) an entropy-transport regularization effect. We consider as illustrative examples the Langevin dynamics and the Proximal Sampler when the target measure is a log-Lipschitz perturbation of a log-concave measure. As an application of the above results, we derive criteria for the occurrence of the cutoff phenomenon in some negatively curved settings.</description>

      <title>A uniformity principle for spatial matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Platforms matching spatially distributed supply to demand face a fundamental design choice: given a fixed total budget of service range, how should it be allocated across supply nodes ex ante, i.e. before supply and demand locations are realized, to maximize fulfilled demand? We model this problem using bipartite random geometric graphs where $n$ supply and $m$ demand nodes are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]^k$ ($k \ge 1$), and edges form when demand falls within a supply node's service region, the volume of which is determined by its service range. Since each supply node serves at most one demand, platform performance is determined by the expected size of a maximum matching. We establish a uniformity principle: whenever one service range allocation is more uniform than the other, the more uniform allocation yields a larger expected matching. This principle emerges from diminishing marginal returns to range expanding service range, and limited interference between supply nodes due to bounded ranges naturally fragmenting the graph. For $k=1$, we further characterize the expected matching size through a Markov chain embedding and derive closed-form expressions for special cases. Our results provide theoretical guidance for optimizing service range allocation and designing incentive structures in ride-hailing, on-demand labor markets, and drone delivery networks.</description>

      <title>Understanding the householder solar panel consumer: A Markovian model and its societal implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Household adoption of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems is central to the green energy transition, yet diffusion depends on social influence and behavioral biases, as well as payback economics. This study develops a parsimonious Markovian model in which households move sequentially from being unengaged (Carbon) to informed, to planning, and finally to adoption (Green). Transition rates are micro-founded by two mechanisms: (i) social contagion/communication, proxied by the current share of adopters, and (ii) economic profitability, proxied by payback time computed from a Net Present Value framework. Novel to this diffusion setting, bounded rationality is introduced via hyperbolic discounting, creating a procrastination loop that delays adoption even when PV is economically attractive in a long-run perspective. Calibrated on the Italian residential PV diffusion path (2006-2020) and assessed in national and regional applications, the model reproduces observed trajectories and enables forward-looking scenario analysis (2020-2026). Results show that policies yielding similar payback improvements can produce different outcomes once present bias is accounted for and that behaviorally informed intervention are stronger. The findings contribute a micro-to-macro bridge between behavioral economics and technology diffusion modeling and imply that effective policy portfolios (and PV business models) should complement incentives with commitment devices and social-norm peer strategies to accelerate PV uptake and its spillover emissions benefits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02484v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a commutative algebra $\mathcal{A}$, we exhibit a canonical structure of post-Lie algebra on the space $\mathcal{A}\otimes {\rm Der}(\mathcal{A})$ where ${\rm Der}(\mathcal{A})$ is the space of derivations on $\mathcal{A}$, in order to use the machinery given by Oudom-Guin (2008) and Ebrahimi-Fard--Lundervold--Munthe-Kaas (2015), and to define a Hopf algebra structure on the associated enveloping algebra with a natural action on $\mathcal{A}$. We apply these results to the setting of Linares-Otto-Tempelmayr (2023), giving a simpler and more efficient construction of their action and extending the recent work by Bruned-Katsetsiadis (2023). This approach gives an optimal setting to perform explicit computations in the associated structure group.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions for Sparse Random Sets Under Linear Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A \subseteq \{0,1,\dots,N\}$ be a random set in which each element is included independently with probability $p=p(N)$. Fix an integer $h \geq 2$ and a linear form $$L(x_1,\dots,x_h) := u_1x_1 + \cdots + u_hx_h.$$ We study the random image set \begin{align*}
  L(A) = \left\{ L(a_1,\dots,a_h) : a_i \in A \right\}, \end{align*} inside the feasible interval of values of $L$ on $\{0,1,\dots,N\}^h$, as well as the associated representation counts. Our results exhibit two distinct threshold scales. First, there is a \emph{global} transition at $p(N) \asymp N^{-(h-1)/h}$ governing the size of $L(A)$: below this scale collisions are rare and $L(A)$ is sparse, while above it $L(A)$ contains nearly all feasible values. We give sharp asymptotics for the size of $L(A)$ in all regimes, including inside the critical window. Second, there is a \emph{local} transition at $p(N)\asymp N^{-(h-2)/(h-1)}$ governing multiplicities: for typical values in the bulk, the number of essentially distinct representations is asymptotically Poisson below this scale, and Poisson behavior fails above it. For $h \geq 3$ these scales are separated, yielding a regime in which $L(A)$ is already globally close to full while local multiplicities remain approximately Poisson. Our framework subsumes the classical sumset and difference-set models, as well as generalized sumsets of the form $sA-dA$, as special cases. Notably, after correcting its formulation, our global theorem settles the 2009 threshold conjecture of Hegarty-Miller on the behavior of these random images.</description>

      <title>Green geometry, Martin boundary and random walk asymptotics on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07688v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a single computationally checkable analytic quantity interlacing Martin boundary collapse, Green geometry, and linear escape for transient random walks on finitely generated groups: the Green-variation functional \[ \Delta(S;a,b):=\max_{x\in\partial S}\frac{|G(a,x)-G(b,x)|}{G(a,x)}. \] We prove that $\Delta\to0$ along exhaustions characterises the strong Liouville property (under mild, verifiable hypotheses on the ``strong Liouville $\Rightarrow \Delta\to0$'' direction), turning boundary oscillation estimates for Green kernels into potential-theoretic rigidity.
  We then give two general criteria for $\Delta$-vanishing. The first one derives quantitative bounds on $\Delta$ from coarse heat-kernel envelopes at an intrinsic scale together with a Tauberian comparability, covering Gaussian/sub-Gaussian and stable-like regimes; and the second one is purely elliptic: an ``elliptic H\"older exhaustion'' criterion. Conversely, on groups of exponential growth, $\Delta$ fails to decay along balls already under stretched-exponential on-diagonal upper bounds, yielding a quantitative obstruction to strong Liouville.
  As consequences, trivial Martin boundary forces linear-scale collapse of Green geometry ($d_G(e,x)=o(|x|)$) and vanishing Green speed (in probability), without any entropy hypothesis. On the non-Liouville side we prove an abundance principle: the existence of a single minimal positive harmonic function at a prescribed growth scale forces infinitely many. Finally, we clarify the role of moment assumptions in speed theory: any linear-speed law of large numbers on a set of positive probability forces $\mathbb E|X_1|&lt;\infty$, while on torsion-free nilpotent groups one can have $\mathbb E|X_1|=\infty$ yet $|X_n|/n\to0$ in probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel mesh-free and direct method for computing the shape derivative in PDE-constrained shape optimization problems. Our approach is based on a probabilistic representation of the shape derivative and is applicable for second-order semilinear elliptic PDEs with Dirichlet boundary conditions and a general class of target functions. The probabilistic representation derives from an extension of a boundary sensitivity result for diffusion processes due to Costantini, Gobet and El Karoui [14]. Moreover, we present a simulation methodology based on our results that does not necessarily require a mesh of the relevant domain, and provide Taylor tests to verify its numerical accuracy</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we solve stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) numerically by using (possibly random) neural networks in the truncated Wiener chaos expansion of their corresponding solution. Moreover, we provide some approximation rates for learning the solution of SPDEs with additive and/or multiplicative noise. Finally, we apply our results in numerical examples to approximate the solution of three SPDEs: the stochastic heat equation, the Heath-Jarrow-Morton equation, and the Zakai equation.</description>

      <title>Error analysis for stochastic gradient optimization schemes using modified equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of stochastic gradient optimization schemes. Assuming that the objective function is strongly convex, we prove weak error estimates which are uniform in time for the error between the solution of the numerical scheme, and the solutions of continuous-time modified (or high-resolution) differential equations at first and second orders, with respect to the time-step size. At first order, the modified equation is deterministic, whereas at second order the modified equation is stochastic and depends on a modified objective function. We go beyond existing results where the error estimates have been considered only on finite time intervals and were not uniform in time. This allows us to then provide a rigorous complexity analysis of the method in the large time and small time-step size regimes. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate the convergence results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates triangle functions induced by tensor products of triangular norms and conorms. For any left continuous t-norm $T$ on $[0,1]$ and any right continuous t-conorm $L$ on $[0,\infty]$, the tensor product $L\otimes T$ induces a triangle function on $\Delp$, giving rise to a partially ordered monoid structure on $(\Delta^+, L \otimes T)$. The main results are as follows: (1) if $L$ is continuous, then $\tau_{T,L}$ is a triangle function on $\Delp$ if and only if $\tau_{T,L}=L\otimes T$, which in turn holds if and only if $L$ satisfies the property (LCS); (2) for $\CDp$, the set of all non-defective distance distribution functions, $(\CDp,L\otimes T)$ forms a submonoid of $(\Delp,L\otimes T)$ if and only if $L$ has no zero divisors; (3)for $\CDp_c$, the set of all continuous distance distribution functions, if the t-norm $T$ is continuous, then $(\CDp_c,L\otimes T)$ is a subsemigroup of $(\Delp,L\otimes T)$ if and only if $L$ satisfies the property (LS). Furthermore, $(\CDp_c,L\otimes T)$ is an ideal of $(\CDp, L\otimes T)$ if and only if $L$ adheres to the cancellation law.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic optimal control control problems with merely measurable coefficients are not well understood. In this manuscript, we consider fully non-linear stochastic optimal control problems in infinite horizon with measurable coefficients and (local) uniformly elliptic diffusion. Using the theory of $L^p$-viscosity solutions, we show existence of an $L^p$-viscosity solution $v\in W_{\rm loc}^{2,p}$ of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which, in turn, is also a strong solution (i.e. it satisfies the HJB equation pointwise a.e.). We are then led to prove verification theorems, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality. These results allow us to construct optimal feedback controls and to characterize the value function as the unique $L^p$-viscosity solution of the HJB equation. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results for fully non-linear stochastic optimal control problems with measurable coefficients. We use the theory developed to solve a stochastic optimal control problem arising in economics within the context of optimal advertising.</description>

      <title>A Computational Transition for Detecting Multivariate Shuffled Linear Regression by Low-Degree Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of multivariate shuffled linear regression, where the correspondence between predictors and responses in a linear model is obfuscated by a latent permutation. Specifically, we investigate the model $Y=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{1+\sigma^2}}(\Pi_* X Q_* + \sigma Z)$, where $X$ is an $n*d$ standard Gaussian design matrix, $Z$ is an $n*m$ Gaussian noise matrix, $\Pi_*$ is an unknown $n*n$ permutation matrix, and $Q_*$ is an unknown $d*m$ on the Grassmanian manifold satisfying $Q_*^{\top} Q_* = \mathbb I_m$.
  Consider the hypothesis testing problem of distinguishing this model from the case where $X$ and $Y$ are independent Gaussian random matrices of sizes $n*d$ and $n*m$, respectively. Our results reveal a phase transition phenomenon in the performance of low-degree polynomial algorithms for this task. (1) When $m=o(d)$, we show that all degree-$D$ polynomials fail to distinguish these two models even when $\sigma=0$, provided with $D^4=o\big( \tfrac{d}{m} \big)$. (2) When $m=d$ and $\sigma=\omega(1)$, we show that all degree-$D$ polynomials fail to distinguish these two models provided with $D=o(\sigma)$. (3) When $m=d$ and $\sigma=o(1)$, we show that there exists a constant-degree polynomial that strongly distinguish these two models. These results establish a smooth transition in the effectiveness of low-degree polynomial algorithms for this problem, highlighting the interplay between the dimensions $m$ and $d$, the noise level $\sigma$, and the computational complexity of the testing task.</description>

      <title>Lattice packing of spheres in high dimensions using a stochastically evolving ellipsoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that in any dimension $n$ there exists an origin-symmetric ellipsoid ${\mathcal{E}} \subset {\mathbb{R}}^n$ of volume $ c n^2 $ that contains no points of ${\mathbb{Z}}^n$ other than the origin, where $c &gt; 0$ is a universal constant. Equivalently, there exists a lattice sphere packing in ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ whose density is at least $cn^2 \cdot 2^{-n}$. Previously known constructions of sphere packings in ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ yielded densities of at most $C n \log n \cdot 2^{-n}$. Our proof utilizes a stochastically evolving ellipsoid that accumulates at least $c n^2$ lattice points on its boundary, while containing no lattice points in its interior except for the origin.</description>

      <title>Activity-driven clustering and many-body steady state of jamming run-and-tumble particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exactly resolve the three-particle steady state of run-and-tumble particles with jamming interactions, providing the first microscopic description beyond two bodies. The invariant measure, derived via a piecewise-deterministic Markov process description and symmetry principles, reveals persistent, separated, and diffusive regimes ruled by the activity parameter. A geometric cascade of scales in the activity parameter organizes the structural weights, showing the separated phase dominates at finite activity, while non-uniformity plays only a minor role. Extending these results to larger systems, we show that the $N$-body steady state inherits the same organization: the number of clusters becomes sharply defined by the activity value, with crossover boundaries whose slopes diverge with $N$. We also show how the activity plays a role similar to a fugacity conjugate to cluster number, yielding a grand-canonical-like structure emerging directly from the microscopic dynamics. This framework lays the groundwork for a systematic microscopic theory of active many-body steady states.</description>

      <title>Metric Poincar\'e inequalities for graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article obtains purely metric counterparts of cornerstone results in the theory of embedding graphs into normed spaces. Our first main result is a metric analogue of Matou\v{s}ek's extrapolation relating the Poincar\'e constants $\gamma(G,\varrho^p)$ and $\gamma(G,\varrho^q)$ for any exponents $0 &lt; p,q &lt; \infty$, any bounded-degree expander graph $G$, and any target metric space $\mathcal{M}=(M,\varrho)$. Our second main result provides a sharp estimate of the Poincar\'e constant $\gamma(G,\varrho)$ in terms of the cardinalities of the vertex set of $G$ and the metric space $\mathcal{M}=(M,\varrho)$, in the setting of \textit{random} graphs. This yields optimal estimates on the minimum cardinality of (bi-Lipschitz) universal metric spaces for graphs, finally establishing a nonlinear analogue of Matou\v{s}ek's celebrated "incompressibility" theorem (1996). Further, we obtain estimates on the nonlinear spectral gap of metric snowflakes and sharp lower bounds on the distortion of random regular graphs into arbitrary metric spaces. Our proofs develop new nonlinear techniques, including random compression methods and a novel structural dichotomy for metric embeddings.</description>

      <title>Short-rate models with stochastic discontinuities: a PDE approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the reform of interest rate benchmarks, interbank offered rates (IBORs) like LIBOR have been replaced by risk-free rates (RFRs), such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in the U.S. and the Euro Short-Term Rate (\euro STR) in Europe. These rates exhibit characteristics like jumps and spikes that correspond to specific market events, driven by regulatory and liquidity constraints. To capture these characteristics, this paper considers a general short-rate model that incorporates discontinuities at fixed times with random sizes. Within this framework, we introduce a PDE-based approach for pricing interest rate derivatives and establish, under suitable assumptions, a Feynman-Ka\v{c} representation for the solution. For affine models, we derive (quasi) closed-form solutions, while for the general case, we develop numerical methods to solve the resulting PDEs.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic structure of the Sinkhorn flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entropy-regularized optimal transport, which has strong links to the Schr\"odinger bridge problem in statistical mechanics, enjoys a variety of applications from trajectory inference to generative modeling. A major driver of renewed interest in this problem is the recent development of fast matrix-scaling algorithms\textemdash known as iterative proportional fitting or the Sinkhorn algorithm\textemdash for entropic optimal transport, which have favorable complexity over traditional approaches to the unregularized problem. Here, we take a perspective on this algorithm rooted in the thermodynamic origins of Schr\"odinger's problem and inspired by the modern geometric theory of diffusion: is the Sinkhorn flow (viewed in continuous-time as a mirror descent by recent results) the gradient flow of entropy in a formal Riemannian geometry? We answer this question affirmatively, finding a nonlocal Wasserstein gradient structure in the dynamics of its free marginal. This offers a physical interpretation of the Sinkhorn flow as the stochastic dynamics of a particle with law evolving by the nonlocal diffusion of a chemical potential. Simultaneously, it brings a standard suite of functional inequalities characterizing Markov diffusion processes to bear upon its geometry and convergence. We prove an entropy-energy (de Bruijn) identity, a Poincar\'e inequality, and a Bakry-\'Emery-type condition under which a logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) holds and implies exponential convergence of the Sinkhorn flow in entropy. We lastly discuss computational applications such as stopping heuristics and latent-space design criteria leveraging the LSI and, returning to the physical interpretation, the possibility of natural systems whose relaxation to equilibrium inherently solves entropic optimal transport or Schr\"odinger bridge problems.</description>

      <title>Monotone max-convolution and subordination functions for free max-convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the distribution of the spectral maximum of monotonically independent self-adjoint operators coincides with the classical max-convolution of their distributions. In free probability, it was proven that for any probability measures $\sigma,\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}$ there is a unique probability measure $\mathbb{A}_\sigma(\mu)$ satisfying $\sigma\boxplus \mu = \sigma \triangleright \mathbb{A}_\sigma(\mu)$, where $\boxplus$ and $\triangleright$ are free and monotone additive convolutions, respectively. We recall that the reciprocal Cauchy transform of $\mathbb{A}_\sigma(\mu)$ is the subordination function for free additive convolution. Motivated by this analogy, we introduce subordination functions for free max-convolution and prove their existence and structural properties.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation for 1-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations with nonzero random drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the wave propagation for a reaction-diffusion equation on the real line, with a random drift and Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piscounov (FKPP) type nonlinear reaction. We show that when the average drift is positive, the asymptotic wave fronts propagating to the positive and negative directions are both pushed in the negative direction, leading to the possibility that both wave fronts propagate toward negative infinity. Our proof is based on the Large Deviations Principle for diffusion processes in random environments, as well as an analysis of the Feynman-Kac formula. Such probabilistic arguments also reveal the underlying physical mechanism of the wave fronts formation: the drift acts as an external field that shifts the (quenched) free-energy reference level without altering the intrinsic fluctuation structure of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Radon-Nikodym theorem plays a significant role in the definition of Shannon entropy, f-divergences, and other basic quantities in information theory. The existence of Radon Nikodym derivates appear in many text books in measure theory but in text books on probability or information theory it is often omitted because the proof is often considered to be too difficult.</description>

      <title>Additive-Functional Approach to Transport in Periodic and Tilted Periodic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we clarify the physical origin of effective transport in periodic and tilted periodic systems. When Brownian dynamics is examined on the scale of a single period, the particle displacement admits a natural separation into a bounded part associated with recurrent motion within the periodic landscape, and an unbounded stochastic part that grows in time and carries the net transport. We show that effective drift and diffusion are governed entirely by this unbounded component, while local potential-induced fluctuations contribute only bounded corrections. Treating the displacement as an additive functional of the stochastic dynamics provides a rigorous formulation of this separation and leads to a corrector-martingale representation at the trajectory level. Within this framework, classical results-including the Lifson-Jackson formula for unbiased periodic systems and the Stratonovich expressions for tilted periodic potentials-follow as direct consequences of the same underlying structure. The same perspective extends naturally to higher-dimensional periodic environments, recovering the standard homogenized transport tensors.</description>
