      <title>Cooper-pair splitters as circuit elements for realizing topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in materials and fabrication of superconducting devices allows the exploration of novel quantum effects in synthetic superconducting systems beyond conventional Josephson junction arrays. As an example, we introduce a new circuit element, the Y-splitter, a superconducting loop with three leads and three Josephson junctions, smaller or comparable in size to the superconducting coherence length of the material. By tuning magnetic flux through an array of Y-splitters, Cooper-pair transport can be made to interfere destructively, while spatially separated split Cooper pairs propagate coherently. We consider an array of Y-splitters connected in a two-dimensional star [Archimedean (3,$12^2$)] geometry, deformable into the kagome lattice, and find a rich phase diagram that includes topological superconducting phases with Chern numbers $\pm 2$. Experimental realization appears feasible.</description>

      <title>Multigap superconductivity with non-trivial topology in a Dirac semimetal PdTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, PdTe has been identified as a Dirac semimetal with potential for unconventional superconductivity based on ARPES measurements. This study presents electrical transport and magnetization measurements conducted on high-quality single crystals of PdTe. Anisotropy in the upper critical magnetic field is observed in resistivity versus temperature data measured under various applied magnetic fields for in-plane (B II ab ) and out-of-plane (B II c) orientations. The magnetic field versus temperature (H - T) phase diagram extracted from resistivity data exhibits an upward curvature akin to several multigap superconductors. Additionally, magnetization measurements reveal de Haas-Van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations in both B II ab and B II c orientations. Fourier analysis of the quantum oscillations identifies two Fermi pockets. Moreover, the Landau fan diagram for a small Fermi pocket confirms a non-trivial Berry phase {\pi}, indicative of the Dirac nature of PdTe. Based on quantum oscillation data, a plausible band diagram is constructed.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in ternary Mg$_4$Pd$_7$As$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the synthesis and characterization of a new compound Mg$_4$Pd$_7$As$_6$, which was found to be a superconductor with $T_c=5.45$~K. Powder X-ray diffraction confirms the U$_4$Re$_7$Si$_6$ structure (space group $Im$-$3m$, no. 229) with the lattice parameter $a$ = 8.2572(1)~\AA. Magnetization, specific heat, and electrical resistivity measurements indicate that it is a moderate-coupling ($\lambda = 0.72$) type-II superconductor. The electronic and phonon structures are calculated, highlighting the importance of antibonding Pd-As interactions in determining the properties of this material. The calculated electron-phonon copling parameter $\lambda = 0.76$ agrees very well with the experimental finding, which confirms the conventional pairing mechanism in Mg$_4$Pd$_7$As$_6$.</description>

      <title>Josephson tunnel junction arrays and Andreev weak links: linked by a single energy-phase relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson elements are cornerstones of cryogenic classical and quantum superconducting technology, owing to their nonlinearity. Two important types of Josephson elements are often considered distinct: the tunnel junction (superconductor-insulator-superconductor, SIS) and the Andreev weak link (superconductor-normal-superconductor, SNS) referring to any non-superconducting and non-insulating central region. SNS junctions and SIS junctions have appeared in related technological and fundamental science contexts over the last decade, such as in the design of protected qubit concepts. In this perspective article, we review correspondences between SISIS junctions and SNS junctions in limiting regimes, in which a single energy-phase relationship describes both systems. We show how this insight helps to connect recent bodies of theoretical and experimental work in both systems, and conclude by describing a few important differences.</description>

      <title>Impact of evanescent scattering modes and finite dispersion in superconducting junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting junctions are essential building blocks for quantum hardware, and their fundamental behavior remains a highly active research field. The behaviour of generic junctions is conveniently described by Beenakker's determinant formula, linking the subgap energy spectrum to the scattering matrix characterizing the junction. In particular, the gap closing between bound and continuum states in short junctions follows from unitarity of the scattering matrix, and thus, from probability conservation. In this work, we critically reassess two assumptions: that scattering in short junctions is approximately energy-independent and dominated by planar channels. We argue that strongly energy-dependent scattering follows from finite dispersion of the conductor electrons even when they spend little time within the scattering region, and show that evanescent modes play a central role when cross-channel scattering is important. By generalizing Beenakker's equation and performing a mapping to an effective Hamiltonian, we show that the gap closing is linked to a chiral symmetry. While finite energy-dependence in the scattering breaks the chiral symmetry, we show two distinct mechanisms preserving the gap closing, each connected to new types of constraints on energy-dependent scattering matrices beyond unitarity. If the dispersive mode is planar, the gap closing is still preserved through a time-dependent probability conservation analysis of the scattering process. If the dispersive channel is evanescent, we derive a constraint which, notably, cannot follow from probability conservation. We thus demonstrate that Andreev physics reveal a much wider variety of properties of normal metal scattering than commonly expected. We expect that our findings will have an impact on the dissipative behavior of driven junctions, and offer a new perspective on fundamental properties of scattering matrices.</description>

      <title>Topological Superfluid Responses of Superconducting Dirac Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07676v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that topological constraints do not only dictate the geometric part of the superfluid stiffness, but can also govern the total superfluid stiffness. By introducing a general adiabatic approach for superfluid responses, we showcase such a possibility by proving that the stiffness of a superconducting Dirac cone in two dimensions (2D) is proportional to its topological charge. By relying on the emergent Lorentz invariance of Dirac electrons, we unify the superfluid stiffness and quantum capacitance in these systems. Based on this connection, we further predict a topological origin for the quantum capacitance of a Josephson junction where 2D massless Dirac electrons are sandwiched between two conventional superconductors. We show that the topological responses persist upon effecting strain, are resilient against weak disorder, and can be experimentally controlled via a Zeeman field. Remarkably, the nonuniversal topological quantization of the two superfluid responses, yet implies the universal topological quantization of the admittance modulus of the superconducting Dirac system in units of conductance. The quantum admittance effect arises when embedding the superconducting Dirac system in an ac electrical circuit with a frequency tuned at the absorption edge. These findings are in principle experimentally observable in graphene-superconductor hybrids.</description>

      <title>Superfluid Stiffness and Josephson Quantum Capacitance: Adiabatic Approach and Topological Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We bring forward a unified framework for the study of the superfluid stiffness and the quantum capacitance of superconducting platforms exhibiting conventional spin-singlet pairing. We focus on systems which in their normal phase contain topological band touching points or crossings, while in their superconducting regime feature a fully gapped energy spectrum. Our unified description relies on viewing these two types of physical quantities as the charge current and density response coefficients obtained for ``slow" spatiotemporal variations of the superconducting phase. Within our adiabatic formalism, the two coefficients are given in terms of Berry curvatures defined in synthetic spaces. Our work lays the foundations for the systematic description of topological diagonal superfluid responses induced by singularities dictating the synthetic Berry curvatures. We exemplify our approach for concrete one- and two-dimensional models of superconducting topological (semi)metals. We discuss topological phenomena which arise in the superfluid stiffness of bulk systems and the quantum capacitance of Josephson junctions. We show that both coefficients become proportional to a topological invariant which counts the number of topological touchings/crossings of the normal phase band structure. These topological effects can be equivalently viewed as manifestations of chiral anomaly. Our predictions appear experimentally testable in topological semimetals with proximity-induced pairing, such as in graphene-superconductor hybrids at charge neutrality.</description>

      <title>Long-range Phase Coherence and Tunable Second Order ${\phi}_0$-Josephson Effect in a Dirac Semimetal $1T-PtTe_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting diode effects have recently attracted much attention for their potential applications in superconducting logic circuits. Several mechanisms such as magneto-chiral effects, finite momentum Cooper pairing, asymmetric edge currents have been proposed to give rise to a supercurrent diode effect in different materials. In this work, we establish the presence of a large intrinsic Josephson diode effect in a type-II Dirac semimetal $1T-PtTe_2$ facilitated by its helical spin-momentum locking and distinguish it from other extrinsic effects. The magnitude of the Josephson diode effect is shown to be directly correlated to the large second-harmonic component of the supercurrent that is induced by the significant contribution of the topological spin-momentum locked states that promote coherent Andreev processes in the junction. We denote such junctions, where the relative phase between the two harmonics corresponding to charge transfers of $2e$ and $4e$ can be tuned by a magnetic field, as second order ${\phi}_0$-junctions. The direct correspondence between the second harmonic supercurrent component and the diode effect in $1T-PtTe_2$ junctions makes topological semimetals with high transparency an ideal platform to study and implement the Josephson diode effect, while also enabling further research on higher order supercurrent transport in Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Tunneling of fluxons via a Josephson resonant level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluxons in a superconducting loop can be coherently coupled by quantum phase slips occurring at a weak link such as a Josephson junction. If Cooper pair tunneling at the junction occurs through a resonant level, $2\pi$ quantum phase slips are suppressed, and fluxons are predominantly coupled by $4\pi$ quantum phase slips. We analyze this scenario by computing the coupling between fluxons as the level is brought into resonance with the superconducting condensate. The results indicate that the $4\pi$-dominated regime can be observed directly in the transition spectrum for circuit parameters typical of a fluxonium qubit. We also show that, if the inductive energy of the loop is much smaller than the plasma frequency of the junction, the low-energy Hamiltonian of the circuit is dual to that of a topological superconducting island. These findings can inform experiments on bifluxon qubits as well as the design of novel types of protected qubits.</description>

Abstract: Josephson junctions enable dissipation-less electrical current through metals and insulators below a critical current. Despite being central to quantum technology based on superconducting quantum bits and fundamental research into self-conjugate quasiparticles, the spatial distribution of super current flow at the junction and its predicted evolution with current bias and external magnetic field remain experimentally elusive. Revealing the hidden current flow, featureless in electrical resistance, helps understanding unconventional phenomena such as the nonreciprocal critical current, i.e., Josephson diode effect. Here we introduce a platform to visualize super current flow at the nanoscale. Utilizing a scanning magnetometer based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond, we uncover competing ground states electrically switchable within the zero-resistance regime. The competition results from the superconducting phase re-configuration induced by the Josephson current and kinetic inductance of thin-film superconductors. We further identify a new mechanism for the Josephson diode effect involving the Josephson current induced phase. The nanoscale super current flow emerges as a new experimental observable for elucidating unconventional superconductivity, and optimizing quantum computation and energy-efficient devices.</description>
