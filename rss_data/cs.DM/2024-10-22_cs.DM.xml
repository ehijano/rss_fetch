      <title>Effects of graph operations on star pairwise compatibility graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G=(V,E)$ is defined as a star-$k$-PCG when it is possible to assign a positive real number weight $w$ to each vertex $V$, and define $k$ distinct intervals $I_1, I_2, \ldots I_k$, in such a way that there is an edge $uv$ in $E$ if and only if the sum of the weights of vertices $u$ and $v$ falls within the union of these intervals. The star-$k$-PCG class is connected to two significant categories of graphs, namely PCGs and multithreshold graphs. The star number of a graph $G$, is the smallest $k$ for which $G$ is a star-$k$-PCG. In this paper, we study the effects of various graph operations, such as the addition of twins, pendant vertices, universal vertices, or isolated vertices, on the star number of the graph resulting from these operations. As a direct application of our results, we determine the star number of lobster graphs and provide an upper bound for the star number of acyclic graphs.</description>

      <title>Unique-neighbor Expanders with Better Expansion for Polynomial-sized Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $(d_1,d_2)$-biregular bipartite graph $G=(L\cup R,E)$ is called left-$(m,\delta)$ unique-neighbor expander iff each subset $S$ of the left vertices with $|S|\leq m$ has at least $\delta d_1|S|$ unique-neighbors, where unique-neighbors mean vertices with exactly one neighbor in $S$. We can also define right/two-sided expanders similarly. In this paper, we give the following three strongly explicit constructions of unique-neighbor expanders with better unique-neighbor expansion for polynomial-sized sets, while sufficient expansion for linear-sized sets is also preserved:
  (1) Two-sided $(n^{1/3-\epsilon},1-\epsilon)$ lossless expanders for arbitrary $\epsilon&gt;0$ and aspect ratio.
  (2) Left-$(\Omega(n),1-\epsilon)$ lossless expanders with right-$(n^{1/3-\epsilon},\delta)$ expansion for some $\delta&gt;0$.
  (3) Two-sided-$(\Omega(n),\delta)$ unique-neighbor expanders with two-sided-$(n^{\Omega(1)},1/2-\epsilon)$ expansion.
  The second construction exhibits the first explicit family of one-sided lossless expanders with unique-neighbor expansion for polynomial-sized sets from the other side and constant aspect ratio. The third construction gives two-sided unique-neighbor expanders with additional $(1/2-\epsilon)$ unique-neighbor expansion for two-sided polynomial-sized sets, which approaches the $1/2$ requirement in Lin and Hsieh (arXiv:2203.03581).
  Our techniques involve tripartite product recently introduced by Hsieh et al (STOC 2024), combined with a generalized existence argument of biregular graph with optimal two-sided unique-neighbor expansion for almost all degrees. We also use a new reduction from large girth/bicycle-freeness to vertex expansion, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The discrete charm of iterated function systems. A computer scientist's perspective on approximation of IFS invariant sets and measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study invariant sets and measures generated by iterated function systems defined on countable discrete spaces that are uniform grids of a finite dimension. The discrete spaces of this type can be considered as models of spaces in which actual numerical computation takes place. In this context, we investigate the possibility of the application of the random iteration algorithm to approximate these discrete IFS invariant sets and measures. The problems concerning a discretization of hyperbolic IFSs are considered as special cases of this more general setting.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of 3D-CNN models, GARCH-ANN, and VAR models for determining equity prices</title>

Abstract: Financial models have increasingly become popular in recent times, and the focus of researchers has been to find the perfect model which fits all circumstances; however, this has not been thoroughly achieved, and as a result, many financial models have been created. Artificial Intelligence modelling has increasingly become more popular in the financial space as an answer to the weakness of the advanced mathematical models studied in Economics. This paper introduces three commonly used models and tests them on the S&amp;P500 to give a strong projection as to the future values of the prices. It then introduces various error metrics like the root mean square error (RMSE) to ascertain the viability of the models. The results show that a longer-term forecast indeed has more arduous consequences as there is a veer between the actual and the forecasted readings. The models can produce a strong growth estimate for businesses and policymakers to plan more appropriately in the short term. Overall, the GARCH-LSTM model produced the least RMSE which also shows that complex models tend to perform better than simpler models</description>

      <title>Symmetric properties and two variants of shuffle-cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.13645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Li et al. in [Inf. Process. Lett. 77 (2001) 35--41] proposed the shuffle cube $SQ_{n}$ as an attractive interconnection network topology for massive parallel and distributed systems. By far, symmetric properties of the shuffle cube remains unknown. In this paper, we show that $SQ_{n}$ is not vertex-transitive for all $n&gt;2$, which is not an appealing property in interconnection networks. To overcome this limitation, two novel vertex-transitive variants of the shuffle-cube, namely simplified shuffle-cube $SSQ_{n}$ and balanced shuffle cube $BSQ_{n}$ are introduced. Then, routing algorithms of $SSQ_{n}$ and $BSQ_{n}$ for all $n&gt;2$ are given respectively. Furthermore, we show that both $SSQ_{n}$ and $BSQ_{n}$ possess Hamiltonian cycle embedding for all $n&gt;2$. Finally, as a by-product, we mend a flaw in the Property 3 in [IEEE Trans. Comput. 46 (1997) 484--490].</description>

      <title>Limiting Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14566v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various problems in engineering and natural science demand binary sequences that do not resemble translates of themselves, that is, the sequences must have small aperiodic autocorrelation at every nonzero shift. If $f$ is a sequence, then the demerit factor of $f$ is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the autocorrelations at all nonzero shifts for the sequence obtained by normalizing $f$ to unit Euclidean norm. The demerit factor is the reciprocal of Golay's merit factor, and low demerit factor indicates low self-similarity of a sequence under translation. We endow the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ with uniform probability measure and consider the distribution of their demerit factors. Earlier works used combinatorial techniques to find exact formulas for the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution as a function of $\ell$. These revealed that for $\ell \geq 4$, the $p$th central moment of this distribution is strictly positive for every $p \geq 2$. This article shows that for every $p$, the $p$th central moment is $\ell^{-2 p}$ times a quasi-polynomial function of $\ell$ with rational coefficients. It also shows that, in the limit as $\ell$ tends to infinity, the $p$th standardized moment is the same as that of the standard normal distribution.</description>

      <title>Vital Edges for (s,t)-mincut: Efficient Algorithms, Compact Structures, and Optimal Sensitivity Oracle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12096v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let G be a directed weighted graph (DiGraph) on n vertices and m edges with source s and sink t. An edge in G is vital if its removal reduces the capacity of (s,t)-mincut. Since the seminal work of Ford and Fulkerson, a long line of work has been done on computing the most vital edge and all vital edges of G. Unfortunately, after 60 years, the existing results are for undirected or unweighted graphs. We present the following result for DiGraph, which solves an open problem stated by Ausiello et al.
  1. There is an algorithm that computes all vital edges as well as the most vital edge of G using O(n) maxflow computations.
  Vital edges play a crucial role in the design of Sensitivity Oracle (SO) for (s,t)-mincut. For directed graphs, the only existing SO is for unweighted graphs by Picard and Queyranne. We present the first and optimal SO for DiGraph.
  2. (a) There is an O(n) space SO that can report in O(1) time the capacity of (s,t)-mincut and (b) an O($n^2$) space SO that can report an (s,t)-mincut in O(n) time after failure/insertion of an edge.
  For unweighted graphs, Picard and Queyranne designed an O(m) space DAG that stores and characterizes all mincuts for all vital edges. Conversely, there is a set containing at most n-1 (s,t)-cuts such that at least one mincut for every vital edge belongs to the set. We generalize these results for DiGraph.
  3. (a) There is a set containing at most n-1 (s,t)-cuts such that at least one mincut for every vital edge is present in the set. (b) We design two compact structures for storing and characterizing all mincuts for all vital edges, (i) O(m) space DAG for partial characterization and (ii) O(mn) space structure for complete characterization.
  To arrive at our results, we develop new techniques, especially a generalization of maxflow-mincut theorem by Ford and Fulkerson, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>HYGENE: A Diffusion-based Hypergraph Generation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are powerful mathematical structures that can model complex, high-order relationships in various domains, including social networks, bioinformatics, and recommender systems. However, generating realistic and diverse hypergraphs remains challenging due to their inherent complexity and lack of effective generative models. In this paper, we introduce a diffusion-based Hypergraph Generation (HYGENE) method that addresses these challenges through a progressive local expansion approach. HYGENE works on the bipartite representation of hypergraphs, starting with a single pair of connected nodes and iteratively expanding it to form the target hypergraph. At each step, nodes and hyperedges are added in a localized manner using a denoising diffusion process, which allows for the construction of the global structure before refining local details. Our experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of HYGENE, proving its ability to closely mimic a variety of properties in hypergraphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to employ deep learning models for hypergraph generation, and our work aims to lay the groundwork for future research in this area.</description>
