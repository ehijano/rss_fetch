      <title>Information Flow in the FTX Bankruptcy: A Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the cryptocurrency network of the FTX exchange during the collapse of its native token, FTT, to understand how network structures adapt to significant financial disruptions, by exploiting vertex centrality measures. Using proprietary data on the transactional relationships between various cryptocurrencies, we construct the filtered correlation matrix to identify the most significant relations in the FTX and Binance markets. By using suitable centrality measures - closeness and information centrality - we assess network stability during FTX's bankruptcy. The findings document the appropriateness of such vertex centralities in understanding the resilience and vulnerabilities of financial networks. By tracking the changes in centrality values before and during the FTX crisis, this study provides useful insights into the structural dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. Results reveal how different cryptocurrencies experienced shifts in their network roles due to the crisis. Moreover, our findings highlight the interconnectedness of cryptocurrency markets and how the failure of a single entity can lead to widespread repercussions that destabilize other nodes of the network.</description>

      <title>To Trade Or Not To Trade: Cascading Waterfall Round Robin Rebalancing Mechanism for Cryptocurrencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have designed an innovative portfolio rebalancing mechanism termed the Cascading Waterfall Round Robin Mechanism. This algorithmic approach recommends an ideal size and number of trades for each asset during the periodic rebalancing process, factoring in the gas fee and slippage. The essence of the model we have created gives indications regarding whether trades should be made on individual assets depending on the uncertainty in the micro - asset level characteristics - and macro - aggregate market factors - environments. In the hyper-volatile crypto market, our approach to daily rebalancing will benefit from volatility. Price movements will cause our algorithm to buy assets that drop in prices and sell as they soar. In fact, the buying and selling happen only when certain boundaries are crossed in order to weed out any market noise and ensure sound trade execution. We have provided several numerical examples to illustrate the steps - including the calculation of several intermediate variables - of our rebalancing mechanism. The Algorithm we have developed can be easily applied outside blockchain to investment funds across all asset classes at any trading frequency and rebalancing duration.
  Shakespeare As A Crypto Trader:
  To Trade Or Not To Trade, that is the Question,
  Whether an Optimizer can Yield the Answer,
  Against the Spikes and Crashes of Markets Gone Wild,
  To Quench One's Thirst before Liquidity Runs Dry,
  Or Wait till the Tide of Momentum turns Mild.</description>
