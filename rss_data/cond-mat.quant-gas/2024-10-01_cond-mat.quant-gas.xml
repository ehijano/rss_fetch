      <title>The molecular nature of superfluidity: Viscosity of helium from quantum stochastic molecular dynamics simulations over real trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Infinite cycles of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first-quantized description of bosonic systems permutation cycles formed by the particles play a fundamental role. In the ideal Bose gas Bose-Enstein condensation (BEC) is signaled by the appearance of infinite cycles. When the particles interact, the two phenomena may not be simultaneous, the existence of infinite cycles is necessary but not sufficient for BEC. We demonstrate that their appearance is always accompanied by a singularity in the thermodynamic quantities which in three and four dimensions can be as strong as a one-sided divergence of the isothermal compressibility. Arguments are presented that long-range interactions can give rise to unexpected results, such as the absence of infinite cycles in three dimensions for long-range repulsion or their presence in one and two dimensions if the pair potential has a long attractive tail.</description>

      <title>Two-component droplet phases and their stability in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unravel the existence and stability properties of one-dimensional droplets arising in genuine two-component particle imbalanced bosonic mixtures under the influence of a weak harmonic confinement. A plethora of miscible droplet phases is found with the majority component atoms in the vicinity of the minority ones assembling in a droplet configuration while the remaining excess atoms being in the gas state. A transition from a bound to a trapped gas many-body state is identified for increasing total atom number and fixed interactions, with the bound character being prolonged for stronger intercomponent attractions. Spectral stability of these two-component droplets is revealed by examining their underlying Bogoliubov-de-Gennes excitation spectrum. Furthermore, the collective dynamics associated with the fundamental dipole and breathing modes of the system is monitored by suddenly shifting the trap's center or quenching the trap's frequency, respectively. A back action of the significantly localized minority component is imprinted in the majority cloud. Our findings can be simulated in recent cold-atom experiments, thus setting the stage for probing the complex nonequilibrium dynamics of two-component droplets.</description>

      <title>Cavity-induced quantum droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum droplets are formed in quantum many-body systems when the competition of quantum corrections with the mean-field interaction yields a stable self-bound quantum liquid. We predict the emergence of a quantum droplet when a Bose-Einstein condensate is placed in an optical resonator with transverse pumping. The strong coupling between the atoms and the cavity mode induces long-range interactions in the atoms and a roton mode for negative cavity detuning emerges. Using a Bogoliubov theory, we show that the roton mode competes with the repulsive atomic $s$-wave scattering. Due to the favorable scaling of the quantum fluctuations with respect to the volume, a self-bound stable quantum liquid emerges.</description>

      <title>Assessing small accelerations using a bosonic Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic Josephson junctions provide a versatile platform for exploring quantum tunneling and coherence phenomena in ultracold atomic systems. While extensive research has examined the Josephson-junction dynamics in various double-well configurations, most studies have been limited to inertial reference frames. In the present work, we posed the question how placing a Josephson junction in a non-inertial reference frame would impact the quantum tunnelling. Our findings demonstrate that accelerating a Josephson junction alters the tunneling dynamics. Conversely, tunneling behavior can be used to assess the acceleration of the system. By analyzing the changes in physical properties, we can assess the acceleration of the double-well. We begin with the most simple non-inertial frame: moving with constant acceleration. The tunneling time decreases exponentially as acceleration increases, making it effective for measuring larger accelerations. However, for smaller accelerations, accurate assessment requires accounting for many-body depletion, which decreases linearly as acceleration rises. Next, we explore a more complex scenario where the acceleration is time dependent. In this case, the acceleration is mapped onto the tunneling time period and depletion, which again serve as predictors of acceleration. We go further by conducting a detailed analysis of the change in tunnelling dynamics when the system deviates from constant or zero acceleration. The quantitative analysis show that the depletion changes exponentially near constant acceleration, while around zero acceleration, the change follows a polynomial pattern. All in all, we quantify how the tunneling process, as well as the mean-field and many-body properties, evolve in a non-inertial system of increasing complexity.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced Thouless pumping of solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed that a soliton resulting from nonlinearity can be pumped across an integer or fractional number of unit cells as a system parameter is slowly varied over a pump period. Nonlinear Thouless pumping is now understood as the flow of instantaneous Wannier functions, ruling out the possibility of pumping a soliton across a nonzero number of unit cells over one cycle when a corresponding Wannier function does not exhibit any flow, i.e., when the corresponding Bloch band that the soliton bifurcates from is topologically trivial. Here we surprisingly find an anomalous nonlinear Thouless pump where the displacement of a soliton over one cycle is twice the Chern number of the Bloch band from which the soliton bifurcates. We show that the breakdown of the correspondence between the displacement of a soliton and the Chern number arises from the emergence of a new branch of stable soliton solutions mainly consisting of two neighboring instantaneous Wannier functions. Furthermore, we find a nonlinearity-induced integer quantized Thouless pump, allowing a soliton to travel across one unit cell during a pump period, even when the corresponding band is topologically trivial. Our results open the door to studying nonlinearity-induced Thouless pumping of solitons.</description>

      <title>Probing Lambda-Gravity with Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a precise test of two fundamental gravitational constants using a novel detector concept that exploits the dynamics of quantum phononic excitations in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), operable at the scale of table-top experiments. In this setup, the sensitivity is enhanced by approximately two orders of magnitude through the use of a tritter operation, which mixes phononic excitations with the BEC's ground state. The BEC exhibits unique sensitivity to the two key components of the gravitational potential in $\Lambda$-gravity: the Newtonian $GM/r$ term and the cosmological constant $\Lambda r^2$. Using state-of-the-art experimental design, we predict that the gravitational constant $G$ could be measured with an accuracy up to $10^{-17}$ N m$^2$/kg$^2$, representing an improvement by two orders of magnitude over current measurements. Moreover, this experiment could establish the best Earth-based upper limit on $\Lambda$ at $&lt;10^{-31}$ m$^{-2}$, marking the first laboratory-based probe of the cosmological constant. Additionally, the setup allows for the measurement of the distance-dependent behaviour of each term in the gravitational potential, providing a novel means to test modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Thouless pumping in a Rice-Mele ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian Thouless pumping intertwines adiabatic quantum control and topological quantum transport and it holds potential for quantum metrology and computing. In this work, we introduce a ladder model featuring two doubly-degenerate bands and we show that adiabatic manipulation of the lattice parameters results in non-Abelian Thouless pumping, inducing both the displacement of an initially localized state and a geometric unitary transformation within the degenerate subspace. Additionally, we show that the structure and symmetry of the ladder model can be understood through its connection to a Yang monopole model. The proposed Hamiltonian can be realized using cold atoms in optical lattices, enabling the experimental demonstration of non-Abelian Thouless pumping in a genuinely quantum many-body system.</description>

      <title>Floquet evolution of the q-deformed \texorpdfstring{SU(3)${}_1$}{SU(3)1} Yang-Mills theory on a two-leg ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate Floquet time-evolution of a truncated SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills theory on a two-leg ladder geometry under open boundary conditions using IBM's superconducting 156-qubit device ibm\_fez. To this end, we derive the quantum spin representation of the lattice Yang-Mills theory, and compose a quantum circuit carefully tailored to hard wares, reducing the use of CZ gates. Since it is still challenging to simulate Hamiltonian evolution in present noisy quantum processors, we make the step size in the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition very large, and simulate thermalization dynamics in Floquet circuit composed of the Suzuki-Trotter evolution. We demonstrate that IBM's Heron quantum processor can simulate, by error mitigation, Floqeut thermalization dynamics in a large system consisting of $62$ qubits. Our work would be a benchmark for further quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories using real devices.</description>

      <title>Supersolidity of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates induced by coupling to fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a mixture of a repulsive dipolar condensate and a degenerate Fermi gas in a quasi-one-dimensional geometry. We demonstrate that the presence of fermions, which attract bosons, drastically changes the behavior of the dipolar condensate. For strong enough boson-fermion attraction, a dipolar Bose-Fermi droplet appears in the mixture, and as the attraction becomes stronger, a roton excitation develops in the Bogoliubov spectrum, leading to the formation of a supersolid, and eventually a crystal of isolated droplets. We describe the system by coupled extended Gross-Pitaevskii (bosons) and Hartree-Fock (fermions) equations. We study the excitation spectrum of the system and identify a number of Goldstone and Higgs modes in the supersolid regime.</description>

      <title>Melting of a vortex matter Wigner crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-dimensional One-Component Plasma (OCP) is a foundational model of the statistical mechanics of interacting particles, describing phenomena common to astrophysics, turbulence, and the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE). Despite an extensive literature, the phase diagram of the 2D OCP is still a subject of some controversy. Here we develop a "vortex matter" simulator to realize the logarithmic-interaction OCP experimentally by exploiting the topological character of quantized vortices in a thin superfluid layer. Precision optical-tweezer control of the location of quantized vortices enables direct preparation of the OCP ground state with or without defects, and heating from acoustic excitations allows the observation of the melting transition from the solid Wigner crystal through the liquid phase. We present novel theoretical analysis that is in quantitative agreement with experimental observations, and demonstrates how equilibrium states are achieved through the system dynamics. This allows a precise measurement of the superfluid-thermal cloud mutual friction and heating coefficients. This platform provides a route towards solving a number of open problems in systems with long-range interactions. At equilibrium, it could distinguish between the competing scenarios of grain boundary melting and KTHNY theory. Dynamical simulators could test the existence of predicted edge-wave solitons which form a hydrodynamic analogue of topological edge states in the FQHE.</description>

      <title>Fate of the Mollow triplet in strongly-coupled atomic arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subwavelength arrays of quantum two-level emitters have emerged as an interesting platform displaying prominent collective effects that can be harnessed for applications. Here we study such arrays under strong coherent driving, realizing an open quantum many-body problem in a strongly non-linear regime. For this we introduce a novel approach to this problem in terms of a Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT), paving the way for further studies. We show that the spectrum of scattered light, characterized by the famous Mollow triplet for a single atom, develops a characteristic lineshape with flat sidebands determined by dipolar interactions and relevant for experiments. Remarkably, this is to some extent independent of the specific geometry, but is sensitive to the ordered arrangement of the atoms. This lineshape therefore characterizes atomic arrays and distinguishes them from disordered ensembles and non-interacting emitters.</description>

Abstract: We study a supersolid in the context of a Gross-Pitaevskii theory with a non-local effective potential. We employ a homogenisation technique which allows us to calculate the elastic moduli, supersolid fraction and other state variables of the system. Our methodology is verified against numerical simulations of elastic deformations. We can also verify that the long-wavelength Goldstone modes that emerge from this technique agree with Bogoliubov theory. We find a thermodynamic anomaly that the supersolid does not obey the thermodynamic relation $\partial P / \partial V \bigr|_N = - n \, \partial P / \partial N \bigr|_V$, which we claim is a feature unique to supersolids.</description>

      <title>Superfluid--Bose-glass transition in a system of disordered bosons with long-range hopping in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the superfluid--Bose-glass transition in a one-dimensional lattice boson model with power-law decaying hopping amplitude $t_{i-j}\sim 1/|i-j|^\alpha$, using bosonization and the nonperturbative functional renormalization group (FRG). When $\alpha$ is smaller than a critical value $\alpha_c&lt;3$, the U(1) symmetry is spontaneously broken, which leads to a density mode with nonlinear dispersion and dynamical exponent $z=(\alpha-1)/2$; the superfluid phase is then stable for sufficiently weak disorder, contrary to the case of short-range hopping where the superfluid phase is destabilized by an infinitesimal disorder when the Luttinger parameter is smaller than $3/2$. In the presence of disorder, long-range hopping has however no effect in the infrared limit and the FRG flow eventually becomes similar to that of a boson system with short-range hopping. This implies that the superfluid phase, when stable, exhibits a density mode with linear dispersion ($z=1$) and the superfluid--Bose-glass transition remains in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class, while the Bose-glass fixed point is insensitive to long-range hopping. We compare our findings with a recent numerical study.</description>

      <title>Phase-induced vortex pinning in rotating supersolid dipolar systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the pinning of vortices for a stationary rotating dipolar supersolid along the low-density paths between droplets as a function of the rotation frequency. We restrict ourselves to the stationary configurations of vortices with the same symmetry as that of the array of droplets. In particular, such an analysis clearly reveals that vortices are not only pinned at local density minima, but instead their coordinates are smooth functions of the rotation frequency. Our approach to explaining such a behavior exploits the fact that the wave function of each rotating droplet acquires a linear phase on the coordinates. Hence, the relative phases between the nearest neighboring droplets allow us to predict the position of the vortices in the intermediate low-density region. Here, we show that for a droplet distribution forming a triangular lattice, the phases of three neighboring droplets are needed for the correct description of the vortex location. In particular, for our confined system, we demonstrate that the estimate accurately reproduces the extended Gross-Pitaevskii results in the spatial regions where the neighboring droplets are well-defined.</description>

      <title>Precision measurement for open systems by non-hermitian linear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lower bound of estimated precision for a coherent parameter unitarily encoded in closed systems has been obtained, and such a lower bound is inversely proportional to the fluctuation of the encoding operator. In this paper, we first derive some general results regarding the lower bound of estimated precision for a dissipative parameter, which is non-unitarily encoded in open systems, by combining the law of error propagation and the non-hermitian linear response theory. This lower bound is related to the correlation of the encoding dissipative operator and the evolution time. We next demonstrate the utility of our general results by considering three different kinds of non-unitary encoding processes, including particle loss, relaxation, and dephasing. We finally compare the lower bound with the quantum Fisher information obtained by tomography and find they are consistent in the regime where the non-hermitian linear response applies. This lower bound can guide us to find the optimal initial states and detecting operators to significantly simplify the measurement process.</description>

      <title>Density effects on the interferometry of Efimov states by modulating magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical association of Efimov trimers in thermal gases by means of modulated magnetic fields has proven very fruitful in determining the binding energy of trimers. The latter was extracted from the number of remaining atoms, which featured oscillatory fringes stemming from the superposition of trimers with atom-dimers. Subsequent theoretical investigations utilizing the time-dependent three-body problem revealed additional association mechanisms, manifested as superpositions of the Efimov state with the trap states and the latter with atom-dimers. The three atoms were initialized in a way to emulate a thermal gas with uniform density. Here, this analysis is extended by taking into account the effects of the density profile of a semi-classical thermal gas. The supersposition of the Efimov trimer with the first atom-dimer remains the same, while the frequencies of highly oscillatory fringes shift to lower values. The latter refer to the frequencies of trimers and atom-dimers in free space since the density profile smears out the contribution of trap states.</description>

      <title>Transition temperature of the homogeneous imperfect Bose gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond standard approaches in existing literature, we explore the relative shift in the transition temperature of a homogeneous dilute Bose gas using the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective action formalism within the improved Hartree-Fock approximation. The first correction to the enhancement of the transition temperature, as compared to that of the ideal Bose gas, is expressed in a universal form: it is linear with respect to the scattering length. The slope of this linear relationship shows excellent agreement with the exact numerical calculations presented in previous studies. Additionally, we identify non-universal terms contributing to the shift.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Non-Hermitian Skin Effect for Multipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the fate of the non-Hermitian skin effect in one-dimensional systems that conserve the dipole moment and higher moments of an associated global $\text{U}(1)$ charge. Motivated by field theoretical arguments and lattice model calculations, we demonstrate that the key feature of the non-Hermitian skin effect for $m$-pole conserving systems is the generation of an $(m+1)$th multipole moment. For example, in contrast to the conventional skin effect where charges are anomalously localized at one boundary, the dipole-conserving skin effect results in charges localized at both boundaries, in a configuration that generates an extremal quadrupole moment. In addition, we explore the dynamical consequences of the $m$-pole skin effect, focusing on charge and entanglement propagation. Both numerically and analytically, we provide evidence that long-time steady-states have Fock-space localization and an area-law scaling of entanglement entropy, which serve as quantum indicators of the skin effect.</description>

      <title>General criterion for non-Hermitian skin effects and Application: Fock space skin effects in many body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity enables macroscopic accumulation of bulk states, named non-Hermitian skin effects. The non-Hermitian skin effects are well-established for single-particle systems, but their proper characterization for general systems is elusive. Here, we propose a general criterion of non-Hermitian skin effects, which works for any finite-dimensional system evolved by a linear operator. The applicable systems include many-body systems and network systems. A system meeting the criterion exhibits enhanced non-normality of the evolution operator, accompanied by exceptional characteristics intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Applying the criterion, we discover a new type of non-Hermitian skin effect in many-body systems, which we dub the Fock space skin effect. We also discuss the Fock space skin effect-induced slow dynamics, which gives an experimental signal for the Fock space skin effect.</description>
