      <title>Harnessing cardiac power: heart kinetic motion analysis for energy harvesters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the complex motion of the heart can unlock enormous potential for kinetic energy harvesting. This paper presents a foundational dataset for heart kinetic motion through in-vivo tests and investigates the most influential factors in heart kinetic motion. In-vivo tests on a living pig's heart, with signal processing, were carried out to study the heart movement by heart beating and respiration motions. A network of nine points on the heart was employed for in vivo measurements. These measurements illustrated the kinetic energy signals in displacement, velocity, and acceleration. The results indicated that the motion level varies in distinct locations over epicardium. The statistical features and autocorrelations were reported for these points, illustrating the highest displacement and acceleration. Each heartbeat generated an energy of 14.35 mJ and a power of 1.03 W. However, this available energy is not uniformly distributed. The results illustrated that not only is cardiac movement location-dependent, but the speed of cardiac displacement cycles is also location-dependent. The right atrium has the highest cardiac kinetic movement with an amplitude of 16.19 mm displacement and 16.3 m/s2 acceleration. To evaluate the energy harvesting possibility from the heart's motion, a piezoelectric energy harvester was simulated by the finite element method, implying that the energy harvesting level significantly depends on implant location over epicardium. The results of this study open the potential of designing novel energy harvesters based on accurate heart movements and provide a foundation for future investigations of energy harvesting for leadless pacemaker energy systems.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Ultrasound for Periodontal Soft Tissue Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodontal diseases affect 45.9\% of adults aged 30 or older in the United States. Current diagnostic methods for clinical assessment of these diseases are visual examination and bleeding on probing that are subjective, qualitative, and/or invasive. Thus, there is a critical need for research on noninvasive modalities for periodontal tissue characterization. Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) has shown promising results in noninvasive characterization of various soft tissues; however, it has not been used in periodontics. This study is among initial investigations into the application of QUS for periodontal tissue characterization in the literature. Here, QUS analysis of oral soft tissues (alveolar mucosa and gingiva) is performed in an in vivo animal study including 10 swine. US scanning was performed at the first molar of all four oral quadrants, resulting in a total of 40 scans. We investigated first order speckle statistics of oral tissues by using the two-parameter Burr (power-law b and scale factor l) and Nakagami models (shape factor m and scale factor $\alpha$). Parametric imaging of these parameters was created using a sliding kernel method sweeping regions of interest with a kernel size of 10 wavelengths from a phantom study. Results showed that the difference between gingiva and alveolar mucosa were statistically significant using Burr and Nakagami parameters ($p-value&lt;0.0001$). The Burr b and Nakagami m were higher in gingiva while the Burr l and Nakagami {$\alpha$} were higher in alveolar mucosa. Findings from QUS analyses agreed with observation from histology that showed denser stains for gingiva. Linear classifications of these tissues using 2D parameter spaces of the Burr and Nakagami models resulted in a segmentation accuracy of 93.51\% and 90.91\%, respectively. We propose that QUS holds promising potentials as an augmented tool for disease diagnosis in periodontology.</description>

      <title>List-Mode PET Image Reconstruction Using Dykstra-Like Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convergence of the block iterative method in image reconstruction for positron emission tomography (PET) requires careful control of relaxation parameters, which is a challenging task. The automatic determination of relaxation parameters for list-mode reconstructions also remains challenging. Therefore, a different approach would be desirable. In this study, we propose a list-mode maximum likelihood Dykstra-like splitting PET reconstruction (LM-MLDS). LM-MLDS converges the list-mode block iterative method by adding the distance from an initial image as a penalty term into an objective function. LM-MLDS takes a two-step approach because its performance depends on the quality of the initial image. The first step uses a uniform image as the initial image, and then the second step uses a reconstructed image after one main iteration as the initial image. In a simulation study, LM-MLDS provided a better tradeoff curve between noise and contrast than the other methods. In a clinical study, LM-MLDS removed the false hotspots at the edge of the axial field of view and improved the image quality of slices covering the top of the head to the cerebellum. List-mode proximal splitting reconstruction is useful not only for optimizing nondifferential functions but also for converging block iterative methods without controlling relaxation parameters.</description>
