      <title>Existence and nonexistence of sign-changing solutions for linearly perturbed superlinear equations on exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study radial solutions of $\Delta u + K(|x|) f(u)+\frac{ (N-2)^2 u}{|x|^{2+(N-2)\delta}} =0, \ 0&lt;\delta&lt;2$ in the exterior of the ball of radius $R&gt;0$ in ${\mathbb R}^{N}$ where $f$ grows superlinearly at infinity and is singular at $0$ with $f(u) \sim -\frac{1}{|u|^{q-1}u}$ and $0&lt;q&lt;1$ for small $u$. We assume $K(|x|) \sim |x|^{-\alpha}$ for large $|x|$ and establish the existence of an infinite number of sign-changing solutions when $N+q(N-2) &lt;\alpha &lt;2(N-1).$ We also prove nonexistence for $0&lt;\alpha \leq2$.</description>

      <title>Diffusion over ramified domains: solvability and fine regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a domain $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R\!}^{\,2}$ with branched fractal boundary $\Gamma^{\infty}$ and parameter $\tau\in[1/2,\tau^{\ast}]$ introduced by Achdou and Tchou \cite{ACH08}, for $\tau^{\ast}\simeq 0.593465$, which acts as an idealization of the bronchial trees in the lungs systems. For each $\tau\in[1/2,\tau^{\ast}]$, the corresponding region $\Omega$ is a non-Lipschitz domain, which attains its roughest structure at the critical value $\tau=\tau^{\ast}$ in such way that in this endpoint parameter the region $\Omega$ fails to be an extension domain, and its ramified boundary $\Gamma^{\infty}$ is not post-critically finite. Then, we investigate a model equation related to the diffusion of oxygen through the bronchial trees by considering the realization of a generalized diffusion equation with inhomogeneous mixed-type boundary conditions. Under minimal assumptions, we first show that the stationary version of the above diffusion equation in uniquely solvable, and that the corresponding weak solution in globally H\"older continuous on $\overline{\Omega}$. Since we are including the critical case $\tau=\tau^{\ast}$, this is the first time in which global uniform continuity of weak solutions of a Robin-type boundary value problem is attained over a non-extension domain. Furthermore, after two transitioning procedures, we prove the unique solvability of the inhomogeneous time-dependent diffusion equation, and we show that the corresponding weak solution is globally uniformly continuous over $[0,T]\times\overline{\Omega}$ for each fixed parameter $T&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Nonspherically symmetric equilibrium bubbles in a steadily rotating incompressible fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note presents two nontrivial, rotational equilibrium solutions to the spatial uniform gas pressure (isobaric) approximate model of Prosperetti in the inviscid case. Building on Gavrilov's work [GAFA 2019], we first establish the existence of equilibrium solutions with nontrivial (rotational) liquid flow. Second, we construct a nonspherically symmetric, horn-torus-shaped equilibrium bubble under mild spatial decay conditions of the liquid flow. In addition, we extend earlier results on the characterization of spherical equilibrium bubbles to the axisymmetric, purely azimuthal setting. Finally, we implement a numerical simulation of the equilibrium bubble shape using the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the essential connection of the parabolic inertia Lam\'{e} equations and Navier-Stokes equations, we prove the existence of smooth solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$ by showing the existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions of the parabolic inertia Lam\'{e} equations and by letting a Lam\'{e} constant $\lambda$ tends to infinity (the other Lam\'{e} constant $\mu&gt;0$ is fixed).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existence of mild solutions for the magnetohydrodynamical system in $\mathscr{C}^1$ domains is established in critical spaces in dimension $n\ge 3$. The proof relies on recent regularity results on the Stokes operator in $\mathscr{C}^1$ domains and a Leibniz-like formula for differential forms proved here in Section 2.</description>

      <title>$H^s_x$ regularity of solutions to the stationary Boltzmann equation with the incoming boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stationary Boltzmann equation with the cross section of the form $B(|v - \tilde{v}, \theta|) = B_0 |v - \tilde{v}|^\gamma \cos \theta \sin \theta$ for $-3 &lt; \gamma \leq 1$ in a bounded convex domain under the incoming boundary condition. In this article, we shall show the existence of a solution in a weighted $L^\infty$ space with fractional Sobolev regularity without assuming the positivity of the Gaussian curvature on the boundary. For boundary data sufficiently smooth and close to the standard Maxwellian, the solution has $H^{1-}_x$ regularity for $-2 \leq \gamma \leq 1$, while only worse regularity is obtained for $-3 &lt; \gamma &lt; -2$. We first show the well-posedness of the linearized problem on a weighted $L^2$ space and develop the $L^2-L^\infty$ estimate without the stochastic cycle. We next investigate $H^s_x$ regularity of the solution to the linearized problem. The velocity averaging lemma plays a key role in our analysis. We finally derive a bilinear estimate to extend results on the linearized problem to the weakly nonlinear problem.</description>

      <title>Quantum ergodicity for contact metric structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the proof of a Quantum Ergodicity (QE) theorem for the eigenfunctions of subLaplacians on contact metric manifolds, under the assumption that the Reeb flow is ergodic. To do so, we rely on a semiclassical pseudodifferential calculus developed for general filtered manifolds that we specialize to the setting of contact manifolds. Our strategy is then reminiscent of an implementation of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation as we rely on the construction of microlocal projectors in our calculus which commute with the subLaplacian, called Landau projectors. The subLaplacian is then shown to act effectively on the range of each Landau projector as the Reeb vector field does. The remainder of the proof follows the classical path towards QE, once microlocal Weyl laws have been established.</description>

      <title>Long-time existence for the 2D ideal Boussinesq and the 2D density-dependent Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish long-time existence of smooth solutions to the 2D ideal Boussinesq equations and to the 2D non-homogeneous incompressible Euler equations for initial data consisting of small temperature perturbations, or small density perturbations, of smooth initial flows which are not necessarily small. Both results are known (see Danchin and Fanelli 2013, Danchin 2011 in the references) but the technique we develop to prove them is at the same time elementary and has broad potential applicability.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the compressible boundary layer equations with analytic initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the well-posedness of the compressible boundary layer equations with data being analytic in the tangential variable of the boundary. The compressible boundary layer equations, a nonlinear coupled system of degenerate parabolic equations and an elliptic equation, describe the behavior of thermal layer and viscous layer in the small viscosity and heat conductivity limit, for the two-dimensional compressible viscous flow with heat conduction with nonslip and zero heat flux boundary conditions. We use the Littlewood-Paley theory to establish the a priori estimates for solutions of this compressible boundary layer problem, and obtain the local existence and uniqueness of the solution in the space of analytic in the tangential variable and Sobolev in the normal variable.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Hardy-Stein type identities for harmonic functions relative to symmetric integro-differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show identities of Hardy-Stein type for harmonic functions relative to integro-differential operators corresponding to general symmetric regular Dirichlet forms satisfying the absolute continuity condition. The novelty is that we consider operators of mixed type containing both local and nonlocal component. Moreover, the identities are proved for compositions of harmonic functions and general convex functions. We also provide some conditional identities, i.e. identities for ratios of harmonic functions. As an application we give a characterization of norms in harmonic Hardy spaces and prove Littlewood--Paley type estimates for square functions. To illustrate general results, we discuss in some details the case of divergence form operator and purely nonlocal operator defined by some jump kernel. Our proofs are rather short and use mainly probabilistic methods.</description>

      <title>Quadratic flatness and Regularity for Codimension-One Varifolds with Bounded Anisotropic Mean Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a uniformly convex norm $ \phi $ on $ \mathbf{R}^{n+1} $ and a unit-density $ n $-dimensional varifold $ V $ in an open subset of $ \mathbf{R}^{n+1} $ with bounded mean $ \phi $-curvature, under the hypothesis
  $$ \textrm{$\mathcal{H}^n \llcorner {\rm spt}\| V \| $ is absolutely continuous with respect to $ \| V \| $},$$
  we prove that there exists an open dense $ \mathscr{C}^{1, \alpha}$-regular part in $ {\rm spt} \| V \| $. Moreover we prove that the $ \mathscr{C}^{1, \alpha}$-regular part of $ V $ is $ \mathcal{H}^n $-almost equal to $({\rm spt}\| V \|)^\ast $, the subset of $ {\rm spt}\| V \| $ where at least one blow up (in Hausdorff distance) of $ {\rm spt}\| V \| $ is not equal to $ \mathbf{R}^{n+1} $.
  These results are consequences of a quadratic flatness theorem asserting that if $ V $ is a general -- not necessarily rectifiable -- varifold $ V $ with bounded mean $ \phi $-curvature and locally $ \mathcal{H}^n $-finite support, then the set of points $ R $ where $ {\rm spt}\| V \|$ admits (exactly) two mutually tangent balls satisfies $ \mathcal{H}^n(({\rm spt}\| V \|)^\ast \setminus R) =0 $ and meets each relatively open set of $ {\rm spt}\| V \| $ on a set of positive $ \mathcal{H}^n $-measure. Indeed, quadratic flatness at a point guarantees that the Allard anisotropic regularity theorem can be applied, hence proving that $ {\rm spt}\| V \|$ is regular around that point.</description>

      <title>Consistency of tug-of-war type operators on random data clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a tug-of-war type operator on geometric graphs and its associated Dirichlet problem on a random data cloud.
  Specifically, we analyze the convergence of the value functions as the number of data points increases and the step size of the game shrinks. This analysis reveals the connection between our tug-of-war type operator and the corresponding model problem.
  A key ingredient in establishing this result is the consistency of the operator.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Kedem-Katchalsky boundary conditions for systems with spatial heterogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates a model describing the interaction of two species in habiting separate but adjacent areas. These populations are governed by a system of
  equations that account for spatial variations in growth rates and the effects of crowding.
  A key feature is the presence of areas within each domain where resources are unlimited
  and crowding effects are absent. The species interact solely through a common bound ary interface, which is modeled by asymmetric Kedem-Katchalsky boundary conditions.
  The paper provides existence, non-existence, and behavior of positive solutions for the
  system. It is shown that a unique positive population distribution exists when one of the
  growth rate parameters falls within a specific range defined by two critical values. One of
  these critical values represents a bifurcation point where the population can emerge from
  extinction, while the other is determined by the characteristics of the refuge areas. The
  study also examines how the populations behave as the growth parameter approaches the
  upper critical value. This analysis reveals the phenomenon of non-simultaneous blow-up,
  where one population component can grow infinitely large within its refuge zone while
  the other remains bounded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $\mathbf L^\infty$ solutions to $2\times 2$ systems of conservation laws. For genuinely nonlinear systems we prove that finite entropy solutions (in particular entropy solutions, if a uniformly convex entropy exists) belong to $C^0(\mathbb R^+; \mathbf L^1_{loc}(\mathbb R))$. Our second result establishes a dispersive-type decay estimate for vanishing viscosity solutions. Both results are unified by the use of a kinetic formulation.</description>

Abstract: We prove higher integrability for local minimizers of the double-phase orthotropic functional \[
  \sum_{i=1}^{n}\int_\Omega\left(\left|u_{x_i}\right|^p+a(x)\left| u_{x_i}\right|^q\right)dx \] when the weight function $a \geq0$ is assumed to be $\alpha$-H\"older continuous, while the exponents $p, q$ are such that $2 \leq p \leq q$ and $\frac{q}{p} &lt; 1 + \frac{\alpha}{n}$. Under natural Sobolev regularity of~$a$, we further obtain explicit Lipschitz regularity estimates for local minimizers.</description>

Abstract: This article aims to investigate the existence of bounded positive solutions of problem \[ (P)\qquad \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} - {\rm div} (a(x,u,\nabla u)) + A_t(x,u,\nabla u) = g(x,u) &amp;\hbox{in $\Omega$,}\\ u\ = \ 0 &amp; \hbox{on $\partial\Omega$,} \end{array}\right.\] with $A_t(x,t,\xi) = \frac{\partial A}{\partial t}(x,t,\xi)$, $a(x,t,\xi) = \nabla_\xi A(x,t,\xi)$ for a given $A(x,t,\xi)$ which grows as $|\xi|^p + |t|^p$ , $p &gt; 1$, where $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^N$, $N \ge 2$, is an open connected domain with Lipschitz boundary and infinite Lebesgue measure, eventually $\Omega = \mathbb{R}^N$, which generalizes the modified Schr\"odinger equation \[ - {\rm div} ((A^*_1(x) + A^*_2(x)|u|^{s}) \nabla u) + \frac{s}2 A^*_2(x)\ |u|^{s - 2} u\ |\nabla u|^2 + u\ =\ |u|^{\mu-2}u \quad\hbox{in $\mathbb{R}^3$.} \] Under suitable assumptions on $A(x,t,\xi)$ and $g(x,t)$, problem $(P)$ has a variational structure. Then, even in lack of radial symmetry hypotheses, one bounded positive solution of $(P)$ can be found by passing to the limit on a sequence $(u_k)_k$ of bounded solutions on bounded domains. Furthermore, if stronger hypotheses are satisfied, either such a solution is nontrivial or a constant $\bar{\lambda} &gt; 0$ and a sequence of points $(y_k)_k \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ exist such that \[ |y_k| \to +\infty\qquad \hbox{and}\qquad \int_{B_1(y_k)} |u_k|^p dx \ge \bar{\lambda}\quad \hbox{for all $k \ge 1$.} \]</description>

      <title>Schrodinger-Poisson-Slater equations with nonlinearity subscaled near zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the following zero-mass Schr{\"o}dinger-Poisson-Slater equation \[ - \Delta u + \left( \frac{1}{4 \pi | x |} \ast u^2 \right) u = f (| x |, u) \text{,} \qquad u \in \mathcal{D}^{1, 2} (\mathbb{R}^3) \text{} \] with nonlinearity subscaled near zero in the sense that $f (| x |, t) \approx a | t |^{p - 2} t$ as $| t | \rightarrow 0$ for some $p\in\big(\frac{18}{7},3\big)$. A nonzero solution is obtained via Morse theory when the nonlinearity is asymptotically scaled at infinity. For this purpose we prove an abstract result on the critical groups at infinity for functionals satisfying the geometric assumptions of the scaled saddle point theorem of Mercuri \&amp; Perera [arXiv:2411.15887]. For the case that $f (| x |, \cdot)$ is odd, a sequence of solutions are obtained via a version of Clark's theorem due to Kajikiya [J.\ Funct.\ Anal.\ 225 (2005) 352--370].</description>

      <title>Implementation of the inverse scattering transform method for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the initial-value problem for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Application of the inverse scattering transform method involves solving direct and inverse scattering problems for the Zakharov-Shabat system with complex potentials. We solve these problems by using new series representations for the Jost solutions of the Zakharov-Shabat system. The representations have the form of power series with respect to a transformed spectral parameter. In terms of the representations, solution of the direct scattering problem reduces to computing the series coefficients following a simple recurrent integration procedure, computation of the scattering coefficients by multiplying corresponding pairs of polynomials (partial sums of the series representations) and locating zeros of a polynomial inside the unit disk. Solution of the inverse scattering problem reduces to the solution of a system of linear algebraic equations for the power series coefficients, while the potential is recovered from the first coefficients. The system is obtained directly from the scattering relations. Thus, unlike other existing techniques, the method does not involve solving the Gelfand-Levitan-Marchenko equation or the matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem. The overall approach leads to a simple and efficient algorithm for the numerical solution of the initial-value problem for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, which is illustrated by numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously establish the formal asymptotics of Neu for Gross-Pitaevskii vortex dynamics in the plane. Given any integer $n\geq2$, we construct a family of $n$-vortex solutions with vortices of degree $\pm1$, and describe precisely the solution profile and associated vortex dynamics on an arbitrarily large, finite time interval. We compute an asymptotic expansion of the vortex positions in terms of the vortex core size $\epsilon&gt;0$, and show that the dynamics is governed at leading order as $\epsilon\to0$ by the classical Helmholtz-Kirchhoff system. Moreover, we show that the first correction to the leading order dynamics is determined by the solution of a linear wave equation, justifying a formal expansion found by Ovchinnikov and Sigal.</description>

      <title>Data assimilation with the 2D Navier-Stokes equations: Optimal Gaussian asymptotics for the posterior measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A functional Bernstein - von Mises theorem is proved for posterior measures arising in a data assimilation problem with the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation where a Gaussian process prior is assigned to the initial condition of the system. The posterior measure, which provides the update in the space of all trajectories arising from a discrete sample of the (deterministic) dynamics, is shown to be approximated by a Gaussian random vector field arising from the solution to a linear parabolic PDE with Gaussian initial condition. The approximation holds in the strong sense of the supremum norm on the regression functions, showing that predicting future states of Navier-Stokes systems admits $1/\sqrt N$-consistent estimators even for commonly used nonparametric models. Consequences for coverage of credible bands and uncertainty quantification are discussed. A local asymptotic minimax theorem is derived that describes the lower bound for estimating the state of the nonlinear system, which is shown to be attained by the Bayesian data assimilation algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we utilize formal integrability to construct a class of differential complexes, thereby providing a resolution for the sheaf of basic sections of a basic vector bundle, as well as a global realization of the Morse-Novikov-Treves complex. In the context of Levi flat structures, we introduce a notion of convexity for each Hermitian metric on a basic line bundle, which enables us to establish vanishing theorems and the global solvability of the Morse-Novikov-Treves complex. In the special case of elliptic structures, we further obtain results concerning singular cohomology and the extension problem for canonical forms.</description>

      <title>A new approach to the Monge-Amp\`ere eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the eigenvalue problem for the complex Monge-Amp\`ere operator in bounded hyperconvex domains in $\C^n$, where the right-hand side is a non-pluripolar positive Borel measure. We establish the uniqueness of eigenfunctions in the finite energy class introduced by Cegrell, up to positive multiplicative constants, and provide a Rayleigh quotient type formula for computing the eigenvalue.
  Under a natural continuity assumption on the measure, we further show that both the eigenvalue and eigenfunctions can be obtained via an iterative procedure starting from any negative finite energy function.
  Our approach relies on the fine properties of plurisubharmonic envelopes, which allow a partial sublinearization of the nonlinear problem. As far as we know, this method is new, even in the linear case, and not only yields new results but also significantly simplifies existing arguments in the literature. Moreover, it extends naturally to the setting of complex Hessian operators.
  Finally, by translating our results from the complex Monge-Amp\`ere setting via a logarithmic transformation, we also obtain several interesting analogues for the real Monge-Amp\`ere operator.</description>

Abstract: We establish the existence of hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature and a prescribed boundary in Euclidean space, represented as radial graphs over domains of the unit sphere. Under the assumptions that the mean curvature of the domain's boundary is positive and that a subsolution exists for the associated Dirichlet problem, we extend Serrin's classical result to include the case of positive constant mean curvature.</description>

Abstract: In $3+1$ dimensions, we study the stability of Kasner solutions for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field-Vlasov system. This system incorporates gravity, electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions for the initial stage of our universe. Due to the presence of the Vlasov field, various new challenges arise. By observing detailed mathematical structures and designing new delicate arguments, we identify a new strong sub-critical regime and prove the nonlinear stability with Kasner exponents lying in this full regime. This extends the result of Fournodavlos-Rodnianski-Speck [8] from the Einstein-scalar field system to the physically more complex system with the Vlasov field.</description>

      <title>A priori regularity estimates for equations degenerating on nodal sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a priori and a posteriori H\"older bounds and Schauder $C^{1,\alpha}$ estimates for continuous solutions of degenerate elliptic equations with variable coefficients of the form $$ \mathrm{div}\left(|u|^a A\nabla w\right)=0\qquad\mathrm{in \ }\Omega\subset\mathbb R^2,\quad a\in\mathbb R, $$ where the weight $u$ is itself a solution to an elliptic equation of the type $\mathrm{div}(A \nabla u) = 0$, with $A$ a Lipschitz-continuous, uniformly elliptic matrix. The function $u$ is allowed to have a nontrivial, possibly singular nodal set.
  The estimates are uniform with respect to $u$ within a class of normalized solutions having bounded Almgren frequency. In the special case $a = 2$, our results apply to the ratio of two solutions to the same elliptic equation sharing a common zero set. Precisely, we prove higher-order boundary Harnack principles on nodal domains, via the derived Schauder estimates for the associated degenerate equations. The results are based upon a fine blow-up argument, a Liouville theorem, and quasiconformal maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06376v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantitative analysis of bubbling phenomena for almost constant mean curvature boundaries is an important question having significant applications in various fields including capillarity theory and the study of mean curvature flows. Such a quantitative analysis was initiated in [G. Ciraolo and F. Maggi, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. (2017)], where the first quantitative result of proximity to a set of disjoint balls of equal radii was obtained in terms of a uniform deviation of the mean curvature from being constant. Weakening the measure of the deviation in such a result is a delicate issue that is crucial in view of the applications for mean curvature flows. Some progress in this direction was recently made in [V. Julin and J. Niinikoski, Anal. PDE (2023)], where $L^{N-1}$-deviations are considered for domains in $\mathbb{R}^N$. In the present paper we significantly weaken the measure of the deviation, obtaining a quantitative result of proximity to a set of disjoint balls of equal radii for the following deviation $$ \int_{\partial \Omega } \left( H_0 - H \right)^+ dS_x, \quad \text{ where } \begin{cases} H \text{ is the mean curvature of } \partial \Omega , \\ H_0:=\frac{| \partial \Omega |}{N | \Omega |} , \\ \left( H_0 - H \right)^+:=\max\left\lbrace H_0 - H , 0 \right\rbrace , \end{cases} $$ which is clearly even weaker than $\Vert H_0-H \Vert_{L^1( \partial \Omega )}$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Propagation of Chaos for 2D Viscous Vortex Model with General Circulations on the Whole Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive quantitative propagation of chaos in the sense of relative entropy for the 2D viscous vortex model with general circulations, approximating the vorticity formulation of the 2D Navier-Stokes equation on the whole Euclidean space, which is an extension of the previous works \cite{fournier2014propagation,jabin2018quantitative}. We improve our previous results in \cite{feng2023quantitative} to the more general case that the vorticity may change sign, allowing the circulations to be in different orientations. We also extend the results of \cite{wang2024sharp} to the whole space to obtain the sharp local propagation of chaos in the high viscosity regime. Both results of convergence rates are global-in-time on any finite time horizon and optimal among existing literature, thanks to the sharp logarithmic growth estimates and a new ODE hierarchy and iterated integral estimates.</description>

The proofs are based on a careful phase analysis and estimates in the intrinsic geometries.</description>

Upper and lower bounds are obtained for the product of $p$-capacity and powers of the $q$-torsional rigidity over the collection of all non-empty, open, bounded and convex sets in $\R^d$ with either a perimeter constraint, or a measure constraint, or a combination of perimeter and measure constraints. For some range of parameters we identify the ball as the unique (up to homotheties) maximiser or minimiser respectively.</description>

By employing variational methods we prove the bifurcation of periodic traveling water waves -- which are steady in a moving frame -- for {\it all} the values of gravity, surface tension, constant vorticity, depth and wavelenght, extending previous results valid for restricted values of the parameters. We parametrize the bifurcating Stokes waves either with their speed or their momentum.</description>

Abstract: We study $\mathbf L^\infty$ entropy solutions to $2\times 2$ systems of conservation laws. We show that, if a uniformly convex entropy exists, these solutions satisfy a pair of kinetic equations (nonlocal in velocity), which are then shown to characterize all solutions with finite entropy production.
  Next, we prove a Liouville-type theorem for genuinely nonlinear systems, which is the main result of the paper. This implies in particular that for every finite entropy solution, every point $(t,x) \in \mathbb R^+\times \mathbb R\setminus \br J$ is of vanishing mean oscillation, where $\br J \subset \mathbb R^+\times \mathbb R$ is a set of Hausdorff dimension at most 1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Dirichlet problem for functions whose graphs are spacelike hypersurfaces with prescribed curvature in the Minkowski space and we obtain some new interior second order estimates for admissible solutions to the corresponding fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Quantitative lower bound for solutions to the Boltzmann equation in non-convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we deal with the continuous mild solutions of the Boltzmann equation in a bounded space domain, either with angular cutoff or non cutoff assumption. Without assuming that the space domain is convex, we construct a Maxwellian lower bound in the cutoff case, and a weaker-than-Maxwellian lower bound in the non-cutoff case, thus extending results of \cite{Bri 1,Bri 2} in which the domain was assumed to be convex.</description>

      <title>Ground-state blowing-up solutions for a Hardy-Sobolev equations on a manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of blowing-up families of solutions to an equation of Hardy-Sobolev type in high dimensions. These families are of minimal type. The sole condition is that the potential of the linear operator touches a critical potential at the singular point. This condition is sharp as shown by the first author in [Cheikh-Ali, Pacific J. of Math. 2022].</description>

      <title>An Atomic Representation for Bicomplex Hardy Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop representations for bicomplex-valued functions in Hardy classes that generalize the complex holomorphic Hardy spaces. Using these representations, we show these functions have boundary values in the sense of distributions that are representable by an atomic decomposition, and we show continuity of the Hilbert transform on this class of distributional boundary values.</description>

      <title>The Graph Geometric Control Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel concept called the Graph Geometric Control Condition (GGCC). It turns out to be a simple, geometric rewriting of many of the frameworks in which the controllability of PDEs on graphs has been studied. We prove that (GGCC) is a necessary and sufficient condition for the exact controllability of the wave equation on metric graphs with internal controls and Dirichlet boundary conditions. We then investigate the internal exact controllability of the wave equation with mixed boundary conditions and the one of the Schr\"odinger equation, as well as the internal null-controllability of the heat equation. We show that (GGCC) provides a sufficient condition for the controllability of these equations and we provide explicit examples proving that (GGCC) is not necessary in these cases.</description>
