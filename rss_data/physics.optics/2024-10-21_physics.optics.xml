      <title>Poynting vector for Cauchy-Riemann beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed derivation of the Poynting vector for Cauchy-Riemann beams propagating in free space considering a Gaussian modulation with $g \in \mathbb{C}$. The effect generated by this Gaussian modulation is a compression-expansion of the intensity distribution. It is shown that the parameter $g$ can reverse the direction of energy flux and eliminate the radial component, resulting in a purely azimuthal field. Additionally, we validate our analytical results through experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the image projection of spatially incoherent light from a multimode fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spatially incoherent light generated by a multimode fiber(MMF) in the application of image projection designed for the ultracold-atom experiments. Inspired by previous half-analytic methods concerning the incoherent light, here a full-numerical model is established to provide more quantitative descriptions, and part of results is compared with experiments. Particularly, our model about the MMF is also compatible with light propagation in free space. Based on this, we study both the intrinsic speckle and the perturbation robustness of a MMF light field, under the influence of light propagation and fiber parameters. We point out several guidelines about choosing the suitable MMF in creating a spatially incoherent light source, which is useful in the context of the ultracold-atom experiments associating with the optical potential projection.</description>

      <title>Impact of the electrode material on the performance of light-emitting electrochemical cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are promising candidates for fully solution-processed lighting applications because they can comprise a single active-material layer and air-stable electrodes. While their performance is often claimed to be independent of the electrode material selection due to the in-situ formation of electric double layers (EDLs), we demonstrate conceptually and experimentally that this understanding needs to be modified. Specifically, the exciton generation zone is observed to be affected by the electrode work function. We rationalize this finding by proposing that the ion concentration in the injection-facilitating EDLs depends on the offset between the electrode work function and the respective semiconductor orbital, which in turn influences the number of ions available for electrochemical doping and hence shifts the exciton generation zone. Further, we investigate the effects of the electrode selection on exciton losses to surface plasmon polaritons and discuss the impact of cavity effects on the exciton density. We conclude by showing that the measured electrode-dependent LEC luminance transients can be replicated by an optical model that considers these electrode-dependent effects to calculate the attained light outcoupling of the LEC stack. As such, our findings provide rational design criteria considering the electrode materials, the active-material thickness, and its composition in concert to achieve optimum LEC performance.</description>

      <title>Discrimination of vortex and pseudovortex beams with a triangular optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A triangular optical cavity can be used to distinguish between two beams with the same intensity profile but different wavefronts. This is what we show in this paper, both theoretically and experimentally, in the case of beams with a doughnut-like intensity profile: one of them having a helical wavefront (vortex beam with orbital angular momentum) and the other with no orbital angular momentum at all (which we call pseudovortex beam). We write the mode decomposition of such beams in the Hermite-Gaussian basis and in the the Laguerre-Gauss basis, respectively, and study how they interact with a triangular cavity in terms of their resonance peaks. The experimental results corroborate the theory, showing that each beam displays its own resonance pattern. Therefore, such cavity may be used to identify beams with orbital angular momentum, distinguishing them from pseudovortices.</description>

      <title>Ultra-miniaturized Bloch mode metasplitters for one-dimensional grating waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present, for the first time, power splitters with multiple channel configurations in one-dimensional grating waveguides (1DGWs) that maintain crystal lattice-sensitive Bloch mode profiles without perturbation across all output channels, all within an ultra-miniaturized footprint of just 2.1 x 2.2 {\mu}m^2. This novel capability reduces the need for transition regions, simplifies multi-channel configurations of 1DGWs, and maximizes the effective use of chip area. The pixelated metamaterial approach, integrated with a time-domain heuristic algorithm, is utilized to concurrently achieve broadband operation, optimized dispersion control, and minimal loss. We experimentally demonstrate that our 1x2 and 1x3 metasplitters achieve average minimum losses per channel of 3.80 dB and 5.36 dB, respectively, just 0.80 dB and 0.59 dB above ideal splitting. The measurements for both designs demonstrate a 1 dB bandwidth of 15 nm, with excellent uniformity across all output channels. These versatile metasplitter designs can serve as fundamental building blocks for ultrahigh-bandwidth, densely integrated photonic circuits and in scenarios where slow light is essential.</description>

      <title>Polygon-based unified Fourier-modal approach for diffractive optics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we derive a theoretical formalism that unifies the rigorous coupled wave analysis and the dynamical diffraction theory. Based on this formalism, we design a computational approach for the diffraction calculation for the nanoscale lamellar gratings with an arbitrary line profile shape. In this approach, the gratings line profile is approximated as a polygon. This proves to be convenient since such an approach does not rely on the geometry model of the grating. We test the new approach against other computational theories and a synchrotron scattering experiment.</description>

      <title>Attosecond vortices in semiconductor materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical results on the generation of short-wavelength attosecond vortex beams in semiconductors through their interactions with an intense Laguerre-Gauss beam, in the limit where non-perturbative high-order harmonics are generated. We exploit the details of the novel microscopic mechanism for high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in condensed matter, such as the use of dephasing time included in semiconductor Bloch equations (SBE), the combination of the SBE model with the thin slab model, and the use of experimentally verified scaling laws for various harmonic orders. For our test, we use a zinc oxide crystal as our standard sample, and our vortex beam is characterized by a topological charge of $l=1$. Our time-domain analysis shows that harmonics within the plateau region specifically contribute to the generation of the attosecond vortex beam. Our findings have implications for advancing the understanding of solid-state HHG and leveraging its strengths, such as the use of thin and dense media, for the efficient generation of short-wavelength attosecond vortex beams.</description>

      <title>Beam dynamics induced by the quantum metric of exceptional rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological physics has broadened its scope from the study of topological insulating phases to include nodal phases containing band structure singularities. The geometry of the corresponding quantum states is described by the quantum metric which provides a theoretical framework for explaining phenomena that conventional approaches fail to address. The field has become even broader by encompassing non-Hermitian singularities: in addition to Dirac, Weyl nodes, or nodal lines, it is now common to encounter exceptional points, exceptional or Weyl rings, and even Weyl spheres. They give access to fascinating effects that cannot be reached within the Hermitian picture. However, the quantum geometry of non-Hermitian singularities is not a straightforward extension of the Hermitian one, remaining far less understood. Here, we study experimentally and theoretically the dynamics of wave packets at exceptional rings stemming from Dirac points in a photonic honeycomb lattice. First, we demonstrate a transition between conical diffraction and non-Hermitian broadening in real space. Next, we predict and demonstrate a new non-Hermitian effect in the reciprocal space, induced by the non-orthogonality of the eigenstates. We call it transverse non-Hermitian drift, and its description requires biorthogonal quantum metric. The non-Hermitian drift can be used for applications in beam steering.</description>

      <title>Conservation law for angular momentum based on optical field derivatives: Analysis of optical spin-orbit conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel theoretical framework that offers new insights into understanding the loss of optical angular momentum (AM), spin AM (SAM), and orbital AM (OAM) in light-matter interactions, encompassing both the transfer from light to matter and spin-orbit conversion (SOC). Traditionally, the separation of optical SAM and OAM from total AM relied on vector potentials, leading to gauge-dependent ambiguities and limiting analysis to vacuum conditions, without accounting for material systems. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a field-derivative approach that constructs optical AM from the time derivatives of electric and magnetic fields, allowing for gauge-independent evaluations of SAM and OAM, even in material systems. We apply this framework to analyze spin-orbit conversion (SOC) in two scenarios: the scattering of circularly polarized (CP) Gaussian beams by a single gold nanoparticle, and the focusing of CP beams and linearly polarized (LP) optical vortex (OV) beams by an aplanatic lens. Our results reveal that SOC is highly dependent on particle size in scattering, with larger particles exhibiting significant OAM loss, while SOC occurs during CP beam focusing, but not with LP OV beams. This framework enables the evaluation of previously overlooked optical SAM and OAM losses, providing a powerful tool for studying systems in which the analysis of AM losses is intrinsically important, such as chiral materials, as well as for designing photonic devices and exploring light-matter interactions at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast pulse propagation time-domain dynamics in dispersive one-dimensional photonic waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast pulses, particularly those with durations under 100 femtoseconds, are crucial in achieving unprecedented precision and control in light-matter interactions. However, conventional on-chip photonic platforms are not inherently designed for ultrafast time-domain operations, posing a significant challenge in achieving essential parameters such as high peak power and high temporal resolution. This challenge is particularly pronounced when propagating through dispersive integrated waveguides, unlike classical applications where dispersion is typically near-zero or linear. In addressing this challenge, we present a design methodology for ultrafast pulse propagation in dispersive integrated waveguides, specifically focused on enhancing the time-domain characteristics of one-dimensional grating waveguides (1DGWs). The proposed methodology aims to determine the optimal structural parameters for achieving maximum peak power, enhanced temporal resolution, and extended pulse storage duration during ultrafast pulse propagation. To validate this approach, we design and fabricate two specialized 1DGWs on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. A digital finite impulse response (FIR) model, trained with both transmission and phase measurement data, is employed to obtain ultrafast time-domain characteristics, enabling easy extraction of these results. Our approach achieves a 2.78-fold increase in peak power and reduces pulse broadening by 24%, resulting in a smaller sacrifice in temporal resolution. These results can possibly pave the way for advanced light-matter interactions within dispersive integrated waveguides.</description>

      <title>Greedy receiver for photon-efficient optical communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In optical communication the transmitter encodes information into a set of light states defined by the modulation format, selected to accommodate specific channel conditions and to remain sufficiently distinguishable at the output. Various receiver architectures have been designed to improve the demodulation performance, ultimately limited by quantum theory. In this work I introduce a new receiver based on a locally optimal greedy algorithm and apply it to pulse position modulation. The receiver reduces the error probabilities of previously proposed strategies in all signal strength regimes and achieves results comparable with those obtained by numerical optimization of the detection process. In contrast, however, it is conceptually simple and therefore can be scaled to arbitrarily high modulation orders for which numerical methods become intractable. In the photon-starved regime characteristic of deep space optical communication, the greedy receiver approaches the quantum-optimal Helstrom bound on state discrimination error probability. In the regime of few-photon pulses, the error reduction offered over the other methods grows up to an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Beam Pointing of Relativistic High-order Harmonics Genrated on a Nonuniform Pre-plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of tunable pre-pulse is a common technique to enhance the high-order harmonic generation from surface plasma. The shape and dynamic of the electron density, the degree of ionization and its rate, and the plasma heating are influenced by the pre-pulse properties. Non-uniform pre-pulse could cause a spatially varying density map to the pre-plasma region, which serves as the spectrally up-conversion and reflection surface. The corresponding geometrical feature and plasma nature under laser field will affect the harmonic emission properties. In this study, the variation in harmonic beam pointing due to the electron density shape was investigated. Particle-in-cell simulations demonstrated that both plasma hydrodynamics and geometrical optical effect induce the deviation of harmonic beam from specular reflection. This research contributes to the understanding of the surface plasma dynamics during high harmonic generation process.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity adjustable in-line high-temperature sensor based on metal microwire optical Fabry-Perot interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optical fiber Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) has been widely investigated as a potential temperature sensor. To function as a temperature sensor, the cavity of the FPI is typically constructed from either silica fibers or polymers. The silica cavity FPIs can function at temperatures exceeding 1000{\deg}C. However, its temperature sensitivity is constrained by its relatively low thermal optical coefficient and thermal expansion of silica materials. Although the polymer cavity FPI exhibits a high temperature sensitivity, its cavity is susceptible to deterioration in high-temperature environments. Here, to overcome this challenge and achieve high-sensitivity temperature sensing in a high-temperature environment, we propose a new type of temperature FPI sensor by inserting and sealing a section of Cr20Ni80 metal microwire inside a section of silica hollow core fiber (HCF) spliced to standard single-mode fiber (SMF). The FPIs exhibit a high degree of temperature sensitivity due to the high thermal expansion of the Cr20Ni80 metal microwire. Since the Cr20Ni80 metal has a high melting temperature of 1400{\deg}C, such FPIs can function in high-temperature environments. Moreover, the temperature sensitivity of this FPI can be modified without affecting its reflection spectrum by changing the length of the metallic microwire situated within the hollow core fiber. The experimental results indicate that the proposed FPIs exhibit a temperature sensitivity greater than -0.35nm/{\deg}C within the temperature range of 50{\deg}C to 440{\deg}C. Our proposed metal microwire-based FPIs are economical, robust, simple to fabricate, and capable of functioning in high-temperature environments, rendering them appealing options for practical applications</description>
