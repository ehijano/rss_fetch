      <title>Topological hybridisation of plasmons with ferrimagnetic magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of hybrid plasmon-magnon modes in a heterostructure comprising a monolayer semiconductor with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling -- specifically, Janus transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) -- and an insulating ferrimagnet, such as yttrium iron garnet-based compounds. Using a combined microscopic-macroscopic framework for plasmon-magnon coupling, we show that plasmons and magnons strongly hybridize over both GHz and THz frequency ranges, enabling experimental access well above cryogenic temperatures. Moreover, the developed approach provides an efficient and natural classification of the topology of the hybrid modes, rooted in the phase winding of the plasmon-magnon coupling induced by spin-momentum locking and the associated chiral winding of the electronic spin along the Fermi contours. Finally, we identify experimentally accessible manifestations of the hybridization, such as topological interface modes and an anomalous thermal Hall response.</description>

      <title>Transport spin polarization in RuO$_2$ films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets host spin-split electronic bands without net magnetization, enabling spin-polarized transport in the absence of conventional ferromagnetism. RuO$_2$ has been proposed as a candidate altermagnet, yet experimental reports remain conflicting, particularly between bulk-sensitive probes and thin-film measurements. Here we investigate the electronic transport properties of epitaxial RuO$_2$ thin films using anomalous Hall effect measurements and point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy. We observe transport spin polarization and a strongly orientation-dependent anomalous Hall response, while magnetometry reveals no detectable net magnetization. The anomalous Hall effect appears only in ultrathin (110)-oriented films, consistent with symmetry-driven N\'eel-vector physics, and the measured transport spin polarization is systematically higher for (110)-oriented films than for (001)-oriented films, consistent with the crystallographic anisotropy of the spin-split bands. These results are consistent with altermagnetic behavior in RuO$_2$, with the experimentally accessible signatures confined to near-surface regions. They also establish superconducting transport spectroscopy as a metrology for identifying and characterizing altermagnet candidates.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Tests of Quantum Geometric Bounds in Ionic and Covalent Insulators using Inelastic X-Ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry underlies many fundamental properties of materials, but it has remained largely inaccessible to direct experiment. Here we demonstrate that inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) provides a direct, quantitative probe of quantum geometry and quantum information in solids. Studying two prototype insulators, covalently bonded diamond and ionically bonded LiF, we measure the density response and experimentally determine the quantum Fisher information, the associated Bures metric, and the electron localization length. These measurements enable a quantitative comparison of quantum geometry for two distinct bonding environments. We find that the dimensionless quantum weight, $aK(q)$, which quantifies the longitudinal localization of quantum information, is constrained by fundamental electrostatic bounds in both materials. Crucially, the quantum weight of diamond exceeds that of LiF, indicating that covalent bonds exhibit a higher degree of delocalization and higher density of quantum information than the ionic bonds. Our results establish a direct experimental relationship between quantum information, electron localization, and chemical bonding, and identify IXS as a powerful tool for measuring quantum geometry in materials.</description>

      <title>$PT$ Symmetry's Real Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological phases have been a central theme in condensed matter physics and beyond over the past two decades. Most efforts have focused on topological classifications of physical systems under given symmetries, while the intrinsic topology of the symmetries themselves has received much less attention. Here, we show that, in generic non-interacting spinless crystals, the spacetime inversion symmetry $PT$ naturally carries a real vector-bundle structure whose topology is characterized by Stiefel--Whitney (SW) classes. In contrast to previous work, where SW classes were used to describe the topology of real valence bundles protected by $PT$, we identify SW classes associated to the $PT$ symmetry itself. These symmetry SW classes can endow the \emph{total} real bundle of a $PT$-symmetric band structure with nontrivial topology, overturning the common assumption that the total bundle is always trivial. As a consequence, valence and conduction bands can exhibit asymmetric SW classes, in sharp contrast to the usual symmetric scenario. We further demonstrate that the symmetry SW classes provide a refined distinction between atomic insulator phases. Our results underscore the importance of treating crystal symmetries as topological objects in their own right, rather than focusing solely on the topology of energy bands.</description>

      <title>Ultrastrong light-matter coupling in near-field coupled split-ring resonators revealed by photocurrent spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landau polaritons arising from the coupling between cyclotron resonance and terahertz split-ring resonators (SRRs) have served as a central platform for exploring ultrastrong light-matter interaction for more than a decade. Over this period, a wide variety of SRR architectures, differing in size, geometry, and even material composition, have been investigated. However, the regime of near-field coupled SRRs has remained largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate ultrastrong coupling using photocurrent spectroscopy in two prototypical near-field configurations: a SRR dimer and a topological SRR chain. The measurements reveal hybridization not only with bright resonant modes but also with optically dark modes and topological edge modes, highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of the photocurrent spectroscopy. Moreover, the engineered near-field interactions allow the study of multi-mode ultrastrong coupling and the interplay between topological band structure and cavity quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Molecular Hamiltonian learning from setpoint-dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular quantum magnets adsorbed on surfaces exhibit rich spin and orbital excitations that can be probed by scanning tunneling microscopy with inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (STM-IETS). However, the quantitative extraction of the underlying multiorbital Hamiltonian from experimental spectra remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we introduce molecular Hamiltonian learning, a machine learning strategy that infers the microscopic Hamiltonian parameters of a single adsorbed molecule directly from the setpoint-dependence of STM-IETS data. The method leverages the systematic evolution of spectral features as the STM tip tunes the local electrostatic environment for different tip-sample distances. We demonstrate this approach on iron phthalocyanine on ferroelectric SnTe, training our algorithm on theory spectra from a realistic multiorbital model, including spin-orbit coupling, electrostatic interactions, local crystal field, and substrate effects. The algorithm, trained solely on theoretical many-body simulations, allows reconstructing Hamiltonian parameters directly from experimental spectra. Our manuscript establishes a flexible and automated strategy for Hamiltonian reconstruction from STM-IETS, transforming setpoint-dependent spectroscopy into quantitative characterization of quantum materials at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Deterministic non-local parity control and supercurrent-based detection in an Andreev molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to manipulate and detect the parity of quantum states in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems is pivotal to realizing the promise of topological quantum computation. However, as these architectures scale toward artificial Kitaev chains with phase-control loops, local accessibility becomes restricted, constraining conventional local parity control and detection. While Andreev molecules offer a platform for non-local intervention, deterministic protocols for parity manipulation have yet to be experimentally established. Here, we demonstrate deterministic non-local control over the parity configuration of a quantum dot (QD) by electrically modulating the coherent hybridization with a spatially adjacent QD within an Andreev molecule. By systematically investigating three distinct joint parity configuration regimes in the elastic co-tunneling limit, we experimentally uncover the operational conditions for this non-local control. In conjunction with theoretical simulations establishing a global phase diagram, we identify a set of universal selection rules governing parity transitions, dictated by the symmetry-imposed interplay between the joint parity configuration and the dominant inter-dot coupling mechanism (elastic co-tunneling vs. crossed Andreev reflection). Furthermore, we establish the supercurrent, directly signaled by zero-bias conductance peaks, as an intrinsic, sensor-free probe of the parity configuration, obviating the need for auxiliary charge sensors. Our results provide a validated physical framework for parity engineering, offering a key building block for scalable, multi-QD superconducting architectures.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear waves: a review Vector $0\pi$ pulse and the generalized perturbative reduction method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, a more general theory of self-induced transparency (SIT) in comparison with the theory of McCall and Hahn is considered. Using the recently developed generalized perturbative reduction method (GPRM) the SIT equations are reduced to vector (coupled) nonlinear Schrodinger equations for auxiliary functions. This approach demonstrates that, unlike McCall and Hahn SIT theory in which single-component scalar breather can propagate independently, in the more general theory of SIT the second derivatives with respect to the spatial coordinate and time of the wave equation play a significant role and describe the interaction of two scalar SIT breathers forming a coupled pair. This is a vector 0\pi pulse of SIT - a two-component vector breather oscillating with the sum and difference of frequencies and wave numbers. The profile, parameters and properties of this pulse differ significantly from the characteristics of the McCall and Hahn pulses.
  Using GPRM it is shown that besides the scalar soliton and the scalar breather, the vector $0\pi$ pulse is also a universal nonlinear wave, arising in virtually all areas of physics where nonlinear phenomena are described by nonlinear equations containing second-order and higher-order derivatives. A number of such nonlinear equations are presented. Among them almost all well known nonlinear equations, as well as the general fourth-order nonlinear partial differential equation and the sixth-order generalized Boussinesq-type equations.</description>

      <title>Dual-Switch Control of a Layer-Locked Anomalous Valley Hall Effect in a Sliding Ferroelectric Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of ferroelectric (FE) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders in twodimensional (2D) materials provides a promising avenue for the nonvolatile control of coupled spin and valley degrees of freedom, a capability central to advancing spinvalleytronics. However, realizing a single material system where these quantum states can be independently and reversibly manipulated by distinct stimuli, a prerequisite for multifunctional devices, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate a dual-switch mechanism in bilayer VS2, a room-temperature FE-AFM system, that enables electrical and magnetic control of a layer-locked anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE). First-principles calculations reveal that interlayer sliding breaks spatial inversion symmetry, inducing a switchable out-of-plane FE polarization that coexists with interlayer AFM. The spin-orbit coupled valley polarization can be reversibly switched either by FE polarization reversal or by a magnetic-field-induced spin-flip transition, confirming the existence of electrically and magnetically addressable valley states. The Berry curvature exhibits both valley-contrasting and layer-locked characteristics, which underpin a switchable Hall response. Notably, electric and magnetic switching are functionally equivalent in modulating valley, layer, and spin indices, revealing strong magnetoelectric coupling. This work establishes a multidegree-of-freedom operational paradigm in 2D multiferroics and opens a viable design pathway toward multi-state memory and spin-valleytronic logic devices.</description>

      <title>Observation of an exciton crystal in a moir\'e excitonic insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong Coulomb interactions can drive electrons to crystallize into a Wigner lattice. Achieving the bosonic analogue - a crystal of excitons - has remained elusive due to their short lifetimes and weaker interactions. Here, we report the observation of a thermodynamically stable exciton crystal in an excitonic insulator coupled to a moir\'e potential. Using an electron-hole bilayer composed of a monolayer MoSe2 and a WS2/WSe2 moir\'e superlattice, we construct a tunable extended Bose-Hubbard model with electrical control over exciton and charge doping in thermal equilibrium. Optical spectroscopy reveals spontaneous crystallization of long-lived excitons at one exciton filling per three moir\'e sites, evidenced by strong Umklapp scattering peaks in the optical spectrum. Exciton transport measurements further show a pronounced exciton resistance peak at the same filling, consistent with suppressed exciton hopping in a crystalline phase. When doped away from net charge neutrality, this moir\'e electron-hole bilayer can host new correlated insulating phases where dipolar excitonic insulators form on top of the background of a hole Mott insulator or generalized Wigner crystals in the moir\'e superlattice. These findings establish moir\'e excitonic insulators as a versatile platform for realizing correlated crystalline phases of bosons and fermions.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of an atomic spin diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a microscopic theory of an atomic spin diode. Our proposed system consists of two magnetic adatoms deposited on the surface of a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. A local s-d type coupling between the local spins and the spins of the electrons induces a non-local Ruderman-Kittel-Kazuya-Yoshida type interaction and a Dzyalonshinskii-Moriya interaction, in addition to dissipative interactions, between the spins. We derive the effective action for the spins using the Keldysh formalism. From the effective action, we also derive equations of motion for the spins which are shown to be of Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) type, and give expressions for the effective field and Gilbert damping which appear in this equation. From our microscopic theory, we find that for an in-plane magnetic field perpendicular to the vector connecting the two atoms, the magnitude of the field and the distance between the atoms can always be tuned to engender perfectly diodic coupling. Our findings may pave the way to experimental realisation of atomic spin diodes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, nonlinear transport phenomena have garnered significant interest in both theoretical explorations and experiments. In this work, we utilize the semi-classical wave packet theory to calculate disorder-induced second-order transport coefficients: second-order electrical ($\sigma$), thermoelectric ($\alpha$), and thermal ($\kappa$) coefficients, capturing the interplay between side-jump and skew-scattering contributions in systems with time-reversal symmetry. Using a topological insulator model, we quantitatively characterize the Fermi-level dependence of these second-order transport coefficients by explicitly including Coulomb impurity potentials. Furthermore, we elucidate the relationships between these coefficients, establishing the second-order Mott relation and the Wiedemann-Franz law induced by disorder. This study develops a comprehensive theoretical framework elucidating the nonlinear thermoelectric transport mechanisms in quantum material systems.</description>

      <title>Interband State Transfer in Double-Gated Bilayer Graphene at High Electric Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The band structure of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene can be tuned using double-gated transistors to apply a perpendicular electric field that generates an interlayer potential energy difference $\Delta$. Dielectric breakdown limits the operation of conventional devices to the $\Delta \ll t_\perp \simeq 360$ meV regime. We employ double ionic gating to reach fields past $ 1$ V/nm, for which $\Delta &gt; t_\perp$. We find that for $\Delta \simeq t_\perp$, the evolution of the longitudinal resistance ($R_{xx}$) peak as a function of applied gate voltages undergoes a sharp change in slope, exhibiting a pronounced "knee". Increasing $\Delta$ past the "knee" results in an unusual evolution transport properties: the peak in $R_{xx}$ decreases in magnitude, it exhibits a splitting concomitant with multiple sign reversals of the Hall resistance, and hysteresis in the peak position emerges. We explain the observed phenomenology in terms of in-gap bound states, whose energy strongly depends on the perpendicular electric field, and crosses the mid-gap level for sufficiently large $\Delta &gt; t_\perp$. The phenomenon causes large changes in the electronic density of in-gap states that profoundly affect the evolution of the chemical potential. Our experimental results and their interpretation reveal unique aspects of the physics of in-gap states in Bernal bilayer graphene and demonstrate that double ionic gating enables investigating the large-$\Delta$ regime, which has remained experimentally inaccessible so far.</description>

      <title>MAD-SURF: a machine learning interatomic potential for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting how organic molecules adsorb, assemble, and interact on metal surfaces is central to surface chemistry and molecular electronics, particularly in the context of interpreting high-resolution scanning probe microscopy. Yet, the application of first-principles simulations to interfaces is hampered by the computational cost for evaluating the electronic structure for the large number of atoms typically involved. We hereby present MAD-SURF, a machine learning interatomic potential specifically tailored for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces. Trained on a broad dataset spanning diverse molecules, adsorption motifs, surfaces, molecular dynamics trajectories and non-covalent aggregates, MAD-SURF achieves accuracy comparable to the underlying DFT reference while enabling simulations orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory. The model reliably reproduces energies, forces and adsorption geometries across the three coinage metal substrates. We demonstrate its capabilities on experimentally characterized systems, including organic monolayers, polycyclic aggregates, flexible biomolecules and the long-range herringbone reconstruction of gold. By merging accuracy, speed, and generalizability, MAD-SURF offers a practical framework for accelerating atomistic simulations and advancing data-driven workflows in surface science.</description>

      <title>Jordan-Wigner mapping between quantum-spin and fermionic Casimir effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jordan-Wigner transformation connects spin operators in one-dimensional spin systems and fermionic operators. In this work, we elucidate the relationship between the finite-size corrections in the spin representation and the fermionic Casimir effect in the corresponding fermion representation. In particular, we focus on the ground-state energy of one-dimensional transverse-field Ising and XY models, and show that all finite-size corrections can be interpreted as lattice fermionic Casimir effects. We further find several types of Casimir phenomena, such as the conventional Casimir energy from massless fields, damping behavior from massive fields, vanishing behavior from flat or nonrelativistic bands, and oscillating behavior from the finite-density effect. Our findings establish a dictionary between finite-size corrections in spin chains and fermionic Casimir effects, and provide experimentally relevant platforms for the fermionic Casimir phenomena.</description>

      <title>C2NP: A Benchmark for Learning Scale-Dependent Geometric Invariances in 3D Materials Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models for materials have achieved strong performance on periodic bulk crystals, yet their ability to generalize across scale transitions to finite nanostructures remains largely untested. We introduce Crystal-to-Nanoparticle (C2NP), a systematic benchmark for evaluating generative models when moving between infinite crystalline unit cells and finite nanoparticles, where surface effects and size-dependent distortions dominate. C2NP defines two complementary tasks: (i) generating nanoparticles of specified radii from periodic unit cells, testing whether models capture surface truncation and geometric constraints; and (ii) recovering bulk lattice parameters and space-group symmetry from finite particle configurations, assessing whether models can infer underlying crystallographic order despite surface perturbations. Using diverse materials as a structurally consistent testbed, we construct over 170,000 nanoparticle configurations by carving particles from supercells derived from DFT-relaxed crystal unit cells, and introduce size-based splits that separate interpolation from extrapolation regimes. Experiments with state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion, flow-matching, and variational models, show that even when losses are low, models often fail geometrically under distribution shift, yielding large lattice-recovery errors and near-zero joint accuracy on structure and symmetry. Overall, our results suggest that current methods rely on template memorization rather than scalable physical generalization. C2NP offers a controlled, reproducible framework for diagnosing these failures, with immediate applications to nanoparticle catalyst design, nanostructured hydrides for hydrogen storage, and materials discovery. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/C2NP.</description>

      <title>Engineering Quantum Emission with Mie Voids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous emission, as a fundamental radiative process and a versatile information carrier, plays a vital role in light-emitting devices, optical information modulation and encryption, super-resolution fluorescence imaging and nano sensing. Engineering the photonic environment surrounding quantum emitters can enhance their emission characteristics. However, simultaneously achieving precise control over both excitation enhancement and quantum-yield modulation at the nanoscale remains elusive, highlighting substantial room for advancing the precised engineering of quantum emission. Here, we introduce silicon Mie voids - air-defined cavities that invert the conventional solid-particle geometry - to achieve independent tuning of quantum emission within an individual subwavelength structure, while minimizing optical losses. Full-wave simulations and experiments on both gradient and uniform Mie-void arrays jointly validate this quantitative framework for emission tuning, which disentangles excitation enhancement arising from local field confinement in air and quantum-yield enhancement resulting from strengthened emitter-resonator coupling, while confirming the accelerated radiative decay enabled by the void configuration. Leveraging this flexible mechanism, we realize a bimodal nanophotonic pattern with near-diffraction-limited pixels that encode the EPFL logo in the bright field and the SJTU logo in both dark field and photoluminescence micrographs. These results establish Mie voids as a powerful platform for programmable, high-density multimodal displays and open new avenues for advancing state-of-the-art nanophotonic devices.</description>

      <title>Graphene Nanoribbon-Graphdiyne Lateral Heterojunctions with Atomically Abrupt Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon-based 2D heterostructures represent an attractive platform for nanoelectronics owing to their tunable electronic and transport properties, yet achieving precise control over their fabrication remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate the on--surface synthesis of covalently bonded lateral heterostructures between armchair graphene nanoribbons and metalated hydrogenated graphdiyne networks on Au(111). Atomic--resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy combined with density functional theory reveals the formation mechanism of covalent interfacial bonds and highlights the critical influence of surface chemistry. In particular, chemisorbed bromine atoms suppress junction formation, while controlled atomic hydrogen dosing increases the bonding efficiency to 71\%. Electronic structure and transport calculations demonstrate how the metallic substrate influences the supported heterostructure, whereas in the freestanding limit, the two carbon subsystems retain their intrinsic properties, forming an atomically narrow junction that enables voltage-tunable spatial current separation. These results define a viable strategy for engineering graphene--graphdiyne heterostructures and advance the design of all-carbon nanoscale electronic architectures.</description>

      <title>Near-field effects on cathodoluminescence outcoupling in perovskite thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Halide perovskite semiconductors are a promising material for high-efficiency solar cells. Their optical properties can vary within and between crystallographic grains. We present spatially-resolved cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy at 2 keV and 5 keV on polycrystalline CsPbBr3 perovskite films to study these variations at the nanoscale. The CL maps show a strongly reduced intensity near the polycrystalline grain boundaries. We perform numerical simulations of the far-field emission of the electron beam-generated optical near fields using the surface profiles from AFM as input. We find that near grain boundaries the light outcoupling is strongly reduced due to enhanced internal reflection and light trapping at the curved surfaces. Lateral variations in CL intensity inside grains are due to Fabry-Perot-like resonances in the film, with the substrate acting as a back reflector. Our results show that near-field coupling and interference effects can dominate nanoscale luminescence maps of halide perovskite films. The results are broadly relevant for the analysis of cathodoluminescence and photoluminescence of corrugated thin films.</description>

      <title>All-electrical switching of spin texture in a strain-tunable 2D Janus ferroelectric altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM), a collinear magnetic phase with momentum-dependent spin splitting, is a promising candidate for strong magnetoelectric coupling. However, realizing direct and tunable coupling between ferroelectricity (FE) and AM within a single two-dimensional (2D) material remains an outstanding challenge. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we identify the distorted phase of monolayer Janus VOClBr as an intrinsic 2D FE-AM. This phase demonstrates robust magnetoelectric coupling, as evidenced by a complete reversal of momentum-space spin polarization upon FE switching, and further supported by spin texture analysis and the magneto-optical Kerr effect. Notably, the FE properties are highly strain-tunable: biaxial compression strain of -4% reduces the FE polarization switching barrier by approximately 87%, whereas a tensile strain of +3% induces a phase transition to an antiferromagnet. Leveraging the lock-in between the electrically controlled spin texture and the magneto-optical Kerr effect signal, we propose a non-volatile, polymorphic spintronic memory device featuring all-electrical writing and optical readout. This work establishes 2D FE-AMs as a versatile platform for coupled ferroic orders and paves the way for voltage-controlled, multifunctional spin-logic devices.</description>

      <title>Observation of Erratic Non-Hermitian Skin Localization and Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localization is a pervasive phenomenon across physics, shaping transport from electrons in solids to light and sound in engineered media. In traditional settings, disorder strongly impedes transport, resulting in dynamical localization or, at best, sub-ballistic or diffusive dynamics. A distinct and previously unobserved regime, erratic non-Hermitian skin localization (ENHSL), can arise in globally reciprocal non-Hermitian lattices with disorder. It features macroscopic, disorder-dependent localization at irregular bulk positions with subexponential decay, linked to stochastic interfaces governed by the universal order statistics of random walks. We realize this regime experimentally in an acoustic lattice implementing a disordered Hatano-Nelson chain with imaginary gauge fields. Using Green's-function-based spectroscopy together with time-resolved measurements on the same platform, we reconstruct the full complex spectrum and eigenstates, and directly observe wave-packet dynamics. Remarkably, we observe ballistic transport despite strong spectral localization. We develop a transport theory that connects the dominant propagation site to the maximal random-walk excursion within an expanding light cone and predicts a universal Levy-arcsine statistics, in quantitative agreement with experiment. Our results decouple eigenstate localization from transport and establish ENHSL as a new paradigm for wave dynamics.</description>

      <title>Resolving Gauge Ambiguities of the Berry Connection in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems display spectral and topological phenomena absent in Hermitian physics; yet, their geometric characterization can be hindered by an intrinsic ambiguity rooted in the eigenspace of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which becomes especially pronounced in the pure quantum regime. Because left and right eigenvectors are not related by conjugation, their norms are not fixed, giving rise to a biorthogonal ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ gauge freedom. Consequently, the standard Berry connection admits four inequivalent definitions depending on how left and right eigenvectors are paired, giving rise to distinct Berry phases and generally complex-valued holonomies. Here we show that these ambiguities and the emergence of complex phases are fully resolved by introducing a covariant-derivative formalism built from the metric tensor of the Hilbert space of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The resulting unique Berry connection remains real-valued under an arbitrary ${\rm GL}(N,{\mathbb C})$ frame change, and transforms as an affine gauge potential, while reducing to the conventional Berry (or Wilczek-Zee) connection in the Hermitian limit. This establishes an unambiguous and gauge-consistent geometric framework for Berry phases, non-Abelian holonomies, and topological invariants in quantum systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal di-iodides such as FeI2, NiI2 and CoI2 are an emerging class of 2D magnets exhibiting rich and diverse magnetic behaviour, but their study at the monolayer limit has been severely hindered by fabrication challenges due to their air-sensitivity. Here, we introduce a polymer-free method for clean, rapid, and high-yield assembly of hermetically encapsulated suspended samples of air-sensitive monolayers. Applying it to di-iodides enables atomic resolution characterisation of thin samples - down to the monolayer limit - for the first time. Our imaging, combined with complementary first-principles calculations, reveals an unusually small energy barrier between alternate stable stacking polytypes in few-layer films, enabling extrinsic control of the stacking phase. We also observe stable isolated iodine vacancies that do not aggregate to form extended structures, and identify and verify the stability of the various edge configurations of thin samples. These results establish the unique structural characteristics of these materials in the thin limit, and more broadly demonstrate the utility of our transfer platform for creating atomically clean suspended vdW heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic-Ising superconductivity in p-wave magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a possibility of superconductivity in the p-wave magnets. These are recently discovered materials that have zero net magnetization by symmetry and finite non-relativistic spin splitting of electron bands, like in altermagnets. Similarly, the spin polarizations is collinear in the momentum space. Yet, as opposed to altermagnets, the magnetization is noncollinear in the real space, and the spin splitting obeys time-reversal symmetry in the momentum space. As a result, if such material harbors superconductivity (due to phonons, or any other mechanism), the only supported superconducting symmetry is Ising superconductivity, an exotic symmetry where any Cooper pair is a 50:50 mix of singlet and triplet. This unusual behavior is also in stark contrast to regular antiferromagnet, which can support Cooper pairs of any parity, and altermagnets, which can only support nonunitary triplet pairs. The presence of large triplet component and enhanced resilience against pair breaking is inherent to the p-wave magnets and as such is unconventional as it does not materialize in conventional spin-orbit coupling induced Ising superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superpositions between states in doubly degenerate Kramers pairs can act as an internal degree of freedom. Here we uncover a Kramers dichroism in PT symmetric magnets: interband transitions induced by circularly polarized light irradiation produce a coherent superposition between Kramers partnered states. This allows to optically control the Kramers degree of freedom. In contrast, Kramers pairs optically excited by linearly polarized light remain in a completely mixed state. Strikingly, we find a class of second-order nonlinear responses that directly track the coherence between Kramers partnered states. Such Kramers nonlinearities can be pronounced producing large second-order nonlinear layer polarization responses activated by Kramers degeneracy in layered antiferromagnets. Together with Kramers dichroism, these render optical responses a novel means for accessing the Kramers degree of freedom and diagnosing their quantum coherent state.</description>

      <title>Conductance of atomic size contacts of Ag and Au at high magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic conduction at the atomic scale can be described by Landauer's formalism. In single atom point contacts of noble metals like Au and Ag, there is just one channel open between both electrodes and the conductance is very close to the quantum of conductance $G \approx G_0=\frac{2e^2}{h}$, with the factor of two coming from spin degeneracy. The magnetoconductivity of atomic size contacts has been studied for numerous systems, unveiling local Kondo screening, magnetic order and spin-polarized currents. However, these have been mostly performed in elements with multiple open conduction channels where $G$ differs from $G_0$. The realization of a magnetically active conductor with a single open channel remains difficult to achieve. Here we present measurements of the electronic conductance of single channel Au and Ag atomic-size contacts in magnetic fields up to 20 Tesla. We observe a decrease in $G$ which goes up to about 15% in many Au contacts at 20 T. We perform calculations and find that pure Ag and Au do not present a strong field dependence of $G$, in agreement with previous results at smaller magnetic fields. We also find, however, that residual O$_2$ molecules attached close to the contact produce an an induced spin-polarized current, which leads to a decrease in $G$. We discuss the role of the magnetic response of the electrodes in the jump to contact. Our results suggest that single channel atomic size conductors with a sizeable response to a magnetic field can be built by combining noble metals and magnetically active molecular systems.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically elucidate the transfer of phonon angular momentum by acoustic modes across a smooth interface between crystals. We analyze this process, which is difficult to describe with the conventional acoustic mismatch model, using a reformulated boundary condition and the Boltzmann theory. For an interface between a chiral and an achiral crystal, our analysis reveals that thermal gradients in the chiral crystal induce angular momentum, which diffuses into the achiral crystal even without heat flow. Notably, the density of angular momentum can be enhanced near the interface. These findings advance our understanding of phonon transport and its interplay with electron spins.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Fluctuations and Charge Fractionalization in Quantum Wires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14410v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum information method for measuring fractional charges in ballistic quantum wires generalizing bipartite fluctuations to the chiral quasiparticles in Luttinger liquids, i.e. analyzing and summing charge and current fluctuations in a region of the wire. Bipartite fluctuations at equilibrium are characterized through a logarithmic scaling with distance encoding the entangled nature of these fractional charges in one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This approach clarifies the physical meaning of the dephasing factor of electronic interferences in a ballistic ring geometry at zero temperature, as a result of charge fractionalization. We formulate an analogy towards ground-state energetics. We show how bipartite current fluctuations represent a useful tool to locate quantum phase transitions associated to Mott physics. We address a spin chain equivalence and verify the fractional charges through an algorithm such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). Adding a potential difference between the two sides (parties) of the wire, bipartite fluctuations can detect a bound state localized at the interface through the Jackiw-Rebbi model coexisting with fractional charges.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of fractional topological pumping of lattice solitons</title>

Abstract: One of the hallmarks of topological systems is the robust quantization of particle transport. It is the origin of the integer-valued quantum Hall conductivity and a potential tool for quantum information technology. Recent experiments on topological pumps constructed by using arrays of photonic waveguides and described by the (lattice-translational invariant) Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model, have demonstrated both integer and fractional transport of lattice solitons. In these systems, a background medium mediates interactions between photons via a Kerr nonlinearity and leads to the formation of self-bound multi-photon states. Upon increasing the interaction strength a sequence of transitions was observed from a phase with integer transport in a pump cycle through different phases of fractional transport to a phase with no transport. We here present a quantum description of topological pumps of self-bound many-particle states in terms of an effective Hamiltonian of their center-of-mass (COM) motion, which allows to introduce an effective band structure $E_\mu(K)$ with $K$ being the COM momentum, and to classify topological phases in terms of generalized symmetries. We provide an explicit analytic expression of the effective Hamiltonian for few particles in the strong interaction limit and present numerical results in the more general case. We identify a topological invariant, an effective single-particle Chern number, which fully governs the soliton transport. Increasing the interaction strength in the AAH model leads to a successive merging of COM bands, which is the origin of the observed sequence of topological phase transitions and also the potential breakdown of topological quantization for some interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Spin caloritronics in collinear ferromagnetic helical structures under irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the charge and spin-dependent thermoelectric response of a ferromagnetic helical system irradiated by arbitrarily polarized light, using a tight-binding framework and the Floquet-Bloch formalism. Transport properties for individual spin channels are determined by employing the non-equilibrium Green's function technique, while phonon thermal conductance is evaluated using a mass-spring model with different lead materials. The findings reveal that that light irradiation induces spin-split transmission features, suppresses thermal conductance, and yields favorable spin thermopower and figure of merit (FOM). The spin FOM consistently outperforms its charge counterpart under various light conditions. Moreover, long-range hopping is shown to enhance the spin thermoelectric performance, suggesting a promising strategy for efficient energy conversion in related ferromagnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Electronic Structure of Graphene by Controlling Spatial Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic properties of a material depend on the spatial freedom of the electron wavefunction. A well-known example is graphite, which is a conventional gapless semiconductor, while a single layer of it, graphene, exhibits extremely high electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, graphene ribbons can have different physical properties, such as a tunable band gap, ranging from gapless to a large band gap semiconductor. The purpose of this study is to investigate the electronic structure of few-layer graphene composed of a layer of graphene nanoribbons and graphene sheet(s), where quasi-one-dimensional nanoribbons can interact with a two-dimensional sheet of graphite. Using the tight-binding model for graphite, we show how different configurations of such heterostructures can affect the electronic structure, which is different from that of their components. Our results show that systems composed of semiconducting AGNRs can not be seen as two separate systems. Namely, a local gap of ~0.6 eV at the Dirac point for dispersive bands can be opened in a bilayer configuration composed of a layer of gapless armchair nanoribbon stacked on graphene. We demonstrate that the band steepness in these structures can be tuned, highlighting their potential for electronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design a superconducting thermoelectric bolometer made of a Graphene-Insulator-Superconductor tunnel junction. Our detector has the advantage of being passive, as it directly transduces input power to a voltage without the need to modulate an external bias. We characterize the device via numerical simulation of the full nonlinear thermal dynamical model of the junction, considering heating of both sides of the junction. While estimating noise contributions, we found novel expressions due to the temperatures of both sides being different than the bath temperature. Numerical simulations show a Noise Equivalent Power ${\rm NEP}\sim 4\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm W}/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ for an input power of $\sim10^{-16}\,{\rm W}$, a response time of $\tau_{th}\sim 200\, {\rm ns}$ and an integration time to obtain a Signal-to-Noise Ratio ${\rm SNR}=1$ of $\tau_{\rm SNR=1}\sim 100\,\mu{\rm s}$ for an input power $\sim 10^{-13}\,{\rm W}$. Therefore, the device shows promise for large-array cosmological experiment applications, also considering its advantages for fabrication and heat budget.</description>

      <title>Orbital Magnetization Reveals Multiband Topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that nontrivial multiband topological invariants of electronic wavefunctions can be revealed through orbital magnetization responses to external magnetic fields. We find that decomposing orbital magnetization into energetic and quantum-geometric contributions allows one to deduce nontrivial multiband topology, provided knowledge of the energy spectrum. We showcase our findings in general effective models with multiband Euler topology. We moreover identify such multiband topological invariants in effective models of strontium ruthenate ($\text{Sr}_2 \text{Ru} \text{O}_4$), which may in principle be verified in the state-of-the-art doping-dependent magnetization measurements. Our reconstruction scheme for multiband invariants sheds a topological perspective on the multiorbital effects in materials realizing unconventional phenomenologies of orbital currents or multiband superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Effect of hybrid field coupling in nanostructured surfaces on anisotropic signal detection in nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropic intensity distributions on nanostructured surfaces and polarization-sensitive spectra have been observed in a number of nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods, including nano-FTIR [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295], photothermal induced resonance (PTIR) [Waeytens et al., Analyst, 2021, 146], tapping AFM-IR [Hondl et al., ACS Meas. Sci. Au, 2025, 5, 469; Luo et al., APL, 2022, 121, 23330], infrared photoinduced force microscopy (PiF-IR) [Anindo et al., JPCC, 2025, 129, 4517; Shcherbakov et al., Rev Methods Primers, 2025, 5, 1; Ali et al., Anal. Chem., 2025, 97, 23914] and peak force infrared microscopy (PFIR) [Xie et al., JPCC, 2022, 126, 8393; Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. A recent work combining modeling and experiment demonstrated that the hybrid field coupling of the IR illumination E0 with a polymer nanosphere and a metallic AFM probe is nearly as strong as the plasmonic coupling in case of a gold nanosphere [Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. For p-polarized illumination, this results in enhanced IR absorption on the surface perpendicular to the propagation of E0 which can explain the observed anisotropic intensity distribution. An additional anisotropy may be introduced by aligned surface molecules with oriented vibrational transition moments [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295; Luo, APL, 2022]. PiF-IR is strongly surface sensitive combining an unprecedented spatial resolution &lt; 5 nm with high spectral resolution [Shcherbakov, Rev Methods Primers, 2025; Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025], which allows, for example, to visualize nanoscale chemical variation on the surface of bacteria cells affected by antimicrobial interaction [Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025]. We compare PiF-IR hyperspectra of aligned perylene Langmuir Blodgett monolayers on nanostructured and planar gold substrates and use quantum chemical calculations of the oriented vibrational oscillators to interpret the observations.</description>

      <title>Topological phonons in anomalous Hall crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments on few-layer graphene structures have reported indirect signatures of anomalous Hall crystals (AHCs), but the need for a top gate to stabilize the phase precludes direct imaging of the emergent electronic lattice. This situation necessitates the investigation of alternative signatures of AHCs. The gapless phonons of the emergent electronic lattice provide a clear distinction from conventional quantum Hall states, but it may be difficult to disentangle these phonons from the plethora of other possible low-lying modes. Intriguingly, the quantum geometry of the underlying electronic ground state can imprint on the collective modes, possibly leading the phonons themselves to be topological. Were this the case, the resulting neutral chiral edge modes would provide a further signature of an AHC. Using time-dependent Hartree-Fock, we compute the spectra of collective modes of Wigner crystals (WCs) and AHCs arising in minimal models and study the topology of the phonons and low-lying excitons. Across the WC to AHC transition, we observe a series of band inversions among collective modes, producing topological phonons and excitons, and a sharp sign change in the phonon Chern number upon entering the AHC phase. We conclude by discussing the relevance of collective mode topology to experiments on candidate systems for AHCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconductor-s-type superconductor nanowires host spinful fermions and cannot be reduced to a single spinless Kitaev chain hosting single Majorana zero mode. Instead, such systems can be converted into two coupled p-wave Kitaev-like chains associated with different spin sectors. Using the bond Fermion transformation and exact diagonalization, we analyze parity resolved spectra and local spectral functions, demonstrating that zero-energy modes strongly localized at the system boundaries emerge only in one effective chain. Inter-chain coupling lifts parity degeneracy and redistributes the low-energy spectral weight, providing a controlled framework to assess the stability of Majorana-like modes in the finite spinful nanowires.</description>

      <title>Hysteretic Excitation in Non-collinear Antiferromagnetic Spin-Torque Oscillators: A Terminal Velocity Motion Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin torque oscillators (NC-AFM STO) by unifying spin dynamics under the Poisson Bracket formalism. Shifting from traditional torque-based descriptions to an operational symmetry perspective, we develop two complementary viewpoints: a vector perspective identifying infinite degenerate Rigid Body Precession (RBP) states where exchange energy depends solely on the total magnetic momentum, and a particle perspective decomposing dynamics into Center-of-Mass (CM) translation and Relative Motion (RM) oscillation. Using time-dependent rotational and translational transformation techniques, we analytically resolve the rapid (~10 ps) transient evolution into a stable RBP state driven by SOT and damping. We demonstrate that the out-of-plane anisotropy (OPA) lifts the exchange degeneracy, triggering a long-term (~1 ns) oscillatory decay toward a steady state characterized by uniform spin z-components and a 120-degree inter-spin locking angle. This state is accurately governed by our Terminal Velocity Motion (TVM) model [arXiv:2305.14013], where exchange coupling transforms into kinetic energy with a light effective mass. The model precisely predicts SOT-driven transients, hysteretic excitation, and the dynamic phase diagram. Finally, we account for the sub-critical current regime mismatch by identifying a 'Rigid-Body Breaking' effect: a surge in effective friction caused by the self-resonance of RM variables induced by CM translation, mediated by the in-plane anisotropy (IPA).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin defects in solids offer promising platforms for quantum sensing and memory due to their long coherence times and optical addressability. Here, we integrate a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond with scanning probe microscopy to discover, read out, and spatially map arbitrary spin-based quantum sensors at the nanoscale. Using the boron vacancy ($\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{B}^-$) center in hexagonal boron nitride$\unicode{x2013}$an emerging two-dimensional spin system$\unicode{x2013}$as a model, we detect its electron spin resonance indirectly via changes in the spin relaxation time ($T_1$) of a nearby NV center, eliminating the need for optical excitation or fluorescence detection of the $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{B}^-$. Cross-relaxation between NV and $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{B}^-$ ensembles significantly reduces NV $T_1$, enabling quantitative nanoscale mapping of defect densities beyond the optical diffraction limit and clear resolution of hyperfine splitting in isotopically enriched h$^{10}$B$^{15}$N. Our method demonstrates interactions between 3D and 2D spin sensors, establishing NV centers as versatile probes for characterizing otherwise inaccessible spin defects.</description>

      <title>LLM Agents for Knowledge Discovery in Atomic Layer Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited probe capabilities without explicit instructions.</description>
