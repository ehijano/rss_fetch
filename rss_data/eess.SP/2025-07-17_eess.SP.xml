      <title>Foundation Models for Brain Signals: A Critical Review of Current Progress and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end, this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We believe that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.</description>

      <title>Directional Measurements and Analysis for FR3 Low-Altitude Channels in a Campus Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present detailed low-altitude channel measurements at the FR3 band in an outdoor campus environment. Using a time-domain channel sounder system, we conduct two types of measurements: path loss measurements by moving the transmitter (Tx) at one-meter intervals along a 26-point rooftop path, and directional power angular spectrum measurements through antenna scanning at half-power beam width intervals. The path loss analysis across different Rx shows that the close-in model outperforms conventional 3GPP models and height-corrected variants, with path loss exponents close to free space values indicating line-of-sight dominance. The power angular spectrum measurements show that propagation behavior varies significantly with environmental conditions. Closer Rx exhibit stronger sensitivity to ground reflections during downward Tx tilting, while obstructed links display uniform angular characteristics due to dominant scattering effects, and corridor environments produce asymmetric power distributions. These results indicate that low-altitude propagation is characterized by complex interactions between Tx height and ground scattering mechanisms, providing fundamental insights for channel modeling in emerging mid-band communication systems.</description>

      <title>Joint UAV Placement and Transceiver Design in Multi-User Wireless Relay Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to improve the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) among users in non-orthogonal multi-user wireless relay networks, by optimizing the placement of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relays, relay beamforming, and receive combining. The design is separated into two problems: beamforming-aware UAV placement optimization and transceiver design for minimum SINR maximization. A significant challenge in beamforming-aware UAV placement optimization is the lack of instantaneous channel state information (CSI) prior to deploying UAV relays, making it difficult to derive the beamforming SINR in non-orthogonal multi-user transmission. To address this issue, an approximation of the expected beamforming SINR is derived using the narrow beam property of a massive MIMO base station. Based on this, a UAV placement algorithm is proposed to provide UAV positions that improve the minimum expected beamforming SINR among users, using a difference-of-convex framework. Subsequently, after deploying the UAV relays to the optimized positions, and with estimated CSI available, a joint relay beamforming and receive combining (JRBC) algorithm is proposed to optimize the transceiver to improve the minimum beamforming SINR among users, using a block-coordinate descent approach. Numerical results show that the UAV placement algorithm combined with the JRBC algorithm provides a 4.6 dB SINR improvement over state-of-the-art schemes.</description>

      <title>Scene Graph-Aided Probabilistic Semantic Communication for Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication emphasizes the transmission of meaning rather than raw symbols. It offers a promising solution to alleviate network congestion and improve transmission efficiency. In this paper, we propose a wireless image communication framework that employs probability graphs as shared semantic knowledge base among distributed users. High-level image semantics are represented via scene graphs, and a two-stage compression algorithm is devised to remove predictable components based on learned conditional and co-occurrence probabilities. At the transmitter, the algorithm filters redundant relations and entity pairs, while at the receiver, semantic recovery leverages the same probability graphs to reconstruct omitted information. For further research, we also put forward a multi-round semantic compression algorithm with its theoretical performance analysis. Simulation results demonstrate that our semantic-aware scheme achieves superior transmission throughput and satiable semantic alignment, validating the efficacy of leveraging high-level semantics for image communication.</description>

      <title>STFT-based Time-Frequency Mode Decomposition: A Fast and Robust Method for Multicomponent Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decomposition of complex, multicomponent, and non-stationary signals into their constituent modes is a fundamental yet significant challenge in science and engineering. Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off among accuracy, computational cost, and the need for prior information such as the number of modes. This paper introduces time-frequency mode decomposition (TFMD), a novel framework for the fast, robust, and adaptive decomposition of such signals. TFMD operates on the principle that modes form contiguous high-energy regions in the time-frequency domain. Its non-iterative pipeline reframes signal decomposition as an image segmentation task: a signal is transformed into a spectrogram, which is then smoothed to enhance the continuity of these high-energy regions. A sequence of adaptive thresholding and connected-component labeling with size-based filtering is then employed to automatically segment the spectrogram and generate a mask for each mode. The modes are finally reconstructed via the inverse short-time Fourier transform. Validation on diverse synthetic signals demonstrates that TFMD accurately determines the number of modes and reconstructs them with high fidelity. Its performance is particularly strong in high-noise conditions. A comparative analysis confirms that TFMD provides robust, competitive performance across a wider variety of signal types, while a theoretical complexity analysis reveals its superior computational efficiency stemming from its non-iterative design. The method's practical utility is further demonstrated by successfully extracting modal responses from a real-world footbridge vibration signal. TFMD provides a computationally efficient and powerful paradigm for multicomponent signal analysis, offering a compelling balance of accuracy, versatility, and efficiency for large-scale or time-sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>DSSD: Efficient Edge-Device LLM Deployment and Collaborative Inference via Distributed Split Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12000v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing but face critical deployment challenges in device-edge systems due to resource limitations and communication overhead. To address these issues, collaborative frameworks have emerged that combine small language models (SLMs) on devices with LLMs at the edge, using speculative decoding (SD) to improve efficiency. However, existing solutions often trade inference accuracy for latency or suffer from high uplink transmission costs when verifying candidate tokens. In this paper, we propose Distributed Split Speculative Decoding (DSSD), a novel architecture that not only preserves the SLM-LLM split but also partitions the verification phase between the device and edge. In this way, DSSD replaces the uplink transmission of multiple vocabulary distributions with a single downlink transmission, significantly reducing communication latency while maintaining inference quality. Experiments show that our solution outperforms current methods, and codes are at: https://github.com/JasonNing96/DSSD-Efficient-Edge-Computing</description>

      <title>Enhancing Situational Awareness in ISAC Networks via Drone Swarms: A Real-World Channel Sounding Data Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the upcoming capabilities of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and the incorporation of user equipment (UE) like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in 6G mobile networks, there is a significant opportunity to enhance situational awareness through multi-static radar sensing in meshed ISAC networks. This paper presents a real-world channel sounding data set acquired using a testbed with synchronized, distributed ground-based sensor nodes and flying sensor nodes within a swarm of up to four drones. The conducted measurement campaign is designed to sense the bi-static reflectivity of objects such as parking cars, vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, and small drones in multi-path environments. We detail the rationale behind the selection of the included scenarios and the configuration of the participating nodesand present exemplary results to demonstrate the potential of using collaborating drone swarms for multi-static radar tracking and localization in air-to-air (A2A) and air-to-ground (A2G) scenarios. The data sets are publicly available to support the development and validation of future ISAC algorithms in real-world environments rather than relying solely on simulation.</description>

      <title>DoRF: Doppler Radiance Fields for Robust Human Activity Recognition Using Wi-Fi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) has gained increasing interest for remote sensing applications. Recent studies show that Doppler velocity projections extracted from CSI can enable human activity recognition (HAR) that is robust to environmental changes and generalizes to new users. However, despite these advances, generalizability still remains insufficient for practical deployment. Inspired by neural radiance fields (NeRF), which learn a volumetric representation of a 3D scene from 2D images, this work proposes a novel approach to reconstruct an informative 3D latent motion representation from one-dimensional Doppler velocity projections extracted from Wi-Fi CSI. The resulting latent representation is then used to construct a uniform Doppler radiance field (DoRF) of the motion, providing a comprehensive view of the performed activity and improving the robustness to environmental variability. The results show that the proposed approach noticeably enhances the generalization accuracy of Wi-Fi-based HAR, highlighting the strong potential of DoRFs for practical sensing applications.</description>

      <title>A Practical Analysis: Understanding Phase Noise Modelling in Time and Frequency Domain for Phase-Locked Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In MIMO systems, the presence of phase noise is a significant factor that can degrade performance. For MIMO testbeds build from SDR devices, phase noise cannot be ignored, particular in applications that require phase synchronization. This is especially relevant in MIMO systems that employ digital beamforming, where precise phase alignment is crucial. Accordingly, accurate phase noise modelling of SDR devices is essential. However, the information provided in data sheets for different SDR models varies widely and is often insufficient for comprehensive characterization of their phase noise performance. While numerical simulations of PLL phase noise behavior are documented in the literature, there is a lack of extensive measurements supported by appropriate system modelling. In this work, we present a practical phase noise modeling methodology applied to an SDR from the USRP X310 series. Based on measurement data, we derive estimates of key PLL performance indicators such as cycle-to-cycle jitter, oscillator constants, and PLL bandwidth. Furthermore, we propose a parametric model for the phase noise PSD of the PLL circuit and provide corresponding parameter estimates. This model can be used for further investigation into the impact of phase noise on MIMO system performance implemented by similar SDR devices.</description>

      <title>PAPR of DFT-s-OTFS with Pulse Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) suffers from high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) when the number of Doppler bins is large. To address this issue, a discrete Fourier transform spread OTFS (DFT-s-OTFS) scheme is employed by applying DFT spreading across the Doppler dimension. This paper presents a thorough PAPR analysis of DFT-s-OTFS in the uplink scenario using different pulse shaping filters and resource allocation strategies. Specifically, we derive a PAPR upper bound of DFT-s-OTFS with interleaved and block Doppler resource allocation schemes. Our analysis reveals that DFT-s-OTFS with interleaved allocation yields a lower PAPR than that of block allocation. Furthermore, we show that interleaved allocation produces a periodic time-domain signal composed of repeated quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) symbols which simplifies the transmitter design. Based on our analytical results, the root raised cosine (RRC) pulse generally results in a higher maximum PAPR compared to the rectangular pulse. Simulation results confirm the validity of the derived PAPR upper bounds. Furthermore, we also demonstrate through BER simulation analysis that the DFT-s-OTFS gives the same performance as OTFS without DFT spreading.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a passive sensing system for traffic monitoring using ambient Long Term Evolution (LTE) signals as a non-intrusive and scalable alternative to traditional surveillance methods. The approach employs a dual-receiver architecture analyzing Channel State Information (CSI) to isolate differential Doppler shifts induced by moving targets, effectively mitigating hardware-induced phase impairments. Implemented with a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform and srsRAN software, the system demonstrated over 90% detection accuracy for speeds above 6000 mm/min in controlled indoor tests, and provided reliable speed estimations for pedestrians and vehicles in outdoor evaluations. Despite challenges at low speeds, directional ambiguity, and multipath fading in urban settings, the results validate LTE-based passive sensing as a feasible traffic monitoring method, identifying critical areas for future research such as angle-of-arrival (AoA) integration, machine learning, and real-time embedded system development.</description>

      <title>Novel Approach to Dual-Channel Estimation in Integrated Sensing and Communications for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) design is crucial for 6G and harmonizes environmental data sensing with communication, emphasizing the need to understand and model these elements. This paper delves into dual-channel models for ISAC, employing channel extraction techniques to validate and enhance accuracy. Focusing on millimeter wave (mmWave) radars, it explores the extraction of the bistatic sensing channel from monostatic measurements and subsequent communication channel estimation. The proposed methods involve interference extraction, module and phase correlation analyses, chirp clustering, and auto-clutter reduction. A comprehensive set-up in an anechoic chamber with controlled scenarios evaluates the proposed techniques, demonstrating successful channel extraction and validation through Root Mean Square Delay Spread (RMS DS), Power Delay Profile (PDP), and Angle of Arrival (AoA) analysis. Comparison with Ray-Tracing (RT) simulations confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach, presenting an innovative stride towards fully integrated sensing and communication in future networks.</description>

      <title>Frequency-responsive RCS characteristics and scaling implications for ISAC development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an investigation on the Radar Cross-Section (RCS) of various targets, with the objective of analysing how RCS properties vary with frequency. Targets such as an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV), a pedestrian, and a full-scale car were measured in the frequency bands referred to in industry standards as FR2 and FR3. Measurements were taken in diverse environments, indoors and outdoors, to ensure comprehensive scenario coverage. The methodology employed in RCS extraction performs background subtraction, followed by time-domain gating to isolate the influence of the target. This analysis compares the RCS values and how the points of greatest contribution are distributed across different bands based on the range response of the RCS. Analysis of the results demonstrated how RCS values change with frequency and target shape, providing insights into the electromagnetic behaviour of these targets. Key findings highlight how much scaling RCS values based on frequency and geometry is complex and varies among different types of materials and shapes. These insights are instrumental for advancing sensing systems and enhancing 3GPP channel models, particularly for Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) techniques proposed for 6G standards.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Bi-Directional Channel Reciprocity for Robust Ultra-Low-Rate Implicit CSI Feedback with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based implicit channel state information (CSI) feedback has been introduced to enhance spectral efficiency in massive MIMO systems. Existing methods often show performance degradation in ultra-low-rate scenarios and inadaptability across diverse environments. In this paper, we propose Dual-ImRUNet, an efficient uplink-assisted deep implicit CSI feedback framework incorporating two novel plug-in preprocessing modules to achieve ultra-low feedback rates while maintaining high environmental robustness. First, a novel bi-directional correlation enhancement module is proposed to strengthen the correlation between uplink and downlink CSI eigenvector matrices. This module projects highly correlated uplink and downlink channel matrices into their respective eigenspaces, effectively reducing redundancy for ultra-low-rate feedback. Second, an innovative input format alignment module is designed to maintain consistent data distributions at both encoder and decoder sides without extra transmission overhead, thereby enhancing robustness against environmental variations. Finally, we develop an efficient transformer-based implicit CSI feedback network to exploit angular-delay domain sparsity and bi-directional correlation for ultra-low-rate CSI compression. Simulation results demonstrate successful reduction of the feedback overhead by 85% compared with the state-of-the-art method and robustness against unseen environments.</description>

      <title>Road Roughness Estimation via Fusion of Standard Onboard Automotive Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Road roughness significantly affects vehicle vibrations and ride quality. We introduce a Kalman filter (KF)-based method for estimating road roughness in terms of the international roughness index (IRI) by fusing inertial and speed measurements, offering a cost-effective solution for pavement monitoring. The method involves system identification on a physical vehicle to estimate realistic model parameters, followed by KF-based reconstruction of the longitudinal road profile to compute IRI values. It explores IRI estimation using vertical and lateral vibrations, the latter more common in modern vehicles. Validation on 230 km of real-world data shows promising results, with IRI estimation errors ranging from 1% to 10% of the reference values. However, accuracy deteriorates significantly when using only lateral vibrations, highlighting their limitations. These findings demonstrate the potential of KF-based estimation for efficient road roughness monitoring.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Data Fusion Generative Adversarial Network for Real Time Underwater Sound Speed Field Construction</title>

Abstract: Sound speed profiles (SSPs) are essential parameters underwater that affects the propagation mode of underwater signals and has a critical impact on the energy efficiency of underwater acoustic communication and accuracy of underwater acoustic positioning. Traditionally, SSPs can be obtained by matching field processing (MFP), compressive sensing (CS), and deep learning (DL) methods. However, existing methods mainly rely on on-site underwater sonar observation data, which put forward strict requirements on the deployment of sonar observation systems. To achieve high-precision estimation of sound velocity distribution in a given sea area without on-site underwater data measurement, we propose a multi-modal data-fusion generative adversarial network model with residual attention block (MDF-RAGAN) for SSP construction. To improve the model's ability for capturing global spatial feature correlations, we embedded the attention mechanisms, and use residual modules for deeply capturing small disturbances in the deep ocean sound velocity distribution caused by changes of SST. Experimental results on real open dataset show that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, which achieves an accuracy with an error of less than 0.3m/s. Specifically, MDF-RAGAN not only outperforms convolutional neural network (CNN) and spatial interpolation (SITP) by nearly a factor of two, but also achieves about 65.8\% root mean square error (RMSE) reduction compared to mean profile, which fully reflects the enhancement of overall profile matching by multi-source fusion and cross-modal attention.</description>

      <title>The Role of Rank in Mismatched Low-Rank Symmetric Matrix Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of a Bayesian statistician tasked with recovering a rank-\(k\) signal matrix \(\bS \bS^{\top} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\), corrupted by element-wise additive Gaussian noise. This problem lies at the core of numerous applications in machine learning, signal processing, and statistics. We derive an analytic expression for the asymptotic mean-square error (MSE) of the Bayesian estimator under mismatches in the assumed signal rank, signal power, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), considering both sphere and Gaussian signals. Additionally, we conduct a rigorous analysis of how rank mismatch influences the asymptotic MSE. Our primary technical tools include the spectrum of Gaussian orthogonal ensembles (GOE) with low-rank perturbations and asymptotic behavior of \(k\)-dimensional spherical integrals.</description>

      <title>Self-Boosted Weight-Constrained FxLMS: A Robustness Distributed Active Noise Control Algorithm Without Internode Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared to the conventional centralized multichannel active noise control (MCANC) algorithm, which requires substantial computational resources, decentralized approaches exhibit higher computational efficiency but typically result in inferior noise reduction performance. To enhance performance, distributed ANC methods have been introduced, enabling information exchange among ANC nodes; however, the resulting communication latency often compromises system stability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a self-boosted weight-constrained filtered-reference least mean square (SB-WCFxLMS) algorithm for the distributed MCANC system without internode communication. The WCFxLMS algorithm is specifically designed to mitigate divergence issues caused by the internode cross-talk effect. The self-boosted strategy lets each ANC node independently adapt its constraint parameters based on its local noise reduction performance, thus ensuring effective noise cancellation without the need for inter-node communication. With the assistance of this mechanism, this approach significantly reduces both computational complexity and communication overhead. Numerical simulations employing real acoustic paths and compressor noise validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed system. The results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves satisfactory noise cancellation performance with minimal resource requirements.</description>

      <title>Soft-Constrained Spatially Selective Active Noise Control for Open-fitting Hearables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in spatially selective active noise control (SSANC) using multiple microphones have enabled hearables to suppress undesired noise while preserving desired speech from a specific direction. Aiming to achieve minimal speech distortion, a hard constraint has been used in previous work in the optimization problem to compute the control filter. In this work, we propose a soft-constrained SSANC system that uses a frequency-independent parameter to trade off between speech distortion and noise reduction. We derive both time- and frequency-domain formulations, and show that conventional active noise control and hard-constrained SSANC represent two limiting cases of the proposed design. We evaluate the system through simulations using a pair of open-fitting hearables in an anechoic environment with one speech source and two noise sources. The simulation results validate the theoretical derivations and demonstrate that for a broad range of the trade-off parameter, the signal-to-noise ratio and the speech quality and intelligibility in terms of PESQ and ESTOI can be substantially improved compared to the hard-constrained design.</description>

      <title>HyDRA: A Hybrid Dual-Mode Network for Closed- and Open-Set RFFI with Optimized VMD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Device recognition is vital for security in wireless communication systems, particularly for applications like access control. Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) offers a non-cryptographic solution by exploiting hardware-induced signal distortions. This paper proposes HyDRA, a Hybrid Dual-mode RF Architecture that integrates an optimized Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) with a novel architecture based on the fusion of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and Mamba components, designed to support both closed-set and open-set classification tasks. The optimized VMD enhances preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy by fixing center frequencies and using closed-form solutions. HyDRA employs the Transformer Dynamic Sequence Encoder (TDSE) for global dependency modeling and the Mamba Linear Flow Encoder (MLFE) for linear-complexity processing, adapting to varying conditions. Evaluation on public datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy in closed-set scenarios and robust performance in our proposed open-set classification method, effectively identifying unauthorized devices. Deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX, HyDRA achieves millisecond-level inference speed with low power consumption, providing a practical solution for real-time wireless authentication in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Spatial Cognition Emerges during Egocentric Video Viewing through Non-invasive BCI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable capacity for spatial cognition, allowing for self-localization even in novel or unfamiliar environments. While hippocampal neurons encoding position and orientation are well documented, the large-scale neural dynamics supporting spatial representation, particularly during naturalistic, passive experience, remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can decode spontaneous, fine-grained egocentric 6D pose, comprising three-dimensional position and orientation, during passive viewing of egocentric video. Despite EEG's limited spatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent visual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable spatial representations, aligning with participants' subjective sense of spatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is presented at a frame rate of 100 ms per image, suggesting alignment with intrinsic neural temporal dynamics. Using gradient-based backpropagation through a neural decoding model, we identify distinct EEG channels contributing to position -- and orientation specific -- components, revealing a distributed yet complementary neural encoding scheme. These findings indicate that the brain's spatial systems operate spontaneously and continuously, even under passive conditions, challenging traditional distinctions between active and passive spatial cognition. Our results offer a non-invasive window into the automatic construction of egocentric spatial maps and advance our understanding of how the human mind transforms everyday sensory experience into structured internal representations.</description>

Abstract: High-Frequency (HF) radar is well suited to the surveillance of low-Earth-orbit space. For large targets, a small deployable HF radar is able to match the detection performance of much larger space surveillance radar systems operating at higher frequencies. However, there are some unique challenges associated with the use of HF, including the range--Doppler coupling bias, coarse detection-level localisation, and the presence of meteor returns and other unwanted signals. This paper details the use of HF radar for space surveillance, including signal processing and radar product formation, tracking, ionospheric correction, and orbit determination. It is shown that by fusing measurements from multiple passes, accurate orbital estimates can be obtained. Included are results from recent SpaceFest trials of the Defence Science and Technology Group's HF space surveillance radar, achieving real-time wide-area surveillance in tracking, orbit determination, and cueing of other space surveillance sensors.</description>

      <title>An Energy Efficient Design of Hybrid NOMA Based on Hybrid SIC with Power Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (H-NOMA) technology, which effectively utilizes both NOMA and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) technologies through flexible resource allocation in a single transmission, has demonstrated immense potential for enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems. To further release the potential of HNOMA, this paper proposes a novel design of H-NOMA which jointly incorporates hybrid successive interference cancellation (HSIC) and power adaptation (PA) in the NOMA transmission phase. To reveal the potential of the proposed HSIC-PA aided H-NOMA scheme, closed-form expression for the probability of the event that H-NOMA can achieve a higher data rate than pure OMA by consuming less energy is rigorously derived. Furthermore, the asymptotic analysis demonstrates that the probability of the proposed H-NOMA scheme approaches 1 in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime without any constraints on either users' target rates or transmit power ratios. This represents a significant improvement over conventional H-NOMA schemes, which require specific restrictive conditions to achieve probability 1 at high SNRs as shown in existing work. The above observation indicates that with less energy consumption, the proposed HSIC-PA aided H-NOMA can achieve a higher data rate than pure OMA with probability 1 at high SNRs, and hence a higher energy efficiency. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the accuracy of the analysis and also demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed H-NOMA scheme.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient and Intelligent ISAC in V2X Networks with Spiking Neural Networks-Driven DRL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is emerging as a key enabler for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems. However, designing efficient beamforming schemes for ISAC signals to achieve accurate sensing and enhance communication performance in the dynamic and uncertain environments of V2X networks presents significant challenges. While artificial intelligence technologies offer promising solutions, the energy-intensive nature of neural networks imposes substantial burdens on communication infrastructures. To address these challenges, this work proposes an energy-efficient and intelligent ISAC system for V2X networks. Specifically, we first leverage a Markov Decision Process framework to model the dynamic and uncertain nature of V2X networks. This framework allows the roadside unit to develop beamforming schemes relying solely on its current sensing information, eliminating the need for numerous pilot signals and extensive CSI acquisition. We then introduce an advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, enabling the joint optimization of beamforming and power allocation to guarantee both communication rate and sensing accuracy in dynamic and uncertain V2X scenario. To alleviate the energy demands of neural networks, we integrate spiking neural networks (SNNs) into the DRL algorithm. The event-driven, sparse spike-based processing of SNNs significantly improves energy efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with lower energy consumption, superior communication performance, and improved sensing accuracy.</description>

      <title>Antenna Position and Beamforming Optimization for Movable Antenna Enabled ISAC: Optimal Solutions and Efficient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system enabled by movable antennas (MAs), which can dynamically adjust antenna positions to enhance both sensing and communication performance for future wireless networks. To characterize the benefits of MA-enabled ISAC systems, we first derive the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for angle estimation error, which is then minimized for optimizing the antenna position vector (APV) and beamforming design, subject to a pre-defined signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraint to ensure the communication performance. In particular, for the case with receive MAs only, we provide a closed-form optimal antenna position solution, and show that employing MAs over conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) can achieve a sensing performance gain upper-bounded by 4.77 dB. On the other hand, for the case with transmit MAs only, we develop a boundary traversal breadth-first search (BT-BFS) algorithm to obtain the global optimal solution in the line-of-sight (LoS) channel scenario, along with a lower-complexity boundary traversal depth-first search (BT-DFS) algorithm to find a local optimal solution efficiently. While in the scenario with non-LoS (NLoS) channels, a majorization-minimization (MM) based Rosen's gradient projection (RGP) algorithm with an efficient initialization method is proposed to obtain stationary solutions for the considered problem, which can be extended to the general case with both transmit and receive MAs. Extensive numerical results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and demonstrate the superiority of the considered MA-enabled ISAC system over conventional ISAC systems with FPAs in terms of sensing and communication performance trade-off.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and Statistical Analysis of the DoF of Continuous Linear Arrays in the Near Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the number of communication modes, that is, the degrees of freedom (DoF) in a wireless line-of-sight channel comprising a small continuous linear intelligent antenna array in the near field of a large one. The framework allows for any orientations between the arrays and any positions in a two-dimensional space assuming that the transmitting array is placed at the origin. Therefore, apart from the length of the two continuous arrays, four key parameters determine the DoF and are hence considered in the analysis: the Cartesian coordinates of the center of the receiving array and two angles that model the rotation of each array around its center. The paper starts with the calculation of the deterministic DoF for a generic geometric setting, which extends beyond the widely studied paraxial case. Subsequently, a stochastic geometry framework is proposed to study the statistical DoF, as a first step towards the investigation of the system-level performance in near field networks. Numerical results applied to millimeter wave networks reveal the large number of DoF provided by near-field communications and unveil key system-level insights. A comparison of the proposed method with the singular value decomposition-based method is illustrated to validate the model.</description>

Abstract: The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is an effective tool for feature extraction in acoustic recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly when applied to non-stationary audio. However, its high computational cost poses a significant challenge, often leading researchers to prefer alternative methods such as the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce the computational complexity of CWT by optimizing the length of the wavelet kernel and the hop size of the output scalogram. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining the robust performance of the trained model in acoustic recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning Perceptually Relevant Temporal Envelope Morphing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal envelope morphing, the process of interpolating between the amplitude dynamics of two audio signals, is an emerging problem in generative audio systems that lacks sufficient perceptual grounding. Morphing of temporal envelopes in a perceptually intuitive manner should enable new methods for sound blending in creative media and for probing perceptual organization in psychoacoustics. However, existing audio morphing techniques often fail to produce intermediate temporal envelopes when input sounds have distinct temporal structures; many morphers effectively overlay both temporal structures, leading to perceptually unnatural results. In this paper, we introduce a novel workflow for learning envelope morphing with perceptual guidance: we first derive perceptually grounded morphing principles through human listening studies, then synthesize large-scale datasets encoding these principles, and finally train machine learning models to create perceptually intermediate morphs. Specifically, we present: (1) perceptual principles that guide envelope morphing, derived from our listening studies, (2) a supervised framework to learn these principles, (3) an autoencoder that learns to compress temporal envelope structures into latent representations, and (4) benchmarks for evaluating audio envelope morphs, using both synthetic and naturalistic data, and show that our approach outperforms existing methods in producing temporally intermediate morphs. All code, models, and datasets will be made publicly available upon publication.</description>
