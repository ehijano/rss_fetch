      <title>Unsupervised local learning based on voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity for resistive and ferroelectric synapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of AI on edge computing devices faces significant challenges related to energy consumption and functionality. These devices could greatly benefit from brain-inspired learning mechanisms, allowing for real-time adaptation while using low-power. In-memory computing with nanoscale resistive memories may play a crucial role in enabling the execution of AI workloads on these edge devices. In this study, we introduce voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity (VDSP) as an efficient approach for unsupervised and local learning in memristive synapses based on Hebbian principles. This method enables online learning without requiring complex pulse-shaping circuits typically necessary for spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We show how VDSP can be advantageously adapted to three types of memristive devices (TiO$_2$, HfO$_2$-based metal-oxide filamentary synapses, and HfZrO$_4$-based ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJ)) with disctinctive switching characteristics. System-level simulations of spiking neural networks incorporating these devices were conducted to validate unsupervised learning on MNIST-based pattern recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The results demonstrated over 83% accuracy across all devices using 200 neurons. Additionally, we assessed the impact of device variability, such as switching thresholds and ratios between high and low resistance state levels, and proposed mitigation strategies to enhance robustness.</description>

      <title>Advancing Forest Fires Classification using Neurochaos Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forest fires are among the most dangerous and unpredictable natural disasters worldwide. Forest fire can be instigated by natural causes or by humans. They are devastating overall, and thus, many research efforts have been carried out to predict whether a fire can occur in an area given certain environmental variables. Many research works employ Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models for classification; however, their accuracy is merely adequate and falls short of expectations. This limit arises because these models are unable to depict the underlying nonlinearity in nature and extensively rely on substantial training data, which is hard to obtain. We propose using Neurochaos Learning (NL), a chaos-based, brain-inspired learning algorithm for forest fire classification. Like our brains, NL needs less data to learn nonlinear patterns in the training data. It employs one-dimensional chaotic maps, namely the Generalized L\"uroth Series (GLS), as neurons. NL yields comparable performance with ML and DL models, sometimes even surpassing them, particularly in low-sample training regimes, and unlike deep neural networks, NL is interpretable as it preserves causal structures in the data. Random Heterogenous Neurochaos Learning (RHNL), a type of NL where different chaotic neurons are randomnly located to mimic the randomness and heterogeneity of human brain gives the best F1 score of 1.0 for the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset. Compared to other traditional ML classifiers considered, RHNL also gives high precision score of 0.90 for Canadian Forest Fires Dataset and 0.68 for Portugal Forest Fires Dataset. The results obtained from this work indicate that Neurochaos Learning (NL) architectures achieve better performance than conventional machine learning classifiers, highlighting their promise for developing more efficient and reliable forest fire detection systems.</description>

      <title>Wireless Sensor Networks as Parallel and Distributed Hardware Platform for Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are proposing fully parallel and maximally distributed hardware realization of a generic neuro-computing system. More specifically, the proposal relates to the wireless sensor networks technology to serve as a massively parallel and fully distributed hardware platform to implement and realize artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. A parallel and distributed (PDP) hardware realization of ANNs makes it possible to have real time computation of large-scale (and complex) problems in a highly robust framework. We will demonstrate how a network of hundreds of thousands of processing nodes (or motes of a wireless sensor network), which have on-board processing and wireless communication features, can be used to implement fully parallel and massively distributed computation of artificial neural network algorithms for solution of truly large-scale problems in real time. The realization of artificial neural network algorithms in a massively parallel and fully distributed hardware has been the goal of neural network computing researchers. This is because a parallel and distributed computation of artificial neural network algorithms could not have been achieved against all the advancements in silicon- or optics-based computing. Accordingly, artificial neural networks could not be applied to very large-scale problems for real time computation of solutions. This hindered the development of neural algorithms for affordable and practical solutions of challenging problems since often special-purpose computing approaches in hardware, software or hybrid (non-neural) had to be developed for and fine-tuned to specific problems that are very large-scale and highly complex. Successful implementation is likely to revolutionize computing as we know it by making it possible to solve very large scale scientific, engineering or technical problems in real time.</description>

      <title>A Practitioner's Guide to Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs, establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices, including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions, Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The associated GitHub repository https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review complements this paper and serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN research.</description>

      <title>Humains-Junior: A 3.8B Language Model Achieving GPT-4o-Level Factual Accuracy by Directed Exoskeleton Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI 69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's $d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp). When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model (Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning" scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance (epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p &lt; 0.001$) and reduce variance ($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100; non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within $\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains (Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

      <title>InputDSA: Demixing then Comparing Recurrent and Externally Driven Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In control problems and basic scientific modeling, it is important to compare observations with dynamical simulations. For example, comparing two neural systems can shed light on the nature of emergent computations in the brain and deep neural networks. Recently, Ostrow et al. (2023) introduced Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA), a method to measure the similarity of two systems based on their recurrent dynamics rather than geometry or topology. However, DSA does not consider how inputs affect the dynamics, meaning that two similar systems, if driven differently, may be classified as different. Because real-world dynamical systems are rarely autonomous, it is important to account for the effects of input drive. To this end, we introduce a novel metric for comparing both intrinsic (recurrent) and input-driven dynamics, called InputDSA (iDSA). InputDSA extends the DSA framework by estimating and comparing both input and intrinsic dynamic operators using a variant of Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc) based on subspace identification. We demonstrate that InputDSA can successfully compare partially observed, input-driven systems from noisy data. We show that when the true inputs are unknown, surrogate inputs can be substituted without a major deterioration in similarity estimates. We apply InputDSA on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning, identifying that high-performing networks are dynamically similar to one another, while low-performing networks are more diverse. Lastly, we apply InputDSA to neural data recorded from rats performing a cognitive task, demonstrating that it identifies a transition from input-driven evidence accumulation to intrinsically-driven decision-making. Our work demonstrates that InputDSA is a robust and efficient method for comparing intrinsic dynamics and the effect of external input on dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Online Learning with Predictive Coding Networks: Exploiting Temporal Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC) framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation. However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10% fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling efficient online learning at the edge.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the Mechanisms of Manipulating Numbers in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs' architectures.</description>

      <title>Reducing base drag on road vehicles using pulsed jets optimized by hybrid genetic algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aerodynamic drag on flat-backed vehicles like vans and trucks is dominated by a low-pressure wake, whose control is critical for reducing fuel consumption. This paper presents an experimental study at $Re_W\approx 78,300$ on active flow control using four pulsed jets at the rear edges of a bluff body model. A hybrid genetic algorithm, combining a global search with a local gradient-based optimizer, was used to determine the optimal jet actuation parameters in an experiment-in-the-loop setup. The cost function was designed to achieve a net energy saving by simultaneously minimizing aerodynamic drag and penalizing the actuation's energy consumption. The optimization campaign successfully identified a control strategy that yields a drag reduction of approximately 10%. The optimal control law features a strong, low-frequency actuation from the bottom jet, which targets the main vortex shedding, while the top and lateral jets address higher-frequency, less energetic phenomena. Particle Image Velocimetry analysis reveals a significant upward shift and stabilization of the wake, leading to substantial pressure recovery on the model's lower base. Ultimately, this work demonstrates that a model-free optimization approach can successfully identify non-intuitive, multi-faceted actuation strategies that yield significant and energetically efficient drag reduction.</description>

      <title>Multiplication-Free Parallelizable Spiking Neurons with Efficient Spatio-Temporal Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are distinguished from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for their complex neuronal dynamics and sparse binary activations (spikes) inspired by the biological neural system. Traditional neuron models use iterative step-by-step dynamics, resulting in serial computation and slow training speed of SNNs. Recently, parallelizable spiking neuron models have been proposed to fully utilize the massive parallel computing ability of graphics processing units to accelerate the training of SNNs. However, existing parallelizable spiking neuron models involve dense floating operations and can only achieve high long-term dependencies learning ability with a large order at the cost of huge computational and memory costs. To solve the dilemma of performance and costs, we propose the mul-free channel-wise Parallel Spiking Neuron, which is hardware-friendly and suitable for SNNs' resource-restricted application scenarios. The proposed neuron imports the channel-wise convolution to enhance the learning ability, induces the sawtooth dilations to reduce the neuron order, and employs the bit-shift operation to avoid multiplications. The algorithm for the design and implementation of acceleration methods is discussed extensively. Our methods are validated in neuromorphic Spiking Heidelberg Digits voices, sequential CIFAR images, and neuromorphic DVS-Lip vision datasets, achieving superior performance over SOTA spiking neurons. Training speed results demonstrate the effectiveness of our acceleration methods, providing a practical reference for future research. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/PengXue0812/Multiplication-Free-Parallelizable-Spiking-Neurons-with-Efficient-Spatio-Temporal-Dynamics}{Github}.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) approach for the formal verification of object detection models, specifically targeting the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric. The approach has been implemented in an open source code, named IBP IoU, compatible with popular abstract interpretation based verification tools. The resulting verifier is evaluated on landing approach runway detection and handwritten digit recognition case studies. Comparisons against a baseline (Vanilla IBP IoU) highlight the superior performance of IBP IoU in ensuring accuracy and stability, contributing to more secure and robust machine learning applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chaos-based reinforcement learning (CBRL) is a method in which the agent's internal chaotic dynamics drives exploration. However, the learning algorithms in CBRL have not been thoroughly developed in previous studies, nor have they incorporated recent advances in reinforcement learning. This study introduced Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (TD3), which is one of the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms that can treat deterministic and continuous action spaces, to CBRL. The validation results provide several insights. First, TD3 works as a learning algorithm for CBRL in a simple goal-reaching task. Second, CBRL agents with TD3 can autonomously suppress their exploratory behavior as learning progresses and resume exploration when the environment changes. Finally, examining the effect of the agent's chaoticity on learning shows that there exists a suitable range of chaos strength in the agent's model to flexibly switch between exploration and exploitation and adapt to environmental changes.</description>

Abstract: The widely used ReLU is favored for its hardware efficiency, {as the implementation at inference is a one bit sign case,} yet suffers from issues such as the ``dying ReLU'' problem, where during training, neurons fail to activate and constantly remain at zero, as highlighted by Lu et al. Traditional approaches to mitigate this issue often introduce more complex and less hardware-friendly activation functions. In this work, we propose a Hysteresis Rectified Linear Unit (HeLU), an efficient activation function designed to address the ``dying ReLU'' problem with minimal complexity. Unlike traditional activation functions with fixed thresholds for training and inference, HeLU employs a variable threshold that refines the backpropagation. This refined mechanism allows simpler activation functions to achieve competitive performance comparable to their more complex counterparts without introducing unnecessary complexity or requiring inductive biases. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that HeLU enhances model generalization across diverse datasets, offering a promising solution for efficient and effective inference suitable for a wide range of neural network architectures.</description>
