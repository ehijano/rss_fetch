      <title>Deriving Locality, Gravity as Spontaneous Breaking of Diffeomorphism Symmetry</title>

Abstract: Looking for ideas for a fundamental physics that could almost work by itself, not making but mild assumptions, we are inspired by the earlier work by Astri Kleppe and myself. We showed that assuming diffeomorphism symmetry in addition to only ``mild assumptions'' we could obtain obtain effectively a local Lagrangian density,without assuming that the action were at all local! However, we point out in the present article, that unless there is a spontaneous breakdown of the full diffeoemorphism invariance by gravitational like fields having non-zero vacuum expectation values, there would be no propagation possible, in other words the resulting effective local theory would be super local, so no communication between the different space-time points. We suggest that having a projective space or some similar space with some more structure, it could be in practice enough to get the effective locallity, so the full diffeomorphism symmetry might not not be really needed. Finally we found a phenomenological feature of the CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation) low l spherical harmonic expansion of the CMB fluctuations which we interpret as a sign of space-time in the background in which space-time is imbedded is a projective space, rather than just a manifold</description>
