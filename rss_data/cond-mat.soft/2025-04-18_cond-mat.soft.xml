      <title>Coarse-Grained Force Fields via Rotational Entropy Corrections to Free Energy Landscapes of Diffusing Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of accurate interatomic potentials, and related fields of forces, from equilibrium conformational distributions of molecules is a crucial step in coarse-grained modeling. In this work we show that in order to develop accurate lab-frame force fields that preserve translational and rotational diffusion of a molecule, the observed body-fixed free energy landscape must be corrected for conformation-dependent rotational entropy to isolate the potential energy surface. We further demonstrate that even when the instantaneous effects of the correction are small, the resulting lagged correlations of the modeled force can be greatly altered and hence the correction is especially vital when parameterizing friction coefficients using modeled interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Collapse Kinetics of Charged Polymers in Good Solvent: Role of Counterion Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the collapse kinetics of charged polymers (polyelectrolytes) induced by counterion condensation using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Under good solvent conditions, polyelectrolytes above the critical charge density ($A &gt; A_c$) exhibit significantly faster collapse dynamics compared to neutral polymers, with dynamic scaling exponents ($\nu_c \approx 0.76-0.84$) distinctly smaller than those observed for neutral polymers ($\nu_c \approx 1.44$) . This accelerated collapse is driven primarily by three mechanisms: (1) local charge neutralization due to counterion condensation, which facilitates immediate local compaction, (2) screening of long-range electrostatic repulsions, reducing the conformational search space, and (3) bridging interactions mediated by multivalent counterions, enhancing efficient formation of intra-chain contacts. We systematically explore the effects of polymer length, charge density, and counterion valency (monovalent, divalent, and trivalent) on collapse dynamics, demonstrating that increased counterion valency significantly lowers the critical charge density required for collapse and accelerates the collapse process. Our findings highlight the limitations of modeling charged biopolymers using purely neutral coarse-grained models, underscoring the importance of electrostatic interactions and counterion dynamics in determining their kinetic pathways. These insights may aid in better understanding the folding, organization, and dynamics of inherently charged biomolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids.</description>

      <title>Rheology of dilute granular gases with hard-core and inverse power-law potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetic theory of dilute granular gases with hard-core and inverse power-law potentials is developed. The scattering process is studied theoretically, which yields the relative speed and the impact parameter dependence of the scattering angle. The viscosity is derived from the Boltzmann equation and its temperature dependence is plotted. We also perform the direct simulation Monte Carlo to check the validity of the theory.</description>

      <title>Osmolyte-Modulated Differential Capacitance and Disjoining Pressure for Nanoconfined Electrolytes: A Modified Poisson-Boltzmann Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory to systematically investigate the influence of zwitterionic osmolyte additives to an electrolyte solution on disjoining pressure and electric differential capacitance within charged slit-like nanopores with conductive walls. We demonstrate that increasing concentrations of zwitterionic osmolytes result in a marked synergistic enhancement of both disjoining pressure and differential capacitance, highlighting their dual role in improving supercapacitor performance. The insights gained underscore the unique capabilities of zwitterionic osmolytes as multifunctional additives for fine-tuning the properties of electric double layers, thereby bridging the gap between capacitive efficiency and electrode longevity.</description>

      <title>Topological defect engineering enables size and shape control in self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-assembly of complex structures from engineered subunits is a major goal of nanotechnology, but controlling their size becomes increasingly difficult in larger assemblies. Existing strategies present significant challenges, among which are the use of multiple subunit types or the precise control of their shape and mechanics. Here we introduce an alternative approach based on identical subunits whose interactions promote crystals, but also favor crystalline defects. We theoretically show that topological restrictions on the scope of these defects in large assemblies imply that the assembly size is controlled by the magnitude of the defect-inducing interaction. Using DNA origami, we experimentally demonstrate both size and shape control in two-dimensional disk- and fiber-like assemblies. Our basic concept of defect engineering could be generalized well beyond these simple examples, and thus provide a broadly applicable scheme to control self-assembly.</description>

      <title>Instability and stress fluctuations of a probe driven through a worm-like micellar fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A particle moving through a worm-like micellar fluid (WLM) shows instability and large fluctuations beyond a threshold. Despite many detailed studies, a direct measurement of the time-dependent stress on the probe particle remains unexplored. To address this, we have designed a measuring geometry coupled with a commercial rheometer to study the dynamics of a cylindrical probe through a WLM system of 2 wt.\% cetyltrimethyl ammonium tosylate(CTAT) + 100 mM sodium chloride(NaCl) for a wide range of velocity and stress scales. We map out the in-situ velocity distribution using particle imaging velocimetry. Beyond a certain velocity threshold, we observe large stress fluctuation events with gradual stress build-up followed by sudden stress drop indicating the storage and release of elastic energy. The length scale constructed from the stress build-up time scale and the probe's velocity match the length scale of extensile deformation in the sample just before the stress drop, further confirming the strong correlation of such storage and release of energy with the unstable motion of the probe. Interestingly, despite their significant difference in magnitudes, the Weissenberg number ($Wi$) for the onset of flow instability obtained from the shear and extensile components remains almost the same. We also find that the turbulent motion of the probe at higher $Wi$ results from the complex mixing of the stick-slip events originating from the partial release of the stored elastic energy. Further, we show that the magnitude of the stick-slip events depends on the detailed micellar structure and dynamics controlled by salt concentration and temperature.</description>

      <title>Rare-Event-Induced Ergodicity Breaking in Logarithmic Aging Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ergodicity breaking and aging effects are fundamental challenges in out-of-equilibrium systems. Various mechanisms have been proposed to understand the non-ergodic and aging phenomena, possibly related to observations in systems ranging from structural glass and Anderson glasses to biological systems and mechanical systems. While anomalous diffusion described by Levy statistics efficiently captures ergodicity breaking, the origin of aging and ergodicity breaking in systems with ultraslow dynamics remain unclear. Here, we report a novel mechanism of ergodicity breaking in systems exhibiting log-aging diffusion. This mechanism, characterized by increasingly infrequent rare events with aging, yields statistics deviating significantly from Levy distribution, breaking ergodicity as shown by unequal time- and ensemble-averaged mean squared displacements and two distinct asymptotic probability distribution functions. Notably, although these rare events contribute negligibly to statistical averages, they dramatically change the system's characteristic time. This work lays the groundwork for microscopic understanding of out-of-equilibrium systems and provides new perspectives on glasses and Griffiths-McCoy singularities.</description>

      <title>Topologically Directed Simulations Reveal the Impact of Geometric Constraints on Knotted Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of knotting and unknotting in polymers or other filaments rely on random processes to facilitate topological changes. Here we introduce a method of \textit{topological steering} to determine the optimal pathway by which a filament may knot or unknot while subject to a given set of physics. The method involves measuring the knotoid spectrum of a space curve projected onto many surfaces and computing the mean unravelling number of those projections. Several perturbations of a curve can be generated stochastically, e.g. using the Langevin equation or crankshaft moves, and a gradient can be followed that maximises or minimises the topological complexity. We apply this method to a polymer model based on a growing self-avoiding tangent-sphere chain, which can be made to model proteins by imposing a constraint that the bending and twisting angles between successive spheres must maintain the distribution found in naturally occurring protein structures. We show that without these protein-like geometric constraints, topologically optimised polymers typically form alternating torus knots and composites thereof, similar to the stochastic knots predicted for long DNA. However, when the geometric constraints are imposed on the system, the frequency of twist knots increases, similar to the observed abundance of twist knots in protein structures.</description>
