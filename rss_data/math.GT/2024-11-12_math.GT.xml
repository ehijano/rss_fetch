      <title>On the AJ bracket for tied links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a tied link $L$, the invariant $\langle\langle\cdot\rangle\rangle$ generalizes the Kauffman bracket of classical links. However, the analogues of Kauffman states and their relationship to this invariant are not immediately clear. We address this question by defining the Aicardi-Juyumaya states, and show that the contribution of each AJ-state to $\langle\langle\cdot\rangle\rangle$ does not depend on the chosen resolution tree. We also present an algorithm to compute the double bracket of a tied link diagram, and use it to find pairs of examples of (oriented) tied links sharing the same Homflypt polynomial but different tied Jones polynomial.</description>

      <title>Lambda lengths in The figure eight knot complement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the complete hyperbolic structure on the complement of the figure eight knot, we determine the set of lambda lengths from the maximal cusp to itself. Using the correspondence between spinors and spin-decorated horospheres, we show that these lambda lengths are precisely the Eisenstein integers, up to multiplication by a unit. We also show that the inter-cusp distances from the maximal cusp to itself are precisely the norms of Eisenstein integers.</description>

      <title>A bypass in the middle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a topological characterization for a family of bypasses with a fixed attaching arc to be contractible. This characterization is formulated in terms of the existence of a bypass that is disjoint from the given family away from the attaching region. As an application, we provide new proofs of several h-principles in overtwisted contact 3-manifolds.</description>

      <title>An invitation to Culler-Shalen theory in arbitrary characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the seminal work of Culler and Shalen from 1983, essential surfaces in 3-manifolds are associated to ideal points of their $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-character varieties, and connections between the algebraic geometry of the character variety and the topology of the 3-manifold are established via group actions on trees. Here, we lay a general foundation for this theory in arbitrary characteristic by using the same approach instead over an arbitrary algebraically closed field. Examples include a change in the $A$-polynomial in characteristic 2, a closed Haken hyperbolic 3-manifold with no detected essential surface, and a closed Haken hyperbolic 3-manifold with an essential surface only detected in characteristic 2.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a new geometric characterization for the spine of untwisted outer space of a right-angled Artin group, constructed by Charney, Stambaugh, and Vogtmann. We realize the spine as the natural simplicial complex associated with the category of spatial cube complexes, a new class of locally CAT(0) cube complexes with a simple definition in terms of hyperplane collapses.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Congruence Subgroup Property for two families of subgroups of Mapping Class Groups of finite-type surfaces, the first one related to nilpotent quotients of the fundamental group and Johnson filtration, and the second one consisting of certain geometric subgroups obtained via subsurface inclusions.</description>

      <title>Iwip endomorphisms of free groups and fixed points of graph selfmaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a paper from 2011, Jiang, Wang and Zhang studied the fixed points and fixed subgroups of selfmaps on a connected finite graph or a connected compact hyperbolic surface $X$. In particular, for any selfmap $f: X\to X$, they proved that a certain quantity defined in terms of the characteristic $\chr(f, \F)$ and the index $\ind(f, \F)$ of a fixed point class $\F$ of $f$ is bounded below by $2\chi(X)$, where $\chi(X)$ is the Euler characteristic of $X$. In this paper, we give a sufficient condition for when equality holds and hence we partially answer a question of Jiang, by studying iwip outer endomorphisms of free groups acting on stable trees.</description>

      <title>Kirby belts, categorified projectors, and the skein lasagna module of $S^{2}\times{S^{2}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We interpret Manolescu-Neithalath's cabled Khovanov homology formula for computing Morrison-Walker-Wedrich's $\mathrm{KhR}_2$ skein lasagna module as a homotopy colimit (mapping telescope) in a completion of the category of complexes over Bar-Natan's cobordism category. Using categorified projectors, we compute the $\mathrm{KhR}_2$ skein lasagna modules of (manifold, boundary link) pairs $(S^2 \times B^2, \tilde \beta)$, where $\tilde \beta$ is a geometrically essential boundary link, identifying a relationship between the lasagna module and the Rozansky projector appearing in the Rozansky-Willis invariant for nullhomologous links in $S^2 \times S^1$. As an application, we show that the $\mathrm{KhR}_2$ skein lasagna module of $S^2 \times S^2$ is trivial, confirming a conjecture of Manolescu.</description>

      <title>Existence of arbitrary large numbers of non-$\mathbb R$-covered Anosov flows on hyperbolic $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to prove that, for every $n\in \mathbb N$, there exists a closed hyperbolic $3$-manifold $M$ which carries at least $n$ non-$\mathbb R$-covered Anosov flows, that are pairwise orbitally inequivalent. Due to a recent result by Fenley, such Anosov flows are quasi-geodesic. Hence, we get the existence of hyperbolic $3$-manifolds carrying many pairwise orbitally inequivalent quasi-geodesic Anosov flows. One of the main ingredients of our proof is a description of the clusters of lozenges that appear in the orbit spaces of the Anosov flows that we construct. The number of lozenges involved in each cluster, as well as the orientation-type of this cluster, provide powerful dynamical invariants allowing to prove that the flows are orbitally inequivalent. We believe that these dynamical invariants could be helpful in a much wider context.</description>

      <title>Exact quadratic growth for the derivatives of iterates of interval diffeomorphisms with only parabolic fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $C^2$ diffeomorphisms of a closed interval with only parabolic fixed points. We show that the maximal growth of the derivatives of the iterates of such a diffeomorphism is exactly quadratic provided it has a non-quadratical tangency to the identity at a fixed point that is topologically repelling on one side. Moreover, in absence of such fixed points, the maximal growth of the derivatives of the iterates is subquadratic.</description>

      <title>Locally approximating groups of homeomorphisms of manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact, connected manifold of positive dimension and let $\mathcal G\leq\textrm{Homeo}(M)$ be \emph{locally approximating} in the sense that for all open $U\subseteq M$ compactly contained in a single Euclidean chart of $M$, the subgroup $\mathcal G[U]$ consisting of elements of $\mathcal G$ supported in $U$ is dense in the full group of homeomorphisms supported in $U$. We prove that $\mathcal G$ interprets first order arithmetic, as well as a first order predicate that encodes membership in finitely generated subgroups of $\mathcal G$. As a consequence, we show that if $\mathcal G$ is not finitely generated, then no group elementarily equivalent to $\mathcal G$ can be finitely generated. We show that many finitely generated locally approximating groups of homeomorphisms $\mathcal G$ of a manifold are prime models of their theories, and give conditions that guarantee any finitely presented group $G$ that is elementarily equivalent to $\mathcal G$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal G$. We thus recover some results of Lasserre about the model theory of Thompson's groups $F$ and $T$. Finally, we obtain several action rigidity result for locally approximating groups of homeomorphisms. If $\mathcal G$ acts in a locally approximating way on a compact, connected manifold $M$ then the dimension of $M$ is uniquely determined by the elementary equivalence class of $\mathcal G$. Moreover, if $\dim M\leq 3$ then $M$ is uniquely determined up to homeomorphism. In for general closed smooth manifolds, the homotopy type of $M$ is uniquely determined. In this way, we obtain a generalization of a well-known result of Rubin.</description>

      <title>Modular vector fields in non-commutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a non-commutative analogue of the modular vector field on a Poisson manifold for a given pair of a double bracket and a connection on a space of 1-forms. As an application, we give an algebraic description of the framed, groupoid version of Turaev's loop operation $\mu$ similar to the one obtained by Alekseev-Kawazumi-Kuno-Naef and the author. The key ingredient for the modular vector field, the triple divergence map, is directly constructed from a connection on a linear category to deal with multiple base points.</description>
