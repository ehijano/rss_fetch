      <title>Probing Quantum Phenomena through Photoproduction in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoproduction in ultra-peripheral relativistic heavy-ion collisions displays many unique features, often involving quantum mechanical coherence and two-source interference between photon emission from the two ions. We review the recent experimental results from RHIC and the LHC and theoretical studies of coherent vector meson photoproduction, emphasizing the quantum mechanical aspects of the interactions and the entanglement between the final state particles. These studies enrich our understanding of non-local realism, underscore the critical role of the polarization of the photon source, quantum interference and nuclear effect on the gluon distribution. It paves a way for quantitatively probing the quantum nature of these high-energy nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Horizontal 1 K refrigerator with novel loading mechanism for polarized solid targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a helium evaporation refrigerator used to cool dynamically polarized proton and deuteron targets for electron-scattering experiments using the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer CLAS12 at Jefferson Lab. The geometry of the CLAS12 detector systems places severe design and construction constraints on the refrigerator and its ancillary equipment, resulting in a horizontal cryostat with a length of 4 m. The 16 cm$^3$ target samples, consisting of frozen ammonia (NH3 or ND3), are loaded at the upstream end of the cryostat and moved to the beam-interaction region using a novel transport mechanism. At this location they are cooled with superfluid helium and polarized via dynamic nuclear polarization at 1 K and 5 T. In this manner samples can be replaced and cooled to 1 K in about 30 minutes without disturbing any elements of the electron beam line or particle detection system. We estimate that this method saved 18 days of valuable beam time over the course of a recent, 88-day long experiment.</description>

      <title>Equation of state and Fermi liquid properties of dense matter based on chiral EFT interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results for the equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter obtained in many-body-perturbation theory (MBPT) up to third order, based on various chiral nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions used in ab initio calculations of nuclei. We extract equation of state properties, such as the incompressibility and the symmetry energy, and discuss estimates of the theoretical uncertainties due to neglected higher-order contributions in the MBPT expansion as well as the chiral effective field theory expansion. In addition, we discuss the Fermi liquid approach to nuclear matter and present results for the Landau parameters, effective mass, and speed of sound for pure neutron matter.</description>

      <title>Transverse-momentum-dependent pion structures from lattice QCD: Collins-Soper kernel, soft factor, TMDWF, and TMDPDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the pion valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Using correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a = 0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper (CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\perp$) between the quarks. At larger $b_\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\perp \gtrsim 1$ fm. Interestingly, we find that the $b_\perp$ dependence of the phenomenological parameterizations of TMDPDF for moderate values of $x$ are in reasonable agreement with our QCD determinations. In addition, we present results for the transverse-momentum-dependent wave function (TMDWF) for a heavier pion with 670 MeV mass.</description>

      <title>The impact of new ($\alpha$, n) reaction rates on the weak s-process in metal-poor massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive stars are significant sites for the weak s-process (ws-process). $^{22}$Ne and $^{16}$O are, respectively, the main neutron source and poison for the ws-process. In the metal-poor stars, the abundance of $^{22}$Ne is limited by the metallicity, so that the contribution of $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg reaction on the s-process is weaker. Conversely, the $^{17}$O($\alpha$, n)$^{20}$Ne reaction is more evident in more metal-poor stars due to the most abundant $^{16}$O in all metallicities. In this work, we calculate the evolution of four metal-poor models ($Z=10^{-3}$) for the Zero-Age Main-Sequence (ZAMS) masses of $M ({\rm ZAMS})=$ 15, 20, 25, and 30 M$_{\odot}$ to investigate the effect of reaction rates on the ws-process. We adopt the new $^{17}$O($\alpha$, n)$^{20}$Ne and $^{17}$O($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{21}$Ne reaction rates suggested by Wiescher et al. (2023) and $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg and $^{22}$Ne($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{26}$Mg from Best et al. (2013). The yields of the s-process isotope with updated reaction rates are compared with the results using default reaction rates from JINA REACLIB. We find that the new $^{17}$O+$\alpha$ reaction rates increase the ws-process mainly in all the stages, while the new $^{22}$Ne+$\alpha$ reaction rates only increase the ws-process in C and Ne burning stages. Updating these new reaction rates would increase the production of ws-process isotopes by tens of times. We also note that for more massive stars, the enhancement by new $^{17}$O+$\alpha$ reaction rates become more significant.</description>
