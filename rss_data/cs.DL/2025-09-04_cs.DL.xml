      <title>Charting the Future of Scholarly Knowledge with AI: A Community Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the growing availability of tools designed to support scholarly knowledge extraction and organization, many researchers still rely on manual methods, sometimes due to unfamiliarity with existing technologies or limited access to domain-adapted solutions. Meanwhile, the rapid increase in scholarly publications across disciplines has made it increasingly difficult to stay current, further underscoring the need for scalable, AI-enabled approaches to structuring and synthesizing scholarly knowledge. Various research communities have begun addressing this challenge independently, developing tools and frameworks aimed at building reliable, dynamic, and queryable scholarly knowledge bases. However, limited interaction across these communities has hindered the exchange of methods, models, and best practices, slowing progress toward more integrated solutions. This manuscript identifies ways to foster cross-disciplinary dialogue, identify shared challenges, categorize new collaboration and shape future research directions in scholarly knowledge and organization.</description>

      <title>More Parameters Than Populations: A Systematic Literature Review of Large Language Models within Survey Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Survey research has a long-standing history of being a human-powered field, but one that embraces various technologies for the collection, processing, and analysis of various behavioral, political, and social outcomes of interest, among others. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) bring new technological challenges and prerequisites in order to fully harness their potential. In this paper, we report work-in-progress on a systematic literature review based on keyword searches from multiple large-scale databases as well as citation networks that assesses how LLMs are currently being applied within the survey research process. We synthesize and organize our findings according to the survey research process to include examples of LLM usage across three broad phases: pre-data collection, data collection, and post-data collection. We discuss selected examples of potential use cases for LLMs as well as its pitfalls based on examples from existing literature. Considering survey research has rich experience and history regarding data quality, we discuss some opportunities and describe future outlooks for survey research to contribute to the continued development and refinement of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Coverage and metadata completeness and accuracy of African research publications in OpenAlex: A comparative analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike traditional proprietary data sources such as Scopus and the Web of Science (WoS), OpenAlex emphasizes its comprehensiveness. This study analyzes OpenAlex coverage and metadata completeness and accuracy of African research publications. To achieve this, OpenAlex is compared with Scopus, WoS, and African Journals Online (AJOL). First, we examine the coverage of African research publications in OpenAlex relative to Scopus, WoS, and AJOL. Then, we assess and compare the availability and accuracy of metadata in OpenAlex, Scopus, and WoS. The findings indicate that OpenAlex offers the most extensive publication coverage. In terms of metadata, OpenAlex provides high coverage for publication and author information, though its coverage of affiliations, references, and funder information is comparatively lower. Metadata accuracy is similarly high for publication and author fields, while affiliation, reference, and funding information show higher rates of missing or incomplete data. Notably, the results demonstrate that both metadata availability and accuracy in OpenAlex improve significantly for publications also indexed in Scopus and WoS. These findings suggest that OpenAlex has the potential to replace proprietary data sources for certain types of analyses. However, for some metadata fields, there remains a trade-off between extensiveness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Impact of Basic Scientists during Applied Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite broad acclaim for basic research, science is undergoing an applied shift that marginalizes basic scientists. This gap reflects an incomplete understanding of their distinctive roles, which prevents translating philosophical appreciation into effective support. We introduce a scalable metric--the application score--to position research along the basic-applied spectrum and apply it to 62 million publications (1970-2023) to reveal the distinctive contributions of basic scientists. We find a structural asymmetry: involvement of basic scientists substantially increases citation impact, even more so in applied contexts, while applied scientists show no such effect in basic domains. This asymmetric effect arises from their intellectual leadership in conceptualization, writing, and experimental design, amplified in large, multidisciplinary, and intermediate career teams. Yet basic scientists remain concentrated in historically prestigious institutions, while new entrants shift toward applied work, indicating critical undersupply. These findings provide large-scale evidence for the indispensable role of basic scientists, guiding policy and institutional strategy to sustain the foundations of discovery and innovation.</description>
