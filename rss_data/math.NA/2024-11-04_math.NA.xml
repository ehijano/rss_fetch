      <title>Noise Guided Structural Learning from Observing Stochastic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an innovative learning framework that incorporate the noise structure to infer the governing equations from observation of trajectory data generated by stochastic dynamics. Our approach can proficiently captures both the noise and the drift terms. Furthermore, it can also accommodate a wide range of noise types, including correlated and state-dependent variations. Moreover, our method demonstrates scalability to high-dimensional systems. Through extensive numerical experiments, we showcase the exceptional performance of our learning algorithm in accurately reconstructing the underlying stochastic dynamics.</description>

      <title>An $hp$-adaptive discontinuous Galerkin discretization of a static anti-plane shear crack model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an $hp$-adaptive discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (DGFEM) to approximate the solution of a static crack boundary value problem. The mathematical model describes the behavior of a geometrically linear strain-limiting elastic body. The compatibility condition for the physical variables, along with a specific algebraically nonlinear constitutive relationship, leads to a second-order quasi-linear elliptic boundary value problem. We demonstrate the existence of a unique discrete solution using Ritz representation theory across the entire range of modeling parameters. Additionally, we derive a priori error estimates for the DGFEM, which are computable and, importantly, expressed in terms of natural energy and $L^2$-norms. Numerical examples showcase the performance of the proposed method in the context of a manufactured solution and a non-convex domain containing an edge crack.</description>

      <title>A faster multipole Legendre-Chebyshev transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a fast algorithm for transforming Legendre coefficients into Chebyshev coefficients, and vice versa. The algorithm is based on the fast multipole method and is similar to the approach described by Alpert and Rokhlin [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 12 (1991)]. The main difference is that we utilise a modal Galerkin approach with Chebyshev basis functions instead of a nodal approach with a Lagrange basis. Part of the algorithm is a novel method that facilitates faster spreading of intermediate results through neighbouring levels of hierarchical matrices. This enhancement leads to a method that is approximately 20% faster to execute, due to less floating point operations. We also describe an efficient initialization algorithm that for the Lagrange basis is roughly 5 times faster than the original method for large input arrays. The described method has both a planning and execution stage that asymptotically require O(N) flops. The algorithm is simple enough that it can be implemented in 100 lines of vectorized Python code. Moreover, its efficiency is such that a single-threaded C implementation can transform 1000,000 coefficients in approximately 20 milliseconds on a new MacBook Pro M3, representing about 3 times the execution time of a well-planned (single-threaded) type 2 discrete cosine transform from FFTW (www.fftw.org). Planning for the 1000,000 coefficients requires approximately 50 milliseconds.</description>

      <title>P$^2$C$^2$Net: PDE-Preserved Coarse Correction Network for efficient prediction of spatiotemporal dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When solving partial differential equations (PDEs), classical numerical methods often require fine mesh grids and small time stepping to meet stability, consistency, and convergence conditions, leading to high computational cost. Recently, machine learning has been increasingly utilized to solve PDE problems, but they often encounter challenges related to interpretability, generalizability, and strong dependency on rich labeled data. Hence, we introduce a new PDE-Preserved Coarse Correction Network (P$^2$C$^2$Net) to efficiently solve spatiotemporal PDE problems on coarse mesh grids in small data regimes. The model consists of two synergistic modules: (1) a trainable PDE block that learns to update the coarse solution (i.e., the system state), based on a high-order numerical scheme with boundary condition encoding, and (2) a neural network block that consistently corrects the solution on the fly. In particular, we propose a learnable symmetric Conv filter, with weights shared over the entire model, to accurately estimate the spatial derivatives of PDE based on the neural-corrected system state. The resulting physics-encoded model is capable of handling limited training data (e.g., 3--5 trajectories) and accelerates the prediction of PDE solutions on coarse spatiotemporal grids while maintaining a high accuracy. P$^2$C$^2$Net achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance with over 50\% gain (e.g., in terms of relative prediction error) across four datasets covering complex reaction-diffusion processes and turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansions for approximate solutions of boundary integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper uses the Modified Projection Method to examine the errors in solving the boundary integral equation from Laplace equation. The analysis uses weighted norms, and parallel algorithms help solve the independent linear systems. By applying the method developed by Kulkarni, the study shows how the approximate solution behaves in polygonal domains. It also explores computational techniques using the double layer potential kernel to solve Laplace equation in these domains. The iterated Galerkin method provides an approximation of order 2r+2 in smooth domains. However, the corners in polygonal domains cause singularities that reduce the accuracy. Adjusting the mesh near these corners can almost restore accuracy when the error is measured using the uniform norm. This paper builds on the work of Rude et al. By using modified operator suggested by Kulkarni, superconvergence in iterated solutions is observed. This leads to an asymptotic error expansion, with the leading term being $O(h^4)$ and the remaining error term $O(h^6)$, resulting in a method with similar accuracy.</description>

      <title>Active flux methods for hyperbolic conservation laws -- flux vector splitting and bound-preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00065v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The active flux (AF) method is a compact high-order finite volume method that simultaneously evolves cell averages and point values at cell interfaces. Within the method of lines framework, the existing Jacobian splitting-based point value update incorporates the upwind idea but suffers from a stagnation issue for nonlinear problems due to inaccurate estimation of the upwind direction, and also from a mesh alignment issue partially resulting from decoupled point value updates. This paper proposes to use flux vector splitting for the point value update, offering a natural and uniform remedy to those two issues. To improve robustness, this paper also develops bound-preserving (BP) AF methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. Two cases are considered: preservation of the maximum principle for the scalar case, and preservation of positive density and pressure for the compressible Euler equations. The update of the cell average is rewritten as a convex combination of the original high-order fluxes and robust low-order (local Lax-Friedrichs or Rusanov) fluxes, and the desired bounds are enforced by choosing the right amount of low-order fluxes. A similar blending strategy is used for the point value update. In addition, a shock sensor-based limiting is proposed to enhance the convex limiting for the cell average, which can suppress oscillations well. Several challenging tests are conducted to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the BP AF methods, including flow past a forward-facing step and high Mach number jets.</description>

      <title>FPRev: Revealing the Order of Floating-Point Summation by Numerical Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The order of floating-point summation is a key factor in numerical reproducibility. However, this critical information is generally unspecified and unknown for most summation-based functions in numerical libraries, making it challenging to migrate them to new environments reproducibly. This paper presents novel, non-intrusive, testing-based algorithms that can reveal the order of floating-point summation by treating functions as callable black boxes. By constructing well-designed input that can cause the swamping phenomenon of floating-point addition, we can infer the order of summation from the output. We introduce FPRev, a tool that implements these algorithms, and validate its efficiency through extensive experiments with popular numerical libraries on various CPUs and GPUs (including those with Tensor Cores). FPRev reveals the varying summation orders across different libraries and devices, and outperforms other methods in terms of time complexity. The source code of FPRev is at \url{https://github.com/microsoft/RepDL/tree/main/tools/FPRev}.</description>

      <title>The learned range test method for the inverse inclusion problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem consisting of the reconstruction of an inclusion $B$ contained in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ from a single pair of Cauchy data $(u|_{\partial\Omega},\partial_\nu u|_{\partial\Omega})$, where $\Delta u=0$ in $\Omega\setminus\overline B$ and $u=0$ on $\partial B$. We show that the reconstruction algorithm based on the range test, a domain sampling method, can be written as a neural network with a specific architecture. We propose to learn the weights of this network in the framework of supervised learning, and to combine it with a pre-trained classifier, with the purpose of distinguishing the inclusions based on their distance from the boundary. The numerical simulations show that this learned range test method provides accurate and stable reconstructions of polygonal inclusions. Furthermore, the results are superior to those obtained with the standard range test method (without learning) and with an end-to-end fully connected deep neural network, a purely data-driven method.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Polynomials with Their Computational Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the effectiveness of two polynomial methods in solving non-linear time and space fractional partial differential equations. We first outline the general methodology and then apply it to five distinct experiments. The proposed method, noted for its simplicity, demonstrates a high degree of accuracy. Comparative analysis with existing techniques reveals that our approach yields more precise solutions. The results, presented through graphs and tables, indicate that He's and Daftardar-Jafari polynomials significantly enhance accuracy. Additionally, we provide an in-depth discussion on the computational costs associated with these polynomials. Due to its straightforward implementation, the proposed method can be extended for application to a broader range of problems.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport Scheme for the 3D Incompressible Semi-Geostrophic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a mesh-free three-dimensional (3D) numerical scheme for solving the incompressible semi-geostrophic equations, based on semi-discrete optimal transport techniques. These results generalise previous two-dimensional (2D) implementations. The optimal transport methods we adopt are known for their structural preservation and energy conservation qualities and achieve an excellent level of efficiency and numerical energy-conservation. We use this scheme to generate numerical simulations of an important benchmark problem. To our knowledge, this is the first fully 3D simulation of this particular cyclone, evidencing the model's applicability to atmospheric and oceanic phenomena and offering a novel, robust tool for meteorological and oceanographic modelling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a family of conforming space-time discretizations for the wave equation based on a first-order-in-time formulation employing maximal regularity splines. In contrast with second-order-in-time formulations, which require a CFL condition to guarantee stability, the methods we consider here are unconditionally stable without the need for stabilization terms. Along the lines of the work by M. Ferrari and S. Fraschini (2024), we address the stability analysis by studying the properties of the condition number of a family of matrices associated with the time discretization. Numerical tests validate the performance of the method.</description>

      <title>Why do we regularise in every iteration for imaging inverse problems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regularisation is commonly used in iterative methods for solving imaging inverse problems. Many algorithms involve the evaluation of the proximal operator of the regularisation term in every iteration, leading to a significant computational overhead since such evaluation can be costly. In this context, the ProxSkip algorithm, recently proposed for federated learning purposes, emerges as an solution. It randomly skips regularisation steps, reducing the computational time of an iterative algorithm without affecting its convergence. Here we explore for the first time the efficacy of ProxSkip to a variety of imaging inverse problems and we also propose a novel PDHGSkip version. Extensive numerical results highlight the potential of these methods to accelerate computations while maintaining high-quality reconstructions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a multi-criteria classification of Vocational and Educational Programs in Extremadura (Spain) during the period 2009-2016. This ranking has been carried out through the integration into a complete database of the detailed information of individuals finishing such studies together with their labor data. The multicriteria method used is TOPSIS together with a new decision support method for assessing the influence of each criterion and its dependence on the weights assigned to them. This new method is based on a worst-best case scenario analysis and it is compared to a well known global sensitivity analysis technique based on the Pearson's correlation ratio.</description>

      <title>Simulating incompressible flows over complex geometries using the shifted boundary method with incomplete adaptive octree meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the shifted boundary method (SBM) to the simulation of incompressible fluid flow using immersed octree meshes. Previous work on SBM for fluid flow primarily utilized two- or three-dimensional unstructured tetrahedral grids. Recently, octree grids have become an essential component of immersed CFD solvers, and this work addresses this gap and the associated computational challenges. We leverage an optimal (approximate) surrogate boundary constructed efficiently on incomplete and adaptive octree meshes. The resulting framework enables the simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in complex geometries without requiring boundary-fitted grids. Simulations of benchmark tests in two and three dimensions demonstrate that the Octree-SBM framework is a robust, accurate, and efficient approach to simulating fluid dynamics problems with complex geometries.</description>

      <title>MBExplainer: Multilevel bandit-based explanations for downstream models with augmented graph embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many industrial applications, it is common that the graph embeddings generated from training GNNs are used in an ensemble model where the embeddings are combined with other tabular features (e.g., original node or edge features) in a downstream ML task. The tabular features may even arise naturally if, e.g., one tries to build a graph such that some of the node or edge features are stored in a tabular format. Here we address the problem of explaining the output of such ensemble models for which the input features consist of learned neural graph embeddings combined with additional tabular features. We propose MBExplainer, a model-agnostic explanation approach for downstream models with augmented graph embeddings. MBExplainer returns a human-legible triple as an explanation for an instance prediction of the whole pipeline consisting of three components: a subgraph with the highest importance, the topmost important nodal features, and the topmost important augmented downstream features. A game-theoretic formulation is used to take the contributions of each component and their interactions into account by assigning three Shapley values corresponding to their own specific games. Finding the explanation requires an efficient search through the corresponding local search spaces corresponding to each component. MBExplainer applies a novel multilevel search algorithm that enables simultaneous pruning of local search spaces in a computationally tractable way. In particular, three interweaved Monte Carlo Tree Search are utilized to iteratively prune the local search spaces. MBExplainer also includes a global search algorithm that uses contextual bandits to efficiently allocate pruning budget among the local search spaces. We show the effectiveness of MBExplainer by presenting a set of comprehensive numerical examples on multiple public graph datasets for both node and graph classification tasks.</description>

      <title>On the required number of electrodes for uniqueness and convex reformulation in an inverse coefficient problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a computer-assisted proof for uniqueness and global reconstruction for the inverse Robin transmission problem, where the corrosion function on the boundary of an interior object is to be determined from current-voltage measurements on the boundary of an outer domain. We consider the shunt electrode model where, in contrast to the standard Neumann boundary condition, the applied electrical current is only partially known. The aim is to determine the corrosion coefficient with a finite number of measurements.
  In this paper, we present a numerically verifiable criterion that ensures unique solvability of the inverse problem, given a desired resolution. This allows us to explicitly determine the required number and position of the required electrodes. Furthermore, we will present an error estimate for noisy data. By rewriting the problem as a convex optimisation problem, our aim is to develop a globally convergent reconstruction algorithm.</description>

      <title>Solving Semi-Linear Elliptic Optimal Control Problems with $L^1$-Cost via Regularization and RAS-Preconditioned Newton Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new parallel computational framework for the efficient solution of a class of $L^2$/$L^1$-regularized optimal control problems governed by semi-linear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs). The main difficulty in solving this type of problem is the nonlinearity and non-smoothness of the $L^1$-term in the cost functional, which we address by employing a combination of several tools. First, we approximate the non-differentiable projection operator appearing in the optimality system by an appropriately chosen regularized operator and establish convergence of the resulting system's solutions. Second, we apply a continuation strategy to control the regularization parameter to improve the behavior of (damped) Newton methods. Third, we combine Newton's method with a domain-decomposition-based nonlinear preconditioning, which improves its robustness properties and allows for parallelization. The efficiency of the proposed numerical framework is demonstrated by extensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Fast Spectrum Estimation of Some Kernel Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In data science, individual observations are often assumed to come independently from an underlying probability space. Kernel matrices formed from large sets of such observations arise frequently, for example during classification tasks. It is desirable to know the eigenvalue decay properties of these matrices without explicitly forming them, such as when determining if a low-rank approximation is feasible. In this work, we introduce a new eigenvalue quantile estimation framework for some kernel matrices. This framework gives meaningful bounds for all the eigenvalues of a kernel matrix while avoiding the cost of constructing the full matrix. The kernel matrices under consideration come from a kernel with quick decay away from the diagonal applied to uniformly-distributed sets of points in Euclidean space of any dimension. We prove the efficacy of this framework given certain bounds on the kernel function, and we provide empirical evidence for its accuracy. In the process, we also prove a very general interlacing-type theorem for finite sets of numbers. Additionally, we indicate an application of this framework to the study of the intrinsic dimension of data, as well as several other directions in which to generalize this work.</description>

      <title>Monte-Carlo/Moments micro-macro Parareal method for unimodal and bimodal scalar McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a micro-macro parallel-in-time Parareal method for scalar McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In the algorithm, the fine Parareal propagator is a Monte Carlo simulation of an ensemble of particles, while an approximate ordinary differential equation (ODE) description of the mean and the variance of the particle distribution is used as a coarse Parareal propagator to achieve speedup. We analyse the convergence behaviour of our method for a linear problem and provide numerical experiments indicating the parallel weak scaling of the algorithm on a set of examples. We show, with numerical experiments, that convergence typically takes place in a low number of iterations, depending on the quality of the ODE predictor. For bimodal SDEs, we avoid quality deterioration of the coarse predictor (compared to unimodal SDEs) through the usage of multiple ODEs, each describing the mean and variance of the particle distribution in locally unimodal regions of the phase space. The benefit of the proposed algorithm can be viewed through two lenses: (i) through the parallel-in-time lens, speedup is obtained through the use of a very cheap coarse integrator (an ODE moment model), and (ii) through the moment models lens, accuracy is iteratively gained through the use of parallel machinery as a corrector. In contrast to the isolated use of a moment model, the proposed method (iteratively) converges to the true distribution generated by the SDE.</description>

Abstract: The paper addresses the challenge of constructing conforming finite element spaces for the curl div operator in three dimensions. Tangential-normal continuity is introduced in order to develop distributional finite element curl div complexes. The spaces constructed are applied to discretize the quad curl problem, demonstrating optimal order of convergence. Furthermore, a hybridization technique is proposed, demonstrating its equivalence to nonconforming finite elements and weak Galerkin methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the micro-macro Parareal algorithm for the simulation of initial-value problems. In this algorithm, a coarse (fast) solver is applied sequentially over the time domain, and a fine (time-consuming) solver is applied as a corrector in parallel over smaller chunks of the time interval. Moreover, the coarse solver acts on a reduced state variable, which is coupled to the fine state variable through appropriate coupling operators. We first provide a contribution to the convergence analysis of the micro-macro Parareal method for multiscale linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Then, we extend a variant of the micro-macro Parareal algorithm for scalar stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to higher-dimensional SDEs.</description>

      <title>Tensor neural networks for high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve high-dimensional steady-state Fokker-Planck equations on the whole space by applying tensor neural networks. The tensor networks are a linear combination of tensor products of one-dimensional feedforward networks or a linear combination of several selected radial basis functions. The use of tensor feedforward networks allows us to efficiently exploit auto-differentiation (in physical variables) in major Python packages while using radial basis functions can fully avoid auto-differentiation, which is rather expensive in high dimensions. We then use the physics-informed neural networks and stochastic gradient descent methods to learn the tensor networks. One essential step is to determine a proper bounded domain or numerical support for the Fokker-Planck equation. To better train the tensor radial basis function networks, we impose some constraints on parameters, which lead to relatively high accuracy. We demonstrate numerically that the tensor neural networks in physics-informed machine learning are efficient for steady-state Fokker-Planck equations from two to ten dimensions.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with the application of probabilistic time integration methods to semi-explicit partial differential-algebraic equations of parabolic type and its semi-discrete counterparts, namely semi-explicit differential-algebraic equations of index 2. The proposed methods iteratively construct a probability distribution over the solution of deterministic problems, enhancing the information obtained from the numerical simulation. Within this paper, we examine the efficacy of the randomized versions of the implicit Euler method, the midpoint scheme, and exponential integrators of first and second order. By demonstrating the consistency and convergence properties of these solvers, we illustrate their utility in capturing the sensitivity of the solution to numerical errors. Our analysis establishes the theoretical validity of randomized time integration for constrained systems and offers insights into the calibration of probabilistic integrators for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Distinct Numerical Solutions for Elliptic Cross-Interface Problems Using Finite Element and Finite Difference Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the second-order finite element method (FEM) and finite difference method (FDM) for numerically solving elliptic cross-interface problems characterized by vertical and horizontal straight lines, piecewise constant coefficients, two homogeneous jump conditions, continuous source terms, and Dirichlet boundary conditions. For brevity, we consider a 2D simplified version where the intersection points of the interface lines coincide with grid points in uniform Cartesian grids. Our findings reveal interesting and important results: (1) When the coefficient functions exhibit either high jumps with low-frequency oscillations or low jumps with high-frequency oscillations, the finite element method and finite difference method yield similar numerical solutions. (2) However, when the interface problems involve high-contrast and high-frequency coefficient functions, the numerical solutions obtained from the finite element and finite difference methods differ significantly. Given that the widely studied SPE10 benchmark problem (see https://www.spe.org/web/csp/datasets/set02.htm) typically involves high-contrast and high-frequency permeability due to varying geological layers in porous media, this phenomenon warrants attention. Furthermore, this observation is particularly important for developing multiscale methods, as reference solutions for these methods are usually obtained using the standard second-order finite element method with a fine mesh, and analytical solutions are not available. We provide sufficient details to enable replication of our numerical results, and the implementation is straightforward. This simplicity ensures that readers can easily confirm the validity of our findings.</description>

      <title>DiffusionPDE: Generative PDE-Solving Under Partial Observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using generative diffusion models. In particular, we focus on the scenarios where we do not have the full knowledge of the scene necessary to apply classical solvers. Most existing forward or inverse PDE approaches perform poorly when the observations on the data or the underlying coefficients are incomplete, which is a common assumption for real-world measurements. In this work, we propose DiffusionPDE that can simultaneously fill in the missing information and solve a PDE by modeling the joint distribution of the solution and coefficient spaces. We show that the learned generative priors lead to a versatile framework for accurately solving a wide range of PDEs under partial observation, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for both forward and inverse directions.</description>

Abstract: The block tensor of trifocal tensors provides crucial geometric information on the three-view geometry of a scene. The underlying synchronization problem seeks to recover camera poses (locations and orientations up to a global transformation) from the block trifocal tensor. We establish an explicit Tucker factorization of this tensor, revealing a low multilinear rank of $(6,4,4)$ independent of the number of cameras under appropriate scaling conditions. We prove that this rank constraint provides sufficient information for camera recovery in the noiseless case. The constraint motivates a synchronization algorithm based on the higher-order singular value decomposition of the block trifocal tensor. Experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art global synchronization methods on real datasets demonstrate the potential of this algorithm for significantly improving location estimation accuracy. Overall this work suggests that higher-order interactions in synchronization problems can be exploited to improve performance, beyond the usual pairwise-based approaches.</description>
