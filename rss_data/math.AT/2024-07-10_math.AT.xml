      <title>Diagrammatic sets as a model of homotopy types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagrammatic sets are presheaves on a rich category of shapes, whose definition is motivated by combinatorial topology and higher-dimensional diagram rewriting. These shapes include representatives of oriented simplices, cubes, and positive opetopes, and are stable under operations including Gray products, joins, suspensions, and duals. We exhibit a cofibrantly generated model structure on diagrammatic sets, as well as two separate Quillen equivalences with the classical model structure on simplicial sets. We construct explicit sets of generating cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations, and prove that the model structure is monoidal with the Gray product of diagrammatic sets.</description>

      <title>Hilali conjecture and complex algebraic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simply connected topological space is called \emph{rationally elliptic} if the rank of its total homotopy group and its total (co)homology group are both finite. A well-known Hilali conjecture claims that for a rationally elliptic space its homotopy rank \emph{does not exceed} its (co)homology rank. In this paper, after recalling some well-known fundamental properties of a rationally elliptic space and giving some important examples of rationally elliptic spaces and rationally elliptic singular complex algebraic varieties for which the Hilali conjecture holds, we give some revised formulas and some conjectures. We also discuss some topics such as mixd Hodge polynomials defined via mixed Hodge structures on cohomology group and the dual of the homotopy group, related to the ``Hilali conjecture \emph{modulo product}", which is an inequality between the usual homological Poincar\'e polynomial and the homotopical Poincar\'e polynomial.</description>

      <title>Global spaces and the homotopy theory of stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06877v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the $\infty$-category of global spaces is equivalent to the homotopy localization of the $\infty$-category of sheaves on the site of separated differentiable stacks, following a philosophy proposed by Gepner-Henriques. We further prove that this $\infty$-category of sheaves is a cohesive $\infty$-topos and that it fully faithfully contains the singular-cohesive $\infty$-topos of Sati-Schreiber.</description>

      <title>On fundamental groups of spaces of (framed) embeddings of the circle in 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06923v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent results on diffeomorphisms, this paper investigates fundamental groups of spaces of embeddings of $S^1$ and $S^1\times D^3$ in 4-manifolds. We express the latter (framed) case in terms of the former, and study examples of the form $M\# S^1\times S^3$ in detail.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Rank Invariant: M\"obius invertibility, Discriminating Power, and Connection to Other Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11591v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In addition to inherent computational challenges, the absence of a canonical method for quantifying `persistence' in multi-parameter persistent homology remains a hurdle in its application.
  One of the best known quantifications of persistence for multi-parameter persistent homology is the rank invariant, which has recently evolved into the generalized rank invariant (GRI) by naturally extending its domain. This extension enables us to quantify persistence across a broader range of regions in the indexing poset compared to the rank invariant. However, the size of the domain of the GRI is generally formidable, making it desirable to restrict its domain to a more manageable subset for computational purposes. The foremost questions regarding such a restriction of the domain are: (1) How to restrict, if possible, the domain of the GRI without any loss of information? (2) When can we more compactly encode the GRI as a `persistence diagram'? (3) What is the trade-off between computational efficiency and the discriminating power of the GRI as the amount of the restriction on the domain varies? (4) What proxies exist for persistence diagrams in the multi-parameter setting that can be derived from the GRI? To address the first three questions, we generalize and axiomatize the classic fundamental lemma of persistent homology via the notion of M\"obius invertibility of the GRI which we propose. This extension also contextualizes known results regarding the (generalized) rank invariant within the classical theory of M\"obius inversion. We conduct a comprehensive comparison between M\"obius invertibility and other existing concepts related to the structural simplicity of persistence modules.
  We address the fourth question through the notion of motivic invariants. We demonstrate that many invariants from the literature can be both derived from the GRI and recast as motivic invariants.</description>

      <title>Gerstenhaber-Schack Bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17771v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $\textbf{Gerstenhaber-Schack bialgebra}$ (GSb) consists of a graded Hopf algebra $A$ together with three multilinear operations $\{\omega^{n,m}\in Hom^{3-m-n}(A^{\otimes m},A^{\otimes n}) :m+n=4\}$ whose sum is a $2$-cocycle in the Gerstenhaber-Schack (G-S) complex of $A$. A $\textbf{G-S extension}$ of $A$ is a GSb containing it. G-S extensions of $A$ are classified up to isomorphism by the degree -1 component of the G-S cohomology group $H_{GS}^{2}(A;A)$. We exhibit a space $X$ and a non-trivial topologically induced GSb structure on $H^{\ast}\left( \Omega X;\mathbb{Z}_{2}\right) .$</description>

      <title>A Model Categoric Equivalence for Crossed Simplicial Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using coinduction and restriction functors, we show that the category of simplicial $\Bbbk$-vector spaces and the category of $\Bbbk$-representations of a crossed simplicial group are equivalent after inverting homotopy equivalences. We do this by first showing that the homotopical version of the original Dold-Kan equivalence is implemented by an adjoint pair of coinduction and restriction functors after a suitable homotopy localization. Finally, we rewrite our equivalence for crossed simplicial objects as a model categorical equivalence.</description>

      <title>The surjection property and computable type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a detailed study of two properties of spaces and pairs of spaces, the surjection property and the epsilon-surjection property, that were recently introduced to characterize the notion of computable type arising from computability theory. For a class of spaces including the finite simplicial complexes, we develop techniques to prove or disprove these properties using homotopy and homology theories, and give applications of these results. In particular, we answer an open question on the computable type property, showing that it is not preserved by taking products. We also observe that computable type is decidable for finite simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Persistence Diagram Estimation of Multivariate Piecewise H\"older-continuous Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To our knowledge, the analysis of convergence rates for persistence diagram estimation from noisy signals had predominantly relied on lifting signal estimation results through sup norm (or other functional norm) stability theorems. We believe that moving forward from this approach can lead to considerable gains. We illustrate it in the setting of Gaussian white noise model. We examine from a minimax perspective, the inference of persistence diagram (for sublevel sets filtration). We show that for piecewise H\"older-continuous functions, with control over the reach of the discontinuities set, taking the persistence diagram coming from a simple histogram estimator of the signal, permit to achieve the minimax rates known for H\"older-continuous functions.</description>
