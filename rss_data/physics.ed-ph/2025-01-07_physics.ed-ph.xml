      <title>Visualizing beat phenomenon between two amplitude-modulated (AM) light beams on a solar cell using smartphones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new simple experimental setup for demonstrating beat phenomenon. We have combined two amplitude-modulated light beams on a solar cell using two smartphones as signal generators and a third smartphone as an oscilloscope to visualize the resulting wave beats. A very good agreement is obtained between the theoretical model and the experimental result. It is an innovative approach to bring physics experimentation to the students and discover the potential possibilities of smartphones in basic physics courses.</description>

      <title>A very low-current electromagnetic induction experiment enhanced by acoustic means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have created a simple, portable, low-cost setup allowing the students and teachers to experiment with and discuss electromagnetic induction in a safe way, using low currents. The simplicity and portability make these activities well suited for experiments outside of the classroom, which is particularly welcome for distance learning. The setup consists of two smartphones used as signal generators, a small coil, two loudspeakers connected to the coil and a third smartphone used as an oscilloscope. We have no doubt that simple, low cost, portable experiments using engaging elements such as smartphones, sound, and music, will be attractive for secondary school and first-year university physics courses.</description>

      <title>Using a remote control to determine the infrared absorption coefficient in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a simple and low cost experiment designed to determine the infrared water absorption coefficient. We used a TV remote control as a point source of infrared light. The intensity after passing the light through different heights of a water column is measured with a solar cell connected to a speaker. The recorded signal, captured with a smartphone sound recorder, provides a practical demonstration of the Beer Lambert law. The collected data were fitted to the theoretical model, obtaining a very good agreement between the value of the water absorption coefficient obtained experimentally and that reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Physics, Environment and Environmental Education; Perceptions from trainee Natural Science teachers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental Education (EE) is vital for shaping citizens who understand and value sustainability as an epistemological and practical alternative to mitigate current environmental issues. This research was prompted by the exploration of the relationship between EE and the physical sciences, connections that are often overlooked in curriculums and in the teaching processes of both this science and EE. It is essential to emphasize that physics provides conceptual frameworks and methodological tools that can enhance the understanding of environmental phenomena from a broad and multidimensional perspective. To delve into these connections, a study with a hermeneutic interpretative nuance was conducted. Through a questionnaire, the perceptions of prospective teachers in the natural sciences field regarding this topic were gathered. The findings revealed that a significant number of them recognize and value the correlation between physics and EE. From their perspective, this linkage is not only crucial for a comprehensive view of environmental dynamics but also to encourage students to develop critical, articulated, and well-founded thinking about environmental balance. The research also highlighted the didactic opportunities presented when intertwining physics with EE. By associating physical concepts with real environmental issues, learning can be reinforced, making it meaningful and enduring over time. This interdisciplinary fusion also holds the potential to increase students' motivation and interest, fostering a more active and engaged attitude in their educational journey</description>
