      <title>When to compute in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacecraft increasingly rely on heterogeneous computing resources spanning onboard flight computers, orbital data centers, ground station edge nodes, and terrestrial cloud infrastructure. Selecting where a workload should execute is a nontrivial multi objective problem driven by latency, reliability, power, communication constraints, cost, and regulatory feasibility. This paper introduces a quantitative optimization framework that formalizes compute location selection through empirically measurable metrics, normalized scoring, feasibility constraints, and a unified utility function designed to operate under incomplete information. We evaluate the model on two representative workloads demonstrating how the framework compares compute tiers and identifies preferred deployment locations. The approach provides a structured, extensible method for mission designers to reason about compute placement in emerging space architectures.</description>

      <title>Flux-Preserving Adaptive Finite State Projection for Multiscale Stochastic Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Finite State Projection (FSP) method approximates the Chemical Master Equation (CME) by restricting the dynamics to a finite subset of the (typically infinite) state space, enabling direct numerical solution with computable error bounds. Adaptive variants update this subset in time, but multiscale systems with widely separated reaction rates remain challenging, as low-probability bottleneck states can carry essential probability flux and the dynamics alternate between fast transients and slowly evolving stiff regimes. We propose a flux-based adaptive FSP method that uses probability flux to drive both state-space pruning and time-step selection. The pruning rule protects low-probability states with large outgoing flux, preserving connectivity in bottleneck systems, while the time-step rule adapts to the instantaneous total flux to handle rate constants spanning several orders of magnitude. Numerical experiments on stiff, oscillatory, and bottleneck reaction networks show that the method maintains accuracy while using substantially smaller state spaces.</description>

      <title>A Parametric Framework for Anticipatory Flashflood Warning: Integrating Landscape Vulnerability with Precipitation Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flash flood warnings are largely reactive, providing limited advance notice for evacuation planning and resource prepositioning. This study presents and validates an anticipatory, parametric framework that converts landscape vulnerability and precipitation into transparent, zone-aware threat levels at neighborhood scales. We first derive an inherent hazard likelihood (IHL) surface using pluvial flood depth, height above nearest drainage, and distance to streams. Next, we compute a hazard severity index (HSI) by normalizing 24-hour rainfall against local Atlas-14 100-year, 24-hour depths. We then integrate IHL and HSI within a localized threat severity (LTS) matrix using 20 class-specific triggers, requiring lower exceedance in high-risk terrain and higher exceedance in uplands. Applied to two Texas flood events, the LTS exhibits statistically significant spatial association with independent crowdsourced impact proxies, capturing observed disruption hotspots. The framework is computationally lightweight, scalable, and extends actionable situational awareness into a 48-72 hour anticipatory window, supporting pre-event decision-making by emergency managers.</description>

      <title>Structure-Aware Antibody Design with Affinity-Optimized Inverse Folding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: The clinical efficacy of antibody therapeutics critically depends on high-affinity target engagement, yet laboratory affinity-maturation campaigns are slow and costly. In computational settings, most protein language models (PLMs) are not trained to favor high-affinity antibodies, and existing preference optimization approaches introduce substantial computational overhead without clear affinity gains. Therefore, this work proposes SimBinder-IF, which converts the inverse folding model ESM-IF into an antibody sequence generator by freezing its structure encoder and training only its decoder to prefer experimentally stronger binders through preference optimization.
  Results: On the 11-assay AbBiBench benchmark, SimBinder-IF achieves a 55 percent relative improvement in mean Spearman correlation between log-likelihood scores and experimentally measured binding affinity compared to vanilla ESM-IF (from 0.264 to 0.410). In zero-shot generalization across four unseen antigen-antibody complexes, the correlation improves by 156 percent (from 0.115 to 0.294). SimBinder-IF also outperforms baselines in top-10 precision for ten-fold or greater affinity improvements. A case study redesigning antibody F045-092 for A/California/04/2009 (pdmH1N1) shows that SimBinder-IF proposes variants with substantially lower predicted binding free energy changes than ESM-IF (mean Delta Delta G -75.16 vs -46.57). Notably, SimBinder-IF trains only about 18 percent of the parameters of the full ESM-IF model, highlighting its parameter efficiency for high-affinity antibody generation.</description>

      <title>NeuRehab: A Reinforcement Learning and Spiking Neural Network-Based Rehab Automation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in robotic rehabilitation therapy have provided modular exercise systems for post-stroke muscle recovery with basic control schemes. But these systems struggle to adapt to patients' complex and ever-changing behaviour, and to operate within mobile settings, such as heat and power. To aid this, we present NeuRehab: an end-to-end framework consisting of a training and inference pipeline with AI-based automation, co-designed with neuromorphic computing-based control systems that balance action performance, power consumption, and observed latency. The framework consists of 2 partitions. One is designated for the rehabilitation device based on ultra-low power spiking networks deployed on dedicated neuromorphic hardware. The other resides on stationary hardware that can accommodate computationally intensive hardware for fine-tuning on a per-patient basis. By maintaining a communication channel between both the modules and splitting the algorithm components, the power and latency requirements of the movable system have been optimised, while retaining the learning performance advantages of compute- and power-hungry hardware on the stationary machine. As part of the framework, we propose (a) the split machine learning processes for efficiency in architectural utilisation, and (b) task-specific temporal optimisations to lower edge-inference control latency. This paper evaluates the proposed methods on a reference stepper motor-based shoulder exercise. Overall, these methods offer comparable performance uplifts over the State-of-the-art for neuromorphic deployment, while achieving over 60% savings in both power and latency during inference compared to standard implementations.</description>

      <title>Modelling financial time series with $\phi^{4}$ quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a $\phi^{4}$ quantum field theory with inhomogeneous couplings and explicit symmetry-breaking to model an ensemble of financial time series from the S$\&amp;$P 500 index. The continuum nature of the $\phi^4$ theory avoids the inaccuracies that occur in Ising-based models which require a discretization of the time series. We demonstrate this using the example of the 2008 global financial crisis. The $\phi^{4}$ quantum field theory is expressive enough to reproduce the higher-order statistics such as the market kurtosis, which can serve as an indicator of possible market shocks. Accurate reproduction of high kurtosis is absent in binarized models. Therefore Ising models, despite being widely employed in econophysics, are incapable of fully representing empirical financial data, a limitation not present in the generalization of the $\phi^{4}$ scalar field theory. We then investigate the scaling properties of the $\phi^{4}$ machine learning algorithm and extract exponents which govern the behavior of the learned couplings (or weights and biases in ML language) in relation to the number of stocks in the model. Finally, we use our model to forecast the price changes of the AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA stocks. We conclude by discussing how the $\phi^{4}$ scalar field theory could be used to build investment strategies and the possible intuitions that the QFT operations of dimensional compactification and renormalization can provide for financial modelling.</description>

      <title>Sandwiched and Silent: Behavioral Adaptation and Private Channel Exploitation in Ethereum MEV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How users adapt after being sandwiched remains unclear; this paper provides an empirical quantification. Using transaction level data from November 2024 to February 2025, enriched with mempool visibility and ZeroMEV labels, we track user outcomes after their n-th public sandwich: (i) reactivation, i.e., the resumption of on-chain activity within a 60-day window, and (ii) first-time adoption of private routing. We refer to users who do not reactivate within this window as churned, and to users experiencing multiple attacks (n&gt;1) as undergoing repeated exposure. Our analysis reveals measurable behavioral adaptation: around 40% of victims migrate to private routing within 60 days, rising to 54% with repeated exposures. Churn peaks at 7.5% after the first sandwich but declines to 1-2%, consistent with survivor bias. In Nov-Dec 2024 we confirm 2,932 private sandwich attacks affecting 3,126 private victim transactions, producing \$409,236 in losses and \$293,786 in attacker profits. A single bot accounts for nearly two-thirds of private frontruns, and private sandwich activity is heavily concentrated on a small set of DEX pools. These results highlight that private routing does not guarantee protection from MEV extraction: while execution failures push users toward private channels, these remain exploitable and highly concentrated, demanding continuous monitoring and protocol-level defenses.</description>

      <title>CNFinBench: A Benchmark for Safety and Compliance of Large Language Models in Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across the financial sector for tasks like investment research and algorithmic trading. Their high-stakes nature demands rigorous evaluation of models' safety and regulatory alignment. However, there is a significant gap between evaluation capabilities and safety requirements. Current financial benchmarks mainly focus on textbook-style question answering and numerical problem-solving, failing to simulate the open-ended scenarios where safety risks typically manifest. To close these gaps, we introduce CNFinBench, a benchmark structured around a Capability-Compliance-Safety triad encompassing 15 subtasks. For Capability Q&amp;As, we introduce a novel business-vertical taxonomy aligned with core financial domains like banking operations, which allows institutions to assess model readiness for deployment in operational scenarios. For Compliance and Risk Control Q&amp;As, we embed regulatory requirements within realistic business scenarios to ensure models are evaluated under practical, scenario-driven conditions. For Safety Q&amp;As, we uniquely incorporate structured bias and fairness auditing, a dimension overlooked by other holistic financial benchmarks, and introduce the first multi-turn adversarial dialogue task to systematically expose compliance decay under sustained, context-aware attacks. Accordingly, we propose the Harmful Instruction Compliance Score (HICS) to quantify models' consistency in resisting harmful instructions across multi-turn dialogues. Experiments on 21 models across all subtasks reveal a persistent gap between capability and compliance: models achieve an average score of 61.0 on capability tasks but drop to 34.2 on compliance and risk-control evaluations. In multi-turn adversarial dialogue tests, most LLMs attain only partial resistance, demonstrating that refusal alone is insufficient without cited, verifiable reasoning.</description>

      <title>On the performance of multi-fidelity and reduced-dimensional neural emulators for inference of physiological boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving inverse problems in cardiovascular modeling is particularly challenging due to the high computational cost of running high-fidelity simulations. In this work, we focus on Bayesian parameter estimation and explore different methods to reduce the computational cost of sampling from the posterior distribution by leveraging low-fidelity approximations. A common approach is to construct a surrogate model for the high-fidelity simulation itself. Another is to build a surrogate for the discrepancy between high- and low-fidelity models. This discrepancy, which is often easier to approximate, is modeled with either a fully connected neural network or a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that enables surrogate construction in a lower-dimensional space. A third possible approach is to treat the discrepancy between the high-fidelity and surrogate models as random noise and estimate its distribution using normalizing flows. This allows us to incorporate the approximation error into the Bayesian inverse problem by modifying the likelihood function. We validate five different methods which are variations of the above on analytical test cases by comparing them to posterior distributions derived solely from high-fidelity models, assessing both accuracy and computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate our approaches on two cardiovascular examples of increasing complexity: a lumped-parameter Windkessel model and a patient-specific three-dimensional anatomy.</description>

      <title>The gradual transformation of inland areas -- human plowing, horse plowing and equity incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many modern areas have not learned their lessons and often hope for the wisdom of later generations, resulting in them only possessing modern technology and difficult to iterate ancient civilizations. At present, there is no way to tell how we should learn from history and promote the gradual upgrading of civilization. Therefore, we must tell the history of civilization's progress and the means of governance, learn from experience to improve the comprehensive strength and survival ability of civilization, and achieve an optimal solution for the tempering brought by conflicts and the reduction of internal conflicts. Firstly, we must follow the footsteps of history and explore the reasons for the long-term stability of each country in conflict, including providing economic benefits to the people and means of suppressing them; then, use mathematical methods to demonstrate how we can achieve the optimal solution at the current stage. After analysis, we can conclude that the civilization transformed from human plowing to horse plowing can easily suppress the resistance of the people and provide them with the ability to resist; The selection of rulers should consider multiple institutional aspects, such as exams, elections, and drawing lots; Economic development follows a lognormal distribution and can be adjusted by population mean and standard deviation. Using a lognormal distribution with the maximum value to divide equity can adjust the wealth gap.</description>

      <title>Data-driven uncertainty-aware seakeeping prediction of the Delft 372 catamaran using ensemble Hankel dynamic mode decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present and validate an ensemble-based Hankel Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (HDMDc) for uncertainty-aware seakeeping predictions of a high-speed catamaran, namely the Delft 372 model. Experimental measurements (time histories) of wave elevation at the longitudinal center of gravity, heave, pitch, notional flight-deck velocity, notional bridge acceleration, and total resistance were collected from irregular wave basin tests on a 1:33.3 scale replica of the Delft 372 model under sea state 5 conditions at Fr = 0.425, and organized into training, validation, and test sets. The HDMDc algorithm constructs an equation-free linear reduced-order model of the seakeeping vessel by augmenting states and inputs with their time-lagged copies to capture nonlinear and memory effects. Two ensembling strategies, namely Bayesian HDMDc (BHDMDc), which samples hyperparameters considered stochastic variables with prior distribution to produce posterior mean forecasts with confidence intervals, and Frequentist HDMDc (FHDMDc), which aggregates multiple model obtained over data subsets, are compared in providing seakeeping prediction and uncertainty quantification. The FHDMDc approach is found to improve the accuracy of the predictions compared to the deterministic counterpart, also providing robust uncertainty estimation; whereas the application of BHDMDc to the present test case is not found beneficial in comparison to the deterministic model. FHDMDc-derived probability density functions for the motions closely match both experimental data and URANS results, demonstrating reliable and computationally efficient seakeeping prediction for design and operational support.</description>

      <title>Finch: Benchmarking Finance &amp; Accounting across Spreadsheet-Centric Enterprise Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a finance &amp; accounting benchmark (Finch) for evaluating AI agents on real-world, enterprise-grade professional workflows -- interleaving data entry, structuring, formatting, web search, cross-file retrieval, calculation, modeling, validation, translation, visualization, and reporting. Finch is sourced from authentic enterprise workspaces at Enron (15,000 spreadsheets and 500,000 emails from 150 employees) and other financial institutions, preserving in-the-wild messiness across multimodal artifacts (text, tables, formulas, charts, code, and images) and spanning diverse domains such as budgeting, trading, and asset management.
  We propose a workflow construction process that combines LLM-assisted discovery with expert annotation: (1) LLM-assisted, expert-verified derivation of workflows from real-world email threads and version histories of spreadsheet files, and (2) meticulous expert annotation for workflows, requiring over 700 hours of domain-expert effort. This yields 172 composite workflows with 384 tasks, involving 1,710 spreadsheets with 27 million cells, along with PDFs and other artifacts, capturing the intrinsically messy, long-horizon, knowledge-intensive, and collaborative nature of real-world enterprise work.
  We conduct both human and automated evaluations of frontier AI systems including GPT 5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, Grok 4, and Qwen 3 Max, and GPT 5.1 Pro spends 48 hours in total yet passes only 38.4% of workflows, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 passes just 25.0%. Comprehensive case studies further surface the challenges that real-world enterprise workflows pose for AI agents.</description>
