      <title>Benchmarking seismic phase associators: Insights from synthetic scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable seismicity catalogs are essential for seismology. Following phase picking, phase association groups arrivals into sets with consistent origins (i.e., events), determines event counts, and identifies outlier picks. To handle the substantial increase in the quantity of seismic phase picks from improved picking methods and larger deployments, several novel phase associators have recently been proposed. This study presents a detailed benchmark analysis of five seismic phase associators, including classical and machine learning-based approaches: PhaseLink, REAL, GaMMA, GENIE, and PyOcto. We use synthetic datasets mimicking real seismicity characteristics in crustal and subduction zone scenarios. We evaluate performance for different conditions, including low- and high-noise environments, out-of-network events, very high event rates, and variable station density. The results reveal notable differences in precision, recall, and computational efficiency. GENIE and PyOcto demonstrate robust performance, with almost perfect performance for most scenarios. Only for the most challenging conditions with high noise levels and event rates, performance drops but still maintains F1 scores above 0.8. PhaseLink's performance declines with noise and event density, particularly in subduction zones, dropping to near zero in the most complex cases. GaMMA outperforms PhaseLink but struggles with accuracy and scalability in high-noise, high-density scenarios. REAL performs reasonably but loses recall under extreme conditions. PyOcto and PhaseLink show the quickest runtimes for smaller-scale datasets, while REAL and GENIE are more than an order of magnitude slower for these cases. At the highest pick rates, GENIE's runtime disadvantage diminishes, matching PyOcto and scaling effectively. Our results can guide practitioners compiling seismicity catalogs and developers designing novel associators.</description>

      <title>Utilizing long memory and circulation patterns for stochastic forecasts of temperature extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long memory and circulation patterns are potential sources of subseasonal-to-seasonal predictions. Here, we infer one-dimensional nonlinear stochastic models of daily temperature which capture both long memory and external driving by the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index. To this end, we employ a data-driven method which combines fractional calculus and stochastic difference equations. A causal analysis of AO and North-Atlantic Oscillation indices and European daily extreme temperatures reveals the largest influence of the AO index on winter temperature in southern Scandinavia. Stochastic temperature forecasts for Visby Flygplats, Sweden, show significantly improved performance for long memory models. Binary temperature forecasts show predictive power for up to 20 (11) days lead time for maximum (minimum) daily temperature (66% CI) while an AR(1) model possesses predictive power for 8 (3) days lead time for daily maximum (minimum) temperature (66% CI). Our results show the potential of long memory and circulation patterns for extreme temperature forecasts.</description>

      <title>Geophysical flows over topography, a playground for laboratory experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physicists face major challenges in modelling multi-scale phenomena that are observed in geophysical flows (e.g. in the Earth's oceans and atmosphere, or liquid planetary cores). In particular, complexities arise because geophysical fluids are rotating and subject to density variations, but also because the fluid boundaries have complex geometries (e.g. the ocean floor) with wavelengths ranging from metres to thousands of kilometres. Dynamical models of planetary fluid layers are thus often constrained by observations, whose interpretation necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the underlying physics. To this end, geophysical studies often combine cutting-edge experiments across a wide range of parameters, together with theory and numerical simulations, to derive predictive scaling laws applicable for planetary settings. In this review, we discuss experimental efforts that have contributed to our understanding of geophysical flows with topography. More specifically, we focus on (i) the flow response to mechanical (orbital) forcings in the presence of a large-scale (ellipsoidal) topography, (ii) some effects of small-scale topography onto bulk flows and boundary-layer dynamics, and (iii) the interaction between convection and roughness. The geophysical context is briefly introduced for each case, and some experimental perspectives are drawn.</description>
