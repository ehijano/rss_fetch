      <title>Shrinkage Estimators for Mean and Covariance: Evidence on Portfolio Efficiency Across Market Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean-variance model remains the most prevalent investment framework, built on diversification principles. However, it consistently struggles with estimation errors in expected returns and the covariance matrix, its core parameters. To address this concern, this research evaluates the performance of mean variance (MV) and global minimum-variance (GMV) models across various shrinkage estimators designed to improve these parameters. Specifically, we examine five shrinkage estimators for expected returns and eleven for the covariance matrix. To compare multiple portfolios, we employ a super efficient data envelopment analysis model to rank the portfolios according to investors risk-return preferences. Our comprehensive empirical investigation utilizes six real world datasets with different dimensional characteristics, applying a rolling window methodology across three out of sample testing periods. Following the ranking process, we examine the chosen shrinkage based MV or GMV portfolios against five traditional portfolio optimization techniques classical MV and GMV for sample estimates, MiniMax, conditional value at risk, and semi mean absolute deviation risk measures. Our empirical findings reveal that, in most scenarios, the GMV model combined with the Ledoit Wolf two parameter shrinkage covariance estimator (COV2) represents the optimal selection for a broad spectrum of investors. Meanwhile, the MV model utilizing COV2 alongside the sample mean (SM) proves more suitable for return oriented investors. These two identified models demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional benchmark approaches. Overall, this study lays the groundwork for a more comprehensive understanding of how specific shrinkage models perform across diverse investor profiles and market setups.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Circuit-Based Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) solution to the dynamic portfolio optimization problem based on Variational Quantum Circuits. The implemented QRL approaches are quantum analogues of the classical neural-network-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Deep Q-Network algorithms. Through an empirical evaluation on real-world financial data, we show that our quantum agents achieve risk-adjusted performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of classical Deep RL models with several orders of magnitude more parameters. However, while quantum circuit execution is inherently fast at the hardware level, practical deployment on cloud-based quantum systems introduces substantial latency, making end-to-end runtime currently dominated by infrastructural overhead and limiting practical applicability. Taken together, our results suggest that QRL is theoretically competitive with state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning and may become practically advantageous as deployment overheads diminish. This positions QRL as a promising paradigm for dynamic decision-making in complex, high-dimensional, and non-stationary environments such as financial markets.
