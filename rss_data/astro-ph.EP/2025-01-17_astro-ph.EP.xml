      <title>REsolved ALMA and SMA Observations of Nearby Stars (REASONS): A population of 74 resolved planetesimal belts at millimetre wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetesimal belts are ubiquitous around nearby stars, and their spatial properties hold crucial information for planetesimal and planet formation models. We present resolved dust observations of 74 planetary systems as part of the REsolved ALMA and SMA Observations of Nearby Stars (REASONS) survey and archival reanalysis. We uniformly modelled interferometric visibilities for the entire sample to obtain the basic spatial properties of each belt, and combined these with constraints from multi-wavelength photometry. We report key findings from a first exploration of this legacy dataset: (1) Belt dust masses are depleted over time in a radially dependent way, with dust being depleted faster in smaller belts, as predicted by collisional evolution. (2) Most belts are broad discs rather than narrow rings, with much broader fractional widths than rings in protoplanetary discs. We link broad belts to either unresolved substructure or broad planetesimal discs produced if protoplanetary rings migrate. (3) The vertical aspect ratios (h = H/R) of 24 belts indicate orbital inclinations of 1-20 degrees, implying relative particle velocities of 0.1-4 km/s, and no clear evolution of heights with system age. This could be explained by early stirring within the belt by large bodies (with sizes of at least 140 km to the size of the Moon), by inheritance of inclinations from the protoplanetary disc stage, or by a diversity in evolutionary pathways and gravitational stirring mechanisms. We release the REASONS legacy multidimensional sample of millimetre-resolved belts to the community as a valuable tool for follow-up multi-wavelength observations and population modelling studies.</description>

      <title>A Pair of Dynamically Interacting Sub-Neptunes Around TOI-6054</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We confirm the planetary nature of a pair of transiting sub-Neptune exoplanets orbiting the bright F-type sub-giant star TOI-6054 ($V=8.02$, $K=6.673$) as a part of the OrCAS radial velocity survey using WIYN/NEID observations. We find that TOI-6054b and TOI-6054c have radii of $2.65 \pm 0.15$ $R_{\oplus}$ and $2.81 \pm 0.18$ $R_{\oplus}$, respectively, and masses of $12.4 \pm 1.7$ $M_{\oplus}$ and $9.2 \pm 2.0$ $M_{\oplus}$. The planets have zero-albedo equilibrium temperatures of $1360 \pm 33$ K and $1144 \pm 28$ K. The host star has expanded and will evolve off of the Main Sequence within the next $\sim$500 Myr, and the resulting increase in stellar luminosity has more than doubled the stellar flux the two planets receive compared to the start of the host star's main sequence phase. Consequently, TOI-6054b may be losing some of its primordial H/He atmosphere -- if it has one. Based on dynamical simulations performed using the orbital parameters of the two planets, TOI-6054b, and TOI-6054c are very likely in a 5:3 mean motion resonance. The TOI-6054 system thus has the potential to be an excellent candidate for future atmospheric follow-up observations, with two similarly sized sub-Neptunes around a bright star. We also estimate that if TOI-6054b is currently losing its H/He atmosphere this should be observable from space and from the ground.</description>

      <title>Background exoplanet candidates in the original Kepler field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. During the primary Kepler mission, between 2009 and 2013, about 150,000 pre-selected targets were observed with a 29.42 minute-long cadence. However, a survey of background stars that fall within the field of view (FOV) of the downloaded apertures of the primary targets has revealed a number of interesting objects. In previous papers we have presented surveys of short period Eclipsing Binaries and RR Lyrae stars.
  Aims. The current survey of the Kepler background is concentrated on identifying longer-period eclipsing binaries and pulsating stars. These will be the subject of later papers. In the course of this survey, in addition to eclipsing binaries and pulsating stars, seven exoplanet candidates have been uncovered and in this paper we report on these candidates.
  Methods. We use Lomb-Scargle (LS), light curve transit search and Phase Dispersion Minimisation (PDM) methods to reveal pixels that show significant periodicities, resulting in the identification of the seven exoplanet candidates. We have prepared the light curves for analysis using Pytransit software and cross matched the pixel coordinates with Gaia and other catalogues to identify the sources.
  Results.We identify seven Hot Jupiter exoplanet candidates with planet radii ranging from 0.8878 to 1.5174 RJup and periods ranging from 2.5089 to 4.7918 days.</description>

      <title>On the robustness of exoplanet atmospheric detections: insights from extensive simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical picture of our Solar System being the archetypal outcome of planet formation has been rendered obsolete by the astonishing diversity of extrasolar-system architectures. From rare hot-Jupiters to abundant super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, most detected exoplanets have no analogs in our system, and their interior and atmospheric compositions remain largely unknown. Fortunately, new methodologies enable us to analyze exoplanet atmospheres, inferring their compositions, temperatures, dynamics, and even formation pathways. Specifically, ground-based high-resolution Doppler spectroscopy (HRDS) can disentangle spectral-line profiles of weak exo-atmospheric signals from the dominating features of Earth's atmosphere in the observed flux. For over a decade, HRDS has focused on hot Jupiters (close-orbiting gas giants) due to their high signal-to-noise ratio, which makes them ideal laboratories for advancing our knowledge. However, there have been concerns regarding potential biases in exo-atmospheric-detection methods, hindering comparative planetology. Here we propose a modeling framework based on extensive simulations of HRDS exo-atmospheric observations to systematically explore in-silico underlying biases in commonly-used pipelines, particularly under the presence of observational noise. Our findings show that exo-atmospheric detection-significances are highly contingent on details of the analysis-pipeline used, with different techniques responding differently to noise: A given technique may fail to recover a true-signal that is detected by another. Noise effects in the computed significances are non-trivial and pipeline-dependent. Statistical analyses provide a complementary tool to contextualize signal-significances, which will gain in relevance as we move towards studying the atmospheres of smaller, potentially habitable exoplanets with even weaker signals.</description>

      <title>Planetary Rhythms: Synchronous Circulation on Variably Irradiated Asynchronous Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal locking of planets to their host stars results in an atmospheric circulation with a hotspot fixed to the frame of reference of the planet. On the other hand, asynchronously rotating planets feature moving hotspots either lagging or leading the corresponding substellar point as it translates along the surface. We show that a planet falling in the latter category could mimic the circulation of tidally synchronous planets under the influence of time-varying instellation, possibly provided by pulsating or multiple star systems. This happens when the planets diurnal period is in resonance with the period of instellation variation, leading to a planet-frame-fixed hotspot. Slight differences in the above periods lead to East-West or West-East creeping hotspots with a period significantly longer than both. The rate of hotspot motion is given by the difference between the diurnal and instellation variation rates, similar to the lower envelope frequency of beat patterns formed by two superposed waves in linear wave theory. We call this phenomenon beating. A combination of the radiative, rotational, wave propagation, and drag timescales establishes dynamical constraints on beating. Based on this we classify a set of Kepler and TESS circumbinary planets with two candidates exhibiting climatic departures from the no-variation scenario. In general, hotter and faster-spinning planets are more susceptible to climatic departures. Beating, if it occurs, may additionally create optimistic extensions of habitable zones for corresponding systems.</description>

      <title>Stellar occultation observations of (38628) Huya and its satellite: a detailed look into the system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical and orbital parameters of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) provide valuable information about the Solar System's formation and evolution. In particular, the characterization of binaries provides insights into the formation mechanisms that may be playing a role at such large distances from the Sun. Studies show two distinct populations, and (38628) Huya occupies an intermediate position between the unequal-size binaries and those with components of roughly equal sizes. In this work, we predicted and observed three stellar occultation events by Huya. Huya and its satellite - S/2012 (38628) 1 - were detected during occultations in March 2021 and again in June 2023. Additionally, an attempt to detect Huya in February 2023 resulted in an additional single-chord detection of the secondary. A spherical body with a minimum diameter of D = 165 km can explain the three single-chord observations and provide a lower limit for the satellite size. The astrometry of Huya's system, as derived from the occultations and supplemented by observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and Keck Observatory, provided constraints on the satellite orbit and the mass of the system. Therefore, assuming the secondary is in an equatorial orbit around the primary, the limb fitting was constrained by the satellite orbit position angle. The system density, calculated by summing the most precise measurement of Huya's volume to the spherical satellite average volume, is $\rho_{1}$ = 1073 $\pm$ 66 kg m$^{-3}$. The density that the object would have assuming a Maclaurin equilibrium shape with a rotational period of 6.725 $\pm$ 0.01 hours is $\rho_{2}$ = 768 $\pm$ 42 kg m$^{-3}$. This difference rules out the Maclaurin equilibrium assumption for the main body shape.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Life: Exploring Information as a Distinctive Feature of Living Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the idea that information is an essential and distinctive feature of living systems. Unlike non-living systems, living systems actively acquire, process, and use information about their environments to respond to changing conditions, sustain themselves, and achieve other intrinsic goals. We discuss relevant theoretical frameworks such as ``semantic information'' and ``fitness value of information''. We also highlight the broader implications of our perspective for fields such as origins-of-life research and astrobiology. In particular, we touch on the transition to information-driven systems as a key step in abiogenesis, informational constraints as determinants of planetary habitability, and informational biosignatures for detecting life beyond Earth. We briefly discuss experimental platforms which offer opportunities to investigate these theoretical concepts in controlled environments. By integrating theoretical and experimental approaches, this perspective advances our understanding of life's informational dynamics and its universal principles across diverse scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Behaviour of the Earth System in the Anthropocene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the Earth System (ES) can, due to the impact of human activities, exhibit chaotic behaviour. Our arguments are based on the assumption that the ES can be described by a Landau-Ginzburg model, which, in itself, predicts that the ES evolves through regular trajectories in phase space towards a Hothouse Earth scenario under a finite amount of human-driven impact. Furthermore, we find that the equilibrium point for temperature fluctuations can exhibit bifurcations and a chaotic pattern if human impact follows a logistic map. Our final analysis includes interactions between different terms of the planetary boundaries in order to gauge the predictability of our model.</description>

      <title>The possibility of panspermia in the deep cosmos by means of the planetary dust grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By obtaining the assumption that planetary dust particles can escape from the gravitational attraction of a planet, we consider the possibility for the dust grains to leave the star's system by means of the radiation pressure. By taking the typical dust parameters into account, we consider their dynamics and show that they can reach the deep cosmos, taking part in panspermia. It has been shown that, during $5$ billion years, the dust grains will reach $10^5$ stellar systems, and by taking the Drake equation into account, it has been shown that the whole galaxy will be full of planetary dust particles.</description>
