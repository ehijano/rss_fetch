      <title>On $\overline{\partial }_{b}$-harmonic maps from pseudo-Hermitian manifolds to K\"{a}hler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider maps from pseudo-Hermitian manifolds to K\"{a}hler manifolds and introduce partial energy functionals for these maps.
  First, we obtain a foliated Lichnerowicz type result on general
  pseudo-Hermitian manifolds, which generalizes a related result on Sasakian
  manifolds in \cite{SSZ2013holomorphic}. Next, we investigate critical maps of the partial
  energy functionals, which are referred to as $\overline{\partial }_{b}$-harmonic maps and $\partial _{b}$-harmonic maps. We give a foliated result
  for both $\overline{\partial }_{b}$- and $\partial _{b}$-harmonic maps,
  generalizing a foliated result of Petit \cite{Pet2002harmonic} for harmonic maps. Then we
  are able to generalize Siu's holomorphicity result for harmonic maps \cite{Siu1980rigid}
  to the case for $\overline{\partial }_{b}$- and $\partial _{b}$-harmonic
  maps.</description>

      <title>On critical maps of the horizontal energy functional between Riemannian foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider critical points of the
  horizontal energy $E_{\HH}(f)$ for a smooth map $f$ between two Riemannian
  foliations. These critical points are referred to as horizontally harmonic
  maps. In particular, if the maps are foliated, they become transversally
  harmonic maps. By utilizing the stress-energy tensor, we establish some
  monotonicity formulas for horizontally harmonic maps from Euclidean spaces,
  the quotients $K_{m}$ of Heisenberg groups and also for transversally
  harmonic maps from Riemannian foliations with appropriate curvature pinching
  conditions. Finally, we give Jin-type theorems for either horizontally
  harmonic maps or transversally harmonic maps under some asymptotic
  conditions at infinity.</description>

      <title>Shape Theory via the Atiyah--Molino Reconstruction and Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstruction problems lie at the very heart of both mathematics and science, posing the enigmatic challenge: \emph{How does one resurrect a hidden structure from the shards of incomplete, fragmented, or distorted data?} In this paper, we introduce a new approach that harnesses the profound insights of the Vaisman Atiyah--Molino framework. Our method renders the reconstruction problem computationally tractable while exhibiting exceptional robustness in the presence of noise. Central to our theory is the Hantjies tensor -- a curvature-like invariant that precisely quantifies noise propagation and enables error-bounded reconstructions. This synthesis of differential geometry, integral analysis, and algebraic topology not only resolves long-standing ambiguities in inverse problems but also paves the way for transformative applications across a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Projections from Furstenberg boundaries onto maximal flats and barycenter maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a semisimple connected Lie group of non-compact type with finite center. Let $K&lt;G$ be a maximal compact subgroup and $P&lt;G$ be a minimal parabolic subgroup. For any pair $(F,x)$, where $F$ is a maximal flat in $G/K$ and $x \in G/P$ is opposite to the Weyl chambers determined by $F$, we define a projection $\Phi(F, x) \in F$ which is continuous and $G$-equivariant. Furthermore, if $q \geq 3$, we exhibit a $G$-equivariant continuous map defined on an open subset of full measure of the space of $q$-tuples of $(G/P)^q$ with image in $G/K$. When $G$ is the orientation preserving isometries of real hyperbolic space and $q = 3$, we recover the geometric barycenter of the corresponding ideal triangle. All our proofs are constructive.</description>

Abstract: We prove a rigidity result for mean curvature self-translating solitons, characterizing the grim reaper cylinder as the only finite entropy self-translating 2-surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ of width $\pi$ and bounded from below. The proof makes use of parabolicity in a weighted setting applied to a suitable universally $L$-superharmonic function defined on translaters in such slabs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of pseudodifferential operators, called Heisenberg semiclassical pseudodifferential operators, to study the space of sections of a power of a line bundle on a compact manifold, in the limit where the power is large. This class contains the Bochner Laplacian associated with a connection of the line bundle, and when the curvature is nondegenerate, its resolvent and some associated spectral projections, including generalized Bergman kernels.</description>

      <title>Exact d'Alembertian for Lorentz distance functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We refine a recent distributional notion of d'Alembertian of a signed Lorentz distance function to an achronal set in a metric measure spacetime obeying the timelike measure contraction property. We show precise representation formulas and comparison estimates (both upper and lower bounds). Under a condition we call "infinitesimally strict concavity" (known for infinitesimally Minkowskian structures and established here for Finsler spacetimes), we prove the associated distribution is a signed measure certifying the integration by parts formula. This treatment of the d'Alembertian using techniques from metric geometry expands upon its recent nonlinear yet elliptic interpretation; even in the smooth case, our formulas seem to pioneer its exact shape across the timelike cut locus. Two central ingredients our contribution unifies are the localization paradigm of Cavalletti-Mondino and the Sobolev calculus of Beran-Braun-Calisti-Gigli-McCann-Ohanyan-Rott-S\"amann.
  In the second part of our work, we present several applications of these insights. First, we show the equivalence of the timelike curvature-dimension condition with a Bochner-type inequality. Second, we set up synthetic mean curvature (as well as barriers for CMC sets) exactly. Third, we prove synthetic volume and area estimates of Heintze-Karcher-type, which enable us to show several synthetic volume singularity theorems.</description>

      <title>Interior control for surfaces with positive scalar curvature and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M^{n}$, $n\in\{3,4,5\}$, be a closed aspherical $n$-manifold and $S\subset M$ a subset consisting of disjoint incompressible embedded closed aspherical submanifolds (possibly with different dimensions). When $n =3,4$, we show that $M\setminus S$ cannot admit any complete metric with positive scalar curvature. When $n=5$, we obtain the same result when $S$ contains a submanifold of codimension 1 or 2. The key ingredient is a new interior control for the extrinsic diameter of surfaces with positive scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian maximal couplings and a vertical reflection principle on a class of sub-Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an approach to constructing non-Markovian, non-co-adapted couplings for sub-Riemannian Brownian motions in sub-Riemannian manifolds with large symmetry groups by treating the specific cases of the three-dimensional Heisenberg group, higher-dimensional non-isotropic Heisenberg groups, SL(2,R) and its universal cover, and SU(2). Our primary focus is on the situation when the processes start from two points on the same vertical fiber, since in general Markovian or co-adapted couplings cannot give the sharp rate for the coupling time in this case. Non-Markovian couplings of this type on sub-Riemannian manifolds were first introduced by Banerjee-Gordina-Mariano, for the three-dimensional Heisenberg group, and were more recently extended by B\'en\'efice to SL(2,R) and SU(2), using a detailed consideration of the Brownian bridge. In contrast, our couplings are based on global isometries of the space, giving couplings that are maximal, as well as making the construction relatively simple and uniform across different manifolds. The coupled processes satisfy a reflection principle with respect to their coupling time, so that the coupling time reduces to the hitting time for one component of the Brownian motion, which is useful in explicitly bounding the tail probability of the coupling time. Further, it's natural to use this coupling as the second stage of a two-stage coupling when considering points on different vertical fibers. We estimate the coupling time in these various situations and give applications to inequalities for the heat semigroup.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic spinors and horospheres in 4-dimensional hyperbolic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give explicit bijective correspondences between three families of objects: certain pairs of quaternions, which we regard as spinors; certain flags in (1+4)-dimensional Minkowski space; and horospheres in 4-dimensional hyperbolic space decorated with certain pairs of spinorial directions. These correspondences generalise previous work of the first author, Penrose--Rindler, and Penner in lower dimensions, and use the description of 4-dimensional hyperbolic isometries via Clifford matrices studied by Ahlfors and others.
  We show that lambda lengths generalise to 4 dimensions, where they take quaternionic values, and are given by a certain bilinear form on quaternionic spinors. They satisfy a non-commutative Ptolemy equation, arising from quasi-Pl\"ucker relations in the Gel'fand--Retakh theory of noncommutative determinants. We also study various structures of geometric and topological interest that arise in the process.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak q=Lie Q$ be an algebraic Lie algebra of index 1, i.e., a generic $Q$-orbit on $\mathfrak q^*$ has codimension 1. We show that the following conditions are equivalent: $\mathfrak q$ is contact; a generic $Q$-orbit on $\mathfrak q^*$ is not conical; there is a generic stabiliser for the coadjoint action of $\mathfrak q$. In addition, if $\mathfrak q$ is contact, then the subalgebra $S(\mathfrak q)_{\sf si}\subset S(\mathfrak q)$ generated by symmetric semi-invariants of $\mathfrak q$ is a polynomial ring. We study also affine seaweed Lie algebras of type ${\sf A}$ and find some contact as well as non-contact examples among them.</description>
