      <title>Lagrangian Simulation Volume-Based Contour Tree Simplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many scientific and engineering problems are modelled by simulating scalar fields defined either on space-filling meshes (Eulerian) or as particles (Lagrangian). For analysis and visualization, topological primitives such as contour trees can be used, but these often need simplification to filter out small-scale features. For parcel-based convective cloud simulations, simplification of the contour tree requires a volumetric measure rather than persistence. Unlike for cubic meshes, volume cannot be approximated by counting regular vertices. Typically, this is addressed by resampling irregular data onto a uniform grid. Unfortunately, the spatial proximity of parcels requires a high sampling frequency, resulting in a massive increase in data size for processing. We therefore extend volume-based contour tree simplification to parcel-in-cell simulations with a graph adaptor in Viskores (VTK-m), using Delaunay tetrahedralization of the parcel centroids as input. Instead of relying on a volume approximation by counting regular vertices -- as was done for cubic meshes -- we adapt the 2D area splines reported by Bajaj et al. 10.1145/259081.259279, and Zhou et al. 10.1109/TVCG.2018.2796555. We implement this in Viskores (formerly called VTK-m) as prefix-sum style hypersweeps for parallel efficiency and show how it can be generalized to compute any integrable property. Finally, our results reveal that contour trees computed directly on the parcels are orders of magnitude faster than computing them on a resampled grid, while also arguably offering better quality segmentation, avoiding interpolation artifacts.</description>

      <title>Hilbert geometry of the symmetric positive-definite bicone: Application to the geometry of the extended Gaussian family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extended Gaussian family is the closure of the Gaussian family obtained by completing the Gaussian family with the counterpart elements induced by degenerate covariance or degenerate precision matrices, or a mix of both degeneracies. The parameter space of the extended Gaussian family forms a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix bicone, i.e. two partial symmetric positive semi-definite matrix cones joined at their bases. In this paper, we study the Hilbert geometry of such an open bounded convex symmetric positive-definite bicone. We report the closed-form formula for the corresponding Hilbert metric distance and study exhaustively its invariance properties. We also touch upon potential applications of this geometry for dealing with extended Gaussian distributions.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for Computing the Exact Convex Hull in High-Dimensional Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel algorithm for computing the convex hull of a point set in high-dimensional Euclidean space. The method iteratively solves a sequence of dynamically updated quadratic programming (QP) problems for each point and leverages the solutions to provide theoretical guarantees for exact convex hull identification. Given $n$ points in an $m$-dimensional space, the algorithm achieves a best-case time complexity of $O(nm^p)$, where $p$ depends on the specific QP solver employed (e.g., an interior-point method). In the worst case, the complexity increases to $O(n h^{p+1})$, where $h$ denotes the minimal number of vertices defining the convex hull. The approach is particularly well-suited for large-scale, high-dimensional datasets, where exponential-time algorithms become computationally infeasible.</description>

      <title>Morse-based Modular Homology for Evolving Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of homology groups for evolving simplicial complexes often requires repeated reconstruction of boundary operators, resulting in prohibitive costs for large-scale or frequently updated data. This work introduces MMHM, a Morse-based Modular Homology Maintenance framework that preserves homological invariants under local complex modifications. An initial discrete Morse reduction produces a critical cell complex chain-homotopy equivalent to the input; subsequent edits trigger localized updates to the affected part of the reduced boundary operators over a chosen coefficient ring. By restricting recomputation to the affected critical cells and applying localized matrix reductions, the approach achieves significant amortized performance gains while guaranteeing homology preservation. A periodic recompression policy together with topology-aware gating and a column-oriented sparse boundary representation with a pivot-ownership map confines elimination to the affected columns and can bypass linear algebra when invariants are decidable combinatorially. The framework offers a drop-in upgrade for topology pipelines, turning costly rebuilds into fast, exact updates that track homology through local edits. Reframing dynamic homology as a locality-bounded maintenance task provides an exact alternative to global recomputation for evolving meshes and complexes.</description>

      <title>The Rectilinear Marco Polo Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the rectilinear Marco Polo problem, which generalizes the Euclidean version of the Marco Polo problem for performing geometric localization to rectilinear search environments, such as in geometries motivated from urban settings, and to higher dimensions. In the rectilinear Marco Polo problem, there is at least one point of interest (POI) within distance $n$, in either the $L_1$ or $L_\infty$ metric, from the origin. Motivated from a search-and-rescue application, our goal is to move a search point, $\Delta$, from the origin to a location within distance $1$ of a POI. We periodically issue probes from $\Delta$ out a given distance (in either the $L_1$ or $L_\infty$ metric) and if a POI is within the specified distance of $\Delta$, then we learn this (but no other location information). Optimization goals are to minimize the number of probes and the distance traveled by $\Delta$. We describe a number of efficient search strategies for rectilinear Marco Polo problems and we analyze each one in terms of the size, $n$, of the search domain, as defined by the maximum distance to a POI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces advanced techniques of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for unsupervised anomaly detection and customer segmentation in banking data. Using the Mapper algorithm and persistent homology, we develop unsupervised procedures that uncover meaningful patterns in customers' banking data by exploiting topological information.

      <title>Topolow: Force-Directed Euclidean Embedding of Dissimilarity Data with Robustness Against Non-Metricity and Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of embedding a set of objects into a low-dimensional Euclidean space based on a matrix of pairwise dissimilarities is fundamental in data analysis, machine learning, and statistics. However, the assumptions of many standard analytical methods are violated when the input dissimilarities fail to satisfy metric or Euclidean axioms. We present the mathematical and statistical foundations of Topolow, a physics-inspired, gradient-free optimization framework for such embedding problems. Topolow is conceptually related to force-directed graph drawing algorithms but is fundamentally distinguished by its goal of quantitative metric reconstruction. It models objects as particles in a physical system, and its novel optimization scheme proceeds through sequential, stochastic pairwise interactions, which circumvents the need to compute a global gradient and provides robustness against convergence to local optima, especially for sparse data. Topolow maximizes the likelihood under a Laplace error model, robust to outliers and heterogeneous errors, and properly handles censored data. Crucially, Topolow does not require the input dissimilarities to be metric, making it a robust solution for embedding non-metric measurements into a valid Euclidean space, thereby enabling the use of standard analytical tools. We demonstrate the superior performance of Topolow compared to standard Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) methods in reconstructing the geometry of sparse and non-Euclidean data. This paper formalizes the algorithm, first introduced as Topolow in the context of antigenic mapping in (Arhami and Rohani, 2025) (open access), with emphasis on its metric embedding and mathematical properties for a broader audience. The general-purpose function Euclidify is available in the R package topolow.</description>
