      <title>On the equivalence of derivatives for maps between Carnot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper gives an alternate, elementary proof of a result of Magnani: maps between Carnot groups that are continuously differential in horizontal directions in the Euclidean sense are continuously Pansu differentiable. Our proof involves primarily Euclidean arguments. We simultaneously reprove Magnani's mean value estimate for continuously Pansu differentiable maps.</description>

      <title>Cycles in spherical Deligne complexes and application to $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture for Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture holds for Artin groups whose Dynkin diagrams are complete bipartite (edge labels are allowed to be arbitrary), answering a question of J. McCammond. Along the way, we treat several related families of hyperbolic type Artin groups, namely the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture holds for all 3-dimensional hyperbolic type Artin groups, except one single example with Dynkin diagram $[3,5,3]$; and the conjecture holds for all quasi-Lann\'er hyperbolic type Artin groups up to dimension 4. We also treat several higher dimensional families.
  Most of the article is about developing new methods of understanding combinatorial minimal fillings of certain types of cycles in spherical Deligne complexes or relative Artin complexes, via non-positive curvature geometry. Then we combine this with an approached to the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture introduced by a previous article of the author to settle new cases of $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture.
  In the appendix we list some related open questions and conjectures.</description>

      <title>Minimal projections onto spaces of polynomials on real euclidean spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate projection constants within classes of multivariate polynomials over finite-dimensional real Hilbert spaces. Specifically, we consider the projection constant for spaces of spherical harmonics and spaces of homogeneous polynomials as well as for spaces of polynomials of finite degree on the unit sphere. We establish a connection between these quantities and certain weighted $L_1$-norms of specific Jacobi polynomials. As a consequence, we present exact formulas, computable expressions and asymptotically accurate estimates for them. The real case we address is considerably more nuanced than its complex counterpart.</description>

      <title>Stability and equivariant Gromov--Hausdorff convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give applications of equivariant Gromov--Hausdorff convergence in various contexts. Namely, using equivariant Gromov--Hausdorff convergence, we prove a stability result in the setting of compact finite dimensional Alexandrov spaces. Moreover, we introduce the notion of an \emph{almost commutative diagram} and show that its use simplifies both exposition and argument.</description>

      <title>Large-scale geometry of Borel graphs of polynomial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04727v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study graphs of polynomial growth from the perspective of asymptotic geometry and descriptive set theory. The starting point of our investigation is a theorem of Krauthgamer and Lee who showed that every connected graph of polynomial growth admits an injective contraction mapping to $(\mathbb Z^n, \|\cdot\|_\infty)$ for some $n\in\mathbb N$. We strengthen and generalize this result in a number of ways. In particular, answering a question of Papasoglu, we construct coarse embeddings from graphs of polynomial growth to $\mathbb Z^n$. Moreover, we only require $n$ to be linear in the asymptotic polynomial growth rate of the graph; this confirms a conjecture of Levin and Linial, London, and Rabinovich "in the asymptotic sense." (The exact form of the conjecture was refuted by Krauthgamer and Lee.) All our results are proved for Borel graphs, which allows us to settle a number of problems in descriptive combinatorics. Roughly, we prove that graphs generated by free Borel actions of $\mathbb Z^n$ are universal for the class of Borel graphs of polynomial growth. This provides a general method for extending results about $\mathbb Z^n$-actions to all Borel graphs of polynomial growth. For example, an immediate consequence of our main result is that all Borel graphs of polynomial growth are hyperfinite, which answers a well-known question in the area. As another illustration, we show that Borel graphs of polynomial growth support a certain combinatorial structure called toast. An important technical tool in our arguments is the notion of padded decomposition from computer science, which is closely related to the concept of asymptotic dimension due to Gromov. Along the way we find an alternative, probabilistic proof of a theorem of Papasoglu that graphs of asymptotic polynomial growth rate $\rho&lt;\infty$ have asymptotic dimension at most $\rho$ and establish the same bound in the Borel setting.</description>
