      <title>Liquidity provision of utility indifference type in decentralized exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a mathematical formulation of liquidity provision in decentralized exchanges. We focus on constant function market makers of utility indifference type, which include constant product market makers with concentrated liquidity as a special case. First, we examine no-arbitrage conditions for a liquidity pool and compute an optimal arbitrage strategy when there is an external liquid market. Second, we show that liquidity provision suffers from impermanent loss unless a transaction fee is levied under the general framework with concentrated liquidity. Third, we establish the well-definedness of arbitrage-free reserve processes of a liquidity pool in continuous-time and show that there is no loss-versus-rebalancing under a nonzero fee if the external market price is continuous. We then argue that liquidity provision by multiple liquidity providers can be understood as liquidity provision by a representative liquidity provider, meaning that the analysis boils down to that for a single liquidity provider. Last, but not least, we give an answer to the fundamental question in which sense the very construction of constant function market makers with concentrated liquidity in the popular platform Uniswap v3 is optimal.</description>

      <title>Max- and min-stability under first-order stochastic dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Max-stability is the property that taking a maximum between two inputs results in a maximum between two outputs. We study max-stability with respect to first-order stochastic dominance, the most fundamental notion of stochastic dominance in decision theory. Under two additional standard axioms of nondegeneracy and lower semicontinuity, we establish a representation theorem for functionals satisfying max-stability, which turns out to be represented by the supremum of a bivariate function. A parallel characterization result for min-stability, that is, with the maximum replaced by the minimum in max-stability, is also established. By combining both max-stability and min-stability, we obtain a new characterization for a class of functionals, called the Lambda-quantiles, that appear in finance and political science.</description>
