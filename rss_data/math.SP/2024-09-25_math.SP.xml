      <title>Linear systems, spectral curves and determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(-A,B,C)$ be a continuous time linear system with state space a separable complex Hilbert space $H$, where $-A$ generates a strongly continuous contraction semigroup $(e^{-tA})_{t\geq 0}$ on $H$, and $\phi (t)=Ce^{-tA}B$ is the impulse response function. Associated to such a system is a Hankel integral operator $\Gamma_\phi$ acting on $L^2((0, \infty ); C)$ and a Schr{\"o}dinger operator whose potential is found via a Fredholm determinant by the Faddeev-Dyson formula. Fredholm determinants of products of Hankel operators also play an important role in the Tracy and Widom's theory of matrix models and asymptotic eigenvalue distributions of random matrices. This paper provide formulas for the Fredholm determinants which arise thus, and determines consequent properties of the associated differential operators. We prove a spectral theorem for self-adjoint linear systems that have scalar input and output: the entries of Kodaira's characteristic matrix are given explicitly with formulas involving the infinitesimal Darboux addition for $(-A,B,C)$. Under suitable conditions on $(-A,B,C)$ we give an explicit version of Burchnall-Chaundy's theorem, showing that the algebra generated by an associated family of differential operators is isomorphic to an algebra of functions on a particular hyperelliptic curve.</description>

      <title>Uniform stability of the inverse problem for the non-self-adjoint Sturm-Liouville operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new approach to investigation of the uniform stability for inverse spectral problems. We consider the non-self-adjoint Sturm-Liouville problem that consists in the recovery of the potential and the parameters of the boundary conditions from the eigenvalues and the generalized weight numbers. The special case of simple eigenvalues, as well as the general case with multiple eigenvalues are studied. We find various subsets in the space of spectral data, on which the inverse mapping is Lipschitz continuous, and obtain the corresponding unconditional uniform stability estimates. Furthermore, the conditional uniform stability of the inverse problem under a priori restrictions on the potential is studied. In addition, we prove the uniform stability of the inverse problem by the Cauchy data, which are convenient for numerical reconstruction of the potential and for applications to partial inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Spectral decomposition of field operators and causal measurement in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the spectral decomposition of field operators in bosonic quantum field theory as a limit of a strongly continuous family of POVM decompositions. The latter arise from integrals over families of bounded positive operators. Crucially, these operators have the same locality properties as the underlying field operators. We use the decompositions to construct families of quantum operations implementing measurements of the field observables. Again, the quantum operations have the same locality properties as the field operators. What is more, we show that these quantum operations do not lead to superluminal signaling and are possible measurements on quantum fields in the sense of Sorkin.</description>

      <title>Extremal values for the square energies of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ non-isolated vertices and $m$ edges. The positive / negative square energies of $G$, denoted $s^+(G)$ / $s^-(G)$, are defined as the sum of squares of the positive / negative eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix $A_G$ of $G$. In this work, we provide several new tools for studying square energy encompassing semi-definite optimization, graph operations, and surplus. Using our tools, we prove the following results on the extremal values of $s^{\pm}(G)$ with a given number of vertices and edges.
  1. We have $\min(s^+(G), s^-(G)) \geq n - \gamma \geq \frac{n}{2}$, where $\gamma$ is the domination number of $G$. This verifies a conjecture of Elphick, Farber, Goldberg and Wocjan up to a constant, and proves a weaker version of this conjecture introduced by Elphick and Linz.
  2. We have $s^+(G) \geq m^{6/7 - o(1)}$ and $s^-(G) = \Omega(m^{1/2})$, with both exponents being optimal.</description>

      <title>Spectral Graph Theoretic Methods for Enhancing Network Robustness in Robot Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the optimization of edge-weighted networks by maximizing algebraic connectivity to enhance network robustness. Motivated by the need for precise robot position estimation in cooperative localization and pose-graph sparsification in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), the algebraic connectivity maximization problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Semi-Definite Program (MISDP), which is NP-hard. Leveraging spectral graph theoretic methods, specifically Cheeger's inequality, this work introduces novel "Cheeger cuts" to strengthen and efficiently solve medium-scale MISDPs. Further, a new Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) is developed for efficiently computing Cheeger cuts, implemented within an outer-approximation algorithm for solving the MISDP. A greedy k-opt heuristic is also presented, producing high-quality solutions that serve as valid lower bounds for Cheeger cuts. Comprehensive numerical analyses demonstrate the efficacy of strengthened cuts via substantial improvements in run times on synthetic and realistic robot localization datasets.</description>

      <title>Critical lengths of Steklov eigenvalues of hypersurfaces of revolution in Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Steklov problem on hypersurfaces of revolution with two boundary components in Euclidean space. In a recent article, the phenomenon of critical length, at which a Steklov eigenvalue is maximized, was exhibited and multiple questions were raised. In this article, we conjecture that, in any dimension, there is a finite number of infinite critical length. To investigate this, we develop an algorithm to efficiently perform numerical experiments, providing support to our conjecture. Furthermore, we prove the conjecture in dimension $n = 3$ and $n = 4$.</description>

      <title>Positivity and entanglement of polynomial Gaussian integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positivity preservation is an important issue in the dynamics of open quantum systems: positivity violations always mark the border of validity of the model. We investigate the positivity of self-adjoint polynomial Gaussian integral operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$, that is, the multivariable kernel $\kappa_{PG}$ is a product of a polynomial $P$ and a Gaussian kernel $\kappa_G$. These operators frequently appear in open quantum systems.
  We show that $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$ can be only positive if the Gaussian part is positive, which yields a strong and quite easy test for positivity. This has an important corollary for the bipartite entanglement of the density operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$: if the Gaussian density operator $\widehat{\kappa}_G$ fails the Peres-Horodecki criterion, then the corresponding polynomial Gaussian density operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$ also fail the criterion for all $P$, hence they are all entangled.
  We prove that polynomial Gaussian operators with polynomials of odd degree cannot be positive semidefinite.
  We introduce a new preorder $\preceq$ on Gaussian kernels such that if $\kappa_{G_0}\preceq \kappa_{G_1}$ then $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG_0}\geq 0$ implies $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG_1}\geq 0$ for all polynomials $P$. Therefore, deciding the positivity of a polynomial Gaussian operator determines the positivity of a lot of another polynomial Gaussian operators having the same polynomial factor, which might improve any given positivity test by carrying it out on a much larger set of operators. We will show an example that this really can make positivity tests much more sensitive and efficient. This preorder has implication for the entanglement problem, too.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for a family of quantum walk models with electric fields, the spectrum is the unit circle for any irrational field. The result also holds for the associated CMV matrices defined by skew-shifts. Generalizations to CMV matrices with skew-shifts on higher dimensional torus are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Spectral bounds of multi-way Cheeger constants via cyclomatic number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a non-trivial extension of the celebrated Cheeger inequality, the higher-order Cheeger inequalities for graphs due to Lee, Oveis Gharan and Trevisan provide for each $k$ an upper bound for the $k$-way Cheeger constant in forms of $C(k)\sqrt{\lambda_k(G)}$, where $\lambda_k(G)$ is the $k$-th eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian and $C(k)$ is a constant depending only on $k$. In this article, we prove some new bounds for multi-way Cheeger constants. By shifting the index of the eigenvalue via cyclomatic number, we establish upper bound estimates with an absolute constant instead of $C(k)$. This, in particular, gives a more direct proof of Miclo's higher order Cheeger inequalities on trees. We also show a new lower bound of the multi-way Cheeger constants in terms of the spectral radius of the graph. The proofs involve the concept of discrete nodal domains and a probability argument showing generic properties of eigenfunctions.</description>
