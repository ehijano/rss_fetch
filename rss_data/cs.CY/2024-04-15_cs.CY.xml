      <title>Business models for the simulation hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation hypothesis suggests that we live in a computer simulation. That notion has attracted significant scholarly and popular interest. This article explores the simulation hypothesis from a business perspective. Due to the lack of a name for a universe consistent with the simulation hypothesis, we propose the term simuverse. We argue that if we live in a simulation, there must be a business justification. Therefore, we ask: If we live in a simuverse, what is its business model? We identify and explore business model scenarios, such as simuverse as a project, service, or platform. We also explore business model pathways and risk management issues. The article contributes to the simulation hypothesis literature and is the first to provide a business model perspective on the simulation hypothesis. The article discusses theoretical and practical implications and identifies opportunities for future research related to sustainability, digital transformation, and Artificial Intelligence (AI).</description>

      <title>Three Disclaimers for Safe Disclosure: A Cardwriter for Reporting the Use of Generative AI in Writing Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in the academic writing process. This is despite the current lack of unified framework for reporting the use of machine assistance. In this work, we propose "Cardwriter", an intuitive interface that produces a short report for authors to declare their use of generative AI in their writing process. The demo is available online, at https://cardwriter.vercel.app</description>

      <title>VRPD-DT: Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones Under Dynamically Changing Traffic Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vehicle routing problem with drones (VRP-D) is to determine the optimal routes of trucks and drones such that the total operational cost is minimized in a scenario where the trucks work in tandem with the drones to deliver parcels to customers. While various heuristic algorithms have been developed to address the problem, existing solutions are built based on simplistic cost models, overlooking the temporal dynamics of the costs, which fluctuate depending on the dynamically changing traffic conditions. In this paper, we present a novel problem called the vehicle routing problem with drones under dynamically changing traffic conditions (VRPD-DT) to address the limitation of existing VRP-D solutions. We design a novel cost model that factors in the actual travel distance and projected travel time, computed using a machine learning-driven travel time prediction algorithm. A variable neighborhood descent (VND) algorithm is developed to find the optimal truck-drone routes under the dynamics of traffic conditions through incorporation of the travel time prediction model. A simulation study was performed to evaluate the performance compared with a state-of-the-art VRP-D heuristic solution. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm in various delivery scenarios.</description>

      <title>A computational model for gender asset gap management with a focus on gender disparity in land acquisition and land tenure security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gender inequality is a significant concern in many cultures, as women face significant barriers to asset acquisition particularly land ownership and control. Land acquisition and land tenure security are complex issues that affect various cultural groups differently, leading to disparities in access and ownership especially when superimposed with other socio-economic issues like gender inequality. Measuring the severity of these issues across different cultural groups is challenging due to variations in cultural norms, expectations and effectiveness of the measurement framework to correctly assess the level of severity. While nominal measures of gender asset gap provide valuable insights into land acquisition and tenure security issues, they do not fully capture the nuances of cultural differences and the impact of governmental and corporate policies that influence gender disparity in land ownership and control. The proposed framework aims to fill this gap by incorporating cultural and policy factors in developing a new measurement framework equipped with a more robust, comprehensive metric to standardize the approach to assessing the severity of gender asset disparity in a general sense but with a focus on land acquisition and tenure security to engender more effective interventions and policy recommendations.</description>

      <title>LLeMpower: Understanding Disparities in the Control and Access of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a powerful technology that augment human skill to create new opportunities, akin to the development of steam engines and the internet. However, LLMs come with a high cost. They require significant computing resources and energy to train and serve. Inequity in their control and access has led to concentration of ownership and power to a small collection of corporations. In our study, we collect training and inference requirements for various LLMs. We then analyze the economic strengths of nations and organizations in the context of developing and serving these models. Additionally, we also look at whether individuals around the world can access and use this emerging technology. We compare and contrast these groups to show that these technologies are monopolized by a surprisingly few entities. We conclude with a qualitative study on the ethical implications of our findings and discuss future directions towards equity in LLM access.</description>

      <title>A Legal Risk Taxonomy for Generative Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, this paper presents a taxonomy of legal risks associated with generative AI (GenAI) by breaking down complex legal concepts to provide a common understanding of potential legal challenges for developing and deploying GenAI models. The methodology is based on (1) examining the legal claims that have been filed in existing lawsuits and (2) evaluating the reasonably foreseeable legal claims that may be filed in future lawsuits. First, we identified 22 lawsuits against prominent GenAI entities and tallied the claims of each lawsuit. From there, we identified seven claims that are cited at least four times across these lawsuits as the most likely claims for future GenAI lawsuits. For each of these seven claims, we describe the elements of the claim (what the plaintiff must prove to prevail) and provide an example of how it may apply to GenAI. Next, we identified 30 other potential claims that we consider to be more speculative, because they have been included in fewer than four lawsuits or have yet to be filed. We further separated those 30 claims into 19 that are most likely to be made in relation to pre-deployment of GenAI models and 11 that are more likely to be made in connection with post-deployment of GenAI models since the legal risks will vary between entities that create versus deploy them. For each of these claims, we describe the elements of the claim and the potential remedies that plaintiffs may seek to help entities determine their legal risks in developing or deploying GenAI. Lastly, we close the paper by noting the novelty of GenAI technology and propose some applications for the paper's taxonomy in driving further research.</description>

      <title>Language-Agnostic Modeling of Wikipedia Articles for Content Quality Assessment across Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wikipedia is the largest web repository of free knowledge. Volunteer editors devote time and effort to creating and expanding articles in more than 300 language editions. As content quality varies from article to article, editors also spend substantial time rating articles with specific criteria. However, keeping these assessments complete and up-to-date is largely impossible given the ever-changing nature of Wikipedia. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel computational framework for modeling the quality of Wikipedia articles.
  State-of-the-art approaches to model Wikipedia article quality have leveraged machine learning techniques with language-specific features. In contrast, our framework is based on language-agnostic structural features extracted from the articles, a set of universal weights, and a language version-specific normalization criterion. Therefore, we ensure that all language editions of Wikipedia can benefit from our framework, even those that do not have their own quality assessment scheme. Using this framework, we have built datasets with the feature values and quality scores of all revisions of all articles in the existing language versions of Wikipedia. We provide a descriptive analysis of these resources and a benchmark of our framework. In addition, we discuss possible downstream tasks to be addressed with these datasets, which are released for public use.</description>

Abstract: Although there has been a growing interest among industries to integrate generative LLMs into their services, limited experiences and scarcity of resources acts as a barrier in launching and servicing large-scale LLM-based conversational services. In this paper, we share our experiences in developing and operating generative AI models within a national-scale search engine, with a specific focus on the sensitiveness of user queries. We propose a taxonomy for sensitive search queries, outline our approaches, and present a comprehensive analysis report on sensitive queries from actual users.</description>

      <title>Sentiment analysis and random forest to classify LLM versus human source applied to Scientific Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After the launch of ChatGPT v.4 there has been a global vivid discussion on the ability of this artificial intelligence powered platform and some other similar ones for the automatic production of all kinds of texts, including scientific and technical texts. This has triggered a reflection in many institutions on whether education and academic procedures should be adapted to the fact that in future many texts we read will not be written by humans (students, scholars, etc.), at least, not entirely. In this work it is proposed a new methodology to classify texts coming from an automatic text production engine or a human, based on Sentiment Analysis as a source for feature engineering independent variables and then train with them a Random Forest classification algorithm. Using four different sentiment lexicons, a number of new features where produced, and then fed to a machine learning random forest methodology, to train such a model. Results seem very convincing that this may be a promising research line to detect fraud, in such environments where human are supposed to be the source of texts.</description>

      <title>ALERT: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Assessing Large Language Models' Safety through Red Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When building Large Language Models (LLMs), it is paramount to bear safety in mind and protect them with guardrails. Indeed, LLMs should never generate content promoting or normalizing harmful, illegal, or unethical behavior that may contribute to harm to individuals or society. This principle applies to both normal and adversarial use. In response, we introduce ALERT, a large-scale benchmark to assess safety based on a novel fine-grained risk taxonomy. It is designed to evaluate the safety of LLMs through red teaming methodologies and consists of more than 45k instructions categorized using our novel taxonomy. By subjecting LLMs to adversarial testing scenarios, ALERT aims to identify vulnerabilities, inform improvements, and enhance the overall safety of the language models. Furthermore, the fine-grained taxonomy enables researchers to perform an in-depth evaluation that also helps one to assess the alignment with various policies. In our experiments, we extensively evaluate 10 popular open- and closed-source LLMs and demonstrate that many of them still struggle to attain reasonable levels of safety.</description>

      <title>Predictive Modelling of Air Quality Index (AQI) Across Diverse Cities and States of India using Machine Learning: Investigating the Influence of Punjab's Stubble Burning on AQI Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air pollution is a common and serious problem nowadays and it cannot be ignored as it has harmful impacts on human health. To address this issue proactively, people should be aware of their surroundings, which means the environment where they survive. With this motive, this research has predicted the AQI based on different air pollutant concentrations in the atmosphere. The dataset used for this research has been taken from the official website of CPCB. The dataset has the air pollutant concentration from 22 different monitoring stations in different cities of Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab. This data is checked for null values and outliers. But, the most important thing to note is the correct understanding and imputation of such values rather than ignoring or doing wrong imputation. The time series data has been used in this research which is tested for stationarity using The Dickey-Fuller test. Further different ML models like CatBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM regressor, time series model SARIMAX, and deep learning model LSTM have been used to predict AQI. For the performance evaluation of different models, I used MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R2. It is observed that Random Forest performed better as compared to other models.</description>

      <title>PraFFL: A Preference-Aware Scheme in Fair Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness in federated learning has emerged as a critical concern, aiming to develop an unbiased model for any special group (e.g., male or female) of sensitive features. However, there is a trade-off between model performance and fairness, i.e., improving fairness will decrease model performance. Existing approaches have characterized such a trade-off by introducing hyperparameters to quantify client's preferences for fairness and model performance. Nevertheless, these methods are limited to scenarios where each client has only a single pre-defined preference. In practical systems, each client may simultaneously have multiple preferences for the model performance and fairness. The key challenge is to design a method that allows the model to adapt to diverse preferences of each client in real time. To this end, we propose a Preference-aware scheme in Fair Federated Learning paradigm (called PraFFL). PraFFL can adaptively adjust the model based on each client's preferences to meet their needs. We theoretically prove that PraFFL can provide the optimal model for client's arbitrary preferences. Experimental results show that our proposed PraFFL outperforms five existing fair federated learning algorithms in terms of the model's capability in adapting to clients' different preferences.</description>

      <title>Adapting Mental Health Prediction Tasks for Cross-lingual Learning via Meta-Training and In-context Learning with Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timely identification is essential for the efficient handling of mental health illnesses such as depression. However, the current research fails to adequately address the prediction of mental health conditions from social media data in low-resource African languages like Swahili. This study introduces two distinct approaches utilising model-agnostic meta-learning and leveraging large language models (LLMs) to address this gap. Experiments are conducted on three datasets translated to low-resource language and applied to four mental health tasks, which include stress, depression, depression severity and suicidal ideation prediction. we first apply a meta-learning model with self-supervision, which results in improved model initialisation for rapid adaptation and cross-lingual transfer. The results show that our meta-trained model performs significantly better than standard fine-tuning methods, outperforming the baseline fine-tuning in macro F1 score with 18\% and 0.8\% over XLM-R and mBERT. In parallel, we use LLMs' in-context learning capabilities to assess their performance accuracy across the Swahili mental health prediction tasks by analysing different cross-lingual prompting approaches. Our analysis showed that Swahili prompts performed better than cross-lingual prompts but less than English prompts. Our findings show that in-context learning can be achieved through cross-lingual transfer through carefully crafted prompt templates with examples and instructions.</description>

      <title>Privacy at a Price: Exploring its Dual Impact on AI Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The worldwide adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning models, particularly in critical sectors, such as healthcare and finance, presents substantial challenges in maintaining individual privacy and fairness. These two elements are vital to a trustworthy environment for learning systems. While numerous studies have concentrated on protecting individual privacy through differential privacy (DP) mechanisms, emerging research indicates that differential privacy in machine learning models can unequally impact separate demographic subgroups regarding prediction accuracy. This leads to a fairness concern, and manifests as biased performance. Although the prevailing view is that enhancing privacy intensifies fairness disparities, a smaller, yet significant, subset of research suggests the opposite view. In this article, with extensive evaluation results, we demonstrate that the impact of differential privacy on fairness is not monotonous. Instead, we observe that the accuracy disparity initially grows as more DP noise (enhanced privacy) is added to the ML process, but subsequently diminishes at higher privacy levels with even more noise. Moreover, implementing gradient clipping in the differentially private stochastic gradient descent ML method can mitigate the negative impact of DP noise on fairness. This mitigation is achieved by moderating the disparity growth through a lower clipping threshold.</description>

      <title>Utility-Fairness Trade-Offs and How to Find Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When building classification systems with demographic fairness considerations, there are two objectives to satisfy: 1) maximizing utility for the specific task and 2) ensuring fairness w.r.t. a known demographic attribute. These objectives often compete, so optimizing both can lead to a trade-off between utility and fairness. While existing works acknowledge the trade-offs and study their limits, two questions remain unanswered: 1) What are the optimal trade-offs between utility and fairness? and 2) How can we numerically quantify these trade-offs from data for a desired prediction task and demographic attribute of interest? This paper addresses these questions. We introduce two utility-fairness trade-offs: the Data-Space and Label-Space Trade-off. The trade-offs reveal three regions within the utility-fairness plane, delineating what is fully and partially possible and impossible. We propose U-FaTE, a method to numerically quantify the trade-offs for a given prediction task and group fairness definition from data samples. Based on the trade-offs, we introduce a new scheme for evaluating representations. An extensive evaluation of fair representation learning methods and representations from over 1000 pre-trained models revealed that most current approaches are far from the estimated and achievable fairness-utility trade-offs across multiple datasets and prediction tasks.</description>

Abstract: Evaluating the reliability of news sources is a routine task for journalists and organizations committed to acquiring and disseminating accurate information. Recent research has shown that predicting sources' reliability represents an important first-prior step in addressing additional challenges such as fake news detection and fact-checking. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for source reliability estimation that leverages reinforcement learning strategies for estimating the reliability degree of news sources. Contrary to previous research, our proposed approach models the problem as the estimation of a reliability degree, and not a reliability label, based on how all the news media sources interact with each other on the Web. We validated the effectiveness of our method on a news media reliability dataset that is an order of magnitude larger than comparable existing datasets. Results show that the estimated reliability degrees strongly correlates with journalists-provided scores (Spearman=0.80) and can effectively predict reliability labels (macro-avg. F$_1$ score=81.05). We release our implementation and dataset, aiming to provide a valuable resource for the NLP community working on information verification.</description>

      <title>If there's a Trigger Warning, then where's the Trigger? Investigating Trigger Warnings at the Passage Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trigger warnings are labels that preface documents with sensitive content if this content could be perceived as harmful by certain groups of readers. Since warnings about a document intuitively need to be shown before reading it, authors usually assign trigger warnings at the document level. What parts of their writing prompted them to assign a warning, however, remains unclear. We investigate for the first time the feasibility of identifying the triggering passages of a document, both manually and computationally. We create a dataset of 4,135 English passages, each annotated with one of eight common trigger warnings. In a large-scale evaluation, we then systematically evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuned and few-shot classifiers, and their generalizability. We find that trigger annotation belongs to the group of subjective annotation tasks in NLP, and that automatic trigger classification remains challenging but feasible.</description>

      <title>Closing the Gap in the Trade-off between Fair Representations and Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid developments of various machine learning models and their deployments in several applications has led to discussions around the importance of looking beyond the accuracies of these models. Fairness of such models is one such aspect that is deservedly gaining more attention. In this work, we analyse the natural language representations of documents and sentences (i.e., encodings) for any embedding-level bias that could potentially also affect the fairness of the downstream tasks that rely on them. We identify bias in these encodings either towards or against different sub-groups based on the difference in their reconstruction errors along various subsets of principal components. We explore and recommend ways to mitigate such bias in the encodings while also maintaining a decent accuracy in classification models that use them.</description>

      <title>Statistical learning for constrained functional parameters in infinite-dimensional models with applications in fair machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constrained learning has become increasingly important, especially in the realm of algorithmic fairness and machine learning. In these settings, predictive models are developed specifically to satisfy pre-defined notions of fairness. Here, we study the general problem of constrained statistical machine learning through a statistical functional lens. We consider learning a function-valued parameter of interest under the constraint that one or several pre-specified real-valued functional parameters equal zero or are otherwise bounded. We characterize the constrained functional parameter as the minimizer of a penalized risk criterion using a Lagrange multiplier formulation. We show that closed-form solutions for the optimal constrained parameter are often available, providing insight into mechanisms that drive fairness in predictive models. Our results also suggest natural estimators of the constrained parameter that can be constructed by combining estimates of unconstrained parameters of the data generating distribution. Thus, our estimation procedure for constructing fair machine learning algorithms can be applied in conjunction with any statistical learning approach and off-the-shelf software. We demonstrate the generality of our method by explicitly considering a number of examples of statistical fairness constraints and implementing the approach using several popular learning approaches.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Statutory Reasoning via Software Engineering Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies such as pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has opened up new frontiers in computational law. An exciting area of development is the use of AI to automate the rule-based reasoning inherent in statutory and contract law. While this form of reasoning has long been studied using classical techniques of natural language processing (NLP) and formal logic, recent solutions increasingly make use of LLMs; though they are far from perfect.
  The advent of GenAI has made it possible to treat many of these natural language documents essentially as programs that compute a result given some set of facts. As such, it should be possible to understand, debug, maintain, evolve, and fix these documents using well-studied techniques from the field of software engineering. This article introduces several concepts of automated software testing and program analysis that could potentially be useful in computational law when applied to AI-driven analysis of statutes and contracts.</description>

      <title>Scalable Two-Minute Feedback: Digital, Lecture-Accompanying Survey as a Continuous Feedback Instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detailed feedback on courses and lecture content is essential for their improvement and also serves as a tool for reflection. However, feedback methods are often only used sporadically, especially in mass courses, because collecting and analyzing feedback in a timely manner is often a challenge for teachers. Moreover, the current situation of the students or the changing workload during the semester are usually not taken into account either. For a holistic investigation, the article used a digital survey format as formative feedback which attempts to measure student stress in a quantitative part and to address the participants' reflection in a qualitative part, as well as to collect general suggestions for improvement (based on the so-called One-Minute Paper) at two educational institutions. The feedback during the semester is evaluated qualitatively and discussed on a meta-level and special features (e.g. reflections on student work ethic or other courses) are addressed. The results show a low, but constant rate of feedback. Responses mostly cover topics of the lecture content or organizational aspects and were intensively used to report issues within the lecture. In addition, artificial intelligence (AI) support in the form of a large language model was tested and showed promising results in summarizing the open-ended responses for the teacher. Finally, the experiences from the lecturers are reflected upon and the results as well as possibilities for improvement are discussed.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Nibbler: An Open Red-Teaming Method for Identifying Diverse Harms in Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of text-to-image (T2I) generative AI models reaching wide audiences, it is critical to evaluate model robustness against non-obvious attacks to mitigate the generation of offensive images. By focusing on ``implicitly adversarial'' prompts (those that trigger T2I models to generate unsafe images for non-obvious reasons), we isolate a set of difficult safety issues that human creativity is well-suited to uncover. To this end, we built the Adversarial Nibbler Challenge, a red-teaming methodology for crowdsourcing a diverse set of implicitly adversarial prompts. We have assembled a suite of state-of-the-art T2I models, employed a simple user interface to identify and annotate harms, and engaged diverse populations to capture long-tail safety issues that may be overlooked in standard testing. The challenge is run in consecutive rounds to enable a sustained discovery and analysis of safety pitfalls in T2I models.
  In this paper, we present an in-depth account of our methodology, a systematic study of novel attack strategies and discussion of safety failures revealed by challenge participants. We also release a companion visualization tool for easy exploration and derivation of insights from the dataset. The first challenge round resulted in over 10k prompt-image pairs with machine annotations for safety. A subset of 1.5k samples contains rich human annotations of harm types and attack styles. We find that 14% of images that humans consider harmful are mislabeled as ``safe'' by machines. We have identified new attack strategies that highlight the complexity of ensuring T2I model robustness. Our findings emphasize the necessity of continual auditing and adaptation as new vulnerabilities emerge. We are confident that this work will enable proactive, iterative safety assessments and promote responsible development of T2I models.</description>

      <title>Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Driving: A Comprehensive Overview and Field Guide for Future Research Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.11561v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving has achieved significant milestones in research and development over the last two decades. There is increasing interest in the field as the deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) promises safer and more ecologically friendly transportation systems. With the rapid progress in computationally powerful artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, AVs can sense their environment with high precision, make safe real-time decisions, and operate reliably without human intervention. However, intelligent decision-making in such vehicles is not generally understandable by humans in the current state of the art, and such deficiency hinders this technology from being socially acceptable. Hence, aside from making safe real-time decisions, AVs must also explain their AI-guided decision-making process in order to be regulatory compliant across many jurisdictions. Our study sheds comprehensive light on the development of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches for AVs. In particular, we make the following contributions. First, we provide a thorough overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging approaches for XAI-based autonomous driving. We then propose a conceptual framework that considers all the essential elements for explainable end-to-end autonomous driving. Finally, we present XAI-based prospective directions and emerging paradigms for future directions that hold promise for enhancing transparency, trustworthiness, and societal acceptance of AVs.</description>

      <title>SatCLIP: Global, General-Purpose Location Embeddings with Satellite Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geographic information is essential for modeling tasks in fields ranging from ecology to epidemiology. However, extracting relevant location characteristics for a given task can be challenging, often requiring expensive data fusion or distillation from massive global imagery datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce Satellite Contrastive Location-Image Pretraining (SatCLIP). This global, general-purpose geographic location encoder learns an implicit representation of locations by matching CNN and ViT inferred visual patterns of openly available satellite imagery with their geographic coordinates. The resulting SatCLIP location encoder efficiently summarizes the characteristics of any given location for convenient use in downstream tasks. In our experiments, we use SatCLIP embeddings to improve prediction performance on nine diverse location-dependent tasks including temperature prediction, animal recognition, and population density estimation. Across tasks, SatCLIP consistently outperforms alternative location encoders and improves geographic generalization by encoding visual similarities of spatially distant environments. These results demonstrate the potential of vision-location models to learn meaningful representations of our planet from the vast, varied, and largely untapped modalities of geospatial data.</description>

      <title>Corn Yield Prediction Model with Deep Neural Networks for Smallholder Farmer Decision Support System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crop yield prediction has been modeled on the assumption that there is no interaction between weather and soil variables. However, this paper argues that an interaction exists, and it can be finely modelled using the Kendall Correlation coefficient. Given the nonlinearity of the interaction between weather and soil variables, a deep neural network regressor (DNNR) is carefully designed with consideration to the depth, number of neurons of the hidden layers, and the hyperparameters with their optimizations. Additionally, a new metric, the average of absolute root squared error (ARSE) is proposed to combine the strengths of root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). With the ARSE metric, the proposed DNNR(s), optimised random forest regressor (RFR) and the extreme gradient boosting regressor (XGBR) achieved impressively small yield errors, 0.0172 t/ha, and 0.0243 t/ha, 0.0001 t/ha, and 0.001 t/ha, respectively. However, the DNNR(s), with changes to the explanatory variables to ensure generalizability to unforeseen data, DNNR(s) performed best. Further analysis reveals that a strong interaction does exist between weather and soil variables. Precisely, yield is observed to increase when precipitation is reduced and silt increased, and vice-versa. However, the degree of decrease or increase is not quantified in this paper. Contrary to existing yield models targeted towards agricultural policies and global food security, the goal of the proposed corn yield model is to empower the smallholder farmer to farm smartly and intelligently, thus the prediction model is integrated into a mobile application that includes education, and a farmer-to-market access module.</description>

      <title>Youth as Peer Auditors: Engaging Teenagers with Algorithm Auditing of Machine Learning Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) applications become more pervasive in youth lives, supporting them to interact, design, and evaluate applications is crucial. This paper positions youth as auditors of their peers' ML-powered applications to better understand algorithmic systems' opaque inner workings and external impacts. In a two-week workshop, 13 youth (ages 14-15) designed and audited ML-powered applications. We analyzed pre/post clinical interviews in which youth were presented with auditing tasks. The analyses show that after the workshop all youth identified algorithmic biases and inferred dataset and model design issues. Youth also discussed algorithmic justice issues and ML model improvements. Furthermore, youth reflected that auditing provided them new perspectives on model functionality and ideas to improve their own models. This work contributes (1) a conceptualization of algorithm auditing for youth; and (2) empirical evidence of the potential benefits of auditing. We discuss potential uses of algorithm auditing in learning and child-computer interaction research.</description>

      <title>Public-private funding models in open source software development: A case study on scikit-learn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Governments are increasingly funding open source software (OSS) development to address concerns regarding software security, digital sovereignty, and national competitiveness in science and innovation. While announcements of governmental funding are generally well-received by OSS developers, we still have a limited understanding of how they evaluate the relative benefits and drawbacks of such funding compared to other types of funding. This paper explores this question through a case study on scikit-learn, a Python library for machine learning, whose funding combines research grants, commercial sponsorship, community donations, and a 32 million Euro grant from France's artificial intelligence strategy. Through 25 interviews with scikit-learn's maintainers and funders, this study makes two key contributions to research and practice. First, the study contributes novel findings about the design and implementation of a public-private funding model in an OSS project. It sheds light on the respective roles that public and private funders have played in supporting scikit-learn, and the processes and governance mechanisms employed by the maintainers to balance their funders' diverse interests and to safeguard community interests. Second, it offers practical recommendations. For OSS developer communities, it illustrates the benefits of a diversified funding model for balancing the merits and drawbacks of different funding sources and mitigating dependence on single funders. For companies, it serves as a reminder that sponsoring developers or OSS projects can significantly help maintainers, who often struggle with limited resources and towering workloads. For governments, it emphasises the importance of funding the maintenance of existing OSS in addition to funding the development of new software or features. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research.</description>
