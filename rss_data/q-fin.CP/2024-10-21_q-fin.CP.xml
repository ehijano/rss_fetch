      <title>Simultaneously Solving FBSDEs with Neural Operators of Logarithmic Depth, Constant Width, and Sub-Linear Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forward-backwards stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) are central in optimal control, game theory, economics, and mathematical finance. Unfortunately, the available FBSDE solvers operate on \textit{individual} FBSDEs, meaning that they cannot provide a computationally feasible strategy for solving large families of FBSDEs as these solvers must be re-run several times. \textit{Neural operators} (NOs) offer an alternative approach for \textit{simultaneously solving} large families of FBSDEs by directly approximating the solution operator mapping \textit{inputs:} terminal conditions and dynamics of the backwards process to \textit{outputs:} solutions to the associated FBSDE. Though universal approximation theorems (UATs) guarantee the existence of such NOs, these NOs are unrealistically large. We confirm that ``small'' NOs can uniformly approximate the solution operator to structured families of FBSDEs with random terminal time, uniformly on suitable compact sets determined by Sobolev norms, to any prescribed error $\varepsilon&gt;0$ using a depth of $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$, a width of $\mathcal{O}(1)$, and a sub-linear rank; i.e. $\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon^r)$ for some $r&lt;1$. This result is rooted in our second main contribution, which shows that convolutional NOs of similar depth, width, and rank can approximate the solution operator to a broad class of Elliptic PDEs. A key insight here is that the convolutional layers of our NO can efficiently encode the Green's function associated to the Elliptic PDEs linked to our FBSDEs. A byproduct of our analysis is the first theoretical justification for the benefit of lifting channels in NOs: they exponentially decelerate the growth rate of the NO's rank.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Factor Allocation Leveraging Regime-Switching Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores dynamic factor allocation by analyzing the cyclical performance of factors through regime analysis. The authors focus on a U.S. equity investment universe comprising seven long-only indices representing the market and six style factors: value, size, momentum, quality, low volatility, and growth. Their approach integrates factor-specific regime inferences of each factor index's active performance relative to the market into the Black-Litterman model to construct a fully-invested, long-only multi-factor portfolio. First, the authors apply the sparse jump model (SJM) to identify bull and bear market regimes for individual factors, using a feature set based on risk and return measures from historical factor active returns, as well as variables reflecting the broader market environment. The regimes identified by the SJM exhibit enhanced stability and interpretability compared to traditional methods. A hypothetical single-factor long-short strategy is then used to assess these regime inferences and fine-tune hyperparameters, resulting in a positive Sharpe ratio of this strategy across all factors with low correlation among them. These regime inferences are then incorporated into the Black-Litterman framework to dynamically adjust allocations among the seven indices, with an equally weighted (EW) portfolio serving as the benchmark. Empirical results show that the constructed multi-factor portfolio significantly improves the information ratio (IR) relative to the market, raising it from just 0.05 for the EW benchmark to approximately 0.4. When measured relative to the EW benchmark itself, the dynamic allocation achieves an IR of around 0.4 to 0.5. The strategy also enhances absolute portfolio performance across key metrics such as the Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown.</description>

      <title>Alleviating Non-identifiability: a High-fidelity Calibration Objective for Financial Market Simulation with Multivariate Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16566v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-identifiability issue has been frequently reported in social simulation works, where different parameters of an agent-based simulation model yield indistinguishable simulated time series data under certain discrepancy metrics. This issue largely undermines the simulation fidelity yet lacks dedicated investigations. This paper theoretically demonstrates that incorporating multiple time series data features during the model calibration phase can exponentially alleviate non-identifiability as the number of features increases. To implement this theoretical finding, a maximization-based aggregation function is proposed based on existing discrepancy metrics to form a new calibration objective function. For verification, the task of calibrating the Financial Market Simulation (FMS), a typical yet complex social simulation, is considered. Empirical studies confirm the significant improvements in alleviating the non-identifiability of calibration tasks. Furthermore, as a model-agnostic method, it achieves much higher simulation fidelity of the chosen FMS model on both synthetic and real market data. Hence, this work is expected to provide not only a rigorous understanding of non-identifiability in social simulation but also an off-the-shelf high-fidelity calibration objective function for FMS.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Empirical Validation of Heston Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on the application of the Heston model to option pricing, employing both theoretical derivations and empirical validations. The Heston model, known for its ability to incorporate stochastic volatility, is derived and analyzed to evaluate its effectiveness in pricing options. For practical application, we utilize Monte Carlo simulations alongside market data from the Crude Oil WTI market to test the model's accuracy. Machine learning based optimization methods are also applied for the estimation of the five Heston parameters. By calibrating the model with real-world data, we assess its robustness and relevance in current financial markets, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical finance models and their practical implementations.</description>
