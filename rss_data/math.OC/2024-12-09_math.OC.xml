      <title>Stokes-Lagrange and Stokes-Dirac representations of $N$-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems for modelling and control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the port-Hamiltonian framework by introducing the concept of Stokes-Lagrange structure, which enables the implicit definition of a Hamiltonian over an $N$-dimensional domain and incorporates energy ports into the system. This new framework parallels the existing Dirac and Stokes-Dirac structures. We propose the Stokes-Lagrange structure as a specific case where the subspace is explicitly defined via differential operators that satisfy an integration by parts formula. By examining various examples through the lens of the Stokes-Lagrange structure, we demonstrate the existence of multiple equivalent system representations. These representations provide significant advantages for both numerical simulation and control design, offering additional tools for the modelling and control of port-Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Approximate Computation of Loss Probability for Queueing System with Capacity Sharing Discipline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multi-channel queueing system is considered. The arriving requests differ in their type. Requests of each type arrive according to a Poisson process. The number of channels required for service with the rate equal to 1 depends of the request type. If a request is serviced with the rate equal to 1, then, by definition, the length of the request equals to the total service time. If at arrival moment, the idle channels is sufficient, then the arriving request is serviced with the rate 1. If, at the arrival moment, there are no idle channel, then the arriving request is lost. If, at arrival moment, there are idle channels but the number of idle channels is not sufficient for servicing with rate 1, then the request begins to be in service with rate equal to the ratio of the number of idle channels to the number of the channels required for service with the rate 1. If a request is serviced with a rate less than 1 and another request leaves the system, then the service rate increases for the request in consideration. Approximate formula for loss probability has been proposed. The accuracy of approximation is estimated. Approximate values are compared with exact values found from the system of equations for the related Markov chain stationary state probabilities.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Gaussian Processes as Linear Model Predictive Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel algorithm for controlling linear time invariant systems in a tracking problem. The controller is based on a Gaussian Process (GP) whose realizations satisfy a system of linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. Control inputs for tracking are determined by conditioning the prior GP on the setpoints, i.e. control as inference. The resulting Model Predictive Control scheme incorporates pointwise soft constraints by introducing virtual setpoints to the posterior Gaussian process. We show theoretically that our controller satisfies asymptotical stability for the optimal control problem by leveraging general results from Bayesian inference and demonstrate this result in a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Global minimization of a minimum of a finite collection of functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the global minimization of a particular type of minimum structured optimization problems wherein the variables must belong to some basic set, the feasible domain is described by the intersection of a large number of functional constraints and the objective stems as the pointwise minimum of a collection of functional pieces. Among others, this setting includes all non-convex piecewise linear problems. The global minimum of a minimum structured problem can be computed using a simple enumeration scheme by solving a sequence of individual problems involving each a single piece and then taking the smallest individual minimum.
  We propose a new algorithm, called Upper-Lower Optimization (ULO), tackling problems from the aforementioned class. Our method does not require the solution of every individual problem listed in the baseline enumeration scheme, yielding potential substantial computational gains. It alternates between (a) local-search steps, which minimize upper models, and (b) suggestion steps, which optimize lower models. We prove that ULO can return a solution of any prescribed global optimality accuracy. According to a computational complexity model based on the cost of solving the individual problems, we analyze in which practical scenarios ULO is expected to outperform the baseline enumeration scheme. Finally, we empirically validate our approach on a set of piecewise linear programs (PL) of incremental difficulty.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic compatibility of parametrized optimal design problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optimal design problems where the design corresponds to a coefficient in the principal part of the state equation. The state equation, in addition, is parameter dependent, and we allow it to change type in the limit of this (modeling) parameter. We develop a framework that guarantees asymptotic compatibility, that is unconditional convergence with respect to modeling and discretization parameters to the solution of the corresponding limiting problems. This framework is then applied to two distinct classes of problems where the modeling parameter represents the degree of nonlocality. Specifically, we show unconditional convergence of optimal design problems when the state equation is either a scalar-valued fractional equation, or a strongly coupled system of nonlocal equations derived from the bond-based model of peridynamics.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Solutions for Minimum-Time Paths of Dubins Airplane in Steady Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the minimum-time path-planning problem for a Dubins airplane under the influence of steady wind. The path-planning problem, by transforming into the air-relative frame, is equivalent to finding the minimum-time control strategy for a Dubins airplane to intercept a moving target. In the air-relative frame, by applying Pontryagin's maximum principle, the candidates for the minimum-time solution are categorized into a family of four types: SC, CC, CCC, CSC, where S denotes a straight line segment and C denotes a circular segment. Furthermore, the geometric properties for each type are analyzed, indicating that the paths of SC and CC can be obtained by finding the roots of a quadratic equation, while the paths of CCC and CSC are determined by the roots of some nonlinear transcendental equations. An improved bisection method is presented in the paper so that all the roots of the transcendental equations can be computed within a constant time. As a consequence, the globally optimal path can be obtained within a constant time by comparing all the candidates of the four types. Finally, numerical examples are presented, showing that the closed-form solutions derived in the paper can ensure to find the globally optimal solution by comparing with existing methods in the literature.</description>

      <title>Optimal control under uncertainty with joint chance state constraints: almost-everywhere bounds, variance reduction, and application to (bi-)linear elliptic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optimal control of PDEs under uncertainty with the state variable subject to joint chance constraints. The controls are deterministic, but the states are probabilistic due to random variables in the governing equation. Joint chance constraints ensure that the random state variable meets pointwise bounds with high probability. For linear governing PDEs and elliptically distributed random parameters, we prove existence and uniqueness results for almost-everywhere state bounds. Using the spherical-radial decomposition (SRD) of the uncertain variable, we prove that when the probability is very large or small, the resulting Monte Carlo estimator for the chance constraint probability exhibits substantially reduced variance compared to the standard Monte Carlo estimator. We further illustrate how the SRD can be leveraged to efficiently compute derivatives of the probability function, and discuss different expansions of the uncertain variable in the governing equation. Numerical examples for linear and bilinear PDEs compare the performance of Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo sampling methods, examining probability estimation convergence as the number of samples increases. We also study how the accuracy of the probabilities depends on the truncation of the random variable expansion, and numerically illustrate the variance reduction of the SRD.</description>

      <title>A Parametric, Second-Order Cone Representable Model of Fairness for Decision-Making Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article develops a parametric model of fairness called "$\varepsilon$-fairness" that can be represented using a single second-order cone constraint and incorporated into existing decision-making problem formulations without impacting the complexity of solution techniques. We develop the model from the fundamental result of finite-dimensional norm equivalence in linear algebra and show that this model has a closed-form relationship to an existing metric for measuring fairness widely used in the literature. Finally, a simple case study on the optimal operation of a damaged power transmission network illustrates its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>ROS: A GNN-based Relax-Optimize-and-Sample Framework for Max-k-Cut Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Max-k-Cut problem is a fundamental combinatorial optimization challenge that generalizes the classic NP-complete Max-Cut problem. While relaxation techniques are commonly employed to tackle Max-k-Cut, they often lack guarantees of equivalence between the solutions of the original problem and its relaxation. To address this issue, we introduce the Relax-Optimize-and-Sample (ROS) framework. In particular, we begin by relaxing the discrete constraints to the continuous probability simplex form. Next, we pre-train and fine-tune a graph neural network model to efficiently optimize the relaxed problem. Subsequently, we propose a sampling-based construction algorithm to map the continuous solution back to a high-quality Max-k-Cut solution. By integrating geometric landscape analysis with statistical theory, we establish the consistency of function values between the continuous solution and its mapped counterpart. Extensive experimental results on random regular graphs and the Gset benchmark demonstrate that the proposed ROS framework effectively scales to large instances with up to 20000 nodes in just a few seconds, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, ROS exhibits strong generalization capabilities across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution instances, underscoring its effectiveness for large-scale optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>On Mean Field Monotonicity Conditions from Control Theoretical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, from the viewpoint of control theory, we discuss the relationships among the commonly used monotonicity conditions that ensure the well-posedness of the solutions arising from problems of mean field games (MFGs) and mean field type control (MFTC). We first introduce the well-posedness of general forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) defined on some suitably chosen Hilbert spaces under the $\beta$-monotonicity. We then propose a monotonicity condition for the MFG, namely partitioning the running cost functional into two parts, so that both parts still depend on the control and the state distribution, yet one satisfies a strong convexity and a small mean field effect condition, while the other has a newly introduced displacement quasi-monotonicity. To the best of our knowledge, the latter quasi type condition has not yet been discussed in the contemporary literature, and it can be considered as a bit more general monotonicity condition than those commonly used. Besides, for the MFG, we show that convexity and small mean field effect condition for the first part of running cost functional and the quasi-monotonicity condition for the second part together imply the $\beta$-monotonicity and thus the well-posedness for the associated FBSDEs. For the MFTC problem, we show that the $\beta$-monotonicity for the corresponding FBSDEs is simply the convexity assumption on the cost functional. Finally, we consider a more general setting where the drift functional is allowed to be non-linear for both MFG and MFTC problems.</description>

      <title>Global Optimization with A Power-Transformed Objective and Gaussian Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method that solves global optimization problems in two steps: (1) perform a (exponential) power-$N$ transformation to the not-necessarily differentiable objective function $f$ to obtain $f_N$, and (2) optimize the Gaussian-smoothed $f_N$ with stochastic approximations. Under mild conditions on $f$, for any $\delta&gt;0$, we prove that with a sufficiently large power $N_\delta$, this method converges to a solution in the $\delta$-neighborhood of $f$'s global maximum point. The convergence rate is $O(d^2\sigma^4\varepsilon^{-2})$, which is faster than both the standard and single-loop homotopy methods. Extensive experiments show that our method requires significantly fewer iterations than other compared algorithms to produce a high-quality solution.</description>

      <title>Constructing Uncertainty Sets for Robust Risk Measures: A Composition of $\phi$-Divergences Approach to Combat Tail Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Risk measures, which typically evaluate the impact of extreme losses, are highly sensitive to misspecification in the tails. This paper studies a robust optimization approach to combat tail uncertainty by proposing a unifying framework to construct uncertainty sets for a broad class of risk measures, given a specified nominal model. Our framework is based on a parametrization of robust risk measures using two (or multiple) $\phi$-divergence functions, which enables us to provide uncertainty sets that are tailored to both the sensitivity of each risk measure to tail losses and the tail behavior of the nominal distribution. In addition, our formulation allows for a tractable computation of robust risk measures, and elicitation of $\phi$-divergences that describe a decision maker's risk and ambiguity preferences.</description>

      <title>Communication Compression for Distributed Learning without Control Variates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed learning algorithms, such as the ones employed in Federated Learning (FL), require communication compression to reduce the cost of client uploads. The compression methods used in practice are often biased, which require error feedback to achieve convergence when the compression is aggressive. In turn, error feedback requires client-specific control variates, which directly contradicts privacy-preserving principles and requires stateful clients. In this paper, we propose Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), a novel distributed learning framework that allows highly compressible client updates by exploiting past aggregated updates, and does not require control variates. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative algorithm and provide a theoretical proof of CAFe's superiority to Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-smooth regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. Experimental results confirm that CAFe consistently outperforms distributed learning with direct compression and highlight the compressibility of the client updates with CAFe.</description>

      <title>A CAV-based perimeter-free regional traffic control strategy utilizing existing parking infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel perimeter-free regional traffic management strategy for traffic networks under a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) environment. The proposed strategy requires CAVs, especially those with long remaining travel distances, to temporarily wait at nearby parking facilities when the network is congested. After a designated holding time, these CAVs are allowed to re-enter the network. Doing so helps reduce congestion and improve overall operational efficiency. Unlike traditional perimeter control approaches that restrict inflows to congested regions, the proposed holding strategy leverages existing parking infrastructure to temporarily hold vehicles in a way that partially avoids local queue accumulation issues. The proposed method can be easily integrated with existing signal control methods and retains the maximum stability property of the original traffic signal control methods. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy not only reduces travel time for vehicles that are not held, but can also reduce travel times for some of the held vehicles as well, which serves as another key merit of the proposed approach. Compared to the two benchmark perimeter control algorithms, the proposed strategy is more robust against demand patterns and generates stronger improvements in the operational efficiency. Importantly, since the proposed strategy requires existing parking infrastructure, its performance has been demonstrated under various configurations of parking locations and capacities. Lastly, the proposed strategy is shown to be beneficial in a partial CAV environment where only a subset of vehicles are available for holding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents enhanced reductions of the bounded-weight and exact-weight Syndrome Decoding Problem (SDP) to a system of quadratic equations. Over $\mathbb{F}_2$, we improve on a previous work and study the degree of regularity of the modeling of the exact weight SDP. Additionally, we introduce a novel technique that transforms SDP instances over $\mathbb{F}_q$ into systems of polynomial equations and thoroughly investigate the dimension of their varieties. Experimental results are provided to evaluate the complexity of solving SDP instances using our models through Gr\"obner bases techniques.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Homogenisation of nonlinear minimum-cost flow problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the large-scale behaviour of nonlinear minimum-cost flow problems on random graphs. In such problems, a random nonlinear cost functional is minimised among all flows (discrete vector-fields) with a prescribed net flux through each vertex. On a stationary random graph embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$, our main result asserts that these problems converge, in the large-scale limit, to a continuous minimisation problem where an effective cost functional is minimised among all vector fields with prescribed divergence. Our main result is formulated using $\Gamma$-convergence and applies to multi-species problems. The proof employs the blow-up technique by Fonseca and M\"uller in a discrete setting. One of the main challenges overcome is the construction of the homogenised energy density on random graphs without a periodic structure.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Gradient Tracking over Time-varying Graphs for Decentralized Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02596v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized optimization over time-varying graphs has been increasingly common in modern machine learning with massive data stored on millions of mobile devices, such as in federated learning. This paper revisits the widely used accelerated gradient tracking and extends it to time-varying graphs. We prove that the practical single loop accelerated gradient tracking needs $O((\frac{\gamma}{1-\sigma_{\gamma}})^2\sqrt{\frac{L}{\epsilon}})$ and $O((\frac{\gamma}{1-\sigma_{\gamma}})^{1.5}\sqrt{\frac{L}{\mu}}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ iterations to reach an $\epsilon$-optimal solution over time-varying graphs when the problems are nonstrongly convex and strongly convex, respectively, where $\gamma$ and $\sigma_{\gamma}$ are two common constants charactering the network connectivity, $L$ and $\mu$ are the smoothness and strong convexity constants, respectively, and one iteration corresponds to one gradient oracle call and one communication round. Our convergence rates improve significantly over the ones of $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{5/7}})$ and $O((\frac{L}{\mu})^{5/7}\frac{1}{(1-\sigma)^{1.5}}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$, respectively, which were proved in the original literature of accelerated gradient tracking only for static graphs, where $\frac{\gamma}{1-\sigma_{\gamma}}$ equals $\frac{1}{1-\sigma}$ when the network is time-invariant. When combining with a multiple consensus subroutine, the dependence on the network connectivity constants can be further improved to $O(1)$ and $O(\frac{\gamma}{1-\sigma_{\gamma}})$ for the gradient oracle and communication round complexities, respectively. When the network is static, by employing the Chebyshev acceleration, our complexities exactly match the lower bounds without hiding any poly-logarithmic factor for both nonstrongly convex and strongly convex problems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Primal-Dual Three Operator Splitting Algorithm with Extension to Equivariant Regularization-by-Denoising</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we propose a stochastic primal-dual three-operator splitting algorithm (TOS-SPDHG) for solving a class of convex three-composite optimization problems. Our proposed scheme is a direct three-operator splitting extension of the SPDHG algorithm [Chambolle et al. 2018]. We provide theoretical convergence analysis showing ergodic $O(1/K)$ convergence rate, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in imaging inverse problems. Moreover, we further propose TOS-SPDHG-RED and TOS-SPDHG-eRED which utilizes the regularization-by-denoising (RED) framework to leverage pretrained deep denoising networks as priors.</description>

      <title>Extracting Koopman Operators for Prediction and Control of Non-linear Dynamics Using Two-stage Learning and Oblique Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Koopman operator framework provides a perspective that non-linear dynamics can be described through the lens of linear operators acting on function spaces. As the framework naturally yields linear embedding models, there have been extensive efforts to utilize it for control, where linear controller designs can be applied to control possibly nonlinear dynamics. However, it is challenging to successfully deploy this modeling procedure in a wide range of applications. In this work, some of the fundamental limitations of linear embedding models are addressed. We show a necessary condition for a linear embedding model to achieve zero modeling error, highlighting a trade-off relation between the model expressivity and a restriction on the model structure to allow the use of linear systems theories for nonlinear dynamics. To achieve good performance despite this trade-off, neural network-based modeling is proposed based on linear embedding with oblique projection, which is derived from a weak formulation of projection-based linear operator learning. We train the proposed model using a two-stage learning procedure, wherein the features and operators are initialized with orthogonal projection, followed by the main training process in which test functions characterizing the oblique projection are learned from data. The first stage achieves an optimality ensured by the orthogonal projection and the second stage improves the generalizability to various tasks by optimizing the model with the oblique projection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over other data-driven modeling methods by providing comprehensive numerical evaluations where four tasks are considered targeting three different systems.</description>

      <title>Viability and control of a delayed SIR epidemic with an ICU state constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies viability and control synthesis for a delayed SIR epidemic. The model integrates a constant delay representing an incubation/latency time. The control inputs model non-pharmaceutical interventions, while an intensive care unit (ICU) state-constraint is introduced to reflect the healthcare system's capacity. The arising delayed control system is analyzed via functional viability tools, providing insights into fulfilling the ICU constraint through feedback control maps. In particular, we consider two scenarios: first, we consider the case of general continuous initial conditions. Then, as a further refinement of our analysis, we assume that the initial conditions satisfy a Lipschitz continuity property, consistent with the considered model. The study compares the (in general, sub-optimal) obtained control policies with the optimal ones for the delay-free case, emphasizing the impact of the delay parameter. The obtained results are supported and illustrated, in a concluding section, by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Stochastic Control in Standard Borel Spaces: Centralized MDP Reductions, Near Optimality of Finite Window Local Information, and Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized stochastic control problems are intrinsically difficult to study because of the inapplicability of standard tools from centralized control such as dynamic programming and the resulting computational complexity. In this paper, we address some of these challenges for decentralized stochastic control with Borel spaces under three different but tightly related information structures under a unified theme: the one-step delayed information sharing pattern, the K-step periodic information sharing pattern, and the completely decentralized information structure where no sharing of information occurs. We will show that the one-step delayed and K-step periodic problems can be reduced to a centralized MDP, generalizing prior results which considered finite, linear, or static models, by addressing several measurability questions. The separated nature of policies under both information structures is then established. We then provide sufficient conditions for the transition kernels of both centralized reductions to be weak-Feller, which facilitates rigorous approximation and learning theoretic results. We will then show that for the completely decentralized control problem finite memory local policies are near optimal under a joint conditional mixing condition. This is achieved by obtaining a bound for finite memory policies which goes to zero as memory size increases. We will also provide a performance bound for the K-periodic problem, which results from replacing the full common information by a finite sliding window of information. The latter will depend on the condition of predictor stability in expected total variation, which we will establish. We finally show that under the periodic information sharing pattern, a quantized Q-learning algorithm converges asymptotically towards a near optimal solution. Each of the above, to our knowledge, is a new contribution to the literature.</description>

      <title>SPARKLE: A Unified Single-Loop Primal-Dual Framework for Decentralized Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies decentralized bilevel optimization, in which multiple agents collaborate to solve problems involving nested optimization structures with neighborhood communications. Most existing literature primarily utilizes gradient tracking to mitigate the influence of data heterogeneity, without exploring other well-known heterogeneity-correction techniques such as EXTRA or Exact Diffusion. Additionally, these studies often employ identical decentralized strategies for both upper- and lower-level problems, neglecting to leverage distinct mechanisms across different levels. To address these limitations, this paper proposes SPARKLE, a unified Single-loop Primal-dual AlgoRithm frameworK for decentraLized bilEvel optimization. SPARKLE offers the flexibility to incorporate various heterogeneitycorrection strategies into the algorithm. Moreover, SPARKLE allows for different strategies to solve upper- and lower-level problems. We present a unified convergence analysis for SPARKLE, applicable to all its variants, with state-of-the-art convergence rates compared to existing decentralized bilevel algorithms. Our results further reveal that EXTRA and Exact Diffusion are more suitable for decentralized bilevel optimization, and using mixed strategies in bilevel algorithms brings more benefits than relying solely on gradient tracking.</description>

Abstract: We investigate state feedback and observation for infinite-dimensional linear systems, including a variety of partial differential equations with boundary control and observation. We extend the modulating function approach to infinite-dimensional systems. This approach, simply put, involves reconstructing part of the state by convolving with null controls of the adjoint system. We show how this method aids in state reconstruction, and we also examine distributional solutions of the adjoint system, showing their ability to handle unbounded feedback operators. This enables us to use feedback from spatial point evaluations in partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Enforcing Mesh Quality Constraints in Shape Optimization with a Gradient Projection Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the numerical solution of shape optimization problems, particularly those constrained by partial differential equations (PDEs), the quality of the underlying mesh is of utmost importance. Particularly when investigating complex geometries, the mesh quality tends to deteriorate over the course of a shape optimization so that either the optimization comes to a halt or an expensive remeshing operation must be performed before the optimization can be continued. In this paper, we present a novel, semi-discrete approach for enforcing a minimum mesh quality in shape optimization. Our approach is based on Rosen's gradient projection method, which incorporates mesh quality constraints into the shape optimization problem. The proposed constraints bound the angles of triangular and solid angles of tetrahedral mesh cells and, thus, also bound the quality of these mesh cells. The method treats these constraints by projecting the search direction to the linear subspace of the currently active constraints. Additionally, only slight modifications to the usual line search procedure are required to ensure the feasibility of the method. We present our method for two- and three-dimensional simplicial meshes. We investigate the proposed approach numerically for the drag minimization of an obstacle in a two-dimensional flow and for the large-scale, three-dimensional optimization of a structured packing used in a distillation column. Our results show that the proposed method is indeed capable of guaranteeing a minimum mesh quality for both academic examples and challenging industrial applications. Particularly, our approach allows the shape optimization of extremely complex structures while ensuring that the mesh quality does not deteriorate.</description>

      <title>Linear Supervision for Nonlinear, High-Dimensional Neural Control and Differential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the dimension of a system increases, traditional methods for control and differential games rapidly become intractable, making the design of safe autonomous agents challenging in complex or team settings. Deep-learning approaches avoid discretization and yield numerous successes in robotics and autonomy, but at a higher dimensional limit, accuracy falls as sampling becomes less efficient. We propose using rapidly generated linear solutions to the partial differential equation (PDE) arising in the problem to accelerate and improve learned value functions for guidance in high-dimensional, nonlinear problems. We define two programs that combine supervision of the linear solution with a standard PDE loss. We demonstrate that these programs offer improvements in speed and accuracy in both a 50-D differential game problem and a 10-D quadrotor control problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The limits of quantum feedback control have immediate consequences for quantum information science at large, yet remain largely unexplored. Here, we combine quantum filtering theory and moment-sum-of-squares techniques to construct a hierarchy of convex optimization problems that furnish monotonically improving, computable bounds on the best attainable performance for a broad class of quantum feedback control problems. These bounds may serve as witnesses of fundamental limitations, optimality certificates, or performance targets. We prove convergence of the bounds to the optimal control performance under technical conditions and demonstrate the practical utility of our approach by designing certifiably near-optimal controllers for a qubit in a cavity subjected to photon counting and homodyne detection measurements.</description>

      <title>Considering a Classical Upper Bound on the Frobenius Number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the (classical) Frobenius problem, namely the problem of finding the largest integer that cannot be represented as a nonnegative integral combination of given relatively prime (strictly) positive integers (known as the Frobenius number). The main contribution of this paper are observations regarding a previously known upper bound on the Frobenius number where, in particular, we observe that a previously presented argument features a subtle error, which alters the value of the upper bound. Despite this, we demonstrate that the subtle error does not impact upon on the validity of the upper bound, although it does impact on the upper bounds tightness. Notably, we formally state the corrected result and additionally compare the relative tightness of the corrected upper bound with the original. In particular, we show that the updated bound is tighter in all but only a relatively "small" number of cases using both formal techniques and via Monte Carlo simulation techniques.</description>

      <title>On a class of interdiction problems with partition matroids: complexity and polynomial-time algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we consider a class of linear matroid interdiction problems, where the feasible sets for the upper-level decision-maker (referred to as a leader) and the lower-level decision-maker (referred to as a follower) are induced by two distinct partition matroids with a common weighted ground set. Unlike classical network interdiction models where the leader is subject to a single budget constraint, in our setting, both the leader and the follower are subject to several independent capacity constraints and engage in a zero-sum game. While the problem of finding a maximum weight independent set in a partition matroid is known to be polynomially solvable, we prove that the considered bilevel problem is $NP$-hard even when the weights of ground elements are all binary. On a positive note, it is revealed that, if the number of capacity constraints is fixed for either the leader or the follower, then the considered class of bilevel problems admits several polynomial-time solution schemes. Specifically, these schemes are based on a single-level dual reformulation, a dynamic programming-based approach, and a greedy algorithm for the leader.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we study the stability of the origin for the multivariate geometric Brownian motion. More precisely, under suitable sufficient conditions, we construct a Lyapunov function such that the origin of the multivariate geometric Brownian motion is globally asymptotically stable in probability. Moreover, we show that such conditions can be rewritten as a Bilinear Matrix Inequality (BMI) feasibility problem. We stress that no commutativity relations between the drift matrix and the noise dispersion matrices are assumed and therefore the so-called Magnus representation of the solution of the multivariate geometric Brownian motion is complicated. In addition, we exemplify our method in numerous specific models from the literature such as random linear oscillators, satellite dynamics, inertia systems, diagonal and non-diagonal noise systems, cancer self-remission and smoking.</description>

Abstract: The $k$-sparse parity problem is a classical problem in computational complexity and algorithmic theory, serving as a key benchmark for understanding computational classes. In this paper, we solve the $k$-sparse parity problem with sign stochastic gradient descent, a variant of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on two-layer fully-connected neural networks. We demonstrate that this approach can efficiently solve the $k$-sparse parity problem on a $d$-dimensional hypercube ($k\leq O(\sqrt{d})$) with a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(d^{k-1})$ using $2^{\Theta(k)}$ neurons, matching the established $\Omega(d^{k})$ lower bounds of Statistical Query (SQ) models. Our theoretical analysis begins by constructing a good neural network capable of correctly solving the $k$-parity problem. We then demonstrate how a trained neural network with sign SGD can effectively approximate this good network, solving the $k$-parity problem with small statistical errors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that matches the SQ lower bound for solving $k$-sparse parity problem using gradient-based methods.</description>

Abstract: Google Vizier has performed millions of optimizations and accelerated numerous research and production systems at Google, demonstrating the success of Bayesian optimization as a large-scale service. Over multiple years, its algorithm has been improved considerably, through the collective experiences of numerous research efforts and user feedback. In this technical report, we discuss the implementation details and design choices of the current default algorithm provided by Open Source Vizier. Our experiments on standardized benchmarks reveal its robustness and versatility against well-established industry baselines on multiple practical modes.</description>

      <title>Geometry of the Space of Partitioned Networks: A Unified Theoretical and Computational Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactions and relations between objects may be pairwise or higher-order in nature, and so network-valued data are ubiquitous in the real world. The "space of networks", however, has a complex structure that cannot be adequately described using conventional statistical tools. We introduce a measure-theoretic formalism for modeling generalized network structures such as graphs, hypergraphs, or graphs whose nodes come with a partition into categorical classes. We then propose a metric that extends the Gromov-Wasserstein distance between graphs and the co-optimal transport distance between hypergraphs. We characterize the geometry of this space, thereby providing a unified theoretical treatment of generalized networks that encompasses the cases of pairwise, as well as higher-order, relations. In particular, we show that our metric is an Alexandrov space of non-negative curvature, and leverage this structure to define gradients for certain functionals commonly arising in geometric data analysis tasks. We extend our analysis to the setting where vertices have additional label information, and derive efficient computational schemes to use in practice. Equipped with these theoretical and computational tools, we demonstrate the utility of our framework in a suite of applications, including hypergraph alignment, clustering and dictionary learning from ensemble data, multi-omics alignment, as well as multiscale network alignment.</description>

      <title>Old Optimizer, New Norm: An Anthology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning optimizers are often motivated through a mix of convex and approximate second-order theory. We select three such methods -- Adam, Shampoo and Prodigy -- and argue that each method can instead be understood as a squarely first-order method without convexity assumptions. In fact, after switching off exponential moving averages, each method is equivalent to steepest descent under a particular norm. By generalizing this observation, we chart a new design space for training algorithms. Different operator norms should be assigned to different tensors based on the role that the tensor plays within the network. For example, while linear and embedding layers may have the same weight space of $\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, these layers play different roles and should be assigned different norms. We hope that this idea of carefully metrizing the neural architecture might lead to more stable, scalable and indeed faster training.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Algorithm for Finite-Horizon Stochastic Control Problems in Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning algorithm for solving finite-horizon stochastic control problems based on a deep neural network representation of the optimal policy functions. The algorithm has three features: (1) It can solve high-dimensional (e.g., over 100 dimensions) and finite-horizon time-inhomogeneous stochastic control problems. (2) It has a monotonicity of performance improvement in each iteration, leading to good convergence properties. (3) It does not rely on the Bellman equation. To demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm, it is applied to solve various finite-horizon time-inhomogeneous problems including recursive utility optimization under a stochastic volatility model, a multi-sector stochastic growth, and optimal control under a dynamic stochastic integration of climate and economy model with eight-dimensional state vectors and 600 time periods.</description>
