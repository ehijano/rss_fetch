      <title>The transition and coexistence of quantum droplets and solitons in quasi-1D dipolar Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our study, we investigated bright solitons, dark solitons, and quantum droplets in quasi-one-dimensional dipolar Bose gases, and further validated the crossover and coexistence of quantum droplets and solitons using the Lieb-Liniger energy within the framework of local density approximation. Increasing the particle number N transforms the bright dipolar soliton state into a stable self-bound quantum droplet state, with further increases in N leading to a broader quantum droplet that enables the presence of dark solitons within it.</description>

      <title>Shape and size measurements of nonequilibrium Bose-Einstein condensates using image processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bose-Einstein condensates have been the subject of intense research in recent years due to their potential applications in quantum computing and many other areas. However, measuring the shape and size of out-of-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensates is a challenging task that requires sophisticated image processing techniques. We propose to study perturbed BEC based on general concepts of analysis, which are widely used in the image processing community. The mathematical basis underlying the algorithms is quite general and independent of the type of image studied. The morphological changes observed in the perturbed atomic clouds as a result of excitation amplitude were observed in a consistent manner. And the spatial expansion of the atomic clouds under free fall shows some symmetry, but it was only observed under certain conditions</description>

      <title>Recent advances in the theory of the BCS-BEC crossover for fermionic superfluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BCS-BEC crossover realized experimentally with ultra-cold Fermi gases may be considered as one of the important scientific achievements occurred during the last several years. The flexibility for operating on these systems on the experimental side and the full control of the relevant system degrees of freedom on the theoretical side make quite stringent at a fundamental level the comparison between the experimental data and the corresponding theoretical calculations. Here, we briefly survey recent theoretical advances resting on a diagrammatic approach at equilibrium that improves in a systematic way on the widely used t-matrix approach, yielding a quite good comparison between theory and experiments for several physical quantities of interest. It is proposed that the physical phenomena underlying this theoretical approach may also be relevant to the superconducting phase of condensed-matter materials which cannot be described by the standard BCS theory.</description>

      <title>Chiral-symmetric Topological Origin of Nonlinear Fixed Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle-hole symmetry and chiral symmetry play a pivotal role in multiple areas of physics, yet they remain un-studied in systems with nonlinear interactions that are beyond Kerr-type. Here, we establish these two non-spatial symmetries in systems with strong and general nonlinear interactions. Chiral symmetry ensures the quantization of the Berry phase of nonlinear normal modes and categorizes the topological phases of nonlinear dynamics. We show edge modes that serve as topologically protected fixed points of chiral-symmetric nonlinear dynamics. Our theoretical framework paves the way towards the topological classification of general nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Effects of forward disorder on quasi-1D superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between disorder and singlet superconductivity in a quasi-1d system. We investigate the applicability of the Anderson theorem, namely that time-reversal conserving (non-magnetic) disorder does not impact the critical temperature, by opposition to time-reversal breaking disorder (magnetic). To do so we examine a quasi-1d system of spin 1/2 fermions with attractive interactions and forward scattering disorder using field theory (bosonization). By computing the superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$), we find that for non-magnetic disorder the Anderson theorem also holds in the quasi-1D geometry. On the contrary, magnetic disorder has an impact on the critical temperature, that we investigate by deriving renormalization group (RG) equations describing the competition between the disorder and the interactions. Computing the critical temperature as a function of disorder strength, we see that different regimes arise depending on the strength of interactions. We discuss possible platforms where to observe this in cold atoms and condensed matter.</description>

      <title>Dispersion law for a one-dimensional weakly interacting Bose gas with zero boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1723</link>
      <description>arXiv:1211.1723v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the time-dependent Gross equation, we find the quasiparticle dispersion law for a one-dimensional weakly interacting Bose gas with a non-point interatomic potential and zero boundary conditions (BCs). The result coincides with the dispersion law for periodic BCs, i.e. the Bogolyubov law $E_{B}(k) = \sqrt{\left (\frac{\hbar^{2} k^2}{2m}\right )^{2} + n_{0}\nu(k)\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{m}}$. In the case of periodic BCs, the dispersion law can be easily derived from Gross' equation. However, for zero BCs, the analysis is not so simple.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the Meissner effect at the zero exceptional point in non-Hermitian two-band BCS model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spontaneous symmetry breaking of a continuous symmetry in complex field theory at the exceptional point of the parameter space is known to exhibit interesting phenomena, such as the breakdown of a Higgs mechanism. In this work, we derive the complex Ginzburg-Landau model from a non-Hermitian two-band BCS model via path integral and investigate its spontaneous symmetry breaking. We find that analog to the Higgs mechanism, the Meissner effect of the complex Ginzburg-Landau model also breaks down at the exceptional point while the gap parameters stay finite.</description>

      <title>Magnonic spin current shot noise in an itinerant Fermi gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin transport phenomena at strongly-correlated interfaces play central roles in fundamental physics as well as spintronic applications. To anatomize spin-transport carriers, we propose the detection of the spin current noise in interacting itinerant fermions. The Fano factor given by the ratio between the spin current and its noise reflects elementary carriers of spin transport at the interface of spin-polarized Fermi gases realized in ultracold atoms. The change of the Fano factor microscopically evinces a crossover from the quasiparticle transport to magnon transport in itinerant fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Vortex loop dynamics and dynamical quantum phase transitions in 3D fermion matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have emerged as a paradigm shift in understanding nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems. However, the challenge lies in identifying order parameters that effectively characterize the associated dynamic phases. In this study, we investigate the behavior of vortex singularities in the phase of the Green's function for a broad class of fermion lattice models in three dimensions after an instantaneous quench in both interacting and non-interacting systems. We find that the full set of vortices form one-dimensional dynamical objects, which we call \emph{vortex loops}. We propose that the number of such vortex loops can be interpreted as a quantized order parameter that distinguishes between different non-equilibrium phases. Our results establish an explicit link between variations in the order parameter and DQPTs in the non-interacting scenario. Moreover, we show that the vortex loops are robust in the weakly interacting case, even though there is no direct relation between the Loschmidt amplitude and the Green's function. Finally, we observe that vortex loops can form complex dynamical patterns in momentum space. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing definitions of dynamical order parameters in non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Backflow Corrections by Tensor Representations: Benchmarks on Fermi-Hubbard-type Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11823v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum many-body problem is an important topic in condensed matter physics. To efficiently solve the problem, several methods have been developped to improve the representation ability of wave-functions.For the Fermi-Hubbard model, current state-of-the-art methods are neural network backflows and the hidden fermion Slater determinant. The backflow correction is an efficient way to improve the Slater determinant of free-particles. In this work we propose a tensor representation of the backflow corrected wave-function, we show that for the spinless $t$-$V$ model, the energy precision is competitive or even lower than current state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For models with spin, we further improve the representation ability by considering non-zero backflow corrections on different spins between the orbital and the particle. We benchmark on molecules under STO-3G basis and the Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic and cylindrical boudary conditions. We show that our methods achieve competitive or even lower energy results than current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Critical current throughout the BCS-BEC crossover with the inclusion of pairing fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work aims at providing a systematic analysis of the current density versus momentum characteristics for a fermionic superfluid throughout the BCS-BEC crossover, even in the fully homogeneous case. At low temperatures, where pairing fluctuations are not strong enough to invalidate a quasi-particle approach, a sharp threshold for the inception of a back-flow current is found, which sets the onset of dissipation and identifies the critical momentum according to Landau. This momentum is seen to smoothly evolve from the BCS to the BEC regimes, whereby a single expression for the single-particle current density that includes pairing fluctuations enables us to incorporate on equal footing two quite distinct dissipative mechanisms, namely, pair-breaking and phonon excitations in the two sides of the BCS-BEC crossover, respectively. At finite temperature, where thermal fluctuations broaden the excitation spectrum and make the dissipative (kinetic and thermal) mechanisms intertwined with each other, an alternative criterion due to Bardeen is instead employed to signal the loss of superfluid behavior. In this way, detailed comparison with available experimental data in linear and annular geometries is significantly improved with respect to previous approaches, thereby demonstrating the crucial role played by quantum fluctuations in renormalizing the single-particle excitation spectrum.</description>

      <title>A tweezer array with 6100 highly coherent atomic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have had a transformative impact on atomic and molecular physics over the past years, and they now form the backbone for a wide range of leading experiments in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology. Underlying this development is the simplicity of single particle control and detection inherent to the technique. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits, and very recently systems with around one thousand atoms were realized without defining qubits or demonstrating coherent control. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits with long coherence times and low-loss, high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding challenge and critical for progress in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology, in particular, towards applications with quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping over 6,100 neutral atoms in around 12,000 sites while simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art performance for several key metrics associated with fundamental limitations of the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of atoms, we also demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) seconds, a record for hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. Further, we show trapping lifetimes close to 23 minutes in a room-temperature apparatus, enabling record-high imaging survival of 99.98952(1)% in combination with an imaging fidelity of over 99.99%. Our results, together with other recent developments, indicate that universal quantum computing with ten thousand atomic qubits could be a near-term prospect. Furthermore, our work could pave the way for quantum simulation and metrology experiments with inherent single particle readout and positioning capabilities at a similar scale.</description>
