      <title>Multi-timescale synaptic plasticity on analog neuromorphic hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As numerical simulations grow in complexity, their demands on computing time and energy increase. Hardware accelerators offer significant efficiency gains in many computationally intensive scientific fields, but their use in computational neuroscience remains limited. Neuromorphic substrates, such as the BrainScaleS architectures, offer significant advantages, especially for studying complex plasticity rules that require extended simulation runtimes. This work presents the implementation of a calcium-based plasticity rule that integrates calcium dynamics based on the synaptic tagging-and-capture hypothesis on the BrainScaleS-2 system. The implementation of the plasticity rule for a single synapse involves incorporating the calcium dynamics and the plasticity rule equations. The calcium dynamics are mapped to the analog circuits of BrainScaleS-2, while the plasticity rule equations are numerically solved on its embedded digital processors. The main hardware constraints include the speed of the processors and the use of integer arithmetic. By adjusting the timestep of the numerical solver and introducing stochastic rounding, we demonstrate that BrainScaleS-2 accurately emulates a single synapse following a calcium-based plasticity rule across four stimulation protocols and validate our implementation against a software reference model.</description>

      <title>Topological analysis of brain dynamical signals reveals signatures of seizure susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epilepsy is known to drastically alter brain dynamics during seizures (ictal periods). However, whether epilepsy may alter brain dynamics during background (non-ictal) periods is less understood. To investigate this, we analyzed the brain activity of epileptic zebrafish as animal models, for two genetic conditions and two fishlines. The recordings were automatically segmented and labeled with machine learning, and then analyzed using Persistent Homology, a method from Topological Data Analysis, which reveals patterns in the topology of brain dynamics in a noise-robust and networkbased manner. We find that ictal and non-ictal periods can be distinguished from the topology of their dynamics, regardless of fishline or genetic condition, which validates our method. Additionally, within a single fishline wild type, we can distinguish the non-ictal periods of seizure-prone and seizure-free individuals. This suggests the presence of topological signatures of the epileptic brain, even during non-ictal periods. In general, our results suggest that Topological Data Analysis can be used as a general quantitative method to screen for dynamical markers of seizure susceptibility also in other species.</description>

      <title>Estimating Treatment Effect under Additive Hazards Models with High-dimensional Covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.00287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects for survival outcomes in the high-dimensional setting is an extremely important topic for many biomedical applications as well as areas of social sciences. We propose a new orthogonal score method for treatment effect estimation and inference that results in asymptotically valid confidence intervals assuming only good estimation properties of the hazard outcome model and the conditional probability of treatment. This guarantee allows us to provide valid inference for the conditional treatment effect under the high-dimensional additive hazards model under considerably more generality than existing approaches. In addition, we develop a new Hazards Difference (HDi), estimator. We showcase that our approach has double-robustness properties in high dimensions: with cross-fitting, the HDi estimate is consistent under a wide variety of treatment assignment models; the HDi estimate is also consistent when the hazards model is misspecified and instead the true data generating mechanism follows a partially linear additive hazards model. We further develop a novel sparsity doubly robust result, where either the outcome or the treatment model can be a fully dense high-dimensional model. We apply our methods to study the treatment effect of radical prostatectomy versus conservative management for prostate cancer patients using the SEER-Medicare Linked Data.</description>

      <title>Learning Identifiable Factorized Causal Representations of Cellular Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of cells and their responses to genetic or chemical perturbations promises to accelerate the discovery of therapeutic targets. However, designing adequate and insightful models for such data is difficult because the response of a cell to perturbations essentially depends on its biological context (e.g., genetic background or cell type). For example, while discovering therapeutic targets, one may want to enrich for drugs that specifically target a certain cell type. This challenge emphasizes the need for methods that explicitly take into account potential interactions between drugs and contexts. Towards this goal, we propose a novel Factorized Causal Representation (FCR) learning method that reveals causal structure in single-cell perturbation data from several cell lines. Based on the framework of identifiable deep generative models, FCR learns multiple cellular representations that are disentangled, comprised of covariate-specific ($\mathbf{z}_x$), treatment-specific ($\mathbf{z}_{t}$), and interaction-specific ($\mathbf{z}_{tx}$) blocks. Based on recent advances in non-linear ICA theory, we prove the component-wise identifiability of $\mathbf{z}_{tx}$ and block-wise identifiability of $\mathbf{z}_t$ and $\mathbf{z}_x$. Then, we present our implementation of FCR, and empirically demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various tasks across four single-cell datasets.</description>
