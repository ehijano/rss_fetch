      <title>Nonlinear theory of the modulational instability at the ion-ion hybrid frequency and collapse of ion-ion hybrid waves in two-ion plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of two-dimensional nonlinear ion-ion hybrid waves propagating perpendicular to an external magnetic field in plasmas with two ion species. We derive nonlinear equations for the envelope of electrostatic potential at the ion-ion hybrid frequency to describe the interaction of ion-ion hybrid waves with low frequency acoustic-type disturbances. The resulting nonlinear equations also take into account the contribution of second harmonics of the ion-ion hybrid frequency. A nonlinear dispersion relation is obtained and, for a number of particular cases, the modulational instability growth rates are found. By neglecting the contribution of second harmonics, the phenomenon of collapse of ion-ion hybrid waves is predicted. It is shown that taking into account the interaction with the second harmonics results in the existence of a stable two-dimensional soliton.</description>

      <title>Variational Solvers for Irreversible Evolutionary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study irreversible evolutionary processes with a general energetic notion of stability. We dedicate this contribution to releasing three nonlinear variational solvers as modular components (based on FEniCSx/dolfinx) that address three mathematical optimisation problems. They are general enough to apply, in principle, to evolutionary systems with instabilities, jumps, and emergence of patterns which is commonplace in diverse arenas spanning from quantum to continuum mechanics, economy, social sciences, and ecology. Our motivation proceeds from fracture mechanics, with the ultimate goal of deploying a transparent numerical platform for scientific validation and prediction of large scale natural fracture phenomena. Our solvers are used to compute one solution to a problem encoded in a system of two inequalities: one (pointwise almost-everywhere) constraint of irreversibility and one global energy statement. As part of our commitment to open science, our solvers are released as free software.</description>

      <title>Transitions near the onset of stationary rotating magnetoconvection: role of magnetic Prandtl number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the instabilities and associated bifurcation structure near the onset of rotating magnetoconvection of low Prandtl number fluids by performing three dimensional direct numerical simulations. Previous studies considered zero magnetic Prandtl number ($\mathrm{Pm}$) limit for the investigation of bifurcation structure near the onset of convection. Here we numerically investigate the effect of $\mathrm{Pm}$ on the bifurcation structure. The classical Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection setup in the presence of horizontal magnetic field and rotation about the vertical axis are considered for the study. The control parameters, including the Taylor number ($\mathrm{Ta}$), Chandrasekhar number ($\mathrm{Q}$), reduced Rayleigh number ($\mathrm{r}$), and magnetic Prandtl number ($\mathrm{Pm}$) are varied in the ranges $0 &lt; \mathrm{Ta}\leq 500$, $0 &lt; \mathrm{Q}\leq 1000$, $0.8\leq \mathrm{r} \leq 2$ and $0 &lt; \mathrm{Pm} &lt; 1$ by considering Prandtl numbers $\mathrm{Pr}= 0.025$ and $0.1$. The investigation reveals the presence of supercritical, subcritical and hybrid transitions to convection. These transitions leads to infinitesimal and finite amplitude fluid patterns at the onset of convection. The finite amplitude solutions can be both stationary and time dependent. The bifurcation structures associated with these flow patterns at the onset are studied in detail. For very small $\mathrm{Pm}$, the bifurcation structure is found to be qualitatively similar to the ones observed in the $\mathrm{Pm}\rightarrow 0$ limit. However, as $\mathrm{Pm}$ is increased, several new solutions appear at the onset and the resulting bifurcation structures are greatly modified.</description>
