      <title>A Flexible Design for Beam Squint Effect Suppression in IRS-Aided THz Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study employing movable components on both base station (BS) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in a wideband terahertz (THz) multiple-input-single-output (MISO) system, where the BS is equipped with a movable antenna (MA) array and the IRS consists of movable subarrays. To alleviate double beam squint effect caused by the coupling of beam squint at the BS and IRS, we propose to maximize the minimal received power across a wide THz spectrum by delicately configuring the positions of MAs and IRS subarrays, which is highly challenging. By adopting majorization-minimization (MM) methodology, we develop an algorithm to tackle the aforementioned optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and the benefit of utilizing movable components on the BS and IRS to mitigate double beam squint effect in wideband THz communications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we reveal a relation between the weight distribution of a concatenated code ensemble based on the Plotkin construction and those of its component codes. The relation may find applications in the calculation of the ensemble weight distributions for many codes, including Reed-Muller (RM)-like codes.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Semantic Communication for Logic-based Hypothesis Deduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an analysis of semantic communication in the context of First-Order Logic (FOL)-based deduction. Specifically, the receiver holds a set of hypotheses about the State of the World (SotW), while the transmitter has incomplete evidence about the true SotW but lacks access to the ground truth. The transmitter aims to communicate limited information to help the receiver identify the hypothesis most consistent with true SotW. We formulate the objective as approximating the posterior distribution at the transmitter to the receiver. Using Stirling's approximation, this reduces to a constrained, finite-horizon resource allocation problem. Applying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions yields a truncated water-filling solution. Despite the problem's non-convexity, symmetry and permutation invariance ensure global optimality. Based on this, we design message selection strategies, both for single- and multi-round communication, and model the receiver's inference as an m-ary Bayesian hypothesis testing problem. Under the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) rule, our communication strategy achieves optimal performance within budget constraints. We further analyze convergence rates and validate the theoretical findings through experiments, demonstrating reduced error over random selection and prior methods.</description>

      <title>A Framework of Arithmetic-Level Variable Precision Computing for In-Memory Architecture: Case Study in MIMO Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational complexity poses a significant challenge in wireless communication. Most existing attempts aim to reduce it through algorithm-specific approaches. However, the precision of computing, which directly relates to both computing performance and computational complexity, is a dimension that is fundamental but rarely explored in the literature. With the emerging architecture of in-memory computing, variable precision computing (VPC) is enabled, allowing each arithmetic operation to be processed with a distinct and specifically optimized computing precision. In this paper, we establish a unified framework of arithmetic-level variable precision computing (AL-VPC), which aims to determine the optimized computing precision for each arithmetic operation. We first develop an arithmetic propagation error model exploiting stochastic analysis, and then formulate a mathematical optimization problem to strike balance between computing performance and computational complexity. Two algorithms, namely, offline VPC and online VPC, are proposed to solve the problem considering various practical concerns. Particularly, in a case study on zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we reveal the Pareto boundary between computing performance and complexity, which exhibits up to a 60% sum-rate enhancement or equivalently up to a 30% complexity reduction compared to the traditional fixed-length methods.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Rate -- Linear Noise Approximation and Exact Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient information processing is crucial for both living organisms and engineered systems. The mutual information rate, a core concept of information theory, quantifies the amount of information shared between the trajectories of input and output signals, and enables the quantification of information flow in dynamic systems. A common approach for estimating the mutual information rate is the Gaussian approximation which assumes that the input and output trajectories follow Gaussian statistics. However, this method is limited to linear systems, and its accuracy in nonlinear or discrete systems remains unclear. In this work, we assess the accuracy of the Gaussian approximation for non-Gaussian systems by leveraging Path Weight Sampling (PWS), a recent technique for exactly computing the mutual information rate. In two case studies, we examine the limitations of the Gaussian approximation. First, we focus on discrete linear systems and demonstrate that, even when the system's statistics are nearly Gaussian, the Gaussian approximation fails to accurately estimate the mutual information rate. Second, we explore a continuous diffusive system with a nonlinear transfer function, revealing significant deviations between the Gaussian approximation and the exact mutual information rate as nonlinearity increases. Our results provide a quantitative evaluation of the Gaussian approximation's performance across different stochastic models and highlight when more computationally intensive methods, such as PWS, are necessary.</description>

      <title>Normalized Maximum Likelihood Code-Length on Riemannian Manifold Data Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable, and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML (Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sequential Universal Hypothesis Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum hypothesis testing (QHT) concerns the statistical inference of unknown quantum states. In the general setting of composite hypotheses, the goal of QHT is to determine whether an unknown quantum state belongs to one or another of two classes of states based on the measurement of a number of copies of the state. Prior art on QHT with composite hypotheses focused on a fixed-copy two-step protocol, with state estimation followed by an optimized joint measurement. However, this fixed-copy approach may be inefficient, using the same number of copies irrespective of the inherent difficulty of the testing task. To address these limitations, we introduce the quantum sequential universal test (QSUT), a novel framework for sequential QHT in the general case of composite hypotheses. QSUT builds on universal inference, and it alternates between adaptive local measurements aimed at exploring the hypothesis space and joint measurements optimized for maximal discrimination. QSUT is proven to rigorously control the type I error under minimal assumptions about the hypothesis structure. We present two practical instantiations of QSUT, one based on the Helstrom-Holevo test and one leveraging shallow variational quantum circuits. Empirical results across a range of composite QHT tasks demonstrate that QSUT consistently reduces copy complexity relative to state-of-the-art fixed-copy strategies.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we give the first examples of low-conductance permutations. The notion of conductance of permutations was introduced in the paper "Indifferentiability of Confusion-Diffusion Networks" by Dodis et al., where the search for low-conductance permutations was initiated and motivated. In this paper we not only give the desired examples, but also make a general characterization of the problem -- i.e. we show that low-conductance permutations are equivalent to permutations that have the information-theoretic properties of the so-called Multi-Source-Somewhere-Condensers.</description>

      <title>A Soft Inducement Framework for Incentive-Aided Steering of No-Regret Players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a steering problem in a mediator-augmented two-player normal-form game, where the mediator aims to guide players toward a specific action profile through information and incentive design. We first characterize the games for which successful steering is possible. Moreover, we establish that steering players to any desired action profile is not always achievable with information design alone, nor when accompanied with sublinear payment schemes. Consequently, we derive a lower bound on the constant payments required per round to achieve this goal. To address these limitations incurred with information design, we introduce an augmented approach that involves a one-shot information design phase before the start of the repeated game, transforming the prior interaction into a Stackelberg game. Finally, we theoretically demonstrate that this approach improves the convergence rate of players' action profiles to the target point by a constant factor with high probability, and support it with empirical results.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Based Non-Invasive Reliability Monitoring of Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However, existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers, enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time without compromising original model performance.</description>

      <title>Two tales for a geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence (G-JSD) gained popularity in machine learning and information sciences thanks to its closed-form expression between Gaussian distributions. In this work, we introduce an alternative definition of the geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence tailored to positive densities which does not normalize geometric mixtures. This novel divergence is termed the extended G-JSD as it applies to the more general case of positive measures. We report explicitly the gap between the extended G-JSD and the G-JSD when considering probability densities, and show how to express the G-JSD and extended G-JSD using the Jeffreys divergence and the Bhattacharyya distance or Bhattacharyya coefficient. The extended G-JSD is proven to be a $f$-divergence which is a separable divergence satisfying information monotonicity and invariance in information geometry. We derive corresponding closed-form formula for the two types of G-JSDs when considering the case of multivariate Gaussian distributions often met in applications. We consider Monte Carlo stochastic estimations and approximations of the two types of G-JSD using the projective $\gamma$-divergences. Although the square root of the JSD yields a metric distance, we show that this is not anymore the case for the two types of G-JSD. Finally, we explain how these two types of geometric JSDs can be interpreted as regularizations of the ordinary JSD.</description>

Abstract: Starting with an explicit framework for designing logical Clifford circuits for CSS codes, we construct logical gates for Hypergraph Product Codes. We first derive symplectic matrices for CNOT, CZ, Phase, and Hadamard operators, which together generate the Clifford group. This enables us to design explicit transformations that result in targeted logical gates for arbitrary codes in this family. As a concrete example, we give logical circuits for the $[[18,2,3]]$ toric code.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage in Locally Differentially Private Hypothesis Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a private hypothesis testing scenario, including both symmetric and asymmetric testing, based on classical data samples. The utility is measured by the error exponents, namely the Chernoff information and the relative entropy, while privacy is measured in terms of classical or quantum local differential privacy. In this scenario, we show a quantum advantage with respect to the optimal privacy-utility trade-off (PUT) in certain cases. Specifically, we focus on distributions referred to as smoothed point mass distributions, along with the uniform distribution, as hypotheses. We then derive upper bounds on the optimal PUTs achievable by classical privacy mechanisms, which are tight in specific instances. To show the quantum advantage, we propose a particular quantum privacy mechanism that achieves better PUTs than these upper bounds in both symmetric and asymmetric testing. The proposed mechanism consists of a classical-quantum channel that prepares symmetric, informationally complete (SIC) states, followed by a depolarizing channel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing accessible information for an ensemble of quantum states is a basic problem in quantum information theory. We show that the optimality criterion recently obtained in [7], when applied to specific ensembles of states, leads to nontrivial tight lower bounds for the Shannon entropy that are discrete relatives of the famous log-Sobolev inequality. In this light, the hypothesis of globally information-optimal measurement for an ensemble of equiangular equiprobable states (quantum pyramids) put forward and numerically substantiated in [2] is reconsidered and the corresponding tight entropy inequalities are proposed. Via the optimality criterion, this suggests also a proof of the conjecture concerning globally information-optimal observables for quantum pyramids put forward in [2].</description>

      <title>Designs from magic-augmented Clifford circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce magic-augmented Clifford circuits -- architectures in which Clifford circuits are preceded and/or followed by constant-depth circuits of non-Clifford (``magic") gates -- as a resource-efficient way to realize approximate $k$-designs, with reduced circuit depth and usage of magic. We prove that shallow Clifford circuits, when augmented with constant-depth circuits of magic gates, can generate approximate unitary and state $k$-designs with $\epsilon$ relative error. The total circuit depth for these constructions on $N$ qubits is $O(\log (N/\epsilon)) +2^{O(k\log k)}$ in one dimension and $O(\log\log(N/\epsilon))+2^{O(k\log k)}$ in all-to-all circuits using ancillas, which improves upon previous results for small $k \geq 4$. Furthermore, our construction of relative-error state $k$-designs only involves states with strictly local magic. The required number of magic gates is parametrically reduced when considering $k$-designs with bounded additive error. As an example, we show that shallow Clifford circuits followed by $O(k^2)$ single-qubit magic gates, independent of system size, can generate an additive-error state $k$-design. We develop a classical statistical mechanics description of our random circuit architectures, which provides a quantitative understanding of the required depth and number of magic gates for additive-error state $k$-designs. We also prove no-go theorems for various architectures to generate designs with bounded relative error.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{T}^d$ denote the $d$-dimensional torus. We consider the problem of optimally recovering a target function $f^*:\mathbb{T}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ from samples of its Fourier coefficients. We make classical smoothness assumptions on $f^*$, specifically that $f^*$ lies in a Besov space $B^s_\infty(L_q)$ with $s &gt; 0$ and $1\leq q\leq \infty$, and measure recovery error in the $L_p$-norm with $1\leq p\leq \infty$. Abstractly, the optimal recovery error is characterized by a `restricted' version of the Gelfand widths, which we call the Fourier sampling numbers. Up to logarithmic factors, we determine the correct asymptotics of the Fourier sampling numbers in the regime $s/d &gt; 1 - 1/p$. We also give a description of nearly optimal Fourier measurements and recovery algorithms in each of these cases. In the other direction, we prove a novel lower bound showing that there is an asymptotic gap between the Fourier sampling numbers and the Gelfand widths when $q = 1$ and $p_0 &lt; p\leq 2$ with $p_0 \approx 1.535$. Finally, we discuss the practical implications of our results, which imply a sharper recovery of edges, and provide numerical results demonstrating this phenomenon.</description>
