      <title>A guide to constructing free transitive actions on median spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct large families of groups admitting free transitive actions on median spaces. In particular, we construct groups which act freely and transitively on the complete universal real tree with continuum valence such that any subgroup of the additive reals is realised as the stabiliser of an axis. We prove a more precise version of this, which implies that there are $2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$ pairwise non-isomorphic groups which admit a free transitive action on this real tree. We also construct free transitive actions on products of complete real trees such that any subgroup of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is realised as the stabiliser of a maximal flat, and an irreducible action on the product of two complete real trees.
  To construct each of these groups, we introduce the notion of an \textit{ore}: a set equipped with the structure of a meet semilattice and a cancellative monoid with involution, which verifies some additional axioms. We show that one can \textit{extract} a group from an ore and equip this group with a left-invariant median structure.</description>

      <title>A strong height gap theorem for $PGL_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The height gap theorem states that the finite subsets $F$ of matrices generating non-virtually solvable groups have normalized height $\widehat{h}(F)$ bounded below by a constant. It was first proved by Breuillard and another proof was given later by Chen, Hurtado and Lee. In this paper we show that when the set $F$ is contained in a maximal arithmetic subgroup $\Gamma$ of $G = PGL_2(\mathbb{R})^a \times PGL_2(\mathbb{C})^b$, $a+b \ge 1$, the height bound for the case when $F$ generates a Zariski dense subgroup of $G$ over $\mathbb{R}$ is proportional to $\log(covol(\Gamma))$, the function of the covolume of $\Gamma$. This result strengthens the theorem for the lattices of large covolume and has various applications including a strong version of the arithmetic Margulis lemma for $PGL_2(\mathbb{R})^a \times PGL_2(\mathbb{C})^b$.</description>

      <title>Weakly branch actions: first-order theory, rigidity and Boston's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We disprove a well-known conjecture of Boston (2000), which claims that a just-infinite pro-$p$ group is branch if and only if it admits a positive-dimensional embedding in the group of $p$-adic automorphisms. This is obtained as a result of a comprehensive study of the rigidity of branch actions.
  Firstly, we generalize the notion of the structure graph, introduced by Wilson in 2000, to weakly branch groups and use it to prove several results on the first-order theory of weakly branch groups, extending previous results of Wilson on branch groups.
  Secondly, we completely characterize the rigidity of weakly branch and branch actions on arbitrary spherically homogeneous rooted trees, extending previous partial results (for branch actions) by Hardy, Garrido, Grigorchuk and Wilson. Moreover, we prove that rigidity of a weakly branch group is equivalent to rigidity of its closure in the full automorphism group.
  Thirdly, we extend greatly the sufficient conditions $(*)$ and $(**)$ of Grigorchuk and Wilson, which leads to a complete and very easy-to-check characterization of the rigidity of the weakly branch actions of a fractal group of $p$-adic automorphisms. We further establish the first connection in the literature between the Hausdorff dimension of a weakly branch action and its rigidity.
  Lastly, we put everything together to show that the zero-dimensional just-infinite branch pro-$p$ groups introduced recently by the author admit rigid branch actions on a tree obtained by deletion of levels. This, together with previous results of the author, shows that these groups are indeed counterexamples to the aforementioned conjecture of Boston.</description>

      <title>Real Spectrum Compactifications of Universal Geometric Spaces over Character Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct universal geometric spaces over the real spectrum compactification $\Xi^{\mathrm{RSp}}$ of the character variety $\Xi$ of a finitely generated group $\Gamma$ in $\mathrm{SL}_n$, providing geometric interpretations of boundary points. For an algebraic set $Y(\mathbb{R})$ on which $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{R})$ acts by algebraic automorphisms (such as $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}(\mathbb{R})$ or an algebraic cover of the symmetric space of $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{R})$), the projection map $\Xi \times Y \rightarrow \Xi$ extends to a $\Gamma$-equivariant continuous surjection $(\Xi \times Y)^{\mathrm{RSp}} \rightarrow \Xi^{\mathrm{RSp}}$. The fibers of this extended map are homeomorphic to the Archimedean spectrum of $Y(\mathbb{F})$ for some real closed field $\mathbb{F}$, which is a locally compact subset of $Y^{\mathrm{RSp}}$. The Archimedean spectrum is naturally homeomorphic to the real analytification, and we use this identification to compute the image of the fibers in their Berkovich analytification. For $Y=\mathbb{P}^1$, the image is a real subtree.</description>

      <title>Non-geometric property (T) of warped cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the geometric property (T) for discretized warped cones of an action on a compact Lie group $M$ by its finitely generated subgroup. We show that if a subgroup $G$ is dense in $M$, then the associated discretized warped cone $\bigsqcup_n M\times \{t(n)\}$ does not have geometric property (T) for any sequence of positive numbers $\{t(n)\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ converging to $\infty$. This result applies to certain ergodic actions of groups with property (T), for example, the action of $SO(d,\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{5}])$ on $SO(d)$ with $d\geq 5$.
  As an application, we obtain new examples of expanders without geometric property (T), including certain superexpanders.</description>
