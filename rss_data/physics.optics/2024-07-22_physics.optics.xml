      <title>Correlation Hyperspectral Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging aims at providing information on both the spatial and the spectral distribution of light, with high resolution. However, state-of-the-art protocols are characterized by an intrinsic trade-off imposing to sacrifice either resolution or image acquisition speed. We address this limitation by exploiting light intensity correlations, which are shown to enable overcoming the typical downsides of traditional hyperspectral imaging techniques, both scanning and snapshot. The proposed approach also opens possibilities that are not otherwise achievable, such as sharper imaging and natural filtering of broadband spectral components that would otherwise hide the spectrum of interest. The enabled combination of high spatial and spectral resolution, high speed, and insensitivity to undesired spectral features shall lead to a paradigm change in hyperspectral imaging devices and open-up new application scenarios.</description>

      <title>Ultra-compact beam steering nanolasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The miniaturization and integration of beam steering devices have consistently been the focus of the field. Conventional methods alter the eigenmode of the optical cavity by regulating the refractive index. Due to the weak nonlinear effect of the optical system, the device must be sufficiently large to achieve sufficient light modulation. The effective method for miniaturizing beam steering devices currently in use is based on metasurfaces. However, this type of device necessitates the input of a laser source, which precludes the simultaneous generation and control of light in a single device. Here we propose a miniaturized beam steering device that employs mode selection between different bound states in the continuum (BIC) states through phase change material. The device is capable of simultaneously achieving both light generation and beam steering (33{\deg}) in a single device with a size of only 25 {\mu}m and with a low threshold of 8.9 kW cm-2. Furthermore,it is possible to achieve a significant degree of dynamic wavelength tunability, with a range extending up to 296 nm. This method achieves high-efficient regulation of light properties by dynamically controlling the system's topological charge, circumventing the problem of weak nonlinearity in traditional methods. Furthermore, the integration of phase change materials with nanolasers enables the direct alteration of lasing properties, which provides a novel idea for dynamic light control. The device process scheme based on phase change materials is straightforward, direct, and highly compatible, which will be advantageous for its intended application.</description>

      <title>A continuous plane of polarization rotator and detector based on the liquid crystal theta-cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulation of the polarization state of optical beams is crucial in advanced optical applications such as polarization microscopy, polarization rotation, and medical imaging. We demonstrate a continuous polarization rotator by utilizing the liquid crystals (LC) in theta-cell configuration comprising of circular and parallel alignment of LC on two aligning glass substrates. A rotation of plane of polarization up to 160 degree is observed using Stokes polarimetry and substantiated by the mathematical analysis using Mueller matrix formalism. Further, the device is demonstrated as a plane of polarization detector with high precision detection angle. The plane of polarization is analyzed through single shot imaging of the intensity distribution of transmitted light through the LC theta-cell.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Relationship Between Amplitude-only Transmission Matrix and Third-Order Correlation of Light Fields in Wavefront Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the regime of wavefront shaping (WFS) techniques, both the transmission matrix (TM) methods and a recently proposed third-order correlation of light fields (TCLF) method are effective in overcoming light scattering. This letter details the relationship between the amplitude-only TM method and the amplitude-only TCLF. The random fluctuations of different pixels on a digital micromirror device (DMD) in the amplitude-only TCLF method can be regarded as orthogonal bases, sharing the same role as the Hadamard bases in the amplitude-only TM method. This insight explains why the computational complexity of the TCLF method is significantly lower than that of the TM methods and also indicates that the amplitude-only TM is essentially a special case of the TCLF method.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Efficient and Polarization-Diversity Fiber-Chip Coupling by 2D Grating Couplers with 193-nm DUV Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) diffractive gratings offer a polarization-independent coupling solution between optical fibers and photonic integrated circuits, with advantages including placement flexibility, ease of fabrication, and tolerance to alignment errors. In this work, we proposed and experimentally demonstrated a highly efficient 2D grating coupler fabricated with 193-nm deep-ultraviolet (DUV) lithography on the 220-nm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. An experimental peak coupling efficiency of -2.54 dB can be obtained using a minimum feature size of 180 nm, relying on the novel double-layer 2D grating structure. The proposed 2D waveguide grating is composed of a 70-nm shallow-etched hole array and a 160-nm-thick deposited polycrystalline silicon tooth array. The demonstrated design exhibits a 3-dB bandwidth of 23.4 nm with good positioning tolerance for optical fibers. Due to the benefits of perfectly vertical coupling configuration, the measured polarization-dependent loss in experiments is below 0.3 dB within the 3-dB working bandwidth. Our proposed double-layer 2D gratings can also be applied to other integrated optics platforms, where the grating directionality can be enhanced by optimizing the front-end-of-line process to break the vertical symmetry, thus enabling an efficient and polarization-independent coupling between optical fibers and photonic chips.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy in a wire medium resulting from the rectangularity of a unit cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study is focused on the dispersion properties of a wire medium formed by a rectangular lattice of parallel wires at the frequencies close to its plasma frequency. While the effective medium theory predicts isotropic behaviour of transverse magnetic (TM) waves in the structure, numerical simulations reveal noticeable anisotropic properties. This anisotropy is dependent on the lattice rectangularity and reaches over 6% and over 75% along and across the wires respectively for thick wires with the radii about 20 times smaller than the smallest period. This conclusion is confirmed by line-of-current approximation theory. The revealed anisotropy effect is observed when the wavelength at the plasma frequency is comparable to the period of the structure. The effect vanishes in the case of extremely thin wires. A dispersion relation for TM waves in the vicinity of the $\Gamma$-point was obtained in a closed form. This provides an analytical description of the anisotropy effect.</description>

      <title>Current-Crowding-Free Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting single photons is essential for applications such as dark matter detection, quantum science and technology, and biomedical imaging. Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) excel in this task due to their near-unity detection efficiency, sub-Hz dark count rates, and picosecond timing jitter. However, a local increase of current density (current crowding) in the bends of meander-shaped SNSPDs limits these performance metrics. By locally irradiating the straight segments of SNSPDs with helium ions while leaving the bends unirradiated, we realize current-crowding-free SNSPDs with simultaneously enhanced sensitivity: after irradiation with 800 ions/nm$\unicode{xB2}$, locally irradiated SNSPDs showed a relative saturation plateau width of 37% while fully irradiated SNSPDs reached only 10%. This larger relative plateau width allows operation at lower relative bias currents, thereby reducing the dark count rate while still detecting single photons efficiently. We achieve an internal detection efficiency of 94% for a wavelength of 780 nm with a dark count rate of 7 mHz near the onset of saturating detection efficiency.</description>

      <title>Emulating quantum computing with optical matrix multiplication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14178v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical computing harnesses the speed of light to perform vector-matrix operations efficiently. It leverages interference, a cornerstone of quantum computing algorithms, to enable parallel computations. In this work, we interweave quantum computing with classical structured light by formulating the process of photonic matrix multiplication using quantum mechanical principles such as state superposition and subsequently demonstrate a well known algorithm, namely the Deutsch-Jozsa's algorithm. This is accomplished by elucidating the inherent tensor product structure within the Cartesian transverse degrees of freedom of light, which is the main resource for optical vector-matrix multiplication. To this end, we establish a discrete basis using localized Gaussian modes arranged in a lattice formation and demonstrate the operation of a Hadamard Gate. Leveraging the reprogrammable and digital capabilities of spatial light modulators, coupled with Fourier transforms by lenses, our approach proves adaptable to various algorithms. Therefore our work advances the use of structured light for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Ray tracing methods for wave propagation in moving anisotropic media : application to magnetized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation of a wave in a medium is generally affected when the medium is moving with respect to the observer. Because plasma equilibria often involve plasma flows, for instance in astrophysics or in magnetic confinement nuclear fusion devices, understanding the effect of motion on plasma waves is important. Meanwhile, the presence of a background magnetic field in a plasma makes it anisotropic. To address this problem, we derive here ray tracing equations for the trajectory of rays propagating in a moving anisotropic medium. The proposed approach is to use an effective dispersion relation for the moving medium as seen from the laboratory, obtained by performing a Lorentz transformation of the dispersion relation known for the medium at rest. This formalism is illustrated by considering the standard ordinary and extraordinary modes in a magnetized plasma at rest. Although we work here at lowest order in the geometrical optics approximation, this method is a first step towards higher order expansions, as required for instance to capture polarization effects.</description>

      <title>Vortex coronagraph: revisiting the phase retrieval properties via Zernike analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High contrast imaging (HCI) is fundamentally limited by wavefront aberrations, and the ability to perform wavefront sensing from focal plane images is key to reach the full potential of ground and space-based instruments. Vortex focal plane mask coupled with downstream pupil (Lyot) stop stands as one of the best small-angle coronagraphs, but is also sensitive to low-order aberrations. Here, we revisit the behavior of the vortex phase mask, from entrance pupil down to the final detector plane, with Zernike polynomials as input phase aberrations. In particular we develop a second-order expansion that allows us to analyze the phase retrieval properties in a more intuitive and accurate way than previously proposed. With this formalism, we show how the azimuthal vortex modulation modifies the phase retrieval properties compared to normal imaging. In particular, our results suggest that images obtained with a scalar vortex coronagraph can be used for unambiguous focal-plane wavefront sensing in any practical situation. We compare our results with numerical simulations and discuss practical implementation in coronagraphic instruments.</description>

Abstract: Optical tweezers have become essential tools for dynamically manipulating objects, ranging from microspheres or biological molecules to neutral atoms. In this study, we demonstrate the creation of tweezer arrays using a generative neural network, which allows for the trapping of neutral atoms with tunable atom arrays. We have successfully loaded cold strontium atoms into various optical tweezer patterns generated by a spatial light modulator (SLM) integrated with generative models. Our approach shortens the process time to control the SLM wtih minimal time delay, eliminating the need for repeated re-optimization of the hologram for the SLM.</description>

      <title>Giant second harmonic generation in supertwisted WS2 spirals grown in step edge particle induced non-Euclidean surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In moir\'e crystals resulting from the stacking of twisted two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, a subtle adjustment in the twist angle surprisingly gives rise to a wide range of correlated optical and electrical properties. Herein, we report the synthesis of supertwisted WS2 spirals and the observation of giant second harmonic generation (SHG) in these spirals. Supertwisted WS2 spirals featuring different twist angles are synthesized on a Euclidean or step-edge particle-induced non-Euclidean surface using a carefully designed water-assisted chemical vapor deposition. We observed an oscillatory dependence of SHG intensity on layer number, attributed to atomically phase-matched nonlinear dipoles within layers of supertwisted spiral crystals where inversion symmetry is restored. Through an investigation into the twist angle evolution of SHG intensity, we discovered that the stacking model between layers plays a crucial role in determining the nonlinearity, and the SHG signals in supertwisted spirals exhibit enhancements by a factor of 2 to 136 when compared with the SHG of the single-layer structure. These findings provide an efficient method for the rational growth of 2D twisted structures and the implementation of twist angle adjustable endowing them great potential for exploring strong coupling correlation physics and applications in the field of twistronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optomechanical systems produce chaotic behaviour due to nonlinear interaction between photons and phonons, and the same systems are used to understand the synthetic fields as well. Here, we report on the study of chaotic behaviour in the presence of a phononic synthetic magnetic field in a closed loop configuration consisting of a single optical mode and two mechanical modes. The modulation phase of the mechanical coupling between the two mechanical modes plays a critical role in determining the mechanical and optical intensity dynamics in the nonlinear regime. Our study shows the dark mode breaking effect in the presence of a synthetic magnetic field, which brings about a complex way of mechanical energy exchange that causes the cavity field to alternate between chaotic and regular behaviour periodically in temporal domain. However in the stronger nonlinear regime the temporal dynamics demonstrate predominantly chaotic behaviour. Besides, with the advent of advanced fabrication technologies, this study holds promises in developing phase tunable integrated low-power chaotic light sources to support efficient optical secure communication systems.</description>

Abstract: Light is a key information carrier, enabling worldwide high-speed data transmission through a telecommunication fibre network. This information-carrying capacity can be extended to transmitting quantum information (QI) by encoding it in single photons -- flying qubits. However, various QI-processing platforms operate at vastly different timescales. QI-processing units in atomic media, operating within nanosecond to microsecond timescales, and high-speed quantum communication, at picosecond timescales, cannot be efficiently linked due to orders of magnitude mismatch in the timescales or, correspondingly, spectral linewidths. In this work, we develop a large-aperture time lens using complex high-bandwidth electro-optic phase modulation to bridge this gap. We demonstrate coherent, deterministic spectral bandwidth compression of quantum light pulses by more than two orders of magnitude with high efficiency. It will facilitate large-scale hybrid QI-processing by linking the ultrafast and quasi-continuous-wave experimental platforms, which until now, to a large extent, have been developing independently.</description>

      <title>Efficient High-Dimensional Entangled State Analyzer with Linear Optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of higher-dimensional photonic encodings (qudits) instead of two-dimensional encodings (qubits) can improve the loss tolerance and reduce the computational resources of photonic-based quantum information processing. To harness this potential, efficient schemes for entangling operations such as the high-dimensional generalization of a linear optics Bell measurement will be required. We show how an efficient high-dimensional entangled state analyzer can be implemented with a linear optics interferometer and auxiliary photonic states. The degree of entanglement of the auxiliary state is much less than in previous protocols as quantified by an exponentially smaller Schmidt rank. In addition, the auxiliary state only occupies a single spatial mode, allowing it to be generated deterministically from a single quantum emitter coupled to a small qubit register. The reduced complexity of the auxiliary states results in a high robustness to imperfections and we show that auxiliary states with fidelities &gt; 0.9 for qudit dimensions 4 can be generated in the presence of qubit error rates on the order of 10%. This paves the way for experimental demonstrations with current hardware.</description>

      <title>The fate of optical excitons in FAPbI3 nanocube superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of the photoexcitation and ultrafast charge dynamics pathways in organic halide perovskite nanocubes and their aggregation into superlattices is key for the potential applications as tunable light emitters, photon harvesting materials and light-amplification systems. In this work, we apply two-dimensional coherent electronic spectroscopy (2DES) to track in real time the formation of near-infrared optical excitons and their ultrafast relaxation in CH(NH2)2PbI3 nanocube superlattices. Our results unveil that the coherent ultrafast dynamics is limited by the combination of the inherent short exciton decay time ~40 fs and the dephasing due to the coupling with selective optical phonon modes at higher temperatures. On the picosecond timescale, we observe the progressive formation of long-lived localized trap states. The analysis of the temperature dependence of the excitonic intrinsic linewidth, as extracted by the anti-diagonal components of the 2D spectra, unveils a dramatic change of the excitonic coherence time across the cubic to tetragonal structural transition. Our results offer a new way to control and enhance the ultrafast coherent dynamics of photocarrier generation in hybrid halide perovskite synthetic solids.</description>

Abstract: We propose a mathematical apparatus which converts magnetostatic (Walker) equations into a wave equation by introducing a specific definition of the magnetic refractive index. Its value can be manipulated by adjusting spatial distribution of the saturation magnetization or the bias magnetic field. We demonstrate that the latter can be accomplished efficiently by utilizing the bias field produced by magnetization patterns recorded onto a neighboring hard magnetic film using the current magnetic storage technology; there is a specific algorithm by which one can convert a two dimensional optical device into its magnetic analogue. The wave equation formalism opens the possibility to adopt a number of optics-like analytical and numerical techniques, including those applicable to scattering, near field, diffraction and geometric (Eikonal equation) optics, as well as a generic finite difference time domain (FDTD) algorithm.</description>
