      <title>A mathematical model for droplet separation by surface tension using contact cantilevers -- applications to {\it{in situ}} diagnosis and treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides an exact mathematical characterization of the meniscus formed by a liquid of density $\rho$ (model for tumor tissue) when probed with a cantilever device, operating by gravity (acceleration $g$) and with surface tension coefficient $\sigma$ (material-dependent for the specific choice of liquid and cantilever). The shape and extremal parameters (maximum height $\mathcal{H}$, break-off volume $\mathcal{V}$) of the meniscus formed, as functions of $\sigma, \rho$, are found by an exact analysis. Having knowledge of the explicit relationship between these parameters allows to perform in one procedure both diagnosis and treatment.</description>

      <title>Automatic motion estimation with applicationsto hiPSC-CMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are an effective tool for studying cardiac function and disease, and hold promise for screening drug effects on human tissue. Changes to motion patterns in these cells are one of the important features to be characterized to understand how an introduced drug or disease may alter the human heart beat. However, quantifying motion accurately and efficiently from optical measurements using microscopy is currently lacking. In this work, we present a unified framework for performing motion analysis on a sequence of microscopically obtained images of tissues consisting of hiPSC-CMs. We provide validation of our developed software using a synthetic test case and show how it can be used to extract displacements and velocities in hiPSC-CM microtissues. Finally, we show how to apply the framework to quantify the effect of an inotropic compound. The described software system is distributed as a python package that is easy to install, well tested and can be integrated into any python workflow.</description>

      <title>Cochlear Wave Propagation and Dynamics in the Human Base and Apex: Model-Based Estimates from Noninvasive Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cochlear wavenumber and impedance are mechanistic variables that encode information regarding how the cochlea works - specifically wave propagation and Organ of Corti dynamics. These mechanistic variables underlie interesting features of cochlear signal processing such as its place-based wavelet analyzers, dispersivity and high-gain. Consequently, it is of interest to estimate these mechanistic variables in various species (particularly humans) and across various locations along the length of the cochlea. In this paper, we develop methods to estimate the mechanistic variables (wavenumber and impedance) from noninvasive response characteristics (such as the quality factors of psychophysical tuning curves) using an existing analytic shortwave single-partition model of the mammalian cochlea. We then apply these methods to estimate human mechanistic variables using reported values for quality factors from psychophysical tuning curves and a location-invariant ratio extrapolated from chinchilla. Our resultant estimates for human wavenumbers and impedances show that the minimum wavelength (which occurs at the peak of the traveling wave) is smaller in base than the apex. The Organ of Corti is stiffness dominated rather than mass dominated, and there is negative effective damping prior to the peak followed by positive effective damping. The effective stiffness, and positive and negative effective damping are greater in the base than the apex. The methods introduced here for estimating mechanistic variables from characteristics of invasive or noninvasive responses enable us to derive such estimates across various species and locations where the responses are describable by sharp filters. In addition to studying cochlear wave propagation and dynamics, the estimation methods developed here are also useful for auditory filter design.</description>
