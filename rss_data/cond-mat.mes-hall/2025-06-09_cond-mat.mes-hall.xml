      <title>Kilobyte-Scale, Selector-Free, Temperature-Hard AlScN Ferroelectric Diode Crossbar Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the fabrication and characterization of kilobyte-scale, selector-free, ferroelectric (FE) diode crossbar memory arrays based on aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN). Utilizing a fully CMOS back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible process, we fabricated 2-kilobyte (128 $\times$ 128) arrays with device diameters down to 5 $\mu$m, achieving memory densities up to 2500 bits/mm$^2$. Large-scale electrical characterization across 1000 randomly selected devices reveals a yield rate of 95.2%, a tight switching voltage distribution with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.003, and consistent on/off ratios of around 10 with a CV of 0.27. We demonstrate selector-free read and program operations of the array, enabled by the high nonlinearity, rectification, and uniform switching behavior of the FE diodes. Furthermore, we verified consistent ferroelectric switching during array operation at temperatures up to 600 $^\circ$C. Our results highlight the potential of AlScN FE diode arrays for energy-efficient, high-density memory applications and lay the groundwork for future integration in compute-near-memory, high-temperature memory, and analog compute-in-memory systems.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum geometry with two-dimensional nonlinear optical spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the nonlinear optical response of crystalline systems is fundamentally a quantum geometric property. In this work, we propose two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS), which measures the nonlinear conductivity as a function of two independent frequencies using two time-delayed light pulses, as a probe of quantum geometry. We show how the two-frequency second-order nonlinear conductivity, which is naturally measured by 2DCS, decomposes into distinct quantum geometric contributions. We identify a term arising from the multi-band quantum connection that does not appear in linear response, and show that it can be measured in isolation by considering specific polarizations and enforcing time-reversal symmetry. We explore this finding via model calculations for transition metal dichalcogenides and Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Through these examples, we demonstrate how 2DCS enables study of the quantum connection, providing a way to compare the quantum geometry of different materials. We also show that one can gain rough momentum-resolved knowledge of the quantum geometry by varying the chemical potential.</description>

      <title>All-electrically controlled spintronics in altermagnetic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent development of altermagnetic materials, supporting spin splitting without net magnetization, opens new directions for spintronics that are fundamentally distinct from conventional ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, or spin-orbit coupling systems. Here we investigate spin-selective quantum transport in heterostructures composed of a normal metal and a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet. We focus on two types of $d$-wave altermagnets, namely, weak and strong altermagnets that support close elliptic and open hyperbolic spin-resolved Fermi surfaces, respectively. Building on these distinct electronic structures, we propose all-electrically controlled spin filter and spin valve devices, where quantum resonant tunneling enables highly spin-polarized conductance tunable via gate voltage and interface transparency. In particular, we find that strong altermagnets allow gate-tunable full spin polarization that is robust against interface scattering and can be reversed by gate control. We further demonstrate that a double-gated spin valve electrically switches between parallel and antiparallel spin configurations, analogous to magnetic junctions but without the need for external magnetic fields. Our results establish both weak and strong altermagnets as promising platforms for realizing magnetic-field-free electrically tunable spintronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Twist-Angle-Controlled Anomalous Gating in Bilayer Graphene/BN Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous gating effects-such as gate ineffectiveness and pronounced hysteresis-have been observed in graphene-based systems encapsulated in boron nitride (BN) and linked to a possible ferroelectric state. However, their origin, stability, and reproducibility remain under debate. Here, we present charge transport experiments in dual-gated, dynamically rotatable van der Waals heterostructures based on bilayer graphene encapsulated in BN. Remarkably, the angular degree of freedom acts as an ON/OFF switch for the anomalous gating response. We show that the angular alignment between the two BN layers -- not the presence of a moir\'e superlattice with graphene -- is the key parameter governing these effects. The relevant alignment between the two BN layers, to observe the anomalous gating effect at room temperature, lies between 15 deg and 45 deg, with no evidence of the expected 60 deg periodicity. Both gate ineffectiveness and hysteresis are highly sensitive to small angular changes, which we classify into three distinct regimes. Our results clarify the conditions necessary to reproduce these phenomena and pave the way for theoretical investigation of their microscopic origins.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature cotunneling electron transport in photo-switchable molecule-nanoparticle networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the temperature-dependent (4.2 - 300 K) electron transport properties (current-voltage) of photo-switchable two-dimensional arrays of gold nanoparticles (10 nm in diameter) functionalized by azobenzene derivatives. Under UV-light irradiation at 4.2 K, the azobenzene moieties are switched from the trans to cis isomers, leading to an increase of the current. In both conformations, at low temperature (&lt; 77 K) and low voltage (&lt; 1 V) the voltage- and temperature-dependent current behaviors show that electron cotunneling is the dominant transport mechanism. The number of cotunneling events Ncot slightly increases from ca. 1. 4 to 1.7 upon trans-to-cis isomerization of the azobenzenes. The nanoparticle Coulomb charging energy is not significantly modified (ca. 15 meV) by the azobenzene isomerization. This weak increase of Ncot is explained by the modest cis/trans current ratio (&lt; 10) and the limited numbers of nanoparticle-molecule-nanoparticle junctions inserted between the two nanoscale electrodes (&lt; 50 nm apart) connecting the network.</description>

      <title>Cavity-mediated exciton hopping in a dielectrically engineered polariton system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons - coherently hybridized states of excitons and photons - are instrumental for solid-state nonlinear optics and quantum simulations. To enable engineered polariton energy landscapes and interactions, local control over the particle-like states can be achieved by tuning the properties of the exciton constituent. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides stand out in this respect, as they readily allow for a deterministic, flexible and scalable control of excitons, and thus of hybrid exciton-polaritons, via environmental dielectric engineering. Here, we demonstrate the realization of mesoscopic exciton-polariton domains in a structured dielectric exciton environment, and establish an effective long-range exciton hopping in the dispersive regime of cavity-coupling. Our results represent a crucial step toward interacting polaritonic networks and quantum simulations in exciton-polariton lattices based on dielectrically tailored two-dimensional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Electrically reconfigurable extended lasing state in an organic liquid-crystal microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-footprint, low-power arrays of coupled coherent emitters with the capability of near- and far-field engineering and coherence control are highly sought after to meet modern nanophotonics evolving needs. Between existing solutions based on vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, phase masks in bulk traditional cavity-based systems, and lattices of exciton-polariton condensates, only the strongly light-matter coupled systems were shown to be capable of controlled on-chip interaction between the individual coherent states while often operating at cryogenic temperatures. Here we demonstrate electrically controlled in-plane interaction between optically reconfigurable spatially separated lasing states, operating at room temperature in the weak light-matter coupling regime. We show spatially extended coherent lasing state or "supermode" with wide-range micro-scale control of near-field, far-field and on-chip phase-locking tuning functionality. An extended lasing state appears due to near-field transverse coupling between distinct spatially pumped lasing states in the plane of an organic liquid crystal-filled microcavity. We realize electrical control over the interaction strength between lasing states and corresponding mutual coherence going beyond nearest neighbours through electrical tuning of the microcavity optical modes with external voltage, and a spin-selective directional coupling regime by using a photonic analogue of the Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Classification for Alternating Excitons in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons, bound electron-holes states, often dominate the optical response of two-dimensional (2D) materials and reflect their inherent properties, including spin-orbit coupling, magnetic ordering, or band topology. By focusing on a growing class of collinear antiferromagnets with a nonrelativistic spin splitting, referred to also as altermagnets (AM), we propose a theoretical framework based on the spin space group (SSG) to elucidate their resulting excitons. Our approach is illustrated on 2D AM with spin-polarized valleys, where we classify the combination of conduction and valence bands by the SSG representations into two cases that hosts bright $s$-like and $p$-like excitons, respectively. This analysis is further supported by effective Hamiltonians and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. We identify the excitonic optical selection rules from the calculated absorption spectra and the symmetry of bright excitons from their momentum space envelope functions. Our framework provides optical fingerprints for various cases of AM, while their tunability, such as the strain-induced valley splitting, is also transferred to excitons allowing, additionally, valley-polarized photocurrent generation.</description>

      <title>Robust quantification of the diamond nitrogen-vacancy center charge state via photoluminescence spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are at the heart of many emerging quantum technologies, all of which require control over the NV charge state. Hence, methods for quantification of the relative photoluminescence (PL) intensities of the NV$^0$ and NV$^-$ charge state, i.e., a charge state ratio, are vital. Several approaches to quantify NV charge state ratios have been reported but are either limited to bulk-like NV diamond samples or yield qualitative results. We propose an NV charge state quantification protocol based on the determination of sample- and experimental setup-specific NV$^0$ and NV$^-$ reference spectra. The approach employs blue (400-470 nm) and green (480-570 nm) excitation to infer pure NV$^0$ and NV$^-$ spectra, which are then used to quantify NV charge state ratios in subsequent experiments via least squares fitting. We test our dual excitation protocol (DEP) for a bulk diamond NV sample, 20 and 100 nm nanodiamond particles and compare results with those obtained via other commonly used techniques such as zero-phonon line fitting and non-negative matrix factorization. We find that DEP can be employed across different samples and experimental setups and yields consistent and quantitative results for NV charge state ratios that are in agreement with our understanding of NV photophysics. By providing robust NV charge state quantification across sample types and measurement platforms, DEP will support the development of NV-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions induced by resonant light: a phenomenological approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a phenomenological framework to describe a subclass of light-induced phase transitions (LIPTs) in condensed matter systems, specifically those mediated by the resonant generation of excitons. Our approach extends the classical Landau theory by introducing dynamic coupling between the system's order parameter and complex excitonic fields, along with Langevin-type forces that drive the system toward states of minimal free energy. The model is applied in the context of all-optical resonant magnetization switching in two-dimensional magnetic materials, particularly reproducing the experimental findings for reverse magnetization by all-optical means for a monolayer CrI$_3$. Our phenomenological model can be applied to other systems characterized by an order parameter and excitonic fields created through resonant light, offering versatility and potential to guide future experimental and theoretical studies in LIPT phenomena.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Floquet fluxonium qubits with commensurable two-tone drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting superconducting qubits from low-frequency noise by operating them on dynamical sweet-spot manifolds has proven to be a promising setup, theoretically as well as experimentally . These dynamical sweet spots are induced by an externally applied Floquet drive, and various drive forms have been studied in different types of qubits. In this work we study the effects of using two-tone drives on the applied magnetic flux of the form $\phi_{ac}(t)=\phi_m\cos(m\omega_\mathrm{d} t)+\phi_n\cos(n\omega_\mathrm{d} t+\varphi)$, where $m,n \in \mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}$, on the coherence times of fluxonium qubits. The optimal drive parameters are found through analysis using perturbation theory and numerical calculations. We show that this type of drive allows for more tunability of the quasi-energy spectrum, creating higher and wider peaks of the dephasing time without affecting the relaxation times too strongly. Further we show that the second commensurable drive tone can be used to implement an improved phase gate compared to implementations with a single tone, supported by Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interlayer excitons in semiconducting bilayers separated by insulating hBN layers constitute a promising platform for investigation of strongly correlated bosonic phases. Here, we report an optical method for the generation and characterization of long-lived interlayer excitons. We find confirmation of tightly bound interlayer excitons by measuring 1s and 2s intralayer excitons in each layer concurrently. Using a pump-probe technique, we find interlayer exciton lifetimes up to 8.8 $\mu$s, increasing with the thickness of the hBN. With optical access to long-lived interlayer excitons, our approach provides a new promising route to explore degenerate Bose--Fermi mixtures of excitons and itinerant electrons with high spatial and temporal resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding time-resolved quantum transport is crucial for developing next-generation quantum technologies, particularly in nano- and molecular junctions subjected to time-dependent perturbations. Traditional steady-state approaches to quantum transport are not designed to capture the transient dynamics necessary for controlling electronic behavior at ultrafast time scales. In this work, we present a non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, within the recently-developed iterated generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz ($i$GKBA), to study thermoelectric quantum transport beyond the wide-band limit approximation (WBLA). We employ the Meir-Wingreen formula for both charge and energy currents and analyze the transition from Lorentzian line-width functions to the WBLA, identifying unphysical divergences in the latter. Our results highlight the importance of finite-bandwidth effects and demonstrate the efficiency of the $i$GKBA approach in modeling time-resolved thermoelectric transport, also providing benchmark comparisons against the full Kadanoff-Baym theory. We exemplify the developed theory in the calculation of time-resolved thermopower and thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency in a cyclobutadiene molecular junction.</description>

In this work we investigate the Kitaev chain coupled to a single mode photonic cavity. Using exact diagonalization we calculate the many-body energy spectrum of the electron-photon Hamiltonian in finite-length chains. We find two distinct types of ground states, one with a well defined parity and another with an alternating parity where a doubly degenerate ground state takes place at exceptional points, known as parity switching points. The double ground state hosts edge states weakly affected by the cavity coupling, even in the low frequency regime, in contrast with higher excited states showing strong dependence with the cavity coupling. Besides the electronic quantities, we also find that the photon number peaks at values of the chemical potential corresponding to parity switching points. Therefore, we suggest that quantum optics experiments could be employed to detect the double ground state hosting edge states weakly hybridized with light. Finally, calculations of photonic quadratures reveal squeezed states that are both captured by the exact diagonalization technique and mean field decoupling. However, within these two approaches differences in the photon probability in odd numbers of photons are reported.</description>

      <title>Correlated Structural and Optical Characterization during Van der Waals Epitaxy of PbI2 on Graphene</title>

Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures of 2D layered materials have gained much attention due to their flexible electronic properties, which make them promising candidates for energy, sensing, catalytic, and biomedical applications. Lead iodide (PbI2), a 2D layered semiconductor material belonging to the metal halide family, shows a thickness-dependent band gap with an indirect-to-direct transition above one monolayer. It has emerged as an excellent candidate for photodetectors and is a key component in metal halide perovskites solar cells. In the current work, we investigated the growth dynamics and the real-time correlation between structural and optical properties of PbI2 layers deposited on graphene/SiC(0001) by Molecular Beam Epitaxy. The structural and optical properties are probed respectively by Grazing Incidence Fast Atom Diffraction and Surface Differential Reflectance Spectroscopy. The growth proceeds layer-by-layer in a van der Waals-like epitaxy, with the zigzag direction of PbI2 parallel to the armchair direction of graphene. Both techniques bring evidence of significant modifications of the structural, electronic, and optical properties of the first PbI2 monolayer, characterized by a 1% tensile strain that relaxes over 3 to 5 monolayers. For a single monolayer, Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy reveals a charge transfer from graphene to PbI2, demonstrated by an energy shift of the order of 50 meV in the graphene band structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the quantum dynamics of a spin-1/2 particle confined to a curved path from the dynamics of a two-dimensional curved thin-layer system incorporating spin connection contributions. We demonstrate that the geodesic curvature, normal curvature, and geodesic torsion of the curve govern the emergent non-Abelian gauge potential and effective scalar potential in the system's Hamiltonian. The resulting spin precession dynamics induced by the gauge potential are analyzed, revealing that the rotation angle of spin orientation along a surface boundary and the pseudo-magnetic flux are topologically governed by the surface geometry. Spin texture evolution along helices illustrates distinct behaviors under geodesic versus non-geodesic propagation. Further, spin evolution in a closed trajectory-Viviani's curve, exemplifies the surface-dependent spin orientation and path-ordering sensitivity of the non-Abelian gauge potential. Our theory establishes a framework for spin-state manipulation via engineered nanostructured channels, enabling novel topological quantum control strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider plasmon-assisted electron tunneling in a quantum twisting microscope (QTM). The dependence of the differential conductance on the two control parameters of the QTM -- the twist angle and bias -- reveals the plasmon spectrum as well as the strength of plasmon-electron interactions in the sample. We perform microscopic calculations for twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), to predict the plasmon features in the tunneling spectra of TBG close to the magic angle for different screening environments. Our work establishes a general framework for inelastic tunneling spectroscopy of collective electronic excitations using the quantum twisting microscope.</description>

      <title>Phonon angular momentum induced by Terahertz electric field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing interest in phonon angular momentum (AM) in recent years, current studies remain limited to a few materials due to the constraints imposed by time reversal symmetry on macroscopic phonon AM. In this work, we theoretically investigate the generation of total phonon AM through alternating terahertz electric fields in polarized materials. In contrast to previous studies on phonon AM, here the off-diagonal elements of the phonon AM operator play an essential role. According to our formula, the large AM is generated when the energy of incident electric fields matches the frequency of optical phonons at {\Gamma} point. Furthermore, a specific resonance on the imaginary part of the response coefficient, as well as periodic regulation of the phonon AM by the phase difference of the driving field, is observed. In polar material GaN, the oscillation maximum is observed as \hbar per unit cell which can be experimentally measured through orbital magnetization induced by phonon AM. Our work offers a promising approach to generate observable phonon AM in a wider range of materials, advancing both the understanding of phonon fundamental physics and potential applications in phononic devices.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of Afterglow and Thermally Stimulated Luminescence in UV-irradiated InP/ZnS Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indium phosphide-based quantum dots (QDs) are a potential material for designing optoelectronic devices, owing their adjustable spectral parameters over the entire visible range, as well as their high biocompatibility and environmental safety. Concurrently, they exhibit structural defects, the rectification of which is crucial for enhancing their optical properties. The present work explores, for the first time, the low-temperature afterglow (AG) and spectrally resolved thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) of UV-irradiated colloidal core/shell InP/ZnS QDs in the range of 7-340 K. It is shown that, when localized during irradiation and released after additional stimulation, charge carriers recombine involving defect centers based on indium and phosphorus dangling bonds. The mechanisms of the observed luminescent phenomena can be caused by both thermal activation and tunneling processes. By means of the initial rise method, the formalism of general-order kinetics, and the analytical description using the Lambert W function, we have analyzed the kinetic features of possible thermally stimulated mechanisms. We have also estimated the energy characteristics of appropriate trapping centers. A low rate of charge carriers recapture is revealed for InP/ZnS QDs. Active traps in nanocrystals of different sizes are characterized by close values of activation energy in the 26-31 meV range. The current paper discloses new horizons for exploiting TSL approaches to study the properties of local defective states in the energy structure of colloidal QDs, which can contribute to the development of targeted synthesis of nanocrystals with tunable temperature sensitivity for optoelectronic and sensor applications.</description>

      <title>Unusual Electron-Phonon Interactions in Highly Anisotropic Two-Dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) represent a fundamental cornerstone of condensed matter physics, commanding persistent attention due to their pivotal role in driving novel quantum phenomena within low-dimensional materials. Here, we unveil unusual anisotropic electron-phonon coupling behaviors in quasi-one-dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ nano-flakes through a powerful combination of angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy directly visualize the pronounced quasi-one-dimensional atomic chains within the crystal structure, establishing a structural foundation for the observed anisotropic interactions. Our Raman investigations reveal remarkable polarization-dependent responses in $A_g$ phonon modes that deviate significantly from conventional behavior, which our theoretical analyses attribute to complex anisotropic electron-photon and electron-phonon interactions. Temperature-dependent Raman measurements further uncover an intriguing phonon decay mechanism involving both three- and four-phonon processes, with the latter showing significant contributions in some modes - a possible manifestation of strong anisotropic electron-phonon interactions. Beyond revealing $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ as an exceptional platform for exploring anisotropic EPIs, this work demonstrates that integrating angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy with DFPT calculations offers a powerful methodology for investigating electron-phonon interactions in emerging low-dimensional quantum materials.</description>

      <title>A Combined DFT and MD Study on Interface Stability in Ferrite-Cementite Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the atomic structure and energetic stability of ferrite-cementite interfaces is essential for optimizing the mechanical performance of steels, especially under extreme conditions such as those encountered in nuclear fusion environments. In this work, we combine Classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) to systematically investigate the stability of ferrite-cementite interfaces within the Bagaryatskii Orientation Relationship. Three interface orientations and several cementite terminations are considered to identify the most stable configurations.
  MD simulations reveal that the (010)||(11-2) and (001)||(1-10) orientations are energetically favourable for selected terminations, and these predictions are validated and refined by subsequent DFT calculations. A key result of our study is the destabilizing effect of interfacial carbon atoms, which increase the interface energy and decrease the Griffith energy, indicating a reduced resistance to fracture. This finding contrasts with earlier reports suggesting a stabilizing role for carbon.
  Our analysis of the electronic structure shows that Fe-C bonding at the interface perturbs the metallic environment of interfacial Fe atoms. This bonding response explains the observed variations in magnetic moment and helps rationalize the trends in interface energy. We also establish correlations between interface energy, magnetic perturbation, and a bond-based descriptor quantifying new and broken bonds. These insights provide a physically grounded, predictive framework for the design and optimization of ferrite-cementite interfaces in advanced steels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confining light around solids via cavities enhances the coupling between the electromagnetic fluctuations and the matter. We predict that in superconductors this cavity-enhanced coupling enables the control of the order-parameter stiffness, which governs key length scales such as the coherence length of Cooper pairs and the magnetic penetration depth. We explain this as a renormalization of the Cooper-pair mass caused by photon-mediated repulsive interactions between the electrons building the pair. The strength of this effect can be tuned via the length of the cavity and we estimate it to be sizable for cavities in the infrared range.</description>

Abstract: Semiconducting field emitters present some interesting features (e.g.; self-limited electron emission) for both scientific interest and industrial applications. The analysis of experimental results and device design has been restrained by the lack of accurate 3D models for the simulation of thermal-field emission from semiconductors. Here we review and correct the equations of field emission from semiconductors and include them to expand GETELEC (General Tool for Electron Emission Calculations). Our method covers all electron emission regime (field, thermal, and intermediate), aiming to maximise the calculation accuracy while minimising the computational cost. GETELEC-2.0 is able to reproduce the characteristic non-linear I-V curves in Fowler-Nordheim coordinates obtained from semiconductors, giving insights about their nature. As well as providing an explanation to the lack of experimental observation of valence band electrons from semiconductors.</description>

Abstract: Optical-to-electrical (O-E) conversion in graphene is a central phenomenon for realizing anticipated ultrafast and low-power-consumption information technologies. However, revealing its mechanism and intrinsic time scale require uncharted terahertz (THz) electronics and device architectures. Here, we succeeded in resolving O-E conversion processes in high-quality graphene by on-chip electrical readout of ultrafast photothermoelectric current. By suppressing the RC time constant using a resistive zinc oxide top gate, we constructed a gate-tunable graphene photodetector with a bandwidth of up to 220 GHz. By measuring nonlocal photocurrent dynamics, we found that the photocurrent extraction from the electrode is instantaneous without a measurable carrier transit time across several-micrometer-long graphene, following the Shockley-Ramo theorem. The time for photocurrent generation is exceptionally tunable from immediate to &gt; 4 ps, and its origin is identified as Fermi-level-dependent intraband carrier-carrier scattering. Our results bridge the gap between ultrafast optical science and device engineering, accelerating ultrafast graphene optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Steering transport of ultrashort polariton wavepackets is essential for achieving on-chip integrated nanocircuits with tightly confined electromagnetic fields towards ultrafast information processing. However, conventional optical techniques have struggled to integrate the necessary components for transferring polariton signals. Here, we address this challenge by electrically generating, manipulating, and reading out terahertz graphene plasmon-polariton wavepackets on-chip. By injecting an electrical pulse into graphene via an ohmic contact, we achieve coherent conversion of the pulse into a plasmon wavepacket exhibiting a pulse duration of 1.2 ps and extreme three-dimensional spatial confinement within a volume of $2.1 \times 10^{-18} m^3$. We reveal the transport properties of plasmons along graphene ribbons in different dielectric environments, providing a basis for designing graphene plasmonic circuits. Furthermore, we find that the conversion efficiency between the electrical pulses and plasmon wavepackets reaches ~30% thanks to the absence of a momentum mismatch. With unprecedented controllability, our platform represents a significant advance in on-chip handling of plasmonic signals in various van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (EMCA) refers to the chirality- and current-dependent nonlinear magnetoresistance in chiral conductors and is commonly interpreted in a semiclassical picture. In this work, we reveal a quantum geometry origin of EMCA using a chiral rectangular lattice model that resembles a chiral organic conductor (DM-EDT-TTF)${}_2$ClO${}_4$ studied for EMCA recently and exhibits symmetry-protected Dirac bands similar to those of graphene. Compared to the semiclassical term, we find that Dirac states contribute significantly to both traditional longitudinal EMCA and the unconventional transverse EMCA via the quantum metric when Fermi energy is close to the Dirac point. Besides, we discover that a topological insulator state can emerge once spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is added to our chiral model lattice. Our work paves a path toward understanding quantum geometry in the magnetotransport of chiral materials.</description>

      <title>Random-Flux-Induced Transition Sequence between Weak and Strong Topological Phases with Anisotropic Localization Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that random flux is able to drive nontrivial topological phase transitions, in particular between weak topological insulators (WTIs) and Chern insulators (CIs), illustrated on an anisotropic Wilson-Dirac model in two dimensions. Remarkably, an intriguing topological transition sequence WTIs$\rightarrow$CIs$\rightarrow$WTIs occurs with the reentrance to a WTI but of different weak topology, which is unattainable with chemical potential disorder. The involvement of anisotropy and weak topology in such a transition gives rise to emergent quasi-critical points, where eigen states are extended in one spatial direction but localized in the other one. This new quantum criticality lies outside the conventional quantum Hall universality class. We provide a comprehensive characterization of the random-flux-induced phase transitions and quantum criticality from both bulk and boundary perspectives. Our results describe a qualitatively new disorder effect based on the interplay of random flux with topological phases of matter.</description>

Abstract: We report tunneling spectroscopy of Andreev subgap states in hybrid nanowires with a thin superconducting full-shell surrounding a semiconducting core. The combination of the quantized fluxoid of the shell and the Andreev reflection at the superconductor-semiconductor interface gives rise to analogs of Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states found in Abrikosov vortices in type-II superconductors. Unlike in metallic superconductors, CdGM analogs in full-shell hybrid nanowires manifest as one-dimensional van Hove singularities with energy spacings comparable to the superconducting gap and independent of the Fermi energy, making them readily observable. Evolution of these analogs with axial magnetic field, skewed within the Little-Parks lobe structure, is consistent with theory and yields information about the radial distribution and angular momenta of the corresponding subbands.</description>

      <title>Coherent Interaction of 2s and 1s Exciton States in Transition-Metal Dichalcogenide Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy to study the coherent interaction of excited exciton states in WSe2 and MoSe2 monolayers via the optical Stark effect. For co-circularly polarized pump and probe, we measure a blueshift which points to a repulsive interaction between the 2s and 1s exciton states. The determined 2s-1s interaction strength is on par with that of the 1s-1s, in agreement with the semiconductor Bloch equations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a 2s-1s biexciton bound state in the cross-circular configuration in both materials and determine their binding energy.</description>

      <title>RKKY quadratic and biquadratic spin-spin interactions in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the competition between the RKKY quadratic and biquadratic spin-spin interactions of two magnetic impurities in twisted bilayer graphene away from the magic angle. We apply the Bistritzer-MacDonald model of two graphene layers twisted with respect to each other by a small angle. By reducing the model to the Dirac-type one with modified Fermi velocity, we derive expressions for the RKKY quadratic and biquadratic spin interactions using perturbation theory for the free energy. The biquadratic interaction is suppressed by a larger power of the interaction constant and decreases faster with a the distance between impurities comparing to the quadratic one. Nevertheless, due to the different period of oscillations with impurity separation distance, chemical potential, twist angle and temperature, it is possible to fine-tune the system to the regime of dominating biquadratic interaction. The existence of such fine-tuned regime might provide a promising opportunity to observe non-conventional spin ordering.</description>

      <title>Buried unstrained Ge channels: a lattice-matched platform for quantum technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ge and Si strained quantum wells have enabled the most advanced spin-qubit quantum processors, but they are deposited on defective, metamorphic SiGe substrates, which may impact device performance and scaling. Here we introduce an alternative platform, based on a heterojunction between unstrained Ge and a strained SiGe barrier, which is lattice-matched to a Ge substrate. In a structure with a 52-nm-thick strained SiGe barrier, we demonstrate a low-disorder two-dimensional hole gas with a high-mobility of 1.33$\times$10$^5$ cm$^2$/Vs and a low percolation density of 1.4(1)$\times$10$^1$$^0$ cm$^-$$^2$. Quantum transport measurements show that confined holes have a strong density-dependent in-plane effective mass and out-of-plane $g$-factor, pointing to a significant heavy-hole--light-hole mixing in agreement with theory. The expected strong spin-orbit interaction, possibility of isotopic purification, and ability to host superconducting pairing correlations make this platform appealing for fast quantum hardware and hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Hole spin qubits in unstrained Germanium layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strained germanium heterostructures are one of the most promising material for hole spin qubits but suffer from the strong anisotropy of the gyromagnetic factors that hinders the optimization of the magnetic field orientation. The figures of merit (Rabi frequencies, lifetimes...) can indeed vary by an order of magnitude within a few degrees around the heterostructure plane. We propose to address this issue by confining the holes at the interface of an unstrained, bulk Ge substrate or thick buffer. We model such structures and show that the gyromagnetic anisotropy is indeed considerably reduced. In addition, the Rabi frequencies and quality factors can be significantly improved with respect to strained heterostructures. This extends the operational range of the qubits and shall ease the scale-up to many-qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Percolative supercurrent in superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report tunneling spectroscopy and transport measurements in superconducting Al and ferromagnetic-insulator EuS bilayers. The samples display remanent spin-splitting, roughly half the superconducting gap, and supercurrent transport above the average paramagnetic limit. We interpret this behavior as arising from the interplay between two characteristic length scales: the superconducting coherence length, $\xi$, and the magnetic domain size, $d$. By comparing experimental results to a theoretical model, we find $\xi/d \approx 10$. In this regime, spin-averaging across the micromagnetic configuration can locally suppress superconductivity, resulting in percolative supercurrent flow.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Quantum Electrodynamics with Moir\'e Flatband Photonic Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters are a key component in photonic quantum technologies. Enhancing their single-photon emission by engineering the photonic environment using cavities can significantly improve the overall efficiency in quantum information processing. However, this enhancement is often constrained by the need for precise nanoscale control over the emitter's position within micro- or nano-cavities. Inspired by the fascinating physics of moir\'e patterns, we present an approach to strongly modify the spontaneous emission rate of a quantum emitter using a finely designed multilayer moir\'e photonic crystal with a robust isolated-flatband dispersion. Theoretical analysis reveals that, due to its nearly infinite photonic density of states, the moir\'e cavity can simultaneously achieve a high Purcell factor and exhibit large tolerance over the emitter's position. We experimentally demonstrate the coupling between this moir\'e cavity and a quantum dot through the cavity-determined polarization of the dot's emission. The radiative lifetime of the quantum dot can be tuned by a factor of 40, ranging from 42 ps to 1692 ps, which is attributed to strong Purcell enhancement and Purcell inhibition effects. Our findings pave the way for moir\'e flatband cavity-enhanced quantum light sources, quantum optical switches, and quantum nodes for quantum internet applications.</description>

      <title>Identifying Switching of Antiferromagnets by Spin-Orbit Torques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets are promising candidates for ultrafast spintronic applications, leveraging current-induced spin-orbit torques. However, experimentally distinguishing between different switching mechanisms of the staggered magnetization (N\'eel vector) driven by current pulses remains a challenge. In an exemplary study of the collinear antiferromagnetic compound Mn$_2$Au, we demonstrate that slower thermomagnetoelastic effects predominantly govern switching over a wide parameter range. In the regime of short current pulses in the nanosecond range, however, we observe fully N\'eel spin-orbit torque driven switching. We show that this ultrafast mechanism enables the complete directional alignment of the N\'eel vector by current pulses in device structures.</description>

      <title>On the origin of heating-induced softening and enthalpic reinforcement in elastomeric nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite a century of use, the mechanism of nanoparticle-driven mechanical reinforcement of elastomers is unresolved. A major hypothesis attributes it to glassy interparticle bridges, supported by an observed inversion of the variation of the modulus E(T) on heating -- from entropic stiffening in elastomers to enthalpic softening in nanocomposites. Here, molecular simulations reveal that elastomer enthalpic softening can instead emerge from a competition over preferred nonequilibrium volumes between elastomer and nanoparticulate networks. A theory for this competition accounting for softening of the bulk modulus on heating predicts the simulated E(T) inversion, suggesting that reinforcement is driven by a volume-competition mechanism unique to co-continuous systems of soft and rigid networks.</description>

      <title>Topological altermagnetic Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions are pivotal for engineering topological superconductivity, yet are severely hindered by orbital effects induced by in-plane magnetic fields. In this work, we introduce the generic topological altermagnetic Josephson junctions (TAJJs) by leveraging the intrinsic spin-polarized band splitting and zero net magnetization attributes of altermagnets. Our proposed TAJJs effectively mitigate the detrimental orbital effects while robustly hosting Majorana end modes (MEMs) at both ends of the junction. Specifically, we demonstrate that MEMs emerge in $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave TAJJs but vanish in the $d_{xy}$-wave configuration, thereby establishing the crystallographic orientation angle $\theta$ of the altermagnet as a novel control parameter of topology. The distinct spin-polarization of the MEMs provides an unambiguous experimental signature for the spin-resolved measurement. Furthermore, by harnessing the synergy between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave altermagnet and its superconducting counterpart, our proposal extends to high-$T_c$ platforms naturally. Overall, this work establishes altermagnets as a versatile paradigm for realizing topological superconductivity, bridging conceptual innovations with scalable quantum architectures devoid of orbital effects and stray fields.</description>

      <title>Exciton--hyperbolic-phonon-polariton Hybridization in Biased Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.</description>
