      <title>BG-FlipIn: A Bayesian game framework for FlipIt-insider models in advanced persistent threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study advanced persistent threats (APT) with an insider who has different preferences. To address the uncertainty of the insider's preference, we propose the BG-FlipIn: a Bayesian game framework for FlipIt-insider models with an investigation on malicious, inadvertent, or corrupt insiders. We calculate the closed-form Bayesian Nash Equilibrium expression and further obtain three edge cases with deterministic insiders corresponding to their Nash Equilibrium expressions. On this basis, we further discover several phenomena in APT related to the defender's move rate and cost, as well as the insider's preferences. We then provide decision-making guidance for the defender, given different parametric conditions. Two applications validate that our BG-FlipIn framework enables the defender to make decisions consistently, avoiding detecting the insider's concrete preference or adjusting its strategy frequently.</description>

      <title>Deterministic algorithms for inhomogeneous Bernoulli trials: Shapley value of network devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $n$ computer devices are to be connected to a network via inhomogeneous Bernoulli trials. The Shapley value of a device quantifies how much the network's value increases due to the participation of that device. Characteristic functions of such games are naturally taken as the belief function (containment function) and Choquet capacity (hitting probability) of a random set (random network of devices).
  Traditionally, the Shapley value is either calculated as the expected marginal contribution over all possible coalitions (subnetworks), which results in exponential computational complexity, or approximated by the Monte Carlo sampling technique, where the performance is highly dependent on the stochastic sampling process.
  The purpose of this study is to design deterministic algorithms for games formulated via inhomogeneous Bernoulli trials that approximate the Shapley value in linear or quadratic time, with rigorous error analysis (Sections 3 and 4). Additionally, we provide a review of relevant literature on existing calculation methods in Remark 3.1 and Appendix I.
  A further goal is to supplement Shapley's original proof by deriving the Shapley value formula using a rigorous approach based on definite integrals and combinatorial analysis. This method explicitly highlights the roles of the Binomial Theorem and the Beta function in the proof, addressing a gap in Shapley's work (Appendix II).</description>

      <title>Extending Games beyond the Finite Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper argues that the finite horizon paradox, where game theory contradicts intuition, stems from the limitations of standard number systems in modelling the cognitive perception of infinity. To address this issue, we propose a new framework based on Alternative Set Theory (AST). This framework represents different cognitive perspectives on a long history of events using distinct topologies. These topologies define an indiscernibility equivalence that formally treats huge, indistinguishable quantities as equivalent. This offers criterion-dependent resolutions to long-standing paradoxes, such as Selten's chain store paradox and Rosenthal's centipede game. Our framework reveals new intuitive subgame perfect equilibria, the characteristics of which depend on the chosen temporal perspective and payoff evaluation. Ultimately, by grounding its mathematical foundation in different modes of human cognition, our work expands the explanatory power of game theory for long-horizon scenarios.</description>

      <title>Auctioning Future Services in Edge Networks with Moving Vehicles: N-Step Look-Ahead Contracts for Sustainable Resource Provision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timely resource allocation in edge-assisted vehicular networks is essential for compute-intensive services such as autonomous driving and navigation. However, vehicle mobility leads to spatio-temporal unpredictability of resource demands, while real-time double auctions incur significant latency. To address these challenges, we propose a look-ahead contract-based auction framework that shifts decision-making from runtime to planning time. Our approach establishes N-step service contracts between edge servers (ESs) using demand forecasts and modified double auctions. The system operates in two stages: first, an LSTM-based prediction module forecasts multi-slot resource needs and determines ES roles (buyer or seller), after which a pre-double auction generates contracts specifying resource quantities, prices, and penalties. Second, these contracts are enforced in real time without rerunning auctions. The framework incorporates energy costs, transmission overhead, and contract breach risks into utility models, ensuring truthful, rational, and energy-efficient trading. Experiments on real-world (UTD19) and synthetic traces demonstrate that our method improves time efficiency, energy use, and social welfare compared with existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Fixed Points and Stochastic Meritocracies: A Long-Term Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study group fairness in the context of feedback loops induced by meritocratic selection into programs that themselves confer additional advantage, like college admissions. We introduce a novel stylized inter-generational model for the setting and analyze it in situations where there are no underlying differences between two populations. We show that, when the benefit of the program (or the harm of not getting into it) is completely symmetric, disparities between the two populations will eventually dissipate. However, the time an accumulated advantage takes to dissipate could be significant, and increases substantially as a function of the relative importance of the program in conveying benefits. We also find that significant disparities can arise due to chance even from completely symmetric initial conditions, especially when populations are small. The introduction of even a slight asymmetry, where the group that has accumulated an advantage becomes slightly preferred, leads to a completely different outcome. In these instances, starting from completely symmetric initial conditions, disparities between groups arise stochastically and then persist over time, yielding a permanent advantage for one group. Our analysis precisely characterizes conditions under which disparities persist or diminish, with a particular focus on the role of the scarcity of available spots in the program and its effectiveness. We also present extensive simulations in a richer model that further support our theoretical results in the simpler, stylized model. Our findings are relevant for the design and implementation of algorithmic fairness interventions in similar selection processes.</description>

      <title>Solving Football by Exploiting Equilibrium Structure of 2p0s Differential Games with One-Sided Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a two-player imperfect-information extensive-form game (IIEFG) with $K$ time steps and a player action space of size $U$, the game tree complexity is $U^{2K}$, causing existing IIEFG solvers to struggle with large or infinite $(U,K)$, e.g., differential games with continuous action spaces. To partially address this scalability challenge, we focus on an important class of 2p0s games where the informed player (P1) knows the payoff while the uninformed player (P2) only has a belief over the set of $I$ possible payoffs. Such games encompass a wide range of scenarios in sports, defense, cybersecurity, and finance. We prove that under mild conditions, P1's (resp. P2's) equilibrium strategy at any infostate concentrates on at most $I$ (resp. $I+1$) action prototypes. When $I\ll U$, this equilibrium structure causes the game tree complexity to collapse to $I^K$ for P1 when P2 plays pure best responses, and $(I+1)^K$ for P2 in a dual game where P1 plays pure best responses. We then show that exploiting this structure in standard learning modes, i.e., model-free multiagent reinforcement learning and model predictive control, is straightforward, leading to significant improvements in learning accuracy and efficiency from SOTA IIEFG solvers. Our demonstration solves a 22-player football game ($K=10$, $U=\infty$) where the attacking team has to strategically conceal their intention until a critical moment in order to exploit information advantage.

      <title>What Do Agents Think One Another Want? Level-2 Inverse Games for Inferring Agents' Estimates of Others' Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effectively interpreting strategic interactions among multiple agents requires us to infer each agent's objective from limited information. Existing inverse game-theoretic approaches frame this challenge in terms of a "level-1" inference problem, in which we take the perspective of a third-party observer and assume that individual agents share complete knowledge of one another's objectives. However, this assumption breaks down in decentralized, real-world scenarios like urban driving and bargaining, in which agents may act based on conflicting views of one another's objectives. We demonstrate the necessity of inferring agents' different estimates of each other's objectives through empirical examples, and by theoretically characterizing the prediction error of level-1 inference on fictitious gameplay data from linear-quadratic games. To address this fundamental issue, we propose a framework for level-2 inference to address the question: "What does each agent believe about other agents' objectives?" We prove that the level-2 inference problem is non-convex even in benign settings like linear-quadratic games, and we develop an efficient gradient-based approach for identifying local solutions. Experiments on a synthetic urban driving example show that our approach uncovers nuanced misalignments that level-1 methods miss.</description>

      <title>The Price of Uncertainty for Social Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How hard is it to achieve consensus in a social network under uncertainty? In this paper we model this problem as a social graph of agents where each vertex is initially colored red or blue. The goal of the agents is to achieve consensus, which is when the colors of all agents align. Agents attempt to do this locally through steps in which an agent changes their color to the color of the majority of their neighbors. In real life, agents may not know exactly how many of their neighbors are red or blue, which introduces uncertainty into this process. Modeling uncertainty as perturbations of relative magnitude $1+\varepsilon$ to these color neighbor counts, we show that even small values of $\varepsilon$ greatly hinder the ability to achieve consensus in a social network. We prove theoretically tight upper and lower bounds on the price of uncertainty, a metric defined by Balcan et al. to quantify the effect of uncertainty in network games.</description>

      <title>Efficient Kernelized Learning in Polyhedral Games Beyond Full-Information: From Colonel Blotto to Congestion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the problem of efficiently learning coarse correlated equilibria (CCE) in polyhedral games, that is, normal-form games with an exponentially large number of actions per player and an underlying combinatorial structure. Prominent examples of such games are the classical Colonel Blotto and congestion games. To achieve computational efficiency, the learning algorithms must exhibit regret and per-iteration complexity that scale polylogarithmically in the size of the players' action sets. This challenge has recently been addressed in the full-information setting, primarily through the use of kernelization. However, in the case of the realistic, but mathematically challenging, partial-information setting, existing approaches result in suboptimal and impractical runtime complexity to learn CCE. We tackle this limitation by building a framework based on the kernelization paradigm. We apply this framework to prominent examples of polyhedral games -- namely the Colonel Blotto, graphic matroid and network congestion games -- and provide computationally efficient payoff-based learning algorithms, which significantly improve upon prior works in terms of the runtime for learning CCE in these settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.13148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A menu description exposes strategyproofness by presenting a mechanism to player $i$ in two steps. Step (1) uses others' reports to describe $i$'s menu of potential outcomes. Step (2) uses $i$'s report to select $i$'s favorite outcome from her menu. We provide novel menu descriptions of the Deferred Acceptance (DA) and Top Trading Cycles (TTC) matching mechanisms. For TTC, our description additionally yields a proof of the strategyproofness of TTC's traditional description, in a way that we prove is impossible for DA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16942v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a model of third-degree price discrimination where the seller's product valuation is unknown to the market designer, who aims to maximize buyer surplus by revealing buyer valuation information. Our main result shows that the regret is bounded by a $\frac{1}{e}$-fraction of the optimal buyer surplus when the seller has zero valuation for the product. This bound is attained by randomly drawing a seller valuation and applying the segmentation of Bergemann et al. (2015) with respect to the drawn valuation. We show that this bound is tight in the case of binary buyer valuation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19553v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of providing information to agents who queue before a scarce good is distributed at a fixed time. Many information policies reveal "sudden bad news," when agents learn the queue is longer than previously believed. Sudden bad news causes assortative inefficiency by prompting multiple agents to simultaneously join the queue. If the value distribution has an increasing (decreasing) hazard rate, information policies that release sudden bad news increase (decrease) total surplus, relative to releasing no information. If agents incur entry costs and the hazard rate is decreasing, the optimal policy reveals only when the queue is full.</description>
