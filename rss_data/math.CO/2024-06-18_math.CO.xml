      <title>Edge Quasi $\lambda$-distance-balanced Graphs in Metric Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a graph $A$, the measure $|M_g^A(f)|=m_g^A(f)$ for each arbitrary edge $f=gh$ counts the edges in $A$ closer to $g$ than $h$. $A$ is termed an edge quasi-$\lambda$-distance-balanced graph in a metric space (abbreviated as $EQDBG$), where a rational number ($&gt;1$) is assigned to each edge $f=gh$ such that $m_g^A(f)=\lambda^{\pm1}m_h^A(f)$. This paper introduces and discusses these graph concepts, providing essential examples and construction methods. The study examines how every $EQDBG$ is a bipartite graph and calculates the edge-Szeged index for such graphs. Additionally, it explores their properties in Cartesian and lexicographic products. Lastly, the concept is extended to nicely edge distance-balanced and strongly edge distance-balanced graphs revealing significant outcomes.</description>

      <title>Supersaturation of Tree Posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known result of Bukh shows that if $P$ is a tree poset of height $k$, then any subset of the Boolean lattice $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \mathcal{B}_n$ of size at least $(k-1+\varepsilon){n\choose \lceil n/2\rceil}$ contains at least one copy of $P$. This was extended by Boehnlein and Jiang to induced copies. We strengthen both results by showing that for any integer $q\ge k$, any family $\mathcal{F}$ of size at least $(q-1+\varepsilon){n\choose \lceil n/2\rceil}$ contains on the order of as many induced copies of $P$ as is contained in the $q$ middle layers of the Boolean lattice. This answers a conjecture of Gerbner, Nagy, Patk\'os, and Vizer in a strong form for tree posets.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial interpretations of cranks of overpartitions and partitions into distinct odd parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give combinatorial interpretations of two residual cranks of overpartitions defined by Bringmann, Lovejoy and Osburn in 2009 analogous to the crank of partitions given by Andrews and Garvan in 1988. As a consequence, we improve upon their definitions and find the true residual cranks of overpartitions. Furthermore, we investigate the combinatorial interpretation of an $M_2$-crank of partitions without repeated odd parts and explore connections of these statistics with their companion rank counterparts and the tenth order mock theta functions of Ramanujan.</description>

      <title>Threshold numbers of multipartite graphs with small parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jamison and Sprague defined multithreshold graphs as a generalization of the well-studied threshold graphs. A graph $G=(V,E)$ is called a \textit{$k$-threshold graph} with \textit{thresholds} $\theta_1&lt;\theta_2&lt;...&lt;\theta_k$ if we can assign a real number $r(v)$ to each vertex $v\in V$ such that for any two vertices $u,v\in V$, we have $uv\in E$ if and only if $r(u)+r(v)$ is greater than or equal to an odd number of $\theta_1,\theta_2,...,\theta_k$. The smallest integer $k$ such that $G$ is a $k$-threshold graph is called the \textit{threshold number} of $G$. For the complete multipartite graphs and the cluster graphs, Chen and Hao determined the exact threshold numbers of those graphs with each part/cluster not being small; Puleo proved a lower bound on the threshold numbers of $nK_3$; Kittipassorn and Sumalroj further determined the exact threshold numbers of $K_{n\times 3}$, $nK_3$, $K_{n\times 4}$, and $nK_4$. On the basis of Kittipassorn and Sumalroj's results, we determine the exact threshold numbers of $K_{n_1\times 1, n_2\times 2, n_3\times 3}$ and $n_1 K_1\cup n_2 K_2\cup n_3 K_3$, which solve a problem proposed by Sumalroj.</description>

      <title>The connection between the chromatic numbers of a hypergraph and its $1$-intersection graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well known problem from an excellent book of Lov\'asz states that any hypergraph with the property that no pair of hyperedges intersect in exactly one vertex can be properly 2-colored. Motivated by this as well as recent works of Keszegh and of Gy\'arf\'as et al we study the $1$-intersection graph of a hypergraph. The $1$-intersection graph encodes those pairs of hyperedges in a hypergraph that intersect in exactly one vertex. We prove for $k\in\{2,4\}$ that all hypergraphs whose $1$-intersection graph is $k$-partite can be properly $k$-colored.</description>

      <title>Fixed points of non-uniform permutations and representation theory of the symmetric group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use representation theory of the symmetric group S_n to prove Poisson limit theorems for the distribution of fixed points for three types of non-uniform permutations. First, we give results for the commutator of x and g where g and x are uniform in S_n. Second, we give results for the commutator of x and g where g is uniform in S_n and x is fixed. Third, we give results for permutations obtained by multiplying n*log(n)/2 + cn random transpositions, as well as a conjecture related to the more general i-cycle walk. Most of our results are known by other, quite different, methods.</description>

      <title>Projective Rectangles: Harmonic Conjugation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A projective rectangle is like a projective plane that has different lengths in two directions. We develop harmonic conjugation in projective rectangles. We construct projective rectangles in some harmonic matroids (matroids where harmonic conjugation is defined on every collinear point triple), such as Desarguesian projective planes of finite characteristic, by harmonic conjugation from extended lift matroids based on finite fields. Similar results follow for countable fields with characteristic $0$. We also show that projective rectangles are almost harmonic matroids.</description>

      <title>Counting subgraphs in locally dense graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is said to be $p$-locally dense if every induced subgraph of $G$ with linearly many vertices has edge density at least $p$. A famous conjecture of Kohayakawa, Nagle, R\"odl, and Schacht predicts that locally dense graphs have, asymptotically, at least as many copies of any fixed graph $H$ as are found in a random graph of edge density $p$.
  In this paper, we prove several results around the KNRS conjecture. First, we prove that certain natural gluing operations on $H$ preserve this property, thus proving the conjecture for many graphs $H$ for which it was previously unknown. Secondly, we study a stability version of this conjecture, and prove that for many graphs $H$, approximate equality is attained in the KNRS conjecture if and only if the host graph $G$ is quasirandom. Finally, we introduce a weakening of the KNRS conjecture, which requires the host graph to be nearly degree-regular, and prove this conjecture for a larger family of graphs. Our techniques reveal a surprising connection between these questions, semidefinite optimization, and the study of copositive matrices.</description>

      <title>Heritability of K\H{o}nig's Property from finite edge sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hypergraph $H = (V,E)$ is said to have K\H{o}nig's Property if there is a matching $M\subseteq E$ and $S\subseteq V$ such that $|S \cap e| = 1$ for all $e\in M$, and $S$ is a vertex cover of $H$. Aharoni posed the question whether K\H{o}nig's Property is inheritable from finite subsets of $E$. We provide a negative answer and investigate similar questions for weaker properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The natural Hopf algebra $\mathbf{N} \cdot \mathcal{O}$ of an operad $\mathcal{O}$ is a Hopf algebra whose bases are indexed by some words on $\mathcal{O}$. We construct polynomial realizations of $\mathbf{N} \cdot \mathcal{O}$ by using alphabets of noncommutative variables endowed with unary and binary relations. By using particular alphabets, we establish links between $\mathbf{N} \cdot \mathcal{O}$ and some other Hopf algebras including the Hopf algebra of word quasi-symmetric functions of Hivert, the decorated versions of the noncommutative Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of Foissy, the noncommutative Fa\`a di Bruno Hopf algebra and its deformations, the noncommutative multi-symmetric functions Hopf algebras of Novelli and Thibon, and the double tensor Hopf algebra of Ebrahimi-Fard and Patras.</description>

      <title>Modified difference ascent sequences and Fishburn structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ascent sequences and their modified version play a central role in the bijective framework relating several combinatorial structures counted by the Fishburn numbers. Ascent sequences are nonnegative integer sequences defined by imposing a bound on the growth of their entries in terms of the number of ascents contained in the corresponding prefix, while modified ascent sequences are the image of ascent sequences under the so-called hat map. By relaxing the notion of ascent, Dukes and Sagan have recently introduced difference ascent sequences. Here we define modified difference ascent sequences and study their combinatorial properties. Inversion sequences are a superset of the difference ascent sequences and we extend the hat map to this domain. Our extension depends on a parameter which we specialize to obtain a new set of permutations counted by the Fishburn numbers and characterized by a subdiagonality property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study extensions of Steiner triple systems by means of the associated Steiner loops. We recognize that the set of Veblen points of a Steiner triple system corresponds to the center of the Steiner loop. We investigate extensions of Steiner loops, focusing in particular on the case of Schreier extensions, which provide a powerful method for constructing Steiner triple systems containing Veblen points.</description>

      <title>Circuit-partition of infinite matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Komj\'ath, Milner, and Polat investigated when a finitary matroid admits a partition into circuits. They defined the class of ``finite matching extendable'' matroids and showed in their compactness theorem that those matroids always admit such a partition. Their proof is based on Shelah's singular compactness technique and a careful analysis of certain $\triangle$-systems.
  We provide a short, simple proof of their theorem. Then we show that a finitary binary oriented matroid can be partitioned into directed circuits if and only if, in every cocircuit, the cardinality of the negative and positive edges are the same. This generalizes a former conjecture of Thomassen, settled affirmatively by the second author, about partitioning the edges of an infinite directed graph into directed cycles. As side results, a Laviolette theorem for finitary matroids and a Farkas lemma for finitary binary oriented matroids are proven. An example is given to show that, in contrast to finite oriented matroids, `binary' cannot be omitted in the latter result.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weak-cop number of a graph, introduced by Lee et al (2023), is a quasi-isometry invariant of graphs and hence of finitely generated groups. While for any $m\in\mathbb{Z}_+\cup\infty$ there exists graphs with weak-cop number $m$, it is an open question whether there exists finitely generated groups whose weak-cop number is different than $1$ and $\infty$. We prove that wreath products of nontrivial groups by infinite groups, as well as Thompson's group $F$, have infinite weak-cop number. The argument for Thompson's group relies on the representation of its elements by Belk and Brown Forest diagrams.</description>

Abstract: We describe algebraically, diagrammatically and in terms of weight vectors, the restriction of tensor powers of the standard representation of quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ to a coideal subalgebra. We realise the category as module category over the monoidal category of type $\pm1$ representations in terms of string diagrams and via generators and relations. The idempotents projecting onto the quantized eigenspaces are described as type $B/D$ analogues of Jones--Wenzl projectors. As an application we introduce and give recursive formulas for analogues of $\Theta$-networks.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Bugs: The Limits of Symmetry Metrics to Detect Partisan Gerrymandering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide both a theoretical and empirical analysis of the Mean-Median Difference (MM) and Partisan Bias (PB), which are both symmetry metrics intended to detect gerrymandering. We consider vote-share, seat-share pairs $(V, S)$ for which one can construct election data having vote share $V$ and seat share $S$, and turnout is equal in each district. We calculate the range of values that MM and PB can achieve on that constructed election data. In the process, we find the range of vote-share, seat share pairs $(V, S)$ for which there is constructed election data with vote share $V$, seat share $S$, and $MM=0$, and see that the corresponding range for PB is the same set of $(V,S)$ pairs. We show how the set of such $(V,S)$ pairs allowing for $MM=0$ (and $PB=0$) changes when turnout in each district is allowed to be different.
  Although the set of $(V,S)$ pairs for which there is election data with $MM=0$ is the same as the set of $(V,S)$ pairs for which there is election data with $PB=0$, the range of possible values for MM and PB on a fixed $(V, S)$ is different. Additionally, for a fixed constructed election outcome, the values of the Mean-Median Difference and Partisan Bias can theoretically be as large as 0.5. We show empirically that these two metric values can differ by as much as 0.33 in US congressional map data. We use both neutral ensemble analysis and the short-burst method to show that neither the Mean-Median Difference nor the Partisan Bias can reliably detect when a districting map has an extreme number of districts won by a particular party. Finally, we give additional empirical and logical arguments in an attempt to explain why other metrics are better at detecting when a districting map has an extreme number of districts won by a particular party.</description>

      <title>Improving Behrend's construction: Sets without arithmetic progressions in integers and over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove new lower bounds on the maximum size of subsets $A\subseteq \{1,\dots,N\}$ or $A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_p^n$ not containing three-term arithmetic progressions. In the setting of $\{1,\dots,N\}$, this is the first improvement upon a classical construction of Behrend from 1946 beyond lower-order factors (in particular, it is the first quasipolynomial improvement). In the setting of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ for a fixed prime $p$ and large $n$, we prove a lower bound of $(cp)^n$ for some absolute constant $c&gt;1/2$ (for $c = 1/2$, such a bound can be obtained via classical constructions from the 1940s, but improving upon this has been a well-known open problem).</description>

      <title>Congruences for sums of MacMahon's $q$-Catalan polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One variant of the $q$-Catalan polynomials is defined in terms of Gaussian polynomials by $\mathcal{C}_k(q)=\genfrac{[}{]}{0pt}{}{2k}{k}_q-q\genfrac{[}{]}{0pt}{}{2k}{k+1}_q$. Liu studied congruences of the form $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} q^k\mathcal{C}_k$ modulo the cyclotomic polynomial $\Phi_n(q)^2$, provided that $n\equiv\pm 1\pmod3$. Apparently the case $n\equiv 0\pmod3$ has been missing from the literature. It is our primary purpose to fill this gap by the current work. In addition, we discuss certain fascinating link to Dirichlet character sum identities.</description>

      <title>On perfect symmetric rank-metric codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{Sym}_q(m)$ be the space of symmetric matrices in $\mathbb{F}_q^{m\times m}$. A subspace of $\mathrm{Sym}_q(m)$ equipped with the rank distance is called a symmetric rank-metric code. In this paper we study the covering properties of symmetric rank-metric codes. First we characterize symmetric rank-metric codes which are perfect, i.e. that satisfy the equality in the sphere-packing like bound. We show that, despite the rank-metric case, there are non trivial perfect codes. Also, we characterize families of codes which are quasi-perfect.</description>

      <title>Expanders and growth of normal subsets in finite simple groups of Lie type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that some classical results on expander graphs imply growth results on normal subsets in finite simple groups. As one application, it is shown that given a nontrivial normal subset $ A $ of a finite simple group $ G $ of Lie type of bounded rank, we either have $ G \setminus \{ 1 \} \subseteq A^2 $ or $ |A^2| \geq |A|^{1+\epsilon} $, for $ \epsilon &gt; 0 $. This improves a result of Gill, Pyber, Short and Szab\'o, and partially resolves a question of Pyber from the Kourovka notebook. We also propose a variant of Gowers' trick for two subsets, and give applications to products of large subsets in groups of Lie type, improving some results of Larsen, Shalev and Tiep.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Shortest Path Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An st-shortest path, or st-path for short, in a graph G is a shortest (induced) path from s to t in G. Two st-paths are said to be adjacent if they differ on exactly one vertex. A reconfiguration sequence between two st-paths P and Q is a sequence of adjacent st-paths starting from P and ending at Q. Deciding whether there exists a reconfiguration sequence between two given $st$-paths is known to be PSPACE-complete, even on restricted classes of graphs such as graphs of bounded bandwidth (hence pathwidth). On the positive side, and rather surprisingly, the problem is polynomial-time solvable on planar graphs. In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of the Shortest Path Reconfiguration (SPR) problem. We show that SPR is W[1]-hard parameterized by k + \ell, even when restricted to graphs of bounded (constant) degeneracy; here k denotes the number of edges on an st-path, and \ell denotes the length of a reconfiguration sequence from P to Q. We complement our hardness result by establishing the fixed-parameter tractability of SPR parameterized by \ell and restricted to nowhere-dense classes of graphs. Additionally, we establish fixed-parameter tractability of SPR when parameterized by the treedepth, by the cluster-deletion number, or by the modular-width of the input graph.</description>

      <title>A linear algorithm for radio $k$-coloring of powers of paths having small diameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.07424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radio $k$-chromatic number $rc_k(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum integer $\lambda$ such that there exists a function $\phi: V(G) \to \{0,1,\cdots, \lambda\}$ satisfying $|\phi(u)-\phi(v)| \geq k+1 - d(u,v)$, where $d(u,v)$ denotes the distance between $u$ and $v$. A considerable amount of attention has been given to find the exact values or providing polynomial time algorithms to determine $rc_k(G)$ for several basic graph families such as paths, cycles, trees, and powers of paths, usually for some specific values of $k$.
  In this article, we find the exact values of $rc_k(G)$ where $G$ is a power of a path with diameter strictly less than $k$. Our proof readily provides a linear time algorithm for assigning a radio $k$-coloring of $G$. Furthermore, our proof technique is a potential tool for solving the same problem for other classes of graphs having ``small'' diameters.</description>

      <title>On quasi-polynomials counting planar tight maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.14796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tight map is a map with some of its vertices marked, such that every vertex of degree $1$ is marked. We give an explicit formula for the number $N_{0,n}(d_1,\ldots,d_n)$ of planar tight maps with $n$ labeled faces of prescribed degrees $d_1,\ldots,d_n$, where a marked vertex is seen as a face of degree $0$. It is a quasi-polynomial in $(d_1,\ldots,d_n)$, as shown previously by Norbury. Our derivation is bijective and based on the slice decomposition of planar maps. In the non-bipartite case, we also rely on enumeration results for two-type forests. We discuss the connection with the enumeration of non necessarily tight maps. In particular, we provide a generalization of Tutte's classical slicings formula to all non-bipartite maps.</description>

      <title>Distribution of similar configurations in subsets of $\mathbb{F}_q^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11579v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field of order $q$ and $E$ be a set in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$. The distance set of $E$ is defined by $\Delta(E):=\{\lVert x-y \rVert :x,y\in E\}$, where $\lVert \alpha \rVert=\alpha_1^2+\dots+\alpha_d^2$. Iosevich, Koh and Parshall (2018) proved that if $d\geq 2$ is even and $|E|\geq 9q^{d/2}$, then $$\mathbb{F}_q= \frac{\Delta(E)}{\Delta(E)}=\left\{\frac{a}{b}: a\in \Delta(E),\ b\in \Delta(E)\setminus\{0\} \right\}.$$ In other words, for each $r\in \mathbb{F}_q^*$ there exist $(x,y)\in E^2$ and $(x',y')\in E^2$ such that $\lVert x-y\rVert\neq0$ and $\lVert x'-y' \rVert=r\lVert x-y\rVert$.
  Geometrically, this means that if the size of $E$ is large, then for any given $r \in \mathbb{F}_q^*$ we can find a pair of edges in the complete graph $K_{|E|}$ with vertex set $E$ such that one of them is dilated by $r\in \mathbb{F}_q^*$ with respect to the other. A natural question arises whether it is possible to generalize this result to arbitrary subgraphs of $K_{|E|}$ with vertex set $E$ and this is the goal of this paper.
  In this paper, we solve this problem for $k$-paths $(k\geq 2)$, simplexes and 4-cycles. We are using a mix of tools from different areas such as enumerative combinatorics, group actions and Tur\'an type theorems.</description>

Abstract: Daisies are a special type of hypergraphs introduced by Bollob\'{a}s, Leader and Malvenuto. An $r$-daisy determined by a pair of disjoint sets $K$ and $M$ is the $(r+|K|)$-uniform hypergraph $\{K\cup P:\: P\in M^{(r)}\}$. In [Combin. Probab. Comput. 20, no. 5, 743-747, 2011] the authors studied Tur\'{a}n type density problems for daisies. This paper deals with Ramsey numbers of Daisies, which are natural generalizations of classical Ramsey numbers. We discuss upper and lower bounds for the Ramsey number of $r$-daisies and also for special cases where the size of the kernel is bounded.</description>

Abstract: A $(k+r)$-uniform hypergraph $H$ on $(k+m)$ vertices is an $(r,m,k)$-daisy if there exists a partition of the vertices $V(H)=K\cup M$ with $|K|=k$, $|M|=m$ such that the set of edges of $H$ is all the $(k+r)$-tuples $K\cup P$, where $P$ is an $r$-tuple of $M$. Complementing results in ["On the Ramsey number of daisies I"], we obtain an $(r-2)$-iterated exponential lower bound to the Ramsey number of an $(r,m,k)$-daisy for $2$-colors. This matches the order of magnitude of the best lower bounds for the Ramsey number of a complete $r$-graph.</description>

      <title>A New Construction of the Vietoris-Rips Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new, inductive construction of the Vietoris-Rips complex, in which we take advantage of a small amount of unexploited combinatorial structure in the $k$-skeleton of the complex in order to avoid unnecessary comparisons when identifying its $(k+1)$-simplices. In doing so, we achieve a significant reduction in the number of comparisons required to construct the Vietoris-Rips compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, which is seen here by examining the computational complexity of the critical step in the algorithms. In experiments comparing a C/C++ implementation of our algorithm to the GUDHI v3.9.0 software package, this results in an observed $5$-$10$-fold improvement in speed of on sufficiently sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs with the best advantages as the graphs become sparser, as well as for higher dimensional Vietoris-Rips complexes. We further clarify that the algorithm described in Boissonnat and Maria (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-33090-2_63) for the construction of the Vietoris-Rips complex is exactly the Incremental Algorithm from Zomorodian (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cag.2010.03.007), albeit with the additional requirement that the result be stored in a tree structure, and we explain how these techniques are different from the algorithm presented here.</description>

Abstract: Webs give a diagrammatic calculus for spaces of tensor invariants. We introduce hourglass plabic graphs as a new avatar of webs, and use these to give the first rotation-invariant $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_4)$-web basis, a long-sought object. The characterization of our basis webs relies on the combinatorics of these new plabic graphs and associated configurations of a symmetrized six-vertex model. We give growth rules, based on a novel crystal-theoretic technique, for generating our basis webs from tableaux and we use skein relations to give an algorithm for expressing arbitrary webs in the basis. We also discuss how previously known rotation-invariant web bases can be unified in our framework of hourglass plabic graphs.</description>

      <title>Promotion permutations for tableaux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our companion paper, we develop a new $SL_4$-web basis. Basis elements are given by certain planar graphs and are constructed so that important algebraic operations can be performed diagrammatically. A guiding principle behind our construction is that the long cycle $(12\ldots n) \in \mathfrak{S}_n$ should act by rotation of webs. Moreover, the bijection between webs and tableaux should intertwine rotation with the promotion action on tableaux.
  In this paper, we develop necessary notions of promotion permutations and promotion matrices, which are new even for standard tableaux. To support inductive arguments in the companion paper, we must however work in the more general setting of fluctuating tableaux, which we introduce and which subsumes many classes of tableaux that have been previously studied, including (generalized) oscillating, vacillating, rational, alternating, and (semi)standard tableaux. Therefore, we also give here a full development of the basic combinatorics and representation theory of fluctuating tableaux.</description>

Abstract: An edge $e$ of a matching covered graph $G$ is removable if $G-e$ is also matching covered. Carvalho, Lucchesi, and Murty showed that every brick $G$ different from $K_4$ and $\overline{C_6}$ has at least $\Delta-2$ removable edges, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of $G$. In this paper, we generalize the result to irreducible near-bricks, where a graph is irreducible if it contains no single ear of length three or more.</description>

      <title>Graphs that admit a Hamilton path are cup-stackable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fay, Hurlbert and Tennant recently introduced a one-player game on a finite connected graph $G$, which they called cup stacking. Stacks of cups are placed at the vertices of $G$, and are transferred between vertices via stacking moves, subject to certain constraints, with the goal of stacking all cups at a single target vertex. If this is possible for every target vertex of $G$, then $G$ is called stackable. In this paper, we prove that if $G$ admits a Hamilton path, then $G$ is stackable, which confirms several of the conjectures raised by Fay, Hurlbert and Tennant. Furthermore, we prove stackability for certain powers of bipartite graphs, and we construct graphs of arbitrarily large minimum degree and connectivity that do not allow stacking onto any of their vertices.</description>

      <title>Stability theorems for multiplicities in graded $S_n$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.00036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove several stability theorems for multiplicities of naturally defined representations of symmetric groups. The first such theorem states that if we consider the diagonal action of the symmetric group $S_{m+r}$ on $k$ sets of $m+r$ variables, then the dimension of the invariants of degree $m$ is the same as the dimension of the invariants of degree $m$ for $S_{m}$ acting on $k$ sets of $m$ variables. Building on this stability, the last section looks at the Hilbert series of coinvariants of the polynomial ring in $k$ sets of $m$ variables. We address a conjecture that the Hilbert series, in degrees no more than $m$, can be computed by a truncated power series expression. Using some auxiliary results and manipulations of power series, we show that if this holds for $k$ and $m$, then the truncation gives the correct Hilbert series up to degree $m$ for $k$ sets of $n \geq m$ variables. This shows the validity of the conjecture up to certain degrees. We also provide a new equivalent conjecture regarding Gr\"{o}bner bases.
  The second type of stability result is for Weyl modules. We prove that the dimension of the $S_{m+r}$ invariants for a Weyl module ${}_{m+r}F^{\lambda}$ (the Schur-Weyl dual of the $S_{|\lambda|}$ module $V^{\lambda}$) with $\left\vert \lambda \right\vert \leq m$ is of the same dimension as the space of $S_{m}$ invariants for ${}_{m}F^{\lambda}$. Multigraded versions of the first type of result are given, as are multigraded generalizations to non-trivial modules of symmetric groups.</description>

Abstract: In 2012 Raghavan, Samuel, and Subrahmanyam showed that the Kazhdan--Lusztig basis for the Iwahori--Hecke algebra in type A provides a ``canonical'' basis for the centraliser algebra of the Schur algebra acting on tensor space. In 2022 the second author found a similar result for the centraliser of the partition algebra acting on the same tensor space. Each basis is indexed by permutations. We exploit these bases to show that the linear decomposition of an arbitrary invariant (in either centraliser algebra) depends integrally on its entries, and describe combinatorial rules that pick out minimal sets of such entries.</description>

      <title>On the relation between quantum walks and absolute zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum walk is a quantum counterpart of the classical random walk. On the other hand, the absolute zeta function can be considered as a zeta function over F_1. This paper presents a connection between the quantum walk and the absolute zeta function. First we deal with a zeta function determined by a time evolution matrix of the Grover walk on a graph. The Grover walk is a typical model of the quantum walk. Then we prove that the zeta function given by the quantum walk is an absolute automorphic form of weight depending on the number of edges of the graph. Furthermore we consider an absolute zeta function for the zeta function based on a quantum walk. As an example, we compute an absolute zeta function for the cycle graph and show that it is expressed as the multiple gamma function of order 2.</description>

      <title>On the resolution of kinks of curves on punctured surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(\Sigma,\mathbb{M},\mathbb{P})$ be a surface with marked points $\mathbb{M}\subseteq \partial\Sigma\neq\varnothing$ and punctures $\mathbb{P}\subseteq\Sigma\setminus\partial\Sigma$. In this paper we show that for every curve $\gamma$ on $\Sigma\setminus\mathbb{P}$, the curve obtained by resolving the kinks of $\gamma$ in any order is uniquely determined, up to homotopy in $\Sigma\setminus\mathbb{P}$, by the $2$-orbifold homotopy class of $\gamma$, in which the punctures are interpreted to be orbifold points of order $2$. Our proof resorts to an application of the Diamond Lemma.</description>

      <title>The distribution on permutations induced by a random parking function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11529v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A parking function on $[n]$ creates a permutation in $S_n$ via the order in which the $n$ cars appear in the $n$ parking spaces. Placing the uniform probability measure on the set of parking functions on $[n]$ induces a probability measure on $S_n$. We initiate a study of some properties of this distribution. Let $P_n^{\text{park}}$ denote this distribution on $S_n$ and let $P_n$ denote the uniform distribution on $S_n$. In particular, we obtain an explicit formula for $P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma)$ for all $\sigma\in S_n$. Then we show that for all but an asymptotically $P_n$-negligible set of permutations, one has $P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma)\in\left(\frac{(2-\epsilon)^n}{(n+1)^{n-1}},\frac{(2+\epsilon)^n}{(n+1)^{n-1}}\right)$. However, this accounts for only an exponentially small part of the $P_n^{\text{park}}$-probability. We also obtain an explicit formula for $P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+1}=i_1,\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+2}=i_2,\cdots, \sigma^{-1}_n=i_j)$, the probability that the last $j$ cars park in positions $i_1,\cdots, i_j$ respectively, and show that the $j$-dimensional random vector $(n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+l}, n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+2},\cdots, n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n})$ under $P_n^{\text{park}}$ converges in distribution to a random vector $(\sum_{r=1}^jX_r,\sum_{r=2}^j X_r,\cdots, X_{j-1}+X_j,X_j)$, where $\{X_r\}_{r=1}^j$ are IID with the Borel distribution. We then show that in fact for $j_n=o(n^\frac16)$, the final $j_n$ cars will park in increasing order with probability approaching 1 as $n\to\infty$. We also obtain an explicit formula for the expected value of the left-to-right maximum statistic $X_n^{\text{LR-max}}$, which counts the total number of left-to-right maxima in a permutation, and show that $E_n^{\text{park}}X_n^{\text{LR-max}}$ grows approximately on the order $n^\frac12$.</description>

      <title>Growth in products of matrices: fastest, average, and generic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00610v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let A and B be 2x2 matrices (over reals). Let w(A, B) be a word of length n. After evaluating w(A, B) as a product of matrices, we get a 2x2 matrix, call it W. What is the largest (by the absolute value) possible entry of W, over all w(A, B) of length n, as a function of n? What is the expected absolute value of the largest (by the absolute value) entry in a random product of n matrices, where each matrix is A or B with probability 0.5? What is the Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give partial answer to the first of these questions and an essentially complete answer to the second question. For the third question (the most difficult of the three), we offer a very simple method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent in the case where all entries of the matrices A and B are nonnegative.</description>

      <title>Computing Non-Repetitive Sequences with a Computable Lefthanded Local Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lefthanded Lov\'asz local lemma (LLLL) is a generalization of the Lov\'asz local lemma (LLL), a powerful technique from the probabilistic method. We prove a computable version of the LLLL and use it to effectivize a collection of results on the existence of certain types of non-repetitive sequences via the LLL and LLLL. This represents the first constructive proof of these results.</description>
