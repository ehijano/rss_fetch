      <title>Tensor Polarizability of the Nucleus and Angular Mixing in Muonic Deuterium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of the tensor polarizability of a nucleus on thebound-state energy levels, and obtain a general formula for the contribution of the tensor polarizability to the energy levels in two-body bound systems. In particular, it is demonstrated that the tensor polarizability leads to mixing between states with different orbital angular momenta. The effect of tensor polarizability is evaluated for the hyperfine-structure components of P states and for the mixing of S and D states in muonic deuterium.</description>

      <title>Ultracold atoms in a dipole trap in microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most cold atoms experiments in microgravity platforms or in Space are achieved using atom chips, leading to limitations in terms of optical access and inhomogeneous magnetic fields. Optical dipole traps do not have these drawbacks but have difficulties producing atomic samples with a large number of atoms at ultra low temperature in the absence of gravity. Here, we report on an efficient evaporative cooling in two-crossed laser beams during parabolic flights. Time-averaged potentials combine the advantages of large capture volume and trap compression, increasing the initial phase space density and collision rate to favor the evaporative process. With this technique we demonstrate the production of an ultra cold gas of $2.5\times 10^4$ rubidium atoms at a temperature below 100 nK in less than 4 seconds. Our experiment paves the way for the development of quantum sensors applied to fundamental physics and geodesy as well as the study of ultracold atomic physics in Space.</description>

      <title>KPZ-like transport in long-range interacting spin chains proximate to integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isotropic integrable spin chains such as the Heisenberg model feature superdiffusive spin transport belonging to an as-yet-unidentified dynamical universality class closely related to that of Kardar, Parisi, and Zhang (KPZ). To determine whether these results extend to more generic one-dimensional models, particularly those realizable in quantum simulators, we investigate spin and energy transport in non-integrable, long-range Heisenberg models using state-of-the-art tensor network methods. Despite the lack of integrability and the asymptotic expectation of diffusion, for power-law models (with exponent $2 &lt; \alpha &lt; \infty$) we observe long-lived $z=3/2$ superdiffusive spin transport and two-point correlators consistent with KPZ scaling functions, up to times $t \sim 10^3/J$. We conjecture that this KPZ-like transport is due to the proximity of such power-law-interacting models to the integrable family of Inozemtsev models, which we show to also exhibit KPZ-like spin transport across all interaction ranges. Finally, we consider anisotropic spin models naturally realized in Rydberg atom arrays and ultracold polar molecules, demonstrating that a wide range of long-lived, non-diffusive transport can be observed in experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Modelling and Analysis of Mechanical and Thermal Response of an Ultrastable, Dual-Axis, Cubic Cavity for Terrestrial and Space Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transportable all-optical atomic clocks represent the next-generation devices for precision time keeping, ushering a new era in encompassing a wide range of PNT (Positioning, Navigation and Timing) applications in the civil and strategic sectors. Their performance relies on ultra-stable, narrow-linewidth lasers, frequency stabilized to a compact portable optical cavity. Among various designs, the cubic spacer-based ultra-stable cavity is particularly well-suited for transportable applications due to its low sensitivity to vibrations, owing to its symmetric geometry and robust mounting structure. While longer cavities offer a lower fundamental thermal noise floor, one needs to strike a balance between transportability and size. In this aspect, the 7.5 cm dual-axis cubic cavity offers a lower fundamental thermal noise floor in comparison to smaller counterparts, while still retaining a reasonable SWaP (Size, Weight and Power) for terrestrial and aerial PNT applications. Its dual-axis design also enables multi-wavelength laser stabilization, making it a promising candidate for future transportable clock applications. This work presents a detailed study of the 7.5 cm dual-axis cubic cavity using FEM (Finite Element Method) to evaluate its mechanical and thermal stability. We analyze the impact of various geometric factors, mounting forces, and machining imperfections, while also modelling thermal effects such as conduction, radiation, and mirror heating within a vacuum chamber and thermally shielded environment. Our findings provide design insights for developing robust dual-axis optical reference cavities, advancing the deployment of portable atomic clocks for next-generation applications in PNT, geodesy, VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) and deep space missions.</description>

      <title>Scattering and sputtering on the lunar surface; Insights from negative ions observed at the surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Airless planetary bodies are directly exposed to solar wind ions, which can scatter or become implanted upon impact with the regolith-covered surface, while also sputtering surface atoms.
  Aims. We construct a semi-analytical model for the scattering of ions of hundreds of eV and the sputtering of surface atoms, both resulting in the emission of negative ions from the lunar surface. Our model contains a novel description of the scattering process that is physics-based and constrained by observations.
  Methods. We use data from the Negative Ions at the Lunar Surface (NILS) instrument on the Chang'e-6 lander to update prior knowledge of ion scattering and sputtering from lunar regolith through Bayesian inference.
  Results. Our model shows good agreement with the NILS data. A precipitating solar wind proton has roughly a 22% chance of scattering from the lunar surface in any charge state, and about an 8% chance of sputtering a surface hydrogen atom. The resulting ratio of scattered to sputtered hydrogen flux is eta_sc / eta_sp = 1.5 for a proton speed of 300 km/s. We find a high probability (7-20%) that a hydrogen atom leaves the surface negatively charged. The angular emission distributions at near-grazing angles for both scattered and sputtered fluxes are controlled by surface roughness. Our model also indicates significant inelastic energy losses for hydrogen interacting with the regolith, suggesting a longer effective path length than previously assumed. Finally, we estimate a surface binding energy of 5.5 eV, consistent with the observations.
  Conclusions. Our model describes the scattering and sputtering of particles of any charge state from any homogeneous, multi-species surface. Using NILS data, we successfully applied the model to update our understanding of solar wind interacting with lunar regolith, and the emission of negative hydrogen ions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytical calculation of the complete $\alpha^6$ correction to energies of $nP$-levels of two-body systems consisting of the spin-$0$ or $1/2$ extended-size particles with arbitrary masses and magnetic moments. The obtained results apply to a wide class of two-body systems such as hydrogen, positronium, muonium, and pionic or aniprotonic helium ion. We found an additional $\alpha^6$ correction for $nP$-levels of positronium, which was previously overlooked. Our results are also relevant for light muonic atoms, whose accurate theoretical predictions are required for extracting the nuclear charge radii.</description>

      <title>Direct loading of a Sr magneto-optical trap from a thermal atomic beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate direct loading of a strontium (Sr) magneto-optical trap (MOT) from a thermal atomic beam in a single-chamber vacuum system. The MOT operates without a Zeeman slower, a slowing laser, a two-dimensional MOT, or differential pumping, while the entire system is maintained in the ultra-high-vacuum regime by a single ion pump. At an oven temperature of $395\,\mathrm{{}^\circ C}$, the MOT captures up to $10^{7}$ ${}^{88}\mathrm{Sr}$ atoms with a loading rate of $10^{7}\,\mathrm{atoms\,s^{-1}}$, while sustaining a background gas pressure of $1 \times 10^{-9} \,\mathrm{Torr}$. At this oven temperature, the MOT lifetime limited by collisions with background gas is $\sim 5 \,\mathrm{s}$, with the atom number primarily constrained by light-assisted two-body collisions. Eliminating differential pumping and precooling stages significantly reduces the system's size, weight, and power requirements, providing a robust and practical platform for field-deployable and spaceborne optical lattice clocks, as well as a variety of other applications requiring compact ultracold atom sources.</description>

      <title>Rotational Splittings in Diatomic Molecules of Interest to Searches for New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diatomic molecules with an energetically low-lying $^3 \Delta_1$ state are attractive platforms to detect new physics beyond the Standard Model, such as parity- and time-reversal violating phenomena. One of the advantages of using a $^3 \Delta_1$ state is its tiny $\Lambda$-splitting due to the coupling between the electronic and rotational angular momenta, which facilitates polarizing the molecules in small external electric fields. Theoretical estimation of the magnitude of the $\Lambda$-splitting is helpful for planning new experiments. In this study, we present a theoretical model to calculate the $\Lambda$-splitting. Our model integrates the relativistic four-component wavefunction and the traditional rotational Hamiltonian based on Hund's case (a). The multireference character of the wavefunction is taken into account. Our calculations for PtH and ThF$^+$ molecules qualitatively agree with experiment. The $\Lambda$-splitting of TaO$^+$ for the rotational ground state is predicted to be around 9 kHz. This tiny splitting can reduce the systematic uncertainty, but in a practical experiment, it may cause depolarization during rotation ramp-up.</description>

The package features a modular design that enables users to easily construct experimental setups, including magnetic fields, laser beams and other environment components, and to perform a range of simulations within these configurations.

      <title>Magnetic resonance in quantum computing and in accurate measurements of the nuclear moments of atoms and molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern experimental techniques can generate magnetic fields of the form H(t) = H0 z-hat + H1 [x-hat cos({\omega}t) + y-hat sin({\omega}t)], at frequencies within an order of magnitude of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) frequencies, {\omega}n0 and {\omega}e0, respectively, when acting on atoms or molecules. We derive simple closed-form expressions for the exact nuclear- and electronic-spin wave functions that enable controlled transitions between entangled states, allowing an atom or molecule to function as a quantum computer. These solutions also enable precise NMR or EPR measurements of nuclear moments in atoms and molecules. We present examples relevant to measurements of the nuclear moments of 14N, 7Li, and 133Cs. Because existing hyperfine measurements of the lowest three nuclear moments of 133Cs are mutually inconsistent, the proposed NMR/EPR experiments provide a route to measuring all seven of its nuclear moments with high precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18651v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coherence of light from independent ensembles of elementary atomic emitters plays a paramount role in diverse areas of modern optics. We demonstrate the interference of photons scattered from independent ensembles of warm atoms in atomic vapor. It relies on the feasibility of the preservation of coherence of light scattered elastically in the forward and backward directions from Doppler-broadened atomic ensembles, such that photons with chaotic photon statistics from two opposite atomic velocity groups contribute to the same detection mode. While the random phase fluctuations of the scattered light caused by a large thermal motion prevent direct observability of the interference in the detected photon rate, the stable frequency difference between photons collected from scattering off counter-propagating laser beams provides strong periodic modulation of the photon coincidence rate with the period given by the detuning of the excitation laser from the atomic resonance. The presented interferometry represents a sensitive and robust methodology for Doppler-free optical atomic and molecular spectroscopy based on photon correlation measurements on scattered light.</description>

      <title>Effects of intertube dipole-dipole interactions in nearly integrable one-dimensional $^{162}$Dy gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of the intertube dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) in recent experiments with arrays of nearly integrable one-dimensional (1D) dipolar Bose gases of $^{162}$Dy atoms. An earlier theoretical modeling ignored those interactions, which we include here via a modification of the 1D confining potentials. We investigate the effects of the intertube DDI both during the state preparation and during the measurements of the rapidity distributions. We explore how the strength of the contact interactions and the magnetic field angles modify the intertube DDI corrections. We find that those corrections slightly change both the properties of the equilibrium state and the rapidity measurements. Remarkably, however, the changes nearly cancel each other, resulting in measured rapidity distributions that are very close to those predicted in the absence of the intertube DDI.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Dicke model in a two-dimensional ion crystal: chaos, quantum thermalization, and revivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems driven far from equilibrium can exhibit chaos, entanglement, and non-classical correlations, yet directly observing these phenomena in large, closed quantum systems remains challenging. Here we realize the Dicke model -- a fundamental description of light-matter interactions -- in a two-dimensional crystal of approximately 100 trapped ions. The ions' internal state is optically coupled to the center of mass vibrational mode via an optical spin-dependent force, enabling unitary many-body dynamics beyond the mean-field and few-body limits. In the integrable regime, where the phonons can be adiabatically eliminated, we observe a dynamical phase transition between ferromagnetic to paramagnetic spin phases. In contrast, when the spins and phonons are strongly coupled, we observe clear signatures of non-integrable chaotic dynamics, including erratic phase-space trajectories and the exponential growth of excitations and entanglement quantified by the one-body R\'enyi entropy. By quenching from an unstable fixed point in the near-integrable regime, quantum noise can generate correlated spin-phonon excitations. Our numerical calculations, in clear agreement with experiment, reveal the generation of two-mode spin-phonon squeezing, 2.6 dB below the standard quantum limit (4.6 dB relative to the initial thermal state), followed by generalized vacuum Rabi collapses and revivals. Our results establish large ion crystals as scalable analog quantum simulators of non-equilibrium light-matter dynamics and provide a controlled platform for experimental studies of information scrambling and entanglement in closed many-body systems.</description>
