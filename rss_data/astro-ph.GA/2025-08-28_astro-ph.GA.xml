      <title>The Binding Energies of Atoms on Amorphous Silicate Dust: A Computational Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. We investigate the binding energies of atoms to interstellar dust particles, which play a key role in their growth and evolution, as well as for the chemical reactions on their surfaces. Aims. We aim to compute the binding energies of abundant atoms in the interstellar medium (C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Fe, and Ni) to silicate dust. Methods. We used the Geometries, Frequencies, and Non-covalent Interactions Tight Binding (GFN1-xTB) method to compute the binding energies. An FeMgSiO$_4$ periodic surface model, containing 81 local minima on the surface, was used. Results. A range of binding energies was found for each element. The median of the binding energies follows the order Si (14.8 eV) &gt; Al (12.8 eV) &gt; Ca (12.7 eV) &gt; C (9.5 eV) &gt; O (8.1 eV) &gt; N (6.2 eV) &gt; Fe (6.0 eV) &gt; S (5.2 eV) &gt; Mg (2.4 eV). The probability distribution of binding energies for each element except Ca is statistically consistent with a log-normal distribution. Conclusions. In general, Si, Ca, and Al atoms have large binding energies. Thus, these atoms can stay on the silicate dust particles at high temperatures. The binding energies of the other atoms, C, N, O, Mg, S, Fe and Ni, are relatively weak. However, the computed binding energies for these elements are still far stronger than the energies associated with dust temperatures typical of the ambient interstellar medium (ISM), suggesting that silicate grains are generally stable against sublimation. We estimate sublimation temperatures for silicate grains to range from 1600 K to 3000K depending on assumed grain size and lifetime. These binding energies on silicate dust grains, estimated from first principles for the first time, provide invaluable input to models of dust evolution and dust-catalyzed chemical reactions in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Radial Migration on Disk Galaxy SFHs: II. The Role of bar strength, disk thickness, and merger history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing the star formation history (SFH) of disk galaxies is central to understanding their growth and evolution, yet such estimates can be strongly biased by stellar radial migration - the redistribution of angular momenta over cosmic time. Using 186 Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) analogues from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, we compare star formation rates (SFRs) inferred from present-day stellar positions with those based on stellar birth radii to quantify the magnitude, spatial structure, and temporal evolution of migration-induced biases. We find that radial migration systematically produces artificial star formation in regions that had not yet formed stars. Notably, about 80% of galaxies exhibit outer-disk stars older than 10 Gyr, implying that these populations must have migrated from the inner disk. Similar effects appear in about 45% of galaxies at intermediate radii during early epochs, and in 30% of quenched inner disks within the past 4 Gyr. Migration also smooths SFHs, washing out localized bursts and periods of suppressed star formation by dispersing stars across neighboring radii. The strength and imprint of these distortions depend sensitively on galactic structure and evolutionary history: strong bars drive mean SFR overestimates of up to 75% in the inner disk and 150% in the outskirts; thinner, dynamically cold disks suffer average outer-disk biases up to 160%; while thick disks exhibit typical inner-disk biases up to 125%. Merger timing further modulates these patterns. Our results demonstrate that failing to account for stellar migration can lead to severe misinterpretations of when and where stars formed, with direct implications for the chemical and evolutionary histories of the MW and external galaxies.</description>

      <title>The mass of the Milky Way from outer halo stars measured by DESI DR1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a benchmark for galaxy evolution and dark matter studies, the total mass of the Milky Way is a parameter of cosmological significance, and its value at large radii from the Galactic center remains highly uncertain. Following a hierarchical Bayesian inference approach, we measure the cumulative mass of the Milky Way using full 6D phase-space information of stars from the first data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We employ 330 blue horizontal-branch stars (BHBs) and 110 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) in DESI covering Galactocentric distances in the range $\sim$50--100 kpc. Within 100 kpc from the Galactic center, we report an enclosed mass of $M(&lt;100\ {\rm kpc}) = 0.57^{+0.08}_{-0.07}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ and $M(&lt;100\ {\rm kpc}) = 0.55^{+0.12}_{-0.10}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ when using BHBs and RRLs, respectively. Extrapolating our mass profiles beyond the extent of our data, we find the virial mass of the Galaxy to be $M_{200}=0.85^{+0.16}_{-0.14}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ and $M_{200}=0.78^{+0.19}_{-0.15}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$, respectively. We validate the effectiveness and limitations of our method using mock BHBs and RRLs from two AuriDESI halos. These tests show that the code recovers the enclosed mass of the mock galaxy with high precision and accuracy between 50 and 200 kpc, independent of the stellar tracer used and their spatial distribution. The tests also suggest an underestimation of the galaxy's cumulative mass at a level of up to $\sim20$\% if stars close to the Galactic center are used in the models. Our mass estimates lay the groundwork for future inference of the Galactic mass with upcoming DESI data releases and spectroscopic surveys mapping the halo.</description>

      <title>The Seven Dwarfs illuminated. The impact of radiation on dwarf galaxies and their circumgalactic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation of a group of field dwarf galaxies which includes on-the-fly radiative transfer (RT) and is evolved to $z=0$. Emission from stars is included according to age-dependent spectra, and a redshift-dependent UV background. The inclusion of RT results in the formation of eight additional faint dwarf galaxies with stellar masses of $10^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$ to several $10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$ and only old stellar populations, similar to the observed Ultra-Faint Dwarf galaxies. They formed before and during cosmic reionisation and were mostly quenched by $z \sim 3-4$. The simulated galaxies follow many observed scaling relations such as the stellar mass-halo mass relation, the mass-size relation, and the luminosity-velocity dispersion relation. For the more massive dwarf galaxies, radiative feedback suppresses star formation, making it less bursty and reducing explosive outflows. This consequently reduces the dark matter core sizes by a factor of 2-3, rendering the core sizes ($\sim$ 1 kpc) more consistent with observations. The distribution of HI in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is ubiquitous with a covering fraction of unity within $R_{vir}$, in good agreement with observations. It is rather insensitive to radiative or SN feedback at $z=0$, but at $z&gt;5$ it is much higher in the RT simulation. In contrast, the distribution of low ions like SiII is very compact and declines sharply beyond the ISM scale. CIV and OVI have a more extended distribution, but their column densities are generally below the detection limit. Radiative feedback leads to smaller column densities of the metal ions, partly due to the reduction of total metal production, and partly because hard photons from the stellar radiation escape the ISM and further ionise the CGM. The abundance of CIV is particularly sensitive to the latter effect.</description>

      <title>The nine rings of the galaxy LEDA 1313424</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The galaxy LEDA 1313424 has recently been discovered to have nine rings [1]. The authors of the discovery paper interpret the rings to be the result of the passing of a smaller galaxy through the center of the LEDA galaxy 56 Myr ago. We point out several difficulties with this interpretation and propose instead that the rings of LEDA are the imprint upon baryonic matter of caustic rings of dark matter. Caustic rings of dark matter, with the pattern of radii observed in the LEDA galaxy, form if the dark matter is axions. Because they move slowly (LEDA's 70 kpc ring, for example, has speed 6.6 km/s) caustic rings of dark matter are plausible sites for the star formation observed in LEDA.</description>

      <title>Tidal Tails in Open Clusters I. Morphology, Binary Fraction, Dynamics, and Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: This research presents unsupervised machine learning and statistical methods to identify and analyze tidal tails in open star clusters using data from the Gaia-DR3 catalog. Aims: We aim to identify member stars, detect and analyze tidal tails in five open clusters, BH 164, Alessi 2, NGC 2281, NGC 2354, and M67, of ages between 60 Myr and 4 Gyr. These clusters were selected based on the previous evidence of extended tidal structures. Methods: We utilized machine learning algorithms such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), along with statistical methods to analyze the kinematic, photometric, and astrometric properties of stars. Key characteristics of tidal tails, including radial velocity, color-magnitude diagram, and spatial projections in the tangent plane beyond the cluster's Jacobi radius ($r_J$), were used to detect them. We used N-body simulations to visualize and compare the observables with real data. Further analysis was done on the detected cluster and tail stars to study their internal dynamics and populations, including binary fraction. We also applied the residual velocity method to detect rotational patterns in the clusters and their tails. Results: We identified tidal tails in all five clusters, with detected tails extending farther in some clusters and containing significantly more stars than previously reported (tails ranging from 40 to 100 pc, one to four times the Jacobi radius, with 100 - 200 tail stars). The luminosity functions of the tails and their parent clusters were generally consistent, and tails lacked massive stars. In general, the binary fraction was found to be higher in the tidal tails. Significant rotation was detected in M67 and NGC 2281 for the first time.</description>

      <title>Correcting the fiber-aperture bias affecting galaxy stellar populations in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Aperture corrections to absorption indices based on CALIFA integral field observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar population properties are crucial for understanding galaxy evolution. Their inference for statistically representative samples requires deep multi-object spectroscopy, typically obtained with fiber-fed spectrographs that integrate only a fraction of galaxy light. The most comprehensive local Universe dataset is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), whose fibers typically collected ~30% of total flux. Stellar population gradients, ubiquitously present in galaxies, systematically bias SDSS toward central properties, by amounts yet to be quantified. We leverage CALIFA integral-field spectroscopy to simulate fiber-fed observations at redshifts z=0.005-0.4, accounting for seeing effects. We analyze systematic aperture correction trends across galaxy morphologies and derive correction recipes based on: fiber-measured indices, global g-r color, absolute r-band magnitude Mr, and physical half-light radius R50. Corrections for absorption indices typically reach &gt;~15% of their dynamical range at z~0.02, decreasing to ~7% at z~0.1 (median SDSS redshift) and becoming negligible above z~0.2. Spiral galaxies exhibit the largest aperture effects due to their strong internal gradients. Our correction recipes, applied to the SDSS-DR7 dataset, significantly reduce scatter in stellar population diagnostic planes and enhance bimodality in age-sensitive diagrams. Corrections reveal systematic overestimates of old galaxy fractions by up to 10% and an underestimate by &gt;~0.2 mag of the transition luminosity at which old galaxies become dominant. Aperture corrections significantly impact observational tracers of stellar populations from fiber spectroscopy. Absorption indices corrections applied to SDSS-DR7 will provide a robust local benchmark for galaxy evolution studies.</description>

      <title>Euclid: A machine-learning search for dual and lensed AGN at sub-arcsec separations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological models of hierarchical structure formation predict the existence of a widespread population of dual accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on kpc-scale separations, corresponding to projected distances &lt; 0".8 at redshifts higher than 0.5. However, close companions to known active galactic nuclei (AGN) or quasars (QSOs) can also be multiple images of the object itself, strongly lensed by a foreground galaxy, as well as foreground stars in a chance superposition. Thanks to its large sky coverage, sensitivity, and high spatial resolution, Euclid offers a unique opportunity to obtain a large, homogeneous sample of dual/lensed AGN candidates with sub-arcsec projected separations. Here we present a machine learning approach, in particular a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to identify close companions to known QSOs down to separations of $\sim\,$0".15 comparable to the Euclid VIS point spread function (PSF). We studied the effectiveness of the CNN in identifying dual AGN and demonstrated that it outperforms traditional techniques. Applying our CNN to a sample of $\sim\,$6000 QSOs from the Q1 Euclid data release, we find a fraction of about 0.25% dual AGN candidates with separation $\sim\,$0".4 (corresponding to $\sim$3 kpc at z=1). Estimating the foreground contamination from stellar objects, we find that most of the pair candidates with separation higher than 0".5 are likely contaminants, while below this limit, contamination is expected to be less than 20%. For objects at higher separation (&gt;0".5, i.e. 4 kpc at z=1), we performed PSF subtraction and used colour-colour diagrams to constrain their nature. We present a first set of dual/lensed AGN candidates detected in the Q1 Euclid data, providing a starting point for the analysis of future data releases.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Single-peaked HI Spectra of Low Redshift Post-starburst Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) have revealed abundant reservoirs of neutral hydrogen (HI) in low redshift post-starburst galaxies (PSBs), raising the question of why star formation ceases rapidly in these systems. In this study, we present a detailed analysis of the shape of the integrated HI spectra of 67 PSBs. We find that PSBs exhibit significantly higher HI spectral concentration values ($K$) compared to a matched sample from xGASS, and are more comparable to those of starburst galaxies. By extending our analysis to spatially resolved HI data from THINGS and ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$, we show that both centrally concentrated HI distributions and dynamically unsettled HI can effectively increase $K$, while non-axisymmetric structures only contribute to the scatter of the $K$ distribution. Distinguishing between central concentration and dynamically unsettled gas as the origin of high $K$ can be achieved by measuring the spectral asymmetry ($A_{\rm F}$), making the $K$-$A_{\rm F}$ plane a powerful diagnostic tool for identifying galaxies with unsettled HI using integrated spectra alone. Based on their location in the $K$-$A_{\rm F}$ plane, we find that most PSBs are not dominated by unsettled HI, but rather exhibit elevated central gas concentration. Both modes of gas redistribution in PSBs may eventually contribute to their quenching.</description>

      <title>The BlueDOG at Cosmic Noon: A Possible Analog to Little Red Dots?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discovered a hyperluminous dust-obscured galaxy with mysterious blue-excess emission (BlueDOG) in rest-frame UV of its spectral energy distribution (SED) from a multi-wavelength survey in the AKARI Deep Field - South (ADF-S). We present the results of SED analysis with multiwavelength photometric data and spectroscopic analysis, observed with Gemini-S/GMOS, FLAMINGOS-2, to explore the origin of blue-excess emission of a hyperluminous BlueDOG, ADFS-KMTDOG-102, at z=2.6. The SED analysis shows that this BlueDOG is a highly massive system (log $M_{*}$/$M_\odot=12.3$) with substantial extinction. Additionally, the proportion of the old stellar population exceeds that of the young stellar population, which suggests stellar evolution cumulated from the early universe. The mass of supermassive black hole (SMBH) estimated using the extinction-corrected broad H$\rm\alpha$ emission line yields log $M_{\rm BH}$/$M_\odot$=10.2. We discuss the similarity between the BlueDOG and 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), recently discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope, showing SED shapes remarkably similar to those of LRDs. The UV emission line ratios indicate that the emission lines are primarily powered by the central active galactic nuclei (AGN). In contrast, the origin of the blue-excess UV continuum remains ambiguous, since both recent star formation and AGN-induced scattered light are viable explanations, based on the results from the SED fitting and scattered light modeling.</description>

      <title>Signature of a Dark Ultra-compact Dwarf Galaxy Transiting the Milky Way Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a vertical velocity anomaly (VVA) in the stellar component of the Galactic disk, consistent with the impact of a dark, ultra-compact dwarf galaxy (UCD)-sized object plunging into the Milky Way. The anomaly spatially coincides with a suite of gaseous disturbances -- including an \Hone\ void, a molecular shell (CO 16.134--0.553), and a vertical \Hone\ filament -- previously interpreted as signatures of a dark matter subhalo (DMSH) collision. Analysis of Gaia DR2 astrometry reveals a statistically significant vertical velocity dip co-located with these features, supporting a dynamical origin. The absence of a luminous source at the filament's terminus suggests a dark or failed UCD. These results provide rare observational evidence for a low-mass DMSH, with implications for the substructure of dark matter halos and constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Insights into spatial mixing of multiple populations in dynamically-young globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many galactic globular clusters (GCs) contain at least two stellar populations. Recent observational studies found that the radial distributions of the first (P1) and second population (P2) differ in dynamically-young GCs. Since P2 is conventionally assumed to form more centrally concentrated, the rapid mixing (or even inversion) in some GCs but not others is puzzling. We investigate whether dynamical processes specific to certain GCs might cause this. Specifically, we evaluate the expansion of P2 by binary-single interactions in the cluster core and whether these can mix the P1/P2 radial distributions, using a set of toy-models with varying numbers and masses of primordial binaries. We find that even one massive binary star can push the central P2 outwards, but multiple binaries are required to fully mix P1 and P2 within a few relaxation times. We also compare our results to observed properties of mixed young GCs (NGC 4590, 5053, or 5904).</description>

      <title>The AstroSat UV Deep Field South-V: Constraints on the average escape of ionizing photons in the cosmic dusk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the escape of ionizing (Lyman-continuum; LyC) photons from 49 star-forming galaxies at redshifts $\sim 1-1.5$, using far-ultraviolet (FUV) imaging from the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat. The sample spans a wide range of stellar masses and UV luminosities. LyC emission is undetected in most galaxies (42/49), and stacking these galaxies yields only an upper limit on the observed LyC-to-nonionizing UV flux density ratio ($({F}_{\lambda,\rm{LyC}}/{F}_{\lambda,\rm{UV}})_{\rm{obs}}&lt;0.12$). Including all galaxies (with 7 LyC-leaker candidates) produces a marginal $2.4\sigma$ detection, suggesting that the average LyC signal is driven by a small number of sources. To identify the conditions favorable for LyC escape, we perform stacking analyses in bins of stellar mass, UV slope, compactness, inclination, and star formation rate surface density. A stacked LyC signal is detected at a significance of $\sim3\sigma$ from a subset of galaxies that are characterized as being compact, have high star formation rate surface densities, and blue UV continuum slopes, despite each of these being individually undetected in LyC. This provides the first systematic evidence at $z\sim 1-1.5$ linking these properties to LyC escape, consistent with trends observed in the lower redshift universe. Additionally, LyC leakage appears more efficient in low-mass galaxies ($\log_{10}(M_{*}/M_{\odot})&lt;9.5$), with their average absolute escape fraction ranging from $\langle f_{\text{esc,abs}} \rangle\sim0.1-0.2$ depending on stellar population assumptions. These results support the scenario that compact, low-mass starbursts were key contributors to the ionizing photon budget during cosmic reionization.</description>

      <title>Joint Analysis of HI Absorption Zeeman Measurements and the Morphology of Filamentary HI Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a joint analysis of HI absorption Zeeman measurements and the morphology of filamentary HI emission to investigate the three-dimensional structure of the magnetic field in the diffuse neutral interstellar medium (ISM). Our analysis is based on the Arecibo Millennium Survey and new data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) toward radio sources 3C 75, 3C 207, and 3C 409. Toward 3C 409, we make a 4$\sigma$ Zeeman detection and infer $B_{LOS}$ = 9.1 +/- 1.9$\mu$G, in agreement with Arecibo results. We quantify the dispersion of HI filaments at the locations and velocities of Zeeman components using GALFA-HI narrow-channel emission maps. Focusing on a subsample of 42 spectrally distinct components, we find a weak but statistically significant positive correlation (Spearman r = 0.3, $p = 0.01$) between $|B_{LOS}|$ and the circular variance of HI filament orientation angles. To examine its origin, we characterize the environments probed by HI absorption using dust emission, 3D dust maps, OH absorption, and CO emission. We find evidence that existing HI absorption Zeeman measurements trace magnetic fields that are coherent on parsec scales, probe primarily local gas ($100$-$500$ pc, often at distances consistent with the Local Bubble wall), and exhibit systematic differences in the magnitude of $B_{LOS}$. We attribute the correlation between Zeeman measurements and filamentary HI morphology to large-scale variations in magnetic field strength and/or inclination angle across different Galactic environments, which could arise due to the Local Bubble geometry or enhanced total field strength in denser regions.</description>

      <title>X-ray view of a massive node of the Cosmic Web at z=3 II. Discovery of extended X-ray emission around a hyperluminous QSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the warm, ionized gas in the CGM at z&gt;3 is now routinely observed around bright QSOs in Lya emission, little is known about the CGM hot phase due to its expected faintness in the X-ray band, often referred to as the ICM. Here, we report the analysis of 634 ks of Chandra X-ray observations in the MQN01 Cosmic Node, a region containing one of the brightest Lya nebulae and the largest galaxy overdensity discovered so far at z&gt;3. We detect 66 net counts of X-ray emission in the 0.5-2 keV band extending to at least 30 kpc from the brightest QSO in MQN01. The morphology and spectrum are consistent with thermal emission from hot plasma in CIE. Photoionization is negligible, and IC is disfavored. A joint spatial and spectral MCMC analysis provides consistency with a beta-model with a steep density profile and a gas temperature kT~1.8 keV and virial halo mass Mvir~3e13 Mo. The inferred hot gas mass is Mhot(&lt;Rvir)~2.6e12 Mo, which is ~8.3% of Mvir, or ~56% of the theoretical cosmological baryon budget of the halo. The hot gas also emits an exceptionally high Lx, with a measured L2-10~2.3e45 erg/s within the central 30 kpc. This system is a clear outlier in the Lx-Tx plane, indicating a thermodynamic state distinct from that of evolved lower-redshift hot halos. The cooling time in the inner 15-30 kpc is comparable to the local dynamical time, suggesting that the gas could become locally unstable in the absence of heating or feedback. Moreover, the thermal pressure associated with the detected CGM hot phase is large enough to confine the cold and dense clumps, which are required to reproduce the high Lya emission associated with the inner regions of the MQN01 structure. Although limited to a single system, our results provide unique information on the multi-phase properties of the CGM and a view of the nascent thermal hot gas phase observed in local galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>The JWST/MIRI view of the planetary nebula NGC 6302 I.: a UV irradiated torus and a hot bubble triggering PAH formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NGC 6302 is a spectacular bipolar planetary nebula (PN) whose spectrum exhibits fast outflows and highly ionized emission lines, indicating the presence of a very hot central star (~220,000 K). Its infrared spectrum reveals a mixed oxygen and carbon dust chemistry, displaying both silicate and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features. Using the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and Medium Resolution Spectrometer, a mosaic map was obtained over the core of NGC 6302, covering the wavelength range of 5--28 micron and spanning an area of ~18.5 arcsec x15 arcsec. The spatially resolved spectrum reveals ~200 molecular and ionized lines from species requiring ionisation potentials of up to 205 eV. The spatial distributions highlight a complex structure at the nebula's centre. Highly ionized species such as Mg VII and Si VII show compact structures, while lower-ionization species such as H^+ extend much farther outwards, forming filament-defined rims that delineate a bubble. Within the bubble, the H^+ and H_2 emission coincide, while the PAH emission appears farther out, indicating an ionization structure distinct from typical photodissociation regions, such as the Orion Bar. This may be the first identification of a PAH formation site in a PN. This PN appears to be shaped not by a steady, continuous outflow, but by a series of dynamic, impulsive bubble ejections, creating local conditions conducive to PAH formation. A dusty torus surrounds the core, primarily composed of large (micron-sized) silicate grains with crystalline components. The long-lived torus contains a substantial mass of material, which could support an equilibrium chemistry and a slow dust-formation process.</description>

      <title>Lensing by black holes within astrophysical environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical black holes are likely to be surrounded by various forms of matter in the form of disks or halos. While a number of studies have examined the impact of an environment on the lensing of light or gravitational waves from cosmological sources, these have, thus far, been carried out in either a Newtonian or post-Newtonian framework where the environment is superimposed on the black-hole spacetime. By using an exact solution in general relativity describing a black hole embedded within a realistic halo of Hernquist matter distribution, we study deflection angles and image amplification in a fully relativistic setup. It is shown that large ``bumps'' corresponding to the peak of the mass distribution can significantly adjust the inferences made for either the source or lens in various contexts. As an application, we consider ``echoes'' of gravitational waves, sourced by astrophysical lenses rather than being intrinsic to the compact object that produces the signal.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of Carbon-Deficient Red Giants: Merger Products of Hierarchical Triple Systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon-deficient giants (CDGs) are a rare and chemically peculiar class of stars whose origins remain under active investigation. We present an asteroseismic analysis of the entire known CDG population, selecting 129 stars observed by $Kepler$, K2, and TESS to obtain seismic constraints. We detect solar-like oscillations in 43 CDGs. By measuring $\nu_{\rm max}$ and applying seismic scaling relations, we determine precise masses for these stars, finding that 79\% are low-mass ($M \lesssim 2~M_\odot$). The luminosity distribution is bimodal, and the CDGs separate into three chemically and evolutionarily distinct groups, characterized by clear trends in sodium and CNO abundances, $\alpha$-element enhancement, and kinematics. We find that two of these groups are only distinguished by their initial $\alpha$-element abundances, thus effectively reducing the number of groups to two. Lithium enrichment is common across all groups, linking CDGs to lithium-rich giants and suggesting a shared evolutionary origin. We find that spectroscopic $\log g$ is systematically offset from seismic values. Group~1 CDG patterns are most consistent with formation through core He-flash mixing, while the more massive and more chemically processed Groups~2 and 2$\alpha$ likely formed through mergers involving helium white dwarfs, possibly in hierarchical triples. Pollution from AGB stars appears very unlikely, given the unchanged [C+N+O] abundance across all groups.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Microlensing of the Galactic Centre $\gamma$-Ray Excess: A New Test for Point-Like or Extended Emission?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a potential test of the origin of the $\gamma$-ray Galactic Centre Excess (GCE). We demonstrate how gravitational microlensing by stellar mass objects along the line of sight to the Galactic Bulge can distinguish between the possibility of extensive emission due to dark matter self-annihilation from more prosaic astrophysical sources, namely millisecond pulsars. Such an astrophysical origin would result in emission from a population of small, currently unresolved point-like sources - in contrast to the expected smoother emission resulting from dark matter annihilation. Given that the scale of gravitational microlensing, that is, the Einstein radius for stellar mass lenses, and hence, the degree of induced magnification, is sensitive to the size of the emitting region, such microlensing will induce time variability in the emission of astrophysical sources, whereas $\gamma$-ray emission from dark matter annihilation will effectively be immune to such influences. However, we find that detecting microlensing-induced variability requires significantly greater sensitivity than that of current or planned $\gamma$-ray detectors. For a small population of bright GCE sources, more than an order-of-magnitude increase in effective area over Fermi-LAT would be required, with events remaining extremely rare. For a large population of faint sources, events would occur multiple times a year, but would only be detectable with a four-order-of-magnitude improvement. Whilst microlensing might not be a definitive test of the origin of the GCE, in future observations, it may prove useful in determining the properties of any point-like source population.</description>

      <title>Cocoon-to-Butterfly Transformation in Protoplanetary Nebula: Detection of a Spherical Halo and a Barrel-shaped Torus in IRAS 06530$-$0213</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protoplanetary nebulae (PPNs) represent a critical evolutionary bridging stage between the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and planetary nebula (PN) stages. Their dynamical structures provide key insights into late stellar evolution. Here, we report CO and $^{13}$CO imaging observations of the carbon-rich PPN IRAS 06530$-$0213, a source exhibiting the unidentified 21 micron emission band, conducted with the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA). The CO maps reveal a spherical halo (diameter $\sim10''$) surrounding a central barrel-shaped torus, where the torus displays an inner diameter of $\sim1.5''$ and an outer diameter of $\sim2''$. Through three-dimensional morpho-kinematic modeling with the SHAPE software, we determine that IRAS 06530$-$0213 experienced its final thermal pulse during the AGB phase $\sim6500$ years ago, transitioning into the PPN phase $\sim4500$ years ago. Our analysis indicates that the blue-shifted CO emission, a feature also detected in several other PPNs and PNs previously misattributed to the interstellar clouds, actually originates from the obscuration of the central nebula by the remnant AGB halo. These findings are expected to deepen our understanding of the dynamical structures of PPNs, as well as their pivotal transitional role in the late-stage evolution of low-to-intermediate mass stars.</description>

      <title>Meridional Circulation II: A Unified Mechanism for Lithium Depletion in Solar Analogs and the Lithium Dip in Mid-F Cluster Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of lithium (Li) in Population I main sequence stars challenges standard stellar theory. Two phenomena stand out: the solar Li problem which extends to Li depletion in solar analogs and the Li dip observed in mid-F stars within open clusters. Building on the meridional circulation-driven radial mixing framework previously developed to explain Li-enriched red clump stars, we explore its relevance to Li depletion on the main sequence. First, our models reproduce the observed $A(\text{Li})$-Age correlation in solar analogs. Through detailed isochrone analysis, we find good agreement between the simulated and observed $A(\text{Li})$-$T_{\text{eff}}$ relationships within the solar analog parameter space. However, the predicted solar Li abundance ($\sim 1.5\,\text{dex}$) is still higher than current solar measurements. Second, our models partially explain the Li dip phenomenon in mid-F cluster stars. The models accurately reproduce Li distributions on the cool side of the Li dip in most clusters and capture the Li behaviors on the hot side observed in systems like the Hyades. However, we identify limitations in the models' ability to fully reproduce the dip morphology, particularly due to the rotation velocity distribution of sample stars in this temperature zone.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Cosmological Constant from Stellar Orbits Around Sgr A* Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel analytical framework employing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to constrain the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ through the analysis of stellar orbits around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A* at the Galactic center. Focusing on the well-observed S2 star, we use an inverse PINN (iPINN) architecture to infer orbital elements and estimate the total precession angle from astrometric data. By isolating the contribution from $\Lambda$, which is defined as the difference between the total precession and the Schwarzschild precession, we derive a stringent upper bound of $\Lambda \leq 5.67 \times 10^{-40}, \mathrm{m}^{-2}$, which is approximately two orders of magnitude tighter than previous estimates obtained using similar data-driven methods. Extension of our analysis to two additional long-period S-stars, S1 and S9, reveals that while the cosmological precession becomes relatively more prominent in such systems, limited orbital coverage introduces significant uncertainties in parameter estimation. Among the cases examined, the constraint derived from S2 remains the most robust. Our results highlight the potential of PINN-based approaches for extracting physical insights from sparse or noisy astronomical data. Future applications to next-generation observational data and further methodological improvements in machine learning are expected to refine the cosmological constraints and enable broader tests of gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>The Corona-Australis star-forming region: New insights on its formation history from detailed stellar and disk analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The star-forming complex of Corona Australis (CrA) is one of the closest and most isolated molecular clouds. It belongs to a chain of clusters that show age gradients with distance from the galactic plane. We aim to provide suggestions regarding its formation history by examining the stellar and disk populations, stellar multiplicity, and interstellar absorption. We made a census of stars and disks using Gaia DR3 and infrared data. Interstellar absorption in the direction of each star was derived by comparing SpTy from the literature and Gaia colors. Stellar multiplicity analysis accounts for both direct observation of visual companions (Gaia data and high-contrast imaging) and indirect detection of the presence of companions (eclipsing and spectroscopic binaries, and astrometry). The properties of the disks were obtained from the slopes of the spectral energy distributions. As found in previous studies, the CrA complex can be divided into two regions: a younger region (CrA-Main: 3+/-1Myr) and an older one (CrA-North: 6.7+/-0.3Myr), slightly younger than previously thought. While CrA-Main still appears bound to the gas, CrA-North is unbound and expanding. The stars that belong to CrA-North were in the most compact configuration 3.72Myr ago. At that time, CrA-Main and CrA-North were much closer to each other than they appear now. The fraction of disk-bearing stars is higher in Main than in North, as also expected due to the younger age of CrA-Main. We propose a formation history scenario for the CrA-complex. It started between 15 and 18 Myr ago with SNe explosions in the Upper Centaurus-Lupus complex, followed by a quiescent phase with little star formation. A star formation episode about 7Myr ago formed CrA-North stars. About 3.7Myr ago, a second SN explosion south of CrA-North triggered star formation in CrA-Main. This last SN might have been the origin of the pulsar RX J1856.5-3754.</description>

      <title>Attempting an accurate age estimate of the open cluster NGC 6633 using CoRoT and Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asteroseismology of solar-like oscillations in giant stars allow the derivation of their masses and radii. For members of open clusters, this provides an age of the cluster that should be identical to the one derived from the colour-magnitude diagram, but independent of the uncertainties that are present for that type of analysis. We aim to identify and measure the properties of giant members of the open cluster NGC6633, and combine these with asteroseismic measurements to derive a precise and self-consistent cluster age. Importantly, we wish to constrain the effects of rotational mixing on stellar evolution, since assumptions about internal mixing can have a significant impact on stellar age estimates. We identify five giant members of NGC6633 using photometry and Gaia data, supplemented by spectroscopic literature measurements. These are combined with asteroseismic measurements from CoRoT data and compared to stellar-model isochrones. This constrains the interior mixing to a low level and enables the most precise, accurate and self-consistent age estimate so far for this cluster. Asteroseismology of the giants and the cluster colour-magnitude diagram provide self-consistent masses of the giant members and their radii constrain the stellar interior mixing to a low level. The [C/N] ratios and Li abundances also suggest that rotation has had very little influence on the evolution of the stars in NGC 6633. This results in an age estimate of 0.55+0.05-0.10 Gyr for NGC6633. Four giant members appear to be in the helium-core burning evolutionary phase as also expected from evolutionary timescales. For the largest giant, the evidence remains inconclusive. A comparison to other age and mass estimates for the same stars in the literature uncovers biases for automated age estimates of helium-core burning stars.</description>

      <title>Collisional excitation of HCN by CO to refine the modeling of cometary comae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first dataset of collisional (de)-excitation rate coefficients of HCN induced by CO, one of the main perturbing gases in cometary atmospheres. The dataset spans the temperature range of 5-50 K. It includes both state-to-state rate coefficients involving the lowest ten and nine rotational levels of HCN and CO, respectively, and the so-called "thermalized" rate coefficients over the rotational population of CO at each kinetic temperature. The derivation of these coefficients exploited the good performance of the statistical adiabatic channel model (SACM) on top of an accurate interaction potential computed at the CCSD(T)-F12b/CBS level of theory. The reliability of the SACM approach was validated by comparison with full quantum calculations restricted at the lowest total angular momentum of the system. These results provide essential input to accurately model the distribution among the rotational energy levels and the abundance of HCN in cometary atmospheres, accounting for deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium that typically occurs in such environments.</description>

      <title>Strong Lens Discoveries in DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR10 with Two Deep Learning Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have conducted a search for strong gravitational lensing systems in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10 (DR10). This paper is the fourth in a series of searches (following Huang et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2021; Storfer et al. 2024, Paper I, II, &amp; III respectively). This is the first catalog of lens candidates covering nearly the entirety of the extragalactic sky south of declination $\delta\approx +32$ deg, all of it observed by the DECam, covering $\sim$14,000 $deg^2$. We impose a $z$-band magnitude cut of &lt; 20 in AB magnitude. We deploy a Residual Neural Network and EfficientNet as an ensemble trained on a compilation of known lensing systems and high-grade candidates as well as nonlenses in the same footprint. The predictions from these two base models are aggregated using a meta-learner. After applying our ensemble to the survey data, we exclude known candidates and systems, and use our own visual inspection portal to rank images in the top 0.01 percentile of all neural network recommendations. We have found 811 new lens candidates. These include 484 new candidates in the Legacy Surveys DR9 footprint, all parts of which have been searched for strong lenses at least once before, either by our group or others. Combining the discoveries from this work with those from Paper I (335), II (1210), and III (1512), we have discovered a total of 3868 new candidates in the DESI Legacy Surveys.</description>

      <title>The weak connection between the stellar haloes and merger histories of Milky Way-mass galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar haloes form through the disruption of satellite galaxies over time, making them a promising observable for constraining galaxy merger histories. We use a dynamical decomposition technique to isolate the stellar haloes of Milky Way-mass galaxies in the $100\,{\rm Mpc}$ EAGLE simulation and study their relationship to the merger histories of their hosts. We define the stellar halo as the stellar mass that is bound to the central subhalo but not associated with the disc or bulge components of a galaxy, and we quantify their merger histories using the most significant merger since $z=1$. Surprisingly, we find that the fraction of a galaxy's total stellar mass in the stellar halo, $f_{\rm SH}$, is not a reliable indicator of its merger activity. Contrary to common assumptions, disc galaxies with low $f_{\rm SH}$ do not necessarily have quiescent merger histories. In fact, roughly one quarter experienced a merger at $z \leq 1$ with a satellite whose stellar mass was at least 10 per cent of the host galaxy's stellar mass. These galaxies undergo mergers with satellites on circular orbits that are roughly co-planar with the pre-existing disc and thereby avoid contributing mass to the stellar halo. Instead, such mergers build thick, extended discs and supply fresh gas that often triggers a significant episode of star formation in the disc. Our results suggest that disc galaxies with low-mass stellar haloes, such as the Milky Way, can have varied and active merger histories, and that stellar haloes may not be a reliable tool for inferring galaxy merger histories.</description>

      <title>A First-look at Spatially-resolved Infrared Supernova Remnants in M33 with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first spatially-resolved infrared images of supernova remnants (SNRs) in M33 with the unprecedented sensitivity and resolution of JWST. We analyze 40 SNRs in four JWST fields: two covering central and southern M33 with separate NIRCam (F335M, F444W) and MIRI (F560W, F2100W) observations, one $\sim$5 kpc-long radial strip observed with MIRI F770W, and one covering the giant HII region NGC 604 with multiple NIRCam and MIRI broad/narrowband filters. Of the 21 SNRs in the MIRI (F560W+F2100W) field, we found three clear detections (i.e., identical infrared and H$\alpha$ morphologies), and six partial-detections, implying a detection fraction of 43\% in these bands. One of the SNRs in this field, L10-080, is a potential candidate for having freshly-formed ejecta dust, based on its size and centrally-concentrated 21 $\mu$m emission. In contrast, only one SNR (out of 16) is detectable in the NIRCam F335M+F444W field. Two SNRs near NGC 604 have strong evidence of molecular (H$_2$) emission at 4.7 $\mu$m, making them the farthest known SNRs with visible molecular shocks. Five SNRs have F770W observations, with the smaller younger objects showing tentative signs of emission, while the older, larger ones have voids. Multi-wavelength data indicate that the clearly-detected SNRs are also among the smallest, brightest at other wavelengths (H$\alpha$, radio and X-ray), have the broadest line widths (H$\alpha$ FWHM$\sim$250-350 km/s), and the densest environments. No correlation between the JWST-detectability and local star-formation history of the SNRs is apparent.</description>

      <title>Lyman Continuum leakage from massive leaky starbursts: A different class of emitters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of Lyman Continuum (LyC) photons responsible for reionizing the universe remains a mystery, with the fraction of escaping LyC photons from galaxies at z$\sim$ 6 to 12 being highly uncertain. While direct detection of LyC photons from this epoch is hindered by absorption from the intergalactic medium, lower redshift analogs offer a promising avenue to study LyC leakage. We present Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (HST COS) observations of five low redshift (z$\sim$ 0.3) massive starburst galaxies, selected for their high stellar mass and weak [SII] nebular emission - an indirect tracer of LyC escape. Three of the five galaxies show LyC leakage, highlighting the reliability of weak [SII] as a tracer, especially in light of recent JWST discoveries of z $&gt;$ 5 galaxies with similarly weak [SII] emission. The dust corrected LyC escape fractions, which represent the LyC photons that would escape in the absence of dust, range from 33% to 84%. However, the absolute escape fractions, which show the LyC photons escaping after passing through both neutral hydrogen absorption and dust attenuation, are significantly lower, ranging between 1% and 3%. This suggests that while the galaxies are nearly optically thin to HI, their high dust content significantly suppresses LyC photon escape. These [SII] weak, massive leakers are distinct from typical low-redshift LyC emitters, showing higher metallicity, lower ionization states, more dust extinction and higher star formation surface densities. This suggests that these galaxies constitute a distinct population, likely governed by a different mechanism facilitating LyC photon escape. We propose that the feedback-driven winds in these compact starbursts create ionized channels through which LyC photons escape, aligning with a picket-fence model.</description>

      <title>Estimating the dense gas mass of molecular clouds using spatially unresolved 3 mm line observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to develop a new method to infer the sub-beam probability density function (PDF) of H2 column densities and the dense gas mass within molecular clouds using spatially unresolved observations of molecular emission lines in the 3 mm band. We model spatially unresolved line integrated intensity measurements as the average of an emission function weighted by the sub-beam column density PDF. The emission function, which expresses the line integrated intensity as a function of the gas column density, is an empirical fit to high resolution (&lt; 0.05 pc) multi-line observations of the Orion B molecular cloud. The column density PDF is assumed to be parametric, composed of a lognormal distribution at moderate column densities and a power law distribution at higher column densities. To estimate the sub-beam column density PDF, the emission model is combined with a Bayesian inversion algorithm (the Beetroots code), which takes account of thermal noise and calibration errors. We validate our method by demonstrating that it recovers the true column density PDF of the Orion B cloud, reproducing the observed emission line integrated intensities. We apply the method to 12CO(J=1-0), 13CO(J=1-0), C18O(J=1-0), HCN(J=1-0), HCO+(J=1-0) and N2H+(J=1-0) observations of a 700 x 700 pc2 field of view (FoV) in the nearby galaxy M51. On average, the model reproduces the observed intensities within 30%. The column density PDFs obtained for the spiral arm region within our test FoV are dominated by a power-law tail at high column densities, with slopes that are consistent with gravitational collapse. Outside the spiral arm, the column density PDFs are predominantly lognormal, consistent with supersonic isothermal turbulence. We calculate the mass associated with the powerlaw tail of the column density PDFs and observe a strong, linear correlation between this mass and the 24$\mu$m surface brightness.</description>

      <title>Calibrating the SIDM Gravothermal Catastrophe with N-body Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) theories predict that dark matter halos experience core-collapse in late-stage evolution, a process where the halo's inner region rapidly increases in density and decreases in size. This process can be modeled by treating the dark matter as a gravothermal fluid, and solving the fluid equations to predict the density profile evolution. This model is incomplete without calibration to N-body simulations, through a constant factor $\beta$ included in the thermal conductivity for the long-mean-free-path limit. The value of $\beta$ employed in the gravothermal fluid formalism has varied between studies, with no clear universal value in the literature. In this work, we use the N-body code Arepo to conduct a series of isolated core-collapse simulations across a range of scattering cross-sections, halo concentrations, and halo masses to calibrate the heat transfer parameter $\beta$. We find that $\beta$ is independent of cross-section, halo concentration, and halo mass for velocity independent elastic scattering cross-sections. We present a model for an effective $\beta$ as a function of a dimensionless cross-section, to describe halo evolution in the long mean free path limit, and show that it accurately captures halo evolution as long as the cross section is not too large. This effective model facilitates comparisons between simulations and the gravothermal model, and enables fast predictions of the dark matter density profile at any given time without running N-body simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), with its extensive optical monitoring capabilities, has provided an unprecedented opportunity to study the long-term variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this work, we present a comparative analysis of optical colour and brightness variability for two $\mathrm{log(L_{Bol})}-z$ matched samples, consisting of 2095 Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies and a control sample consisting of 2380 Broad-line Seyfert 1 (BLSy1) galaxies. Using over six years of r-band and g-band light curves from the ZTF Data Release 22 (DR22), we characterize flux variability, fractional flux variability, and amplitude of temporal variability for each source in the samples. Our results indicate that BLSy1 galaxies exhibit significantly stronger variability compared to NLSy1s. To probe colour variability, we utilize quasi-simultaneous light curves, with half-hour epoch differences between $\mathrm{g}$- and $\mathrm{r}$-band measurements. We evaluated the colour index using both flux-flux space analysis and linear regression in magnitude-magnitude space. We find that large majorities of these sources -- 74% of NLSy1 and 79% of BLSy1 -- exhibit a clear ``bluer-when-brighter'' (BWB) trend, although part of this effect may arise from contamination by the non-varying, predominantly redder flux of the host galaxy. Furthermore, rest-frame structure function analysis reveals that BLSy1 galaxies are $1.44 \pm 0.06$ times more variable than NLSy1s. These results can provide valuable insights into the variability properties of AGN subclasses and their underlying physical drivers.</description>

Abstract: Stellar atmospheric element abundance ratios of stars retain information about their birth conditions, helping elucidate their origin and nature. In this letter, we analyse and contrast the hydrostatic and explosive $\alpha$-element abundance ratios, and the ratio of the two (the hex ratio), for a large sample of Galactic globular clusters (GCs), halo substructures, satellite galaxies, and the Milky Way high-/low-$\alpha$ discs using data from the $APOGEE$ survey. Our results show that: $i$) Milky Way GCs and halo substructures appear to have qualitatively similar hex ratios across a broad range of [Fe/H], that are higher than that of dwarf satellite galaxies of similar [Fe/H]; $ii$) for all stellar populations studied, there is a trend in the hex ratio with [Fe/H]; $iii$) there is a weak trend in the hex ratio with respect to age for Galactic GCs, but not with initial or final GC mass; $iv$) there are no differences in the hex ratio between GCs formed $in$ $situ$ versus those labelled as accreted.</description>

Abstract: It has long been suggested that a fraction of the dark matter in the Universe could exist in the form of primordial black holes (PBHs) that have existed since the radiation dominated era. Recent studies have suggested that these PBHs may be the progenitors to the population of high-redshift, supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed since the launch of JWST. For the first time, we have included PBHs in cosmological simulations, to test whether PBHs can sink to the center of collapsing halos, locate dense gaseous regions and experience significant growth. We tested PBH-to-DM mass ratios of $f_{\rm PBH}$ = $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$, with an initial PBH mass of 1000 M$_\odot$, as inspired by recent observational constraints. We find that at $f_{\rm PBH} = 10^{-3}$, a number of PBHs were able to embed themselves in dense gas and grow to $10^{4}$-$10^{5}$ M$_\odot$ by $z=20$. These intermediate black holes (IMBHs) are possible progenitors to the highest redshift SMBH observations such as GNZ-11 ($10^{6}$ M$_\odot$ by $z=10$), outperforming light seed black hole (BH) growth seen in recent simulations without the need to invoke heavy seeding prescriptions. On the other hand, $f_{\rm PBH} = 10^{-4}$ resulted in no significant BH growth, emphasizing that the ability of PBHs to act as SMBH seeds is sensitive to the true value of $f_{\rm PBH}$ in the Universe, and showing that the $f_{\rm PBH} =10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ boundary marks the threshold above which SMBH seeding via 1000 M$_\odot$ PBHs becomes effective. This is the first step towards building a realistic PBH framework in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-chimes: A model for radiative cooling and the abundances of ions and molecules in simulations of galaxy formation</title>

Abstract: Radiative processes play a pivotal role in shaping the thermal and chemical states of gas across diverse astrophysical environments, from the interstellar medium (ISM) to the intergalactic medium. We present a hybrid cooling model for cosmological simulations that incorporates a comprehensive treatment of radiative processes, including parameterizations of the interstellar radiation field, cosmic ray rates, and dust physics. The model uses the chimes chemical network and combines on-the-fly non-equilibrium calculations with quasi-equilibrium cooling rates. The quasi-equilibrium rates account for the time-dependent free electron fractions of elements tracked in non-equilibrium, balancing computational efficiency with physical accuracy. We evaluate the performance under various conditions, including the thermal evolution of primordial gas at the cosmic mean density, the properties of the warm and cold neutral media in Milky Way-like galaxies, and the atomic-to-molecular hydrogen transition. We demonstrate that thermal equilibrium predictions for the neutral phases of the ISM underestimate the median gas pressures in simulations of isolated galaxies by up to 0.5 dex. Finally we find that the atomic-to-molecular hydrogen transition is shifted to lower densities by up to 1 dex if oxygen is not included in the chemical network. Our work provides a robust framework for studying the multi-phase ISM and its role in galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

Abstract: We describe the second data release (DR2) of the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations of galaxy formation, from the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project, available at http://flathub.flatironinstitute.org/fire. DR2 includes all snapshots for most simulations, starting at z ~ 99, with all snapshot time spacings &lt;~ 25 Myr. The Core suite -- comprising 14 Milky Way-mass galaxies, 5 SMC/LMC-mass galaxies, and 4 lower-mass galaxies -- includes 601 snapshots to z = 0. For the Core suite, we also release resimulations with physics variations: (1) dark-matter-only versions; (2) a modified ultraviolet background with later reionization at z = 7.8; (3) magnetohydrodynamics, anisotropic conduction, and viscosity in gas; and (4) a model for cosmic-ray injection, transport, and feedback (assuming a constant diffusion coefficient). The Massive Halo suite now includes 8 massive galaxies with 278 snapshots to z = 1. The High Redshift suite includes 34 simulations: in addition to the 22 simulations run to z = 5, we now include 12 additional simulations run to z = 7 and z = 9. We also release 4 dark-matter-only cosmological boxes used to generate zoom-in initial conditions for many FIRE simulations. Most simulations include catalogs of (sub)halos and galaxies at all available snapshots, and most Core simulations to z = 0 include full halo merger trees.</description>

      <title>An Image-Plane Approach to Gravitational Lens Modeling of Interferometric Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing acts as a cosmic telescope, enabling the study of the high-redshift universe. Astronomical interferometers, such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), have provided high-resolution images of strongly lensed sources at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths. To model the mass and light distributions of lensing and source galaxies from strongly lensed images, strong lens modeling for interferometric observations is conventionally performed in the visibility space, which is computationally expensive. In this paper, we implement an image-plane lens modeling methodology for interferometric dirty images by accounting for noise correlations. We show that the image-plane likelihood function produces accurate model values when tested on simulated ALMA observations with an ensemble of noise realizations. We also apply our technique to ALMA observations of two sources selected from the South Pole Telescope survey, comparing our results with previous visibility-based models. Our model results are consistent with previous models for both parametric and pixelated source-plane reconstructions. We implement this methodology for interferometric lens modeling in the open-source software package lenstronomy.</description>

      <title>Globular clusters in M104: Tracing kinematics and metallicities from the centre to the halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10100</link>

Abstract: As ancient star clusters, globular clusters (GCs) are regarded as powerful tracers of galaxy evolution and assembly. Due to their brightness and compact sizes, GCs are employed to probe the kinematics and stellar population properties of galaxies, from the central regions out into the halo where the underlying stellar light becomes too faint for spectroscopic studies. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the GC system of M 104 (NGC 4594, also known as the Sombrero galaxy) based on literature spectroscopic catalogues and newly collected data from Very Large Telescope (VLT) MUSE integral-field spectroscopy combined with multi-object spectroscopy from VLT FLAMES and OSIRIS at the Gran Telescopio de Canarias (GTC). We present a new catalogue of 499 GCs with radial velocity measurements that span from the inner disc region out to $\sim$ 70 kpc (24$^{\prime}$). In addition to velocities, we measure metallicities from the MUSE, OSIRIS, and FLAMES spectra of 190 GCs. Together with literature values, we collected a sample of 278 metallicities. Comparing GCs observed with multiple instruments, we find a good agreement of velocity and metallicity measurements. Studying GC kinematics with a simple model confirms a decreasing velocity dispersion profile and low rotation velocities. The blue GCs appear to be more dispersion-dominated, while the red GCs follow the kinematics of the stars more closely. We find a large scatter of GC metallicities with distance from the centre and metal-rich GCs are found over all radii. We discuss that the GC metallicity distribution with a broad metal-poor component likely reflects the complex assembly history of M 104.</description>

      <title>A Spectroscopic Search for Dormant Black Holes in Low-Metallicity Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the massive black hole (BH) system Gaia BH3 in pre-release Gaia DR4 data suggests that wide BH binaries with luminous companions may be significantly overrepresented at low metallicities. Motivated by this finding, we have initiated a spectroscopic survey of low-metallicity stars exhibiting elevated RUWE values in Gaia DR3, using the FEROS and APF spectrographs. We identify promising BH binary candidates as objects with instantaneously measured radial velocities (RVs) that are very different from their mean RVs reported in Gaia DR3. Thus far, we have observed over 500 targets, including a nearly complete sample of stars with $\text{[Fe/H]} &lt; -1.5$, RUWE $&gt; 2$, and $G &lt; 15$. Our search has yielded one promising target exhibiting slow acceleration and an RV more than 98 km s$^{-1}$ different from its DR3 mean RV, as well as dozens of other candidates with smaller RV discrepancies. We quantify the sensitivity of our search using simulations, demonstrating that it recovers at least half of the BH companions within our selection criteria. We make all the spectra and RVs from our survey publicly available and encourage further follow-up.</description>

      <title>XRISM Reveals Complex Multi-Temperature Structures in the Abell 2029 Galaxy Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present $\sim$500 ks XRISM observations covering the central and two northern regions of the Abell 2029 galaxy cluster. Resolve enables us to distinguish multiple emission lines from hydrogen-like and helium-like iron (Fe) ions. This study focuses on the multi-temperature structure of Abell 2029 using line-ratio diagnostics. Using a single-temperature collisionally ionized equilibrium model, we measure average plasma temperatures of 6.73 keV, 7.61 keV, and 8.14 keV in the central, inner northern, and outer northern regions, respectively, spanning a radial range up to 700 kpc. To further investigate thermal structure, we derive excitation and ionization temperatures by comparing observed emission-line flux ratios with atomic database predictions. Significant deviations from the single-temperature CIE model in the central and inner northern regions indicate the presence of multi-phase gas. The excitation and ionization temperatures range from 2.85 keV to 8.5 keV in the central region, 4.3 keV to 9.8 keV in the inner northern region, and 8.3 keV to 10.4 keV in the outer northern region. These temperature distributions are largely consistent with the previously observed temperature gradient of A2029. However, Resolve detects two notably cooler components--3.42 keV in the central region and $\sim$4.3 keV in the inner northern region--likely associated with displaced cool gas due to gas sloshing. Additionally, we thermally resolve a 2.85 keV gas component at the core of A2029--potentially a significant development in our understanding of gas cooling. We propose that this cooler gas is a direct product of ongoing cooling processes in A2029, having already cooled to its present temperature. If this temperature structure is stable and no heating mechanism is present, this reservoir is likely to cool to even lower temperatures and form stars.</description>

      <title>Planetary Nebulae in the eROSITA eRASS1 catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some planetary nebulae (PNe) host X-ray-emitting hot bubbles shaped by stellar wind interactions and/or harbor X-ray-emitting central stars due to accretion, shocks within their fast stellar winds, or even chromospheric emission from binary companions. In both cases, the properties of the X-ray emission critically probe late-stages of stellar evolution for such low- and intermediate-mass stars. While extant Chandra and XMM-Newton observations have detected X-ray emission in PNe, the numbers known remain very small ($\sim40$) compared to the overall Galactic PNe population ($\sim4000$). We have initiated a project aimed at increasing the sample of known PNe with X-ray emission using both current and new space-based X-ray telescopes such as the Einstein probe. To further investigate their X-ray properties to elucidate what drives current X-ray PN detections, we have cross-searched the SRG {\it eROSITA-DE} eRASS1 source catalogue and Hong Kong (HASH) PNe Database. Five known X-ray PNe have been detected (Abell\,30, NGC\,2392, NGC\,3242, NGC\,5315, and LoTr\,5), two new X-ray PNe are revealed (IC\,1297 and NGC\,2867), one (K\,1-27) is removed from previous X-ray compilations, and another 11 previously detected X-ray emitting PNe are not recovered. A comparison of the X-ray flux of detected and undetected X-ray PNe reveals that eROSITA eRASS1 is sensitive to PNe with X-ray fluxes larger than $\approx2\times10^{-14}$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The frequency of occurrence is $\simeq$0.5\% among the 1430 HASH True PNe in the eRASS1 footprint.</description>
