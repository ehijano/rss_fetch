Abstract: In this note I present a readable version of the proof of my 2001 result, giving a sufficient and necessary condition for a function on a combinatorial cube to essentially (locally) depend on at most one variable (see the end of the paper for the motivation), as well as some limiting results.</description>

      <title>Algebraic and Combinatorial Stability of Independence Polynomials in Iterated Strong Products of Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the independence polynomials arising from iterated strong products of cycle graphs, examining their algebraic symmetries and combinatorial structures. Leveraging modular arithmetic and Galois theory, we establish precise conditions under which these polynomials factor over finite fields, highlighting modular collapses based on prime and composite cycle lengths. We demonstrate that while real-rootedness depends on cycle parity, the combinatorial structure ensures universal log-concavity and unimodality of coefficients. A toggling argument provides a combinatorial proof of unimodality, complementing algebraic methods and offering insights into polynomial stability. These findings bridge combinatorial and algebraic perspectives, contributing to graph-theoretic frameworks with implications in statistical mechanics and information theory.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of Total Dual Integrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design new tools to study variants of Total Dual Integrality. As an application, we obtain a geometric characterization of Total Dual Integrality for the case where the associated polyhedron is non-degenerate. We also give sufficient conditions for a system to be Totally Dual Dyadic, and prove new special cases of Seymour's Dyadic conjecture on ideal clutters.</description>

      <title>On refined enumerations of plane partitions of a given shape with bounded entries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider plane partitions $\text{PP}(\lambda; m)$ of a given shape $\lambda$, with entries at most $m$. We prove that the distributions of two statistics on $\text{PP}(\lambda; m)$ coincide: one is the number of rows containing $0$ and the other is the number of rows containing $m$. We also provide a bijective proof.</description>

      <title>Secure domination in $P_5$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dominating set of a graph $G$ is a set $S \subseteq V(G)$ such that every vertex in $V(G) \setminus S$ has a neighbor in $S$, where two vertices are neighbors if they are adjacent. A secure dominating set of $G$ is a dominating set $S$ of $G$ with the additional property that for every vertex $v \in V(G) \setminus S$, there exists a neighbor $u$ of $v$ in $S$ such that $(S \setminus \{u\}) \cup \{v\}$ is a dominating set of $G$. The secure domination number of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_s(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a secure dominating set of $G$. We prove that if $G$ is a $P_5$-free graph, then $\gamma_s(G) \le \frac{3}{2}\alpha(G)$, where $\alpha(G)$ denotes the independence number of $G$. We further show that if $G$ is a connected $(P_5, H)$-free graph for some $H \in \{ P_3 \cup P_1, K_2 \cup 2K_1, ~\text{paw},~ C_4\}$, then $\gamma_s(G)\le \max\{3,\alpha(G)\}$. We also show that if $G$ is a $(P_3 \cup P_2)$-free graph, then $\gamma_s(G)\le \alpha(G)+1$.</description>

      <title>Maximal entropy random walks and central Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and develop the concept of Maximal Entropy Random Walks (MERWs) on Weighted Bratteli Diagrams (WBDs), maximizing entropy production along paths as a natural criterion for choosing random walks on networks. Initially defined for irreducible finite graphs, MERWs were recently extended to the infinite setting in [1]. Bratteli Diagrams model various growth processes, such as the Young Lattice, where the Plancherel growth process emerges as a MERW. We show that MERWs are special cases of central Markov chains, which, in general, provide a powerful framework for deriving combinatorial identities. Regarding growing trees, in particular, we retrieve and extend Han's hook-length formula for binary trees and demonstrate that the Binary Search Tree (BST) process is a MERW, recovering its asymptotic behavior. We also introduce preferential attachment to generalize BSTs. For comb models, significant central measures appear, including the Chinese restaurant process, providing an alternative proof of the Poisson-Dirichlet limit distribution. Finally, we propose a Monte Carlo method, based on Knuth's algorithm, to approximate MERWs. We apply it to a pyramidal growth model, drawing connections with the limit shape of Young diagrams under the Plancherel measure.</description>

      <title>Multi-parametric matroids -- Applications to interdiction and weight set decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08178v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the multi-parametric matroid problem. The weights of the elements of the matroid's ground set depend linearly on an arbitrary but fixed number of parameters, each of which is taken from a real interval. The goal is to compute a minimum weight basis for each possible combination of the parameters. For this problem, we propose an algorithm that requires a polynomial number of independence tests and discuss two useful applications. First, the algorithm can be applied to solve a multi-parametric version of a special matroid interdiction problem, and second, it can be utilized to compute the weight set decomposition of the multi-objective (graphic) matroid problem. For the latter, we asymptotically improve the current state-of-the-art algorithm by a factor that is almost proportional to the number of edges of the graphic matroid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Cameron-Liebler sets of planes in the Klein quadric $Q^+(5,q)$ in PG$(5,q)$. We prove that there are many examples of such Cameron-Liebler sets of planes in the Klein quadric. More specifically, we provide an incomplete list of examples of such Cameron-Liebler sets of planes. By doing so, we also provide some characteristic results regarding these sets in connection with the Klein quadric. These results contribute to an open conjecture posed in [21].</description>

      <title>On the number of Hamiltonian cycles in the generalized Petersen graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Petersen graph $G(n, k)$ is a cubic graph with vertex set $V(G(n, k)) = \{v_i\}_{0 \leq i &lt; n} \cup \{w_i\}_{0 \leq i &lt; n}$ and edge set $E(G(n, k)) = \{v_i v_{i+1}\}_{0 \leq i &lt; n} \cup \{w_i w_{i+k}\}_{0 \leq i &lt; n} \cup \{v_i w_i\}_{0 \leq i &lt; n}$ where the indices are taken modulo $n$. Schwenk found the number of Hamiltonian cycles in $G(n, 2)$, and in this article we present initial conditions and linear recurrence relations for the number of Hamiltonian cycles in $G(n, 3)$ and $G(n, 4)$. This is attained by introducing $G'(n, k)$, which is a modified version of $G(n, k)$, and a subset of its subgraphs which we call admissible, and which are partitioned into different classes in such a manner that we can find relations between the number of admissible subgraphs of each class. The number of Hamiltonian cycles in $G(n, k)$ is a sum of the number of admissible subgraphs of $G'(n, k)$ over a certain subset of the classes. Although the number of classes is quite high (1705 for $k=3$ and 25675 for $k=4$), we are able to find linear recurrence relations for the number of admissible subgraphs in each class by partitioning a directed graph on the classes and their relations into strongly connected components, of which there are only a handful of different isomorphism classes for $k=3$ and $k=4$, all of a manageable size.</description>

      <title>Crossing Number of 3-Plane Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study 3-plane drawings, that is, drawings of graphs in which every edge has at most three crossings. We show how the recently developed Density Formula for topological drawings of graphs (KKKRSU GD 2024) can be used to count the crossings in terms of the number $n$ of vertices. As a main result, we show that every 3-plane drawing has at most $5.5(n-2)$ crossings, which is tight. In particular, it follows that every 3-planar graph on $n$ vertices has crossing number at most $5.5n$, which improves upon a recent bound (BBBDHKMOW GD 2024) of $6.6n$. To apply the Density Formula, we carefully analyze the interplay between certain configurations of cells in a 3-plane drawing. As a by-product, we also obtain an alternative proof for the known statement that every 3-planar graph has at most $5.5(n-2)$ edges.</description>

      <title>On resilient hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matching number of a $k$-graph is the maximum number of pairwise disjoint edges in it. The $k$-graph is called $t$-resilient if omitting $t$ vertices never decreases its matching number. The complete $k$-graph on $sk+k-1$ vertices has matching number $s$ and it is easily seen to be $(k-1)$-resilient. We conjecture that this is maximal for $k=3$ and $s$ arbitrary. The main result verifies this conjecture for $s=2$. Then Theorem 1.9 provides a considerable improvement on the known upper bounds for $s\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Counting cospectral graphs obtained via switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Switching is an operation on a graph that does not change the spectrum of the adjacency matrix, thus producing cospectral graphs. An important activity in the field of spectral graph theory is the characterization of graphs by their spectrum. Hence, switching provides a tool for disproving the existence of such a characterization.
  This paper presents a general framework for counting the number of graphs that have a non-isomorphic cospectral graph through a switching method, expanding on the work by Haemers and Spence [European Journal of Combinatorics, 2004]. Our framework is based on a different counting approach, which allows it to be used for all known switching methods for the adjacency matrix. From this, we derive asymptotic results, which we complement with computer enumeration results for graphs up to $10$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Evolomino is NP-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolomino is a pencil-and-paper logic puzzle popularized by a Japanese publisher Nikoli (like Sudoku, Kakuro, Slitherlink, Masyu, and Fillomino). The puzzle's name comes from the fact that the shape of the blocks that the player must draw gradually evolves in the direction of pre-drawn arrows. We prove, by reduction from 3-SAT, that the question of whether there exists at least one solution to the puzzle that satisfies Evolomino's rules is NP-complete. Since our reduction is parsimonious, i.e., it preserves the number of solutions, we also prove that counting the number of solutions to an Evolomino puzzle is #P-complete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quiver Grassmannians of equioriented type $\texttt{A}$ and nilpotent equioriented type $\tilde{\texttt{A}}$ quiver representations are GKM-varieties. In particular, they have a cellular decomposition and admit a torus action with finitely many fixed points and one-dimensional orbits (i.e. skeletal action). We examine the case of string representations and provide a classification of all corresponding quiver Grassmannians with a GKM-variety structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main motivation for this article is to explore the connections between the existence of certain combinatorial patterns (as in van der Corputs's theorem on arithmetic progressions of length $3$) with well-known tools and theorems for definable groups in simple theories. In the last sections of this article, we apply our model-theoretic results to bound the number of initial points starting few arithmetic progression of length $3$ in the structure of the additive group of integers with a predicate for the prime integers, assuming Dickson's conjecture, or with a predicate for the square-free integers, as well as for asymptotic limits of finite fields. Our techniques yield similar results for the elements appearing as distances in skew-corners and for S\'ark\"ozy's theorem.</description>

      <title>Sorting permutations using a pop stack with a bypass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new sorting device for permutations which makes use of a pop stack augmented with a bypass operation. This results in a sorting machine, which is more powerful than the usual Popstacksort algorithm and seems to have never been investigated previously. In the present paper, we give a characterization of sortable permutations in terms of forbidden patterns and reinterpret the resulting enumerating sequence using a class of restricted Motzkin paths. Moreover, we describe an algorithm to compute the set of all preimages of a given permutation, thanks to which we characterize permutations having a small number of preimages. Finally, we provide a full description of the preimages of principal classes of permutations, and we discuss the device consisting of two pop stacks in parallel, again with a bypass operation.</description>

      <title>Ramsey property for spaces with bilinear forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Ramsey property for vector spaces over finite fields with bilinear forms. We prove that symplectic spaces over finite fields do not have the Ramsey property. We also describe vector spaces with skew symmetric bilinear forms and radicals of finite codimension, where the Ramsey property does not hold. Some direct connections with generalized affine spaces are given.</description>

      <title>Homotopy types of complexes of hyperplanes in quasi-median graphs and applications to right-angled Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that, given two finite connected graphs $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$, if the two right-angled Artin groups $A(\Gamma_1)$ and $A(\Gamma_2)$ are quasi-isometric, then the infinite pointed sums $\bigvee_\mathbb{N} \Gamma_1^{\bowtie}$ and $\bigvee_\mathbb{N} \Gamma_2^{\bowtie}$ are homotopy equivalent, where $\Gamma_i^{\bowtie}$ denotes the simplicial complex whose vertex-set is $\Gamma_i$ and whose simplices are given by joins. These invariants are extracted from a study, of independent interest, of the homotopy types of several complexes of hyperplanes in quasi-median graphs (such as one-skeleta of CAT(0) cube complexes). For instance, given a quasi-median graph $X$, the \emph{crossing complex} $\mathrm{Cross}^\triangle(X)$ is the simplicial complex whose vertices are the hyperplanes (or $\theta$-classes) of $X$ and whose simplices are collections of pairwise transverse hyperplanes. When $X$ has no cut-vertex, we show that $\mathrm{Cross}^\triangle(X)$ is homotopy equivalent to the pointed sum of the links of all the vertices in the prism-completion $X^\square$ of $X$.</description>

      <title>Quantum K--theory of Grassmannians from a Yang-Baxter algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an earlier paper, two of the authors defined a $5$-vertex Yang-Baxter algebra (a Hopf algebra) which acts on the sum of the equivariant quantum K-rings of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}(k;n)$, where $k$ varies from $0$ to $n$. We construct geometrically defined operators on quantum K-rings describing this action. In particular, the $R$-matrix defining the Yang-Baxter algebra corresponds to the left Weyl group action. Most importantly, we use the `quantum=classical' statement for the quantum K-theory of Grassmannians to prove an explicit geometric interpretation of the action of generators of the Yang-Baxter algebra. The diagonal entries of the monodromy matrix are given by quantum K-multiplications by explicitly defined classes, and the off-diagonal entries by certain push-pull convolutions. We use this to find a quantization of the classes of fixed points in the quantum K-rings, corresponding to the Bethe vectors of the Yang-Baxter algebra. On each of the quantum K-rings, we prove that the two Frobenius structures (one from geometry, and the other from the integrable system construction) coincide. We discuss several applications, including an action of the extended affine Weyl group on the quantum K-theory ring (extending the Seidel action), a quantum version of the localization map (which is a ring homomorphism with respect to the quantum K-product), and a graphical calculus to multiply by Hirzebruch $\lambda_y$ classes of the dual of the tautological quotient bundle. In an Appendix we illustrate our results in the case when $n=2$.</description>

Abstract: We study perfect crystals for the standard modules of the affine Lie algebra $A_1^{(1)}$ at all levels using the theory of multi-grounded partitions. We prove a family of partition identities which are reminiscent of the Andrews-Gordon identities and companions to the Meurman-Primc identities, but with simple difference conditions involving absolute values.</description>

      <title>Decomposing random regular graphs into stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $k$-star decompositions, that is, partitions of the edge set into disjoint stars with $k$ edges, in the uniformly random $d$-regular graph model $\mathcal{G}_{n,d}$. Using the small subgraph conditioning method, we prove an existence result for such decompositions for all $d,k$ such that $d/2 &lt; k \leq d/2 + \max\{1,\frac{1}{6}\log d\}$. More generally, we give a sufficient existence condition that can be checked numerically for any given values of $d$ and $k$. Complementary negative results are obtained using the independence ratio of random regular graphs. Our results establish an existence threshold for $k$-star decompositions in $\mathcal{G}_{n,d}$ for all $d\leq 100$ and $k &gt; d/2$.
  For smaller values of $k$, the connection between $k$-star decompositions and $\beta$-orientations allows us to apply results of Thomassen (2012) and Lov\'asz, Thomassen, Wu and Zhang (2013). We prove that random $d$-regular graphs satisfy their assumptions with high probability, thus establishing a.a.s. existence of $k$-star decompositions (i) when $2k^2+k\leq d$, and (ii) when $k$ is odd and $k &lt; d/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $r$-uniform expansion $F^{(r)+}$ of a graph $F$ is obtained by enlarging each edge with $r-2$ new vertices such that altogether we use $(r-2)|E(F)|$ new vertices. Two simple lower bounds on the largest number $\mathrm{ex}_r(n,F^{(r)+})$ of $r$-edges in $F^{(r)+}$-free $r$-graphs are $\Omega(n^{r-1})$ (in the case $F$ is not a star) and $\mathrm{ex}(n,K_r,F)$, which is the largest number of $r$-cliques in $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs. We prove that $\mathrm{ex}_r(n,F^{(r)+})=\mathrm{ex}(n,K_r,F)+O(n^{r-1})$. The proof comes with a structure theorem that we use to determine $\ex_r(n,F^{(r)+})$ exactly for some graphs $F$, every $r\chi(F)$ and sufficiently large $n$.</description>

Abstract: We say that a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ contains a graph $H$ as a trace if there exists some set $S\subset V(\mathcal{H})$ such that $\mathcal{H}|_S=\{h\cap S: h\in E(\mathcal{H})\}$ contains a subhypergraph isomorphic to $H$. We study the largest number of hyperedges in 3-uniform hypergraphs avoiding some graph $F$ as trace. In particular, we improve a bound given by Luo and Spiro in the case $F=C_4$, and obtain exact bounds for large $n$ when $F$ is a book graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a positive integer $r$ and a graph $G$ with degree sequence $d_1,\dots,d_n$, we define $e_r(G)=\sum_{i=1}^n d_i^r$. We let $\mathrm{ex}_r(n,F)$ be the largest value of $e_r(G)$ if $G$ is an $n$-vertex $F$-free graph. We show that if $F$ has a color-critical edge, then $\mathrm{ex}_r(n,F)=e_r(G)$ for a complete $(\chi(F)-1)$-partite graph $G$ (this was known for cliques and $C_5$). We obtain exact results for several other non-bipartite graphs and also determine $\mathrm{ex}_r(n,C_4)$ for $r\ge 3$. We also give simple proofs of multiple known results.
  Our key observation is the connection to $\mathrm{ex}(n,S_r,F)$, which is the largest number of copies of $S_r$ in $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs, where $S_r$ is the star with $r$ leaves. We explore this connection and apply methods from the study of $\mathrm{ex}(n,S_r,F)$ to prove our results. We also obtain several new results on $\mathrm{ex}(n,S_r,F)$.</description>

      <title>Induced Minor Models. I. Structural Properties and Algorithmic Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $H$ is said to be an induced minor of a graph $G$ if $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of vertex deletions and edge contractions. Equivalently, $H$ is an induced minor of $G$ if there exists an induced minor model of $H$ in $G$, that is, a collection of pairwise disjoint subsets of vertices of $G$ labeled by the vertices of $H$, each inducing a connected subgraph in $G$, such that two vertices of $H$ are adjacent if and only if there is an edge in $G$ between the corresponding subsets.
  In this paper, we investigate structural properties of induced minor models, including bounds on treewidth and chromatic number of the subgraphs induced by minimal induced minor models. It is known that for some graphs $H$, testing a given graph $G$ contains $H$ as an induced minor is an NP-complete problem. Nevertheless, as algorithmic applications of our structural results, we make use of recent developments regarding tree-independence number to show that if $H$ is the $4$-wheel, the $5$-vertex complete graph minus an edge, or a complete bipartite graph $K_{2,q}$, then there is a polynomial-time algorithm to find in a given graph $G$ an induced minor model of $H$ in $G$, if there is one. We also develop an alternative polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing graphs that do not contain $K_{2,3}$ as an induced minor, which revolves around the idea of detecting the induced subgraphs whose presence is forced when the input graph contains $K_{2,3}$ as an induced minor, using the so-called shortest path detector. It turns out that all these induced subgraphs are Truemper configurations.</description>

      <title>Key-avoidance for alternating sign matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05311v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of key-avoidance on alternating sign matrices (ASMs) defined via pattern-avoidance on an associated permutation called the \emph{key} of an ASM. We enumerate alternating sign matrices whose key avoids a given set of permutation patterns in several instances. We show that ASMs whose key avoids $231$ are permutations, thus any known enumeration for a set of permutation patterns including $231$ extends to ASMs. We furthermore enumerate by the Catalan numbers ASMs whose key avoids both $312$ and $321$. We also show ASMs whose key avoids $312$ are in bijection with the gapless monotone triangles of [Ayyer, Cori, Gouyou-Beauchamps 2011]. Thus key-avoidance generalizes the notion of $312$-avoidance studied there. Finally, we enumerate ASMs with a given key avoiding $312$ and $321$ using a connection to Schubert polynomials, thereby deriving an interesting Catalan identity.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture of Nikiforov concerning the minimal $p$-energy of connected graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16604v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given simple graph \( G \), the \( p \)-energy of \( G \), denoted by \( \mathcal{E}_p(G) \), is defined as the sum of the \( p \)-th power of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix. Let \( S_n \) denote the star graph with one internal node and \( n-1 \) leaves. Nikiforov conjectured that for \( 1 &lt; p &lt; 2 \), the connected graph of order \( n \) with the smallest \( p \)-energy is \( S_n \). Recently, this conjecture was proved for bipartite graphs. In this paper, by employing a Coulson-Jacobs-type formula and certain spectral radius results for connected graphs, we completely resolve this conjecture. Furthermore, we establish that the equality condition in the inequality \( \mathcal{E}_p(G) \geq \mathcal{E}_p(S_n) \) holds if and only if \( G \) is \( S_n \).</description>

      <title>Containers with non-uniform co-degree conditions, and an application to nearly orthogonal sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a variant of the hypergraph container lemma with non-uniform conditions on the co-degrees. In particular, an upper bound on the co-degree of some subset of vertices $T$ is allowed to depend on where the vertices in $T$ live in the hypergraph, rather than having one condition which holds for all subsets. We use this to extend recent results on nearly-orthogonal sets in $\mathbb{F}_p^d$. For a field $\mathbb{F}$ and integers $d, k$ and $\ell$, a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}^d$ is called $(k,\ell)$-nearly orthogonal if all vectors in $A$ are non-self-orthogonal and every $k+1$ vectors in $A$ contain $\ell + 1$ pairwise orthogonal vectors. Recently, Haviv, Mattheus, Milojevi\'{c} and Wigderson have improved the lower bound on nearly orthogonal sets over finite fields, using counting arguments and a hypergraph container lemma. They showed that for every prime $p$ and an integer $\ell$, there is a constant $\delta(p,\ell)$ such that for every field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p$ and for all integers $d \geq k \geq \ell + 1$, $\mathbb{F}^d$ contains a $(k,\ell)$-nearly orthogonal set of size $d^{\delta k / \log k}$. This nearly matches an upper bound $\binom{d+k}{k}$ coming from Ramsey theory. Moreover, they proved the same lower bound for the size of a largest set $A$ where for any two subsets of $A$ of size $k+1$ each, there is a vector in one of the subsets orthogonal to a vector in the other one. We prove a common generalisation of this result, showing that essentially the same lower bound holds for the size of a largest set $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}^d$ with the stronger property that given any family of subsets $A_1, \ldots, A_{\ell+1} \subseteq A$, each of size $k+1$, we can find a vector in each $A_i$ such that they are all pairwise orthogonal.</description>

Abstract: An upward (resp. downward) digitally convex word is a binary word that best approximates from below (resp. from above) an upward (resp. downward) convex curve in the plane. We study these words from the combinatorial point of view, formalizing their geometric properties and highlighting connections with Christoffel words and finite Sturmian words. In particular, we study from the combinatorial perspective the operations of inflation and deflation on digitally convex words.</description>

Abstract: In arXiv:2301.02177, Crew, Pechenik, and Spirkl defined the Kromatic symmetric function $\overline{X}_G$ as a $K$-analogue of Stanley's chromatic symmetric function $X_G$, and one question they asked was how $\overline{X}_G$ expands in their $\overline{p}_\lambda$ basis, which they defined as a $K$-analogue of the classic power sum basis $p_\lambda.$ In arXiv:2408.01395, we gave a formula that partially answered this question but did not explain the combinatorial significance of the coefficients. Here, we give combinatorial descriptions for the $\overline{p}$-coefficients of $\overline{X}_G$ and $\omega(\overline{X}_G)$, lifting the $p$-expansion of $X_G$ in terms of acyclic orientations that was given by Bernardi and Nadeau in arXiv:1904.01262. We also propose an alternative $K$-analogue $\overline{p}'$ of the $p$-basis that gives slightly cleaner expansion formulas. Our expansions are based on Lyndon heaps, introduced by Lalonde (1995), which are representatives for certain equivalence classes of acyclic orientations on clan graphs of $G$. Additionally, we show that knowing $\overline{X}_G$ is equivalent to knowing the multiset of independence polynomials of induced subgraphs of $G$, which gives shorter proofs of all our results from arXiv:2403.15929 that $\overline{X}_G$ can be used to determine the number of copies in $G$ of certain induced subgraphs. We also give power sum expansions for the Kromatic quasisymmetric function $\overline{X}_G(q)$ defined by Marberg in arXiv:2312.16474 in the case where $G$ is the incomparability graph of a unit interval order.</description>

      <title>Positionality of Dumont--Thomas numeration systems for integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04487</link>

Abstract: Introduced in 2001 by Lecomte and Rigo, abstract numeration systems provide a way of expressing natural numbers with words from a language $L$ accepted by a finite automaton. As it turns out, these numeration systems are not necessarily positional, i.e., we cannot always find a sequence $U=(U_i)_{i\ge 0}$ of integers such that the value of every word in the language $L$ is determined by the position of its letters and the first few values of $U$. Finding the conditions under which an abstract numeration system is positional seems difficult in general. In this paper, we thus consider this question for a particular sub-family of abstract numeration systems called Dumont--Thomas numeration systems. They are derived from substitutions and were introduced in 1989 by Dumont and Thomas. We exhibit conditions on the underlying substitution so that the corresponding Dumont--Thomas numeration is positional. We first work in the most general setting, then particularize our results to some practical cases. Finally, we link our numeration systems to existing literature, notably properties studied by R\'{e}nyi in 1957, Parry in 1960, Bertrand-Mathis in 1989, and Fabre in 1995.</description>

      <title>On the one-dimensional extensions of $q$-matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In classical matroid theory, extensions are the inverse operation of restrictions for matroids. In particular, extensions to a ground set with one additional element are called single-element extensions. In this paper we introduce a $q$-analogue of single-element extensions for $q$-matroids, which we call one-dimensional extensions. To enumerate such extensions, we establish a $q$-analogue of modular cuts and define a certain function which we call a modular cut selector. It assigns each newly appearing one-dimensional subspace to a modular cut. By using these notion, we establish the one-to-one correspondence between one-dimensional extensions and modular cut selectors. As an application, we develop a classification algorithm for $q$-matroids. Furthermore, by computation, we classify all the $q$-matroids on ground spaces over $\mathbb{F}_2$ of dimension $4$.</description>

      <title>Homotopy groups and quantitative Sperner-type lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.08715v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of Sperner's lemma for a triangulation $T$ of $(m+1)$-discs $D$ whose vertices are colored in $n+2$ colors. A proper coloring of $T$ on the boundary of $D$ determines a simplicial mapping $f:S^m \to S^n$ and the element $x=[f]$ in $\pi_m(S^n)$. For any $x$ in this homotopy group we define a non-negative integer $\mu(x)$. For some cases this invariant can be found explicitly. Namely, if $m=n$ then this number is the Brouwer degree of the mapping $f$. For the case $m=3, n=2$ we found a lower bound for $\mu(x)$, where $x$ is the Hopf invariant, and proved that $\mu(1)=\mu(2)=9$.
  The main result of this paper is the theorem that the number of fully colored $n$-simplexes in $T$ is not less than $\mu([f])$. To prove this theorem we use a generalization of Pontryagin's theorem for manifolds with respect to their boundaries.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for partitions over the Fibonacci numbers and related sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, harkening back to ideas of Hardy and Ramanujan, Mahler and de Bruijn, with the addition of more recent results on the Fibonacci Dirichlet series, we determine the asymptotic number of ways $p_F(n)$ to write an integer as the sum of non-distinct Fibonacci numbers. This appears to be the first such asymptotic result concerning non-distinct partitions over Fibonacci numbers. As well, under weak conditions, we prove analogous results for a general linear recurrences.</description>

      <title>On the module of derivations of a line arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To each multiple point $p$ in a line arrangement $\mathcal A$ in the complex projective plane we associate a derivation $\tilde D_p \in D_0( \mathcal A)$. We show first that these derivations span a large subspace of $D_0(\mathcal A)$. To each such derivation $\tilde D_p \in D_0(\mathcal A)$ we associate a polynomial $g_p$ which seems to play a key role in the characterization of the freeness of $\mathcal A$, as well as in the study of the position of the multiple points of $\mathcal A$ with respect to unions of lines.</description>

      <title>A conjecture on monomial realizations and polyhedral realizations for crystal bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystal bases are powerful combinatorial tools in the representation theory of quantum groups $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ for a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras $\mathfrak{g}$. The polyhedral realizations are combinatorial descriptions of the crystal base $B(\infty)$ for Verma modules in terms of the set of integer points of a polyhedral cone, which equals the string cone when $\mathfrak{g}$ is finite dimensional simple. It is a fundamental and natural problem to find explicit forms of the polyhedral cone. The monomial realization expresses crystal bases $B(\lambda)$ of integrable highest weight representations as Laurent monomials with double indexed variables. In this paper, we give a conjecture between explicit forms of the polyhedral cones and monomial realizations. We prove the conjecture is true when $\mathfrak{g}$ is a classical Lie algebra, a rank $2$ Kac-Moody algebra or a classical affine Lie algebra.</description>
