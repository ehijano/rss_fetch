      <title>Atomic Transition Probabilities for UV and Optical Lines of Tm II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report new branching fraction measurements for 224 ultraviolet (UV) and optical transitions of Tm II. These transitions range in wavelength (wavenumber) from 2350 - 6417 Angstroms (42532 - 15579 cm-1) and originate in 13 odd-parity and 24 even-parity upper levels. Thirty-five of the 37 levels, accounting for 213 of the 224 transitions, are studied for the first time. Branching fractions are determined for two levels studied previously for comparison to earlier results. The levels studied for the first time are high-lying, ranging in energy from 35753 - 54989 cm-1. The branching fractions are determined from emission spectra from two different high-resolution spectrometers. These are combined with radiative lifetimes reported in an earlier study to produce a set of transition probabilities and log(gf) values with accuracy ranging from 5 - 30%. Comparison is made to experimental and theoretical transition probabilities from the literature where such data exist. These new log(gf) values are used to derive an abundance from one previously unused Tm II line in the UV spectrum of the r-process-enhanced metal-poor star HD 222925, and this abundance is consistent with previous determinations based on other Tm II lines.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Donor Star Rejuvenation on Common Envelope Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In close binary star systems, common envelope evolution may occur after a previous phase of mass transfer. Some isolated formation channels for double neutron star binaries suggest that the donor of common envelope evolution was the accretor of a previous phase of stable mass transfer. Accretion should substantially alter the structure of the donor, particularly by steepening the density gradient at the core-envelope interface and rejuvenating the star. We study the common envelope evolution of a donor that was the accretor of a previous phase of stable mass transfer and has a rejuvenated structure. We perform 3D hydrodynamics simulations of the common envelope evolution of a 18 $M_\odot$ supergiant with a 1.4 $M_\odot$ companion using rejuvenated and non-rejuvenated 1D stellar models for the donor. We compare the two simulations to characterize the effect of the rejuvenation on the outcome of the common envelope phase and the shape of the ejecta. We find that accounting for a previous phase of mass transfer reduces the duration of the inspiral phase by a factor of two, likely due to the different structure in the outer layers of the donor. In the rejuvenated case, the simulations show more equatorially concentrated and asymmetric ejecta, though both cases display evidence for the formation of a pressure-supported thick circumbinary disk. During the dynamical inspiral phase, the impact of rejuvenation on the unbinding of the envelope is unclear; we find that rejuvenation decreases the amount of unbound mass by 20$\%$ to 40$\%$ depending on the energy criterion used.</description>

      <title>Identification of planetary and proto-planetary nebulae candidates through akari infrared photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilized photometric data from the space telescope AKARI to identify potential planetary nebulae (PNe) and proto-planetary nebulae (PPNe) candidates. Using the colour-colour diagram, we found a region with a high concentration of established PNe and PPNe, comprising about 95% of the objects. Based on this, we identified 67 objects within this region that lack definitive classification in existing literature, suggesting they are promising candidates. We conducted Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) analysis and morphological investigations using imagery from various observatories and satellites. Finally, we present a list of 65 potential PNe and PPNe candidates.</description>

      <title>Stellar flares, superflares and coronal mass ejections -- entering the Big data era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flares, sometimes accompanied by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), are the result of sudden changes in the magnetic field of stars with high energy release through magnetic reconnection, which can be observed across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to the optical range to X-rays. In our observational review, we attempt to collect some fundamental new results, which can largely be linked to the Big data era that has arrived due to the expansion of space photometric observations of the last two decades. We list the different types of stars showing flare activity, their observation strategies, and discuss how their main stellar properties relate to the characteristics of the flares (or even CMEs) they emit. Our goal is to focus, without claiming to be complete, on those results that may in one way or another challenge the "standard" flare model based on the solar paradigm.</description>

      <title>Pulsations of Three Rapidly Oscillating Ap Stars TIC 96315731, TIC 72392575, and TIC 318007796</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the frequencies of three known roAp stars, TIC 96315731, TIC 72392575, and TIC 318007796, using the light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). For TIC 96315731, the rotational and pulsational frequencies are $0.1498360\,\mathrm{d}^{-1}$ and $165.2609\,\mathrm{d}^{-1}$, respectively. In the case of TIC 72392575, the rotational frequency is $0.25551\,\mathrm{d}^{-1}$. We detect a quintuplet of pulsation frequencies with a center frequency of $135.9233\,\mathrm{d}^{-1}$, along with two signals within the second pair of rotational sidelobes of the quintuplet separated by the rotation frequency. These two signals may correspond to the frequencies of a dipole mode. In TIC 318007796, the rotational and pulsational frequencies are $0.2475021\,\mathrm{d}^{-1}$, $192.73995\,\mathrm{d}^{-1}$, and $196.33065\,\mathrm{d}^{-1}$, respectively. Based on the oblique pulsator model, we calculate the rotation inclination $\left( i \right)$ and magnetic obliquity angle $\left( \beta \right)$ for the stars, which provides the geometry of the pulsation modes. Combining the phases of the frequency quintuplets, the pulsation amplitude and phase modulation curves, and the results of spherical harmonic decomposition, we conclude that the pulsation modes of frequency quintuplets in TIC 96315731, TIC 72392575, and TIC 318007796 correspond to distorted dipole mode, distorted quadrupole mode, and distorted dipole mode, respectively.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Empirical Solar Energetic Particle Scaling Relations II. Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. The space radiation environment conditions and the maximum expected coronal mass ejection (CME) speed are being assessed through the investigation of scaling laws between the peak proton flux and fluence of Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events with the speed of the CMEs. Methods. We utilize a complete catalog of SEP events, covering the last ~25 years of CME observations (i.e. 1997 to 2017). We calculate the peak proton fluxes and integrated event fluences for those events reaching an integral energy of up to E&gt; 100 MeV, covering the period of the last ~25 years of CME observations. For a sample of 38 strong SEP events, we first investigate the statistical relations between the recorded peak proton fluxes (IP) and fluences (FP) at a set of integral energies of E &gt;10 MeV, E&gt;30 MeV, E&gt;60 MeV, and E&gt;100 MeV versus the projected CME speed near the Sun (VCME) obtained by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (SOHO/LASCO). Based on the inferred relations, we further calculate the integrated energy dependence of both IP and FP, assuming that they follow an inverse power-law with respect to energy. By making use of simple physical assumptions, we combine our derived scaling laws to estimate the upper limits for VCME, IP, and FP focusing on two cases of known extreme SEP events that occurred on February 23, 1956 (GLE05) and in AD774/775, respectively. Given physical constraints and assumptions, several options for the upper limit VCME, associated with these events, are investigated. Results. A scaling law relating IP and FP to the CME speed as V^{5}CME for CMEs ranging between ~3400-5400 km/s is consistent with values of FP inferred for the cosmogenic nuclide event of AD774/775. At the same time, the upper CME speed that the current Sun can provide possibly falls within an upper limit of VCME &lt;= 5500 km/s.</description>

      <title>The role of meridional flow in the generation of solar/stellar magnetic fields and cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meridional flow is crucial in generating the solar poloidal magnetic field by facilitating the poleward transport of the field from the decayed Bipolar Magnetic Regions (BMRs). As the meridional circulation changes with the stellar rotation rate, the properties of stellar magnetic cycles are expected to be influenced by this flow. In this study, we explore the role of meridional flow in generating magnetic fields in Sun and sun-like stars using STABLE, Surface flux Transport And Babcock-Leighton, dynamo model. We find that a moderate meridional flow increases the polar field by efficiently driving the trailing polarity flux toward the pole, while a strong flow tends to transport both polarities of BMRs poleward, potentially reducing the polar field. Our findings are in perfect agreement with what one can expect from the surface flux transport model. Similarly, the toroidal field initially increases with moderate flow speeds and then decreases after a certain value. This trend is due to the competitive effects of shearing and diffusion. Furthermore, our study highlights the impact of meridional flow on the cycle strength and duration in stellar cycles. By including the meridional flow from a mean-field hydrodynamics model in STABLE, we show that the magnetic field strength initially increases with the stellar rotation rate and then declines in rapidly rotating stars, offering an explanation of the observed variation of stellar magnetic field with rotation rate.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature equations of state of compact stars with hyperons: three-dimensional tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00484v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct tables of finite temperature equation of state (EoS) of hypernuclear matter in the range of densities, temperatures, and electron fractions that are needed for numerical simulations of supernovas, proto-neutron stars, and binary neutron star mergers and cast them in the format of {\sc CompOSE} database. The tables are extracted from a model that is based on covariant density functional (CDF) theory that includes the full $J^P=1/2^+$ baryon octet in a manner that is consistent with the current astrophysical and nuclear constraints. We employ a parameterization with three different values of the slope of the symmetry energy $L_{\rm sym}=30$, 50 and 70 MeV and fixed skewness $Q_{\rm sat}= 400$ MeV for above saturation matter. A model for the EoS of inhomogeneous matter is matched at sub-saturation density to the high-density hypernuclear EoS. We discuss the generic features of the resulting EoS and the composition of matter as a function of density, temperature, and electron fraction. The nuclear characteristics and strangeness fraction of these models are compared to the alternatives from the literature. The integral properties of static and rapidly rotating compact stars in the limit of zero temperature are discussed and confronted with the multimessenger astrophysical constraints.</description>

      <title>Exoplanets Across Galactic Stellar Populations with PLATO: Estimating Exoplanet Yields Around FGK Stars for the Thin Disk, Thick Disk and Stellar Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to assess the potential of the upcoming PLATO mission to investigate exoplanet populations around stars in diverse Galactic environments, specifically focusing on the Milky Way thin disk, thick disk, and stellar halo. We aim to quantify PLATOs ability to detect planets in each environment and determine how these observations could constrain planet formation models. Beginning from the all-sky PLATO Input Catalog, we kinematically classify the 2.4 million FGK stars into their respective Galactic components. For the sub-sample of stars in the long-observation LOPS2 and LOPN1 PLATO fields, we estimate planet occurrence rates using the New Generation Planet Population Synthesis (NGPPS) dataset. Combining these estimates with a PLATO detection efficiency model, we predicted the expected planet yields for each Galactic environment during a nominal 2+2 year mission. Based on our analysis, PLATO is likely to detect at least 400 exoplanets around the alpha-enriched thick disk stars. The majority of those planets are expected to be Super-Earths and Sub-Neptunes with radii between 2 and 10 Earth radii and orbital periods between 2 and 50 days, ideal for studying the link between the radius valley and stellar chemistry. For the metal-poor halo, PLATO is likely to detect between 1 and 80 planets with periods between 10 and 50 days, depending on the potential existence of a metallicity threshold for planet formation. The PLATO fields contain more than 3,400 potential target stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -0.6, which will help to improve our understanding of planets around metal-poor stars. We identify a specific target list of 47 (kinematically classified) halo stars in the high-priority, high-SNR PLATO P1 sample, offering prime opportunities in the search for planets in metal-poor environments.</description>

      <title>Combined Gemini-South and HST photometric analysis of the globular cluster NGC 6558. The age of the metal-poor population of the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NGC~6558 is a low-galactic latitude globular cluster projected in the direction of the Galactic bulge. Due to high reddening, this region presents challenges in deriving accurate parameters, which require meticulous photometric analysis. We present a combined analysis of near-infrared and optical photometry from multi-epoch high-resolution images collected with Gemini-South/GSAOI+GeMS (in the $J$ and $K_S$ filters) and HST/ACS (in the F606W and F814W filters). We aim to refine the fundamental parameters of NGC~6558, utilizing high-quality Gemini-South/GSAOI and HST/ACS photometries. Additionally, we intend to investigate its role in the formation of the Galactic bulge. We studied the impact of two differential reddening corrections on the age derivation. When removing as much as possible the Galactic bulge field star contamination, the isochrone fitting combined with synthetic colour-magnitude diagrams gives a distance of $8.41^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ kpc, an age of $13.0\pm 0.9$ Gyr, a reddening of E($B-V$)$\,\,=0.34\pm0.02$, and a total-to-selective coefficient R$_V = 3.2\pm0.2$ thanks to the simultaneous near-infrared$-$Optical synthetic colour-magnitude diagram fitting. The orbital parameters showed that NGC~6558 is confined whitin the inner Galaxy and it is not compatible with a bar-shape orbit, indicating that it is a bulge member. The old age of NGC~6558, combined with similar metallicity and a blue horizontal branch in the Galactic bulge, indicates that it is part of the moderately metal-poor globular clusters. Assembling the old and moderately metal-poor ([Fe/H]$\,\,\sim-1.1$) clusters in the Galactic bulge, we derived their age-metallicity relation with star formation stars at $13.6\pm0.2$ Gyr and effective yields of $\rho=0.007\pm0.009\,\, Z_\odot$ showing a chemical enrichment ten times faster than the ex-situ globular clusters branch.</description>

      <title>Toward Exoplanet Transit Spectroscopy Using JWST/MIRI's Medium Resolution Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)'s Medium Resolution Spectrometer (the MRS) on JWST has potentially important advantages for transit and eclipse spectroscopy of exoplanets, including lack of saturation for bright host stars, wavelength span to longward of 20 microns, and JWST's highest spectral resolving power. We here test the performance of the MRS for time series spectroscopy by observing the secondary eclipse of the bright stellar eclipsing binary R Canis Majoris. Our observations push the MRS into saturation at the shortest wavelength, more than for any currently known exoplanet system. We find strong charge migration between pixels that we mitigate using a custom data analysis pipeline. Our data analysis recovers much of the spatial charge migration by combining detector pixels at the group level, via weighting by the point spread function. We achieve nearly photon-limited performance in time series data at wavelengths longward of 5.2 microns. In 2017, Snellen et al. suggested that the MRS could be used to detect carbon dioxide absorption from the atmosphere of the temperate planet orbiting Proxima Centauri. We infer that the relative spectral response of the MRS versus wavelength is sufficiently stable to make that detection feasible. As regards the secondary eclipse of this Algol-type binary, we measure the eclipse depth by summing our spectra over the wavelengths in four channels, and also measuring the eclipse depth as observed by TESS. Those eclipse depths require a temperature for the secondary star that is significantly hotter than previous observations in the optical to near-IR, probably due to irradiation by the primary star. At full spectral resolution of the MRS, we find atomic hydrogen recombination emission lines in the secondary star, from principal quantum levels n = 7, 8, 10, and 14.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Molecules: The Underprediction of CO$_2$ and Overprediction of PH$_3$ in Late T and Y Dwarf Atmospheric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity and spectral coverage of JWST is enabling us to test our assumptions of ultracool dwarf atmospheric chemistry, especially with regards to the abundances of phosphine (PH$_3$) and carbon dioxide (CO$_2$). In this paper, we use NIRSpec PRISM spectra ($\sim$0.8$-$5.5 $\mu$m, $R\sim$100) of four late T and Y dwarfs to show that standard substellar atmosphere models have difficulty replicating the 4.1$-$4.4 $\mu$m wavelength range as they predict an overabundance of phosphine and an underabundance of carbon dioxide. To help quantify this discrepancy, we generate a grid of models using PICASO based on the Elf Owl chemical and temperature profiles where we include the abundances of these two molecules as parameters. The fits to these PICASO models show a consistent preference for orders of magnitude higher CO$_2$ abundances and a reduction in PH$_3$ abundance as compared to the nominal models. This tendency means that the claimed phosphine detection in UNCOVER$-$BD$-$3 could instead be explained by a CO$_2$ abundance in excess of standard atmospheric model predictions; however the signal-to-noise of the spectrum is not high enough to discriminate between these cases. We discuss atmospheric mechanisms that could explain the observed underabundance of PH$_3$ and overabundance of CO$_2$, including a vertical eddy diffusion coefficient ($K_{\mathrm{zz}}$) that varies with altitude, incorrect chemical pathways, or elements condensing out in forms such as NH$_4$H$_2$PO$_4$. However, our favored explanation for the required CO$_2$ enhancement is that the quench approximation does not accurately predict the CO$_2$ abundance, as CO$_2$ remains in chemical equilibrium with CO after CO quenches.</description>

      <title>Pair-instability evolution and explosions in massive stars</title>

Abstract: Very massive stars are radiation pressure dominated. Before running out of viable nuclear fuel, they can reach a thermodynamic state where electron-positron pair-production robs them of radiation support, triggering their collapse. Thermonuclear explosion(s) in the core ensue. These have long been predicted to result in either repeated episodic mass loss (pulsational pair instability), which reduces the mass available to eventually form a black hole, or, if sufficient energy is generated, the complete unbinding of all stellar material in one single explosive episode (pair instability supernova), which leaves behind no black hole. Despite theoretical agreement among modelers, the wide variety of predicted signatures and the rarity of very high-mass stellar progenitors have so far resulted in a lack of observational confirmation. Nevertheless, because of the impact of pair instability evolution on black hole masses relevant to gravitational-wave astronomy, as well as the present and upcoming expanded capabilities of time-domain astronomy and high redshift spectroscopy, interest in these explosion remains high. We review the current understanding of pair instability evolution, with particular emphasis on the known uncertainties. We also summarize the existing claimed electromagnetic counterparts and discuss prospects for future direct and indirect searches.</description>

      <title>An alternative model for the orbital decay of M82 X-2: the anomalous magnetic braking of a Bp star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the first pulsating ultraluminous X-ray source M82 X-2 was reported to be experiencing a rapid orbital decay at a rate of $\dot{P}=-(5.69\pm0.24)\times 10^{-8}~\rm s\,s^{-1}$ based on seven years \emph{NuSTAR} data. To account for the observed orbital-period derivative, it requires a mass transfer rate of $\sim200\dot{M}_{\rm edd}$ ($\dot{M}_{\rm edd}$ is the Eddington accretion rate) from the donor star to the accreting neutron star. However, other potential models cannot be completely excluded. In this work, we propose an anomalous magnetic braking (AMB) model to interpret the detected orbital decay of M82 X-2. If the donor star is an Ap/Bp star with an anomalously strong magnetic field, the magnetic coupling between strong surface magnetic field and irradiation-driven wind from the surface of the donor star could cause an efficient angular-momentum loss, driving a rapid orbital decay observed in M82 X-2. The AMB mechanism of an Ap/Bp star with a mass of $5.0-15.0~M_{\odot}$ and a surface magnetic field of $3000-4500~\rm G$ could produce the observed $\dot{P}$ of M82 X-2. We also discuss the possibility of other alternative models including the companion star expansion and a surrounding circumbinary disk.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation of Dense Rotation-Dominated Structures Fed by Collapsing Gravomagneto-Sheetlets and Origin of Misaligned 100 au-Scale Binaries and Multiple Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The majority of stars are in binary/multiple systems. How such systems form in turbulent, magnetized cores of molecular clouds in the presence of non-ideal MHD effects remains relatively under-explored. Through ATHENA++-based non-ideal MHD AMR simulations with ambipolar diffusion, we show that the collapsing protostellar envelope is dominated by dense gravo-magneto-sheetlets, a turbulence-warped version of the classic pseudodisk produced by anisotropic magnetic resistance to the gravitational collapse, in agreement with previous simulations of turbulent, magnetized single-star formation. The sheetlets feed mass, magnetic fields, and angular momentum to a Dense ROtation-Dominated (DROD) structure, which fragments into binary/multiple systems. This DROD fragmentation scenario is a more dynamic variant of the traditional disk fragmentation scenario for binary/multiple formation, with dense spiral filaments created by inhomogeneous feeding from the highly structured larger-scale sheetlets rather than the need for angular momentum transport, which is dominated by magnetic braking. Provided that the local material is sufficiently demagnetized, with a plasma-$\beta$ of 10 or more, collisions between the dense spiraling filaments play a key role in facilitating gravitational collapse and stellar companion formation by pushing the local magnetic Toomre parameter $Q_\mathrm{m}$ below unity. This mechanism can naturally produce {\it in situ} misaligned systems on the 100-au scale, often detected with high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. Our simulations also highlight the importance of non-ideal MHD effects, which affect whether fragmentation occurs and, if so, the masses and orbital parameters of the stellar companions formed.</description>

      <title>Short-period Heartbeat Binaries from TESS Full-Frame Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify $240$ short-period ($P \lesssim 10$ days) binary systems in the TESS data, $180$ of which are heartbeat binaries (HB). The sample is mostly a mix of A and B-type stars and primarily includes eclipsing systems, where over $30\%$ of the sources with primary and secondary eclipses show a secular change in their inter-eclipse timings and relative eclipse depths over a multi-year timescale, likely due to orbital precession. The orbital parameters of the population are estimated by fitting a heartbeat model to their phase curves and Gaia magnitudes, where the model accounts for ellipsoidal variability, Doppler beaming, reflection effects, and eclipses. We construct the sample's period-eccentricity distribution and find an eccentricity cutoff (where $e \rightarrow 0$) at a period $1.7$ days. Additionally, we measure the periastron advance rate for the $12$ of the precessing sources and find that they all exhibit prograde apsidal precession, which is as high as $9^{\circ}$ yr$^{-1}$ for one of the systems. Using the inferred stellar parameters, we estimate the general relativistic precession rate of the argument of periastron for the population and expect over $30$ systems to show a precession in excess of $0.3^{\circ}$ yr$^{-1}$</description>

      <title>Cluster Population Demographics in NGC 628 Derived from Stochastic Population Synthesis Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05912v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physical properties of star cluster populations offer valuable insights into their birth, evolution, and disruption. However, individual stars in clusters beyond the nearest neighbours of the Milky Way are unresolved, forcing analyses of star cluster demographics to rely on integrated light, a process fraught with uncertainty. Here we infer the demographics of the cluster population in the benchmark galaxy NGC 628 using data from the Legacy Extra-galactic UV Survey (LEGUS) coupled to a novel Bayesian forward-modelling technique. Our method analyzes all 1178 clusters in the LEGUS catalogue, $\sim4$ times more than prior studies severely affected by completeness cuts. Our results indicate that the cluster mass function is either significantly steeper than the commonly-observed slope of $-2$ or is truncated at $\approx 10^{4.5}$ M$_\odot$; the latter possibility is consistent with proposed relations between truncation mass and star formation surface density. We find that cluster disruption is relatively mild for the first $\approx 200$ Myr of cluster evolution; no evidence for mass-dependent disruption is found. We find suggestive but not incontrovertible evidence that inner galaxy clusters may be more prone to disruption and outer galaxy clusters have a more truncated mass function, but confirming or refuting these findings will require larger samples from future observations of outer galaxy clusters. Finally, we find that current stellar track and atmosphere models, along with common forms for cluster mass and age distributions, cannot fully capture all features in the multidimensional photometric distribution of star clusters. While our forward-modelling approach outperforms earlier backward-modeling approaches, some systematic differences persist between observed and modelled photometric distributions.</description>

      <title>Toward Robust Corrections for Stellar Contamination in JWST Exoplanet Transmission Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy is still the preferred characterization technique for exoplanet atmospheres, although it presents unique challenges that translate into characterization bottlenecks when robust mitigation strategies are missing. Stellar contamination is one such challenge that can overpower the planetary signal by up to an order of magnitude, and thus not accounting for it can lead to significant biases in the derived atmospheric properties. Yet this accounting may not be straightforward, as important discrepancies exist between state-of-the-art stellar models and measured spectra and between models themselves. Here we explore the extent to which stellar models can be used to reliably correct for stellar contamination and yield a planet's uncontaminated transmission spectrum. We find that discrepancies between stellar models can significantly contribute to the noise budget of JWST transmission spectra of planets around stars with heterogeneous photospheres, the true number of unique photospheric spectral components and their properties can only be accurately retrieved when the stellar models have sufficient fidelity, and under such optimistic circumstances the contribution of stellar contamination to the noise budget of a transmission spectrum is considerably below that of the photon noise for the standard transit observation setup. Therefore, we advocate for further development of model spectra of stars and their active regions in a data-driven manner, empirical approaches for deriving spectra of photospheric components using the observatories with which the atmospheric explorations are carried out, and analysis techniques accounting for multimodal posterior distributions for photospheric parameters of interest, which will be increasingly revealed by precise JWST measurements.</description>

      <title>A roadmap for the atmospheric characterization of terrestrial exoplanets with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15895v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-cool dwarf stars are abundant, long-lived, and uniquely suited to enable the atmospheric study of transiting terrestrial companions with JWST. Amongst them, the most prominent is the M8.5V star TRAPPIST-1 and its seven planets. While JWST Cycle 1 observations have started to yield preliminary insights into the planets, they have also revealed that their atmospheric exploration requires a better understanding of their host star. Here, we propose a roadmap to characterize the TRAPPIST-1 system -- and others like it -- in an efficient and robust manner. We notably recommend that -- although more challenging to schedule -- multi-transit windows be prioritized to mitigate the effects of stellar activity and gather up to twice more transits per JWST hour spent. We conclude that, for such systems, planets cannot be studied in isolation by small programs, but rather need large-scale, jointly space- and ground-based initiatives to fully exploit the capabilities of JWST for the exploration of terrestrial planets.</description>

      <title>True Pair-instability Supernova Descendant: Implications for the First Stars' Mass Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The initial mass function (IMF) of the first Pop III stars remains a persistent mystery. Their predicted massive nature implies the existence of stars exploding as pair-instability supernovae (PISN), but no observational evidence had been found. Now, the LAMOST survey claims to have discovered a pure PISN descendant, J1010+2358, at ${\rm [Fe/H]}= -2.4$. Here we confirm that a massive 250-260 ${\rm M_\odot}$ PISN is needed to reproduce the abundance pattern of J1010+2358. However, the PISN contribution can be as low as 10%, since key elements are missing to discriminate between scenarios. We investigate the implications of this discovery for the Pop III IMF, by statistical comparison with the predictions of our cosmological galaxy formation model, NEFERTITI. First, we show that the non-detection of mono-enriched PISN descendants at ${\rm [Fe/H]}&lt;-2.5$ allows us to exclude: (i) a flat IMF at a 90% confidence level; and (ii) a Larson type IMF with characteristic mass $m_{\rm ch}/{\rm M_\odot} &gt; 191.16x - 132.44$, where x is the slope, at a 75% confidence level. Secondly, we show that if J1010+2358 has only inherited &lt;70% of its metals from a massive PISN, no further constraints can be put on the Pop III IMF. If, instead, J1010+2358 will be confirmed to be a nearly pure (&gt;90%) PISN descendant, it will offer strong and complementary constraints on the Pop III IMF, excluding the steepest and bottom-heaviest IMFs: $m_{\rm ch}/{\rm M_\odot} &lt; 143.21x - 225.94$. Our work shows that even a single detection of a pure PISN descendant can be crucial to our understanding of the mass distribution of the first stars.</description>

      <title>Well behaved class of Heintzmann's solution within $f(R,\,T)$ framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to develop a well-behaved class of Heintzmann IIa [{\em H. Heintzmann, Z. Physik 228, 489-493 (1969)}] solution in the context of $f(R,\, T)$ gravity. In the $f(R, T)$ framework, the gravitational action includes both the Ricci scalar ($R$) and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor ($T$). We chose a particular $f(R,\,T)$ model s.t. $f(R,\,T) = R+2 \chi T$, where $\chi$ is known as the coupling parameter. This solution describes a novel isotropic compact fluid sphere with positively finite central pressure and density in this extended theory of gravity. The results obtained analytically are better described by graphical representations of the physical parameters for various values of the coupling parameter $\chi$. The solution for a specific compact object, Vela X-1, with radius $\mathfrak{R} = 9.56_{-0.08}^{+0.08}$ km and mass $\mathcal{M} = 1.77 \pm 0.08~\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$ [{\em M. L. Rawls et al. ApJ, 730, 25 (2011)}], is shown here. We analyze the fundamental physical attributes of the star, which reveals the influence of the coupling parameter $\chi$ on the values of substance parameters. This helps us to make a fruitful comparison of this modified $f(R,\, T)$ gravity with the standard GR and notice that it holds good for stable compact objects. In this framework, the star under our consideration exhibits a stable structure consistent with the Heintzmann IIa {\em ansatz}. From all of our obtained graphical and numerical results, we can ultimately conclude that our reported model is physically admissible and satisfies all the physical criteria for an acceptable model.</description>
