      <title>Ground- and Space-Based Dust Observations of VV 191 Overlapping Galaxy Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta$) provides a constraint on attenuation, the cumulative effects of dust grains in the ISM. The ratio is a reliable spectroscopic tool for deriving the dust properties of galaxies that determine many different quantities such as star formation rate, metallicity, and SED models. Here we measure independently both the attenuation and H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ of an occulting galaxy pair: VV 191. Attenuation measurements in the visible spectrum (A$_{V,stars}$) from dust maps derived from the F606W filter of HST and the F090W filter of JWST are matched with spaxel-by-spaxel H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ observations from the George and Cynthia Mitchell Spectrograph (GCMS) of the McDonald Observatory. The 0.5 to 0.7 micron bandpass covers the Balmer lines for VV 191. The dust maps of JWST and HST provide the high sensitivity necessary for comparisons and tracking trends of the geometrically favorable galaxy. We present maps and plots of the Balmer lines for the VV 191 galaxy pair and for a specific region highlighting dust lanes for VV 191b in the overlap region. We compute A$_{V, HII}$ from H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ and plot both quantities against A$_{V, stars}$. Our results show that regions with higher dust content, residing closer to the spiral center, dominate ionized gas attenuation, leading to an overestimation of A$_{V, HII}$ by a factor or 2. Further out in the spiral arms, the lower dust content leads to more agreement between the attenuations, indicating lower SFR and larger contribution from older stars to the stellar continuum outside the Petrosian radius.</description>

      <title>Radio-to-Submillimetre Spectral Energy Distributions of NGC 1365</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the radio-to-submillimetre spectral energy distribution (SED) for the central pseudobulge of NGC~1365 using archival data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Very Large Array (VLA). This analysis shows that free-free emission dominates the continuum emission at 50--120~GHz and produces about 75 per cent of the 103~GHz continuum emission. However, the fraction of 103~GHz continuum emission originating from free-free emission varies significantly among different subregions in the pseudobulge, particularly for an outflow from the AGN on the eastern pseudobulge where the synchrotron emission produces half of the 103~GHz continuum emission. Free-free emission also dominates at 103~GHz within the central 400 pc diameter region, but this emission is associated with the AGN rather than star formation. The star formation rate (SFR) within the pseudobulge derived from the ALMA free-free emission is $8.9 \pm 1.1$~M$_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$. This is comparable to the SFR from the mid-infrared emission but higher than the SFR from the extinction-corrected H$\alpha$ line emission, mainly because the pseudobulge is heavily dust obscured. The 1.5 GHz emission yields a comparable SFR for the pseudobulge but may have lower SFRs within subregions of the pseudobulge because of the diffusion outside of these regions of the electrons producing the synchrotron radiation. We propose that applying a correction factor of 75 per cent to the 80--110~GHz continuum emission could provide valuable estimates of the free-free emission without performing any SED decomposition, which could derive extinction-free SFRs within 20 per cent accuracy.</description>

      <title>A mock redshift catalogue of the dusty star-forming galaxy population with intrinsic clustering and lensing for deep millimetre surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new cosmologically motivated mock redshift survey of the Dusty Star-Forming Galaxy population. Our mock survey is based on the Bolshoi-Planck dark-matter halo simulation and covers an area of 5.3 sq. degree. Using a semi-empirical approach, we generate a light cone and populate the dark-matter haloes with galaxies. Infrared properties are assigned to the galaxies based on theoretical and empirical relations from the literature. Additionally, background galaxies are gravitationally lensed by dark-matter haloes along the line-of-sight assuming a point-mass model approximation. We characterize the mock survey by measuring the star formation rate density, integrated number counts, redshift distribution, and infrared luminosity function. When compared with single-dish and interferometric observations, the predictions from our mock survey closely follow the compiled results from the literature. We have also directed this study towards characterizing one of the extragalactic legacy surveys to be observed with the TolTEC camera at the Large Millimeter Telescope: the 0.8 sq. degree Ultra Deep Survey, with expected depths of 0.025, 0.018 and 0.012 mJy beam$^{-1}$ at 1.1, 1.4 and 2.0 mm. Exploiting the clustering information in our mock survey, we investigate its impact on the effect of flux boosting by the fainter population of dusty galaxies, finding that clustering can increase the median boosting by 0.5 per cent at 1.1 mm, 0.8 per cent at 1.4 mm and, 2.0 per cent at 2.0 mm, and with higher dispersion.</description>

      <title>Prototype Faraday rotation measure catalogs from the Polarisation Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM) pilot observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Polarisation Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM) will conduct a sensitive $\sim$1 GHz radio polarization survey covering 20 000 square degrees of the Southern sky with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). In anticipation of the full survey, we analyze pilot observations of low-band (800-1087 MHz), mid-band (1316-1439 MHz), and combined-band observations for an extragalactic field and a Galactic-plane field (low-band only). Using the POSSUM processing pipeline, we produce prototype RM catalogs that are filtered to construct prototype RM grids. We assess typical RM grid densities and RM uncertainties and their dependence on frequency, bandwidth, and Galactic latitude. We present a median filter method for separating foreground diffuse emission from background components, and find that after application of the filter, 99.5% of measured RMs of simulated sources are within 3$\sigma$ of their true RM, with a typical loss of polarized intensity of 5% $\pm$ 5%. We find RM grid densities of 35.1, 30.6, 37.2, and 13.5 RMs per square degree and median uncertainties on RM measurements of 1.55, 12.82, 1.06, and 1.89 rad m$^{-2}$ for the median-filtered low-band, mid-band, combined-band, and Galactic observations, respectively. We estimate that the full POSSUM survey will produce an RM catalog of $\sim$775 000 RMs with median-filtered low-band observations and $\sim$877 000 RMs with median-filtered combined-band observations. We construct a structure function from the Galactic RM catalog, which shows a break at $0.7^{\circ}$, corresponding to a physical scale of 12-24 pc for the nearest spiral arm.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Ghostly Remains of an Extremely Diffuse Satellite in the Remote Halo of NGC\,253</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of NGC253-SNFC-dw1, a new satellite galaxy in the remote stellar halo of the Sculptor Group spiral, NGC 253. The system was revealed using deep resolved star photometry obtained as part of the Subaru Near-Field Cosmology Survey that uses the Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope. Although rather luminous ($\rm{M_{V}} = -11.7 \pm 0.2$) and massive ($M_* \sim 1.25\times 10^7~\rm{M}_{\odot}$), the system is one of the most diffuse satellites yet known, with a half-light radius of $\rm{R_{h}} = 3.37 \pm 0.36$ kpc and an average surface brightness of $\sim 30.1$ mag arcmin$^{-2}$ within the $\rm{R_{h}}$. The colour-magnitude diagram shows a dominant old ($\sim 10$ Gyr) and metal-poor ($\rm{[M/H]}=-1.5 \pm 0.1$ dex) stellar population, as well as several candidate thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch stars. The distribution of red giant branch stars is asymmetrical and displays two elongated tidal extensions pointing towards NGC 253, suggestive of a highly disrupted system being observed at apocenter. NGC253-SNFC-dw1 has a size comparable to that of the puzzling Local Group dwarfs Andromeda XIX and Antlia 2 but is two magnitudes brighter. While unambiguous evidence of tidal disruption in these systems has not yet been demonstrated, the morphology of NGC253-SNFC-dw1 clearly shows that this is a natural path to produce such diffuse and extended galaxies. The surprising discovery of this system in a previously well-searched region of the sky emphasizes the importance of surface brightness limiting depth in satellite searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio galaxies in clusters of galaxies are prominent reservoirs of magnetic fields and of non-thermal particles, which get mixed with the intracluster medium. We review the observational and theoretical knowledge of the role of these crucial ingredients for the formation of diffuse radio emission in clusters (radio halos, relics, mini halos) and outline the open questions in this field.</description>

      <title>The mass-metallicity and fundamental metallicity relations in non-AGN and AGN-host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies' stellar masses, gas-phase oxygen abundances (metallicity), and star formation rates (SFRs) obey a series of empirical correlations, most notably the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and fundamental metallicity relation (FZR), which relates oxygen abundance to a combination of stellar mass and SFR. However, due to the difficulty of measuring oxygen abundances and SFRs in galaxies that host powerful active galactic nuclei (AGN), to date it is unknown to what extent AGN-host galaxies also follow these correlations. In this work, we apply Bayesian methods to the MaNGA integral field spectrographic (IFS) survey that allow us to measure oxygen abundances and SFRs in AGN hosts, and use these measurements to explore how the MZR and FZR differ between galaxies that do and do not host AGN. We find similar MZRs at stellar masses above $10^{10.5} \mathrm{M}_\odot$, but that at lower stellar masses AGN hosts show up to $\sim 0.2$ dex higher oxygen abundances. The offset in the FZR is significantly smaller, suggesting that the larger deviation in the MZR is a result of AGN-host galaxies having systematically lower SFRs at fixed stellar mass. However, within the AGN-host sample there is little correlation between SFR and oxygen abundance. These findings support a scenario in which an AGN can halt efficient gas accretion, which drives non-AGN host galaxies to both higher SFR and lower oxygen abundance, resulting in the galaxy evolving off the star-forming main sequence (SFMS). As a consequence, as the SFR declines for an individual system its metallicity remains mostly unchanged.</description>

      <title>Glimmers in the Cosmic Dawn: A Census of the Youngest Supermassive Black Holes by Photometric Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report first results from a deep near infrared campaign with the Hubble Space Telescope to obtain late-epoch images of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF), 10-15 years after the first epoch data were obtained. The main objectives are to search for faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshifts by virtue of their photometric variability, and measure (or constrain) the comoving number density of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), n_SMBH, at early times. In this Letter we present a brief overview of the program and preliminary results regarding eight objects. Three variables are supernovae, two of which are apparently hostless with indeterminable redshifts, although one has previously been recorded at a z\approx 6 galaxy. Two further objects are clear AGN candidates at z=2.0 and 3.2, based on morphology and/or spectroscopy, in particular infrared spectroscopy from JWST. Three variable targets are identified at z=6-7, which are also likely AGN candidates. These sources provide a first measure of n_SMBH in the reionization epoch by photometric variability, which places a firm lower limit of 3x10^{-4} cMpc^{-3}. After accounting for variability and luminosity incompleteness, we estimate n_SMBH \gtrsim 8x10^{-3} cMpc^{-3}, which is the largest value so far reported at these redshifts. This SMBH abundance is also strikingly similar to estimates of n_SMBH in the local Universe. We discuss how these results test various theories for SMBH formation.</description>

      <title>The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). III. A Catalog of Surface Brightness Fluctuation Distances and the Three-Dimensional Distribution of Galaxies in the Virgo Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) method is a robust and efficient way of measuring distances to galaxies containing evolved stellar populations. Although many recent applications of the method have used space-based imaging, SBF remains a powerful technique for ground-based telescopes. Deep, wide-field imaging surveys with subarsecond seeing enable SBF measurements for numerous nearby galaxies. Using a preliminary calibration, Cantiello et al. (2018) presented SBF distances for 89 bright, mainly early-type galaxies observed in the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). Here, we present a refined calibration and SBF distances for 278 galaxies extending several magnitudes fainter than in previous work. The derived distances have uncertainties of 5-12\% depending on the properties of the individual galaxies, and our sample is more than three times larger than any previous SBF study of this region. Virgo has a famously complex structure with numerous subclusters, clouds and groups; we associate individual galaxies with the various substructures and map their three-dimensional spatial distribution. Curiously, subcluster A, centered around M87, appears to have two peaks in distance: the main peak at $\sim$16.5 Mpc and a smaller one at $\sim$19.4 Mpc. Subclusters B and C have distances of $\sim$15.8 Mpc. The W and W' groups form a filament-like structure, extending more than 15~Mpc behind the cluster with a commensurate velocity increase of $\sim$1000 \kms\ along its length. These measurements are a valuable resource for future studies of the relationship between galaxy properties and local environment within a dynamic and evolving region.</description>

      <title>The APO-K2 Catalog. II. Accurate Stellar Ages for Red Giant Branch Stars Across the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present stellar age determinations for 4,661 red giant branch (RGB) stars in the APO-K2 Catalog, derived using mass estimates from K2 asteroseismology from the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program and elemental abundances from the Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. Our sample includes 17 of the 19 fields observed by K2, making it one of the most comprehensive catalogs of accurate stellar ages across the Galaxy in terms of the wide range of populations spanned by its stars, enabling rigorous tests of Galactic chemical evolution models. Taking into account the selection functions of the K2 sample, the data appear to support the age-chemistry morphology of stellar populations predicted by both inside-out and late-burst scenarios. We also investigate trends in age versus stellar chemistry and Galactic position, which are consistent with previous findings. Comparisons against APOKASC-3 asteroseismic ages show agreement to within ~3%. We also discuss offsets between our ages and spectroscopic ages. Finally, we note that ignoring the effects of $\alpha$-enhancement on stellar opacity (either directly or with the Salaris metallicity correction) results in an ~10% offset in age estimates for the most $\alpha$-enhanced stars, which is an important consideration for continued tests of Galactic models with this and other asteroseismic age samples.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Lens Light Complexity with A Novel Multi-Gaussian Expansion Approach for Strong Gravitational Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a strong gravitational lensing system, the distorted light from a source is analysed to infer the properties of the lens. However, light emitted by the lens itself can contaminate the image of the source, introducing systematic errors in the analysis. We present a simple and efficient lens light model based on the well-tested multi-Gaussian expansion (MGE) method for representing galaxy surface brightness profiles, which we combine with a semi-linear inversion scheme for pixelized source modelling. Testing it against realistic mock lensing images, we show that our scheme can fit the lensed images to the noise level, with relative differences between the true input and best-fit lens light model remaining below 5%. We apply the MGE lens light model to 38 lenses from the HST SLACS sample. We find that the new scheme provides a good fit for the majority of the sample with only 3 exceptions -- these show clear asymmetric residuals in the lens light. We examine the radial dependence of the ellipticity and position angles and confirm that it is common for a typical lens galaxy to exhibit twisting, non-elliptical isophotes and boxy / disky isophotes. Our MGE lens light model will be a valuable tool for understanding the hidden complexity of the lens mass distribution.</description>

      <title>Bimodal orientation distribution and head-tail asymmetry of a sample of filamentary molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The morphology of molecular clouds is crucial for understanding their origin and evolution. In this work, we investigate the morphology of the filamentary molecular clouds (filaments for short) using a portion of the $^{12}\text{CO} (J=1-0)$ data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project. The data cover an area spanning $104.75^\circ &lt;l&lt; 150.25^\circ , \vert b\vert &lt; 5.25^\circ$ in Galactic coordinates, with $V_\text{LSR}$ ranging from $-95$ to 25 $\text{km s}^{-1}$. Our primary focus is on the orientation and morphological asymmetry of the filaments. To achieve this, we apply several criteria on the data to create a sample of filaments with well-defined straight shape, and we use elliptical fitting to obtain the orientation of each filament, with an estimated error of $\sim1.6^\circ$ for the orientation. We find that the filament orientation with respect to the Galactic plane exhibits a bimodal distribution, a double-Gaussian fitting of which has two centres located at $-38.1^\circ $ and $42.0^\circ $, with 1$\sigma$ of the two Gaussian functions being $35.4^\circ$ and $27.4^\circ$. We do not find significant correlation between the orientation and other parameters, including the Galactic coordinates, radial velocity, velocity width, and physical scale. A considerable fraction of filaments ($\gtrsim 40$ per cent) display head-tail asymmetry, which suggests that mass concentration tends to occur at one end of the filaments.</description>

      <title>Stellar Metallicity of Galaxies: New Insight on the Formation and Evolution of Low Surface Brightness Galaxies in the IllustrisTNG Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the stellar metallicities of low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) and normal high surface brightness galaxies (HSBGs) in the IllustrisTNG100-1 simulation. LSBGs and HSBGs are classified as galaxies with mean central surface brightness $\mu_{\rm r} &gt; 22.0 \ mag \ arcsec^{-2}$ and $\mu_{\rm r} &lt; 22.0 \ mag \ arcsec^{-2}$, respectively. Our findings indicate that both LSBGs and HSBGs exhibit similar number distributions of stellar metallicities at high redshifts ($z&gt;1.5$). However, at low redshifts ($z&lt;1.5$), a clear bimodal distribution of stellar metallicities in galaxies emerges, with LSBGs tending to be more metal-poor than HSBGs. The lower metallicity of LSBGs compared to HSBGs is mostly attributed to the pronounced gradient in the radial distribution of stellar metallicities. The bimodality of stellar metallicity is not attributed to colour distinctions but rather to the slower metal enrichment in LSBGs compared to HSBGs. This suggests that the mechanisms driving metal enrichment in LSBGs differ from those in HSBGs.</description>

      <title>CHANG-ES. XXX. 10 kpc Radio Lobes in The Sombrero Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of the 10 kilo-parsec (kpc) scale radio lobes in the Sombrero galaxy (NGC 4594), using data from the Continuum Halos in Nearby Galaxies - an Expanded Very Large Array (VLA) Survey (CHANG-ES) project. We further examine the balance between the magnetic pressure inside the lobes and the thermal pressure of the ambient hot gas. At the radii $r$ of ~(1-10) kpc, the magnetic pressure inside the lobes and the thermal pressure of the ambient hot gas are generally in balance. This implies that the jets could expand into the surroundings at least to r ~ 10 kpc. The feedback from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet responsible for the large-scale lobes may help to explain the unusually high X-ray luminosity of this massive quiescent isolated disk galaxy, although more theoretical work is needed to further examine this possibility.</description>

      <title>Radial Acceleration Relation of HI-rich Low Surface Brightness Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the radial acceleration relation (RAR) in low surface brightness galaxies selected from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey. We find that the dynamical acceleration $g_{\rm obs}$ and baryonic gravitational acceleration $g_{\rm bar}$ of the HI-rich low surface brightness galaxies still follow the universal RAR of typical late-type galaxies. The universal RAR signifies a consistent correlation between the distribution of baryonic matter and dark matter across galaxies with diverse morphologies and properties. Our findings suggest that the matter distributions in low surface brightness galaxies may indeed resemble that of general late-type galaxies. This implies that low surface brightness galaxies may not originate from dark matter halos with lower densities; instead, they may originate from the dark matter halos with high spins or form through feedback processes.</description>

      <title>A spectacular galactic scale magnetohydrodynamic powered wind in ESO 320-G030</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How galaxies regulate nuclear growth through gas accretion by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is one of the most fundamental questions in galaxy evolution. One potential way to regulate nuclear growth is through a galactic wind that removes gas from the nucleus. It is unclear whether galactic winds are powered by jets, mechanical winds, radiation, or via magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes. Compact obscured nuclei (CONs) represent a significant phase of galactic nuclear growth. These galaxies hide growing SMBHs or unusual starbursts in their very opaque, extremely compact (r $&lt;$ 100 pc) centres. They are found in approximately 30 % of the luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG and ULIRG) population. Here, we present high-resolution ALMA observations ($\sim$30 mas, $\sim$5 pc) of ground-state and vibrationally excited HCN towards ESO 320-G030 (IRAS 11506-3851). ESO 320-G030 is an isolated luminous infrared galaxy known to host a compact obscured nucleus and a kiloparsec-scale molecular wind. Our analysis of these high-resolution observations excludes the possibility of a starburst-driven wind, a mechanically or energy driven active galactic nucleus (AGN) wind, and exposes a molecular MDH wind. These results imply that the nuclear evolution of galaxies and the growth of SMBHs are similar to the growth of hot cores or protostars where gravitational collapse of the nuclear torus drives a MHD wind. These results mean galaxies are capable, in part, of regulating the evolution of their nuclei without feedback.</description>

      <title>A serendipitous discovery of HI-rich galaxy groups with MeerKAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the serendipitous discovery of 49 HI-rich galaxies in a 2.3 hour Open Time observation with MeerKAT. We present their properties including their HI masses, intensity and velocity maps, and spectra. We determine that at least three HI-rich galaxy groups have been detected, potentially as part of a supergroup. Some members of these galaxy groups show clear interaction with each other in their HI emission. We cross-match the detections with PanSTARRS, WISE and GALEX, and obtain stellar masses and star formation rates. One source is found to be a potential OH megamaser, but further follow-up is required to confidently determine this. For 6 sources with sufficient spatial resolution in HI we produce rotation curves with BBarolo, generate mass models, and derive a dark matter halo mass. While the number of galaxies detected in this relatively short pointing appears to be at the high end of expectations compared to other MeerKAT observations and group HIMF studies, this finding highlights the capability of MeerKAT for other serendipitous discoveries, and the potential for many more HI-rich galaxies to be revealed within both existing and upcoming Open Time datasets.</description>

      <title>B-fields And dust in interstelLar fiLAments using Dust POLarization (BALLAD-POL): II. Testing the Radiative Torque Paradigm in Musca and OMC-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization of starlight and thermal dust emission caused by aligned dust grains is a valuable tool to characterize magnetic fields (B-fields) and constrain dust properties. However, the physics of grain alignment is not fully understood. To test the popular paradigm of radiative torque (RAT) theory, including RAT alignment (RAT-A) and disruption (RAT-D), we use dust polarization data observed by {\it Planck} and SOFIA/HAWC+ toward two filaments with contrasting physical conditions: Musca, a quiet filament, and OMC-1, a highly dynamic filament due to feedback. We analyze various relations of the observed polarization fraction, $P$, with gas column density, $\NHt$, dust temperature, $\Td$, and polarization angle dispersion function, $\S$. We found that $P$ decreases with increasing $\S$ and increasing $\NHt$, as expected from RAT-A. On the other hand, the $P-\Td$ relation is more complicated; it is a linear correlation at low $\Td$ but turns into an anti-correlation when $\Td$ reaches a certain high value. Next, we compute the polarization fraction on a pixel-by-pixel with B-fields in the plane of the sky using the DustPOL code based on RAT, incorporate the depolarization effect by B-field tangling using $\S$, and compare the realistic polarization model with observations of Musca and OMC-1. For Musca with well-ordered B-fields, our numerical model reproduces the decline of $P$ toward the filament spine (aka. polarization hole), having high $\NHt$ and low $\Td$, indicating the loss of grain alignment efficiency due to RAT-A. For OMC-1, with stronger B-field variations and higher $\Td$, our model can reproduce the observed $P-\Td$ and $P-N(\rm H_{2})$ relations only if the depolarization effect resulting from B-field tangling and RAT-D effect are taken into account. Our results provide more robust observational evidence for the RAT paradigm, particularly the recently discovered RAT-D.</description>

      <title>The PARADIGM Project I: A Multiscale radio morphological analysis of local U/LIRGS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disentangling the radio flux contribution from star formation (SF) and active-galactic-nuclei (AGN) activity is a long-standing problem in extragalactic astronomy, since at frequencies of $\lesssim$ 10 GHz, both processes emit synchrotron radiation. We present in this work the general objectives of the PARADIGM Project, a multi-instrument concept to explore star-formation and mass assembly of galaxies. We introduce two novel general approaches for a detailed multiscale study of the radio emission in local U/LIRGs. In this work, we use archival interferometric data from the Very Large Array (VLA) centred at ~ 6 GHz (C band) and present new observations from the e-Multi-Element Radio-Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN) for UGC5101, VV705, VV250 and UGC8696. Using our image decomposition methods, we robustly disentangle the radio emission into distinct components by combining information from the two interferometric arrays. We use e-MERLIN as a probe of the core-compact radio emission (AGN or starburst) at ~ 20 pc scales, and as a probe of nuclear diffuse emission, at scales ~ 100 - 200 pc. With VLA, we characterise the source morphology and the flux density on scales from 200 pc up to and above 1 kpc. As a result, we find deconvolved and convolved sizes for nuclear regions from ~ 10 pc to ~ 200 pc. At larger scales, we find sizes of 1.5 - 2 kpc for diffuse structures (with effective sizes of ~ 300 - 400 pc). We demonstrate that the radio emission from nuclear extended structures (~ 100 pc) can dominate over core-compact components, providing a significant fraction of the total multiscale SF output. We establish a multiscale radio tracer for star formation by combining information from different instruments. Consequently, this work sets a starting point to potentially correct for overestimations of AGN fractions and underestimates of SF activity.</description>

      <title>PRODIGE -- Envelope to Disk with NOEMA III. The origin of complex organic molecule emission in SVS13A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) have been found toward low-mass protostars but the origins of the COM emission are still unclear. It can be associated with, for example, hot corinos, outflows, and/or accretion shock/disk atmosphere. We have conducted NOEMA observations toward SVS13A from the PROtostars &amp; DIsks: Global Evolution (PRODIGE) program. Our previous \ce{DCN} observations reveal a possible infalling streamer, which may affect the chemistry of the central protobinary by inducing accretion outbursts and/or shocked gas. Here, we further analyze six O-bearing COMs: CH3OH, aGg'-(CH2OH)2, C2H5OH, CH2(OH)CHO, CH3CHO, and CH3OCHO. Although the COM emission is not spatially resolved, we constrain the source sizes to $\lesssim0.3-0.4$ arcsec (90$-$120 au) by conducting uv-domain Gaussian fitting. Interestingly, the high-spectral resolution data reveal complex line profiles with multiple peaks showing differences between these six O-bearing COMs. The LTE fitting unveils differences in excitation temperatures and emitting areas among these COMs. We further conduct multiple-velocity-component LTE fitting to decompose the line emission into different kinematic components. Up to 6 velocity components are found from the LTE modeling. The temperature, column density, and source size of these components from each COM are obtained. We find a variety in excitation temperatures ($100-500$ K) and source sizes (D$\sim10-70$ au) from these kinematic components from different COMs. The emission of each COM can trace several components and different COMs most likely trace different regions. Given this complex structure, we suggest that the central region is inhomogeneous and unlikely to be heated by only protostellar radiation. We conclude that accretion shocks induced by the large-scale infalling streamer likely exist and contribute to the complexity of the COM emission.</description>

      <title>Gas-phase condensation of carbonated silicate grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reports on the detection of carbonates in planetary nebulae (PNe) and protostars suggested the existence of a mechanism that produce these compounds in stellar winds and outflows. A consecutive laboratory study reported a possible mechanism by observing the non-thermodynamic equilibrium (TE), gas-phase condensation of amorphous silicate grains with amorphous calcium carbonate inclusions. It concluded that water vapor was necessary to the formation of the carbonates. We present a laboratory study with pulsed laser ablation of an MgSi target in O$_2$ and CO$_2$ gases and report, in the absence of water vapor, the non-TE, gas-phase condensation of amorphous carbonated magnesium silicate dust. It consists of amorphous silicate grains with formula MgSiO$_3$ that comprise carbonate groups homogeneously dispersed in their structure. The infrared spectra of the grains show the characteristic bands of amorphous silicates and two bands at $\sim$6.3 and $\sim$7.0 $\mu$m that we assign to the carbonate groups. The silicate bands are not significantly affected at an estimated Si:C ratio of 9:1 to 9:2. Such grains could form in winds and outflows of evolved stars and PNe if C atoms are present during silicate condensation. Additionally, we find that Lyman-$\alpha$ radiation dissociates the carbonate groups at the surface of the carbonated silicate grains and we estimate the corresponding photodissociation cross section of (0.04 $\pm$ 0.02) $\times$ 10$^{-16}$ cm$^2$. Therefore, photodissociation would limit the formation of carbonate groups on grains in winds and outflows of stars emitting VUV photons and the carbonates observed in protostars have not formed by gas-phase condensation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first volume-limited sample of spectroscopically confirmed hot subluminous stars out to 500 pc, defined using the accurate parallax measurements from the {\em Gaia} space mission data release 3 (DR3). The sample comprises a total of 397 members, with 305 ($\sim 77\%$) identified as hot subdwarf stars, including 83 newly discovered systems. Of these, we observe that 178 ($\sim58\%$) are hydrogen-rich sdBs, 65 are sdOBs ($\sim 21\%$), 32 are sdOs ($\sim 11\%$), and 30 are He-sdO/Bs ($\sim 10\%$). Among them, 48 ($\sim 16\%$) exhibit an infrared excess in their spectral energy distribution fits, suggesting a composite binary system. The hot subdwarf population is estimated to be 90\% complete, assuming that most missing systems are these composite binaries located within the main sequence (MS) in the \emph{Gaia} colour-magnitude diagram (CMD). The remaining sources in the sample include cataclysmic variables (CVs), blue horizontal branch stars (BHBs), hot white dwarfs (WDs), and MS stars. We derived the mid-plane density $\rho_{0}$ and scale height $\mathrm{h}_{z}$ for the non-composite hot subdwarf star population using a hyperbolic sechant profile (sech$^2$). The best-fit values are $\rho_{0}\,=\,5.17\pm 0.33 \times10^{-7}$ stars/pc$^{3}$ and $\mathrm{h}_{z} = 281 \pm 62$ pc. When accounting for the composite-colour hot subdwarfs and their estimated completeness, the mid-plane density increases to $\rho_{0}\,=\,6.15^ {+1.16}_{-0.53} \times10^{-7}$ stars/pc$^{3}$. This corrected space density is an order of magnitude lower than predicted by population synthesis studies, supporting previous observational estimates.</description>

      <title>A coherent view of Li depletion and angular momentum transport to explain the Li plateau -- from Population II to Population I stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unraveling the cosmological Li problem - the discrepancy between Big Bang nucleosynthesis predictions and observed values in the Spite plateau - requires a comprehensive exploration of stellar evolution. In this study, we utilized the code STAREVOL to compute the stellar evolution models with atomic diffusion, rotation-induced processes, parametric turbulence, and additional viscosity. We calibrated the models to fit the abundance of Li in Population II stars selected from the GALAH DR3 spectroscopic survey and literature compilation based on their chemical composition. The calibration reveals the significance of parametric turbulence in counteracting atomic diffusion effects. These models predict the constancy of the Spite plateau as a function of $T_\mathrm{eff}$ and [Fe/H] which agrees with the observational trend found after a detailed selection of dwarf non-peculiar stars. Other dwarfs that lie below the Spite plateau are either CEMP or have other types of chemical peculiarities, reinforcing the notion of their environmental origin. The Li abundance near the Spite plateau of the most Fe-deficient star, J0023+0307, which is not CEMP, provides additional evidence for the stellar depletion solution of the Li cosmological problem. Also, our models predict a transition from Li constancy at low metallicities to dispersion at high metallicities which is seen in observations. In addition, we extend our analysis to include a comparison with observational data from the globular cluster NGC 6752, showcasing excellent agreement between model predictions and Li and Mg trends in post-turnoff stars. This opens avenues for refining the estimates of initial Li abundance in metal-rich globular clusters which would help to constrain Li evolution in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Mining the GALAH data I: Study of five Super lithium-rich metal-poor giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of a large amount of Li in giants is still a mystery. Most of the super Li-rich giants reported in recent studies are in the solar metallicity regime. Here, we study the five metal-poor super Li-rich giants (SLRs) from GALAH Data Release 3 with their [Fe/H] ranging from -1.35 to -2.38 with lithium abundance of A(Li) $\geq$ 3.4~dex. The asteroseismic analysis reveals that none are on the red giant branch. The average period spacing ($\Delta P$ ) values indicate giants are in the core He-burning phase. All of them are low-mass giants (M $&lt;$ 1.5M$_{\odot}$). The location in the HR diagram suggests one of them is in the red clump phase, and interestingly, the other four are much brighter and coincide with the early AGB phase. The abundance analysis reveals that C, O, Na, Ba, and Eu are normal for giants of respective metallicities and evolutionary phases. Further, we didn't find any strong evidence for the presence of dust in the form of infrared excess or binarity from the available radial velocity data. We discussed a few scenarios for the existence of SLRs at higher luminosity, including past merger events. The findings will help to understand the production and evolution of Li among giants, in particular, during and the post-red clump phase.</description>

      <title>An Observational View of Structure in Protostellar Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The envelopes and disks that surround protostars reflect the initial conditions of star and planet formation and govern the assembly of stellar masses. Characterizing these structures requires observations that span the near-infrared to centimeter wavelengths. Consequently, the past two decades have seen progress driven by numerous advances in observational facilities across this spectrum, including the \textit{Spitzer Space Telescope}, \textit{Herschel Space Observatory}, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and a host of other ground-based interferometers and single-dish radio telescopes. Nearly all protostars appear to have well-formed circumstellar disks that are likely to be rotationally-supported; the ability to detect a disk around a protostar is more a question of spatial resolution than whether or not a disk is present. The disks around protostars have inherently higher millimeter/submillimeter luminosities as compared to disks around more-evolved pre-main sequence stars, though there may be systematic variations between star forming regions. The envelopes around protostars are inherently asymmetric and streamers emphasize that mass flow through the envelopes to the disks may not be homogeneous. The current mass distribution of protostars may be impacted by selection bias given that it is skewed toward solar-mass protostars, inconsistent with the stellar initial mass function.</description>

      <title>Parallax Effect in Microlensing Events due to Free-Floating Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of most important applications of microlensing observations is detecting free-floating planets(FFPs). The time scale of microlensing due to FFPs ($t_{\rm E}$) is short (a few days). Discerning the annual parallax effect in observations from these short-duration events by one observer is barely possible, though their parallax amplitude is larger than that in common events. In microlensing events due to FFPs, the lens-source relative trajectory alters because of the observer's motion by $\boldsymbol{\delta u}$. This deviation is a straight line if $t_{\rm E} \ll P_{\oplus}$, and its size is $\delta u\propto \pi_{\rm{rel}}$ ($P_{\oplus}$ is the observer's orbital period). So, most of observed microlensing events due to close FFPs have simple Paczy\'nsky lightcurves with indiscernible and valuable parallax. To evaluate destructive effects of invisible parallax in such events, we simulate $\sim9650$ microlensing events due to FFPs with $t_{\rm E}&lt;10$ days that are observed only by The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope(\wfirst). We conclude that in half of these microlensing events the missing parallax alters the real lightcurves, changing their shape and derived properties(by $\Delta \chi^{2}\gtrsim100$). By fitting Paczy\'nski lightcurves to these affected events we evaluate the relative and dimensionless deviations in the lensing parameters from their real values ($\delta t_{\rm E}, \delta \rho_{\star}, ...$). We conclude that around $46$ FFPs which are discovered by \wfirst\ have lightcurves highly affected by invisible parallax with $\delta t_{\rm E}&gt;0.1~\rm{and}~\delta \rho_{\star}&gt;0.1$. Our study reveals the importance of simultaneous and dense observations of microlensing events viewed by \wfirst\ by other observers rotating the Sun in different orbits.</description>

      <title>SASHIMI-SIDM: Semi-analytical subhalo modelling for self-interacting dark matter at sub-galactic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the semi-analytical structure formation model, SASHIMI, which predicts subhalo populations in collisionless, cold dark matter (CDM), with a parametric model that maps CDM halos to self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. The resulting model, SASHIMI-SIDM, generates SIDM subhalo populations down to sub-galactic mass scales, for an arbitrary input cross section, in minutes. We show that SASHIMI-SIDM agrees with SIDM subhalo populations from high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations in resolved regimes. Crucially, we predict that the fraction of core-collapsed subhalos peaks at a mass scale determined by the input SIDM cross section and decreases toward higher halo masses, consistent with the predictions of gravothermal models and cosmological simulations. For the first time, we also show that the core-collapsed fraction decreases toward lower halo masses; this result is uniquely enabled by our semi-analytical approach. As a proof of principle, we apply SASHIMI-SIDM to predict the boost to the local dark matter density and annihilation rate from core-collapsed SIDM subhalos, which can be enhanced relative to CDM by an order of magnitude for viable SIDM models. Thus, SASHIMI-SIDM provides an efficient and reliable tool for scanning SIDM parameter space and testing it with astrophysical observations. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/shinichiroando/sashimi-si.</description>

      <title>Probing Stellar Clusters from Gaia DR2 as Galactic PeVatrons: I -- Expected Gamma-ray and Neutrino Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young &amp; massive stellar clusters (SCs) are a potential source of galactic cosmic rays up to very high energies as a result of two possible acceleration scenarios. Collective stellar winds from massive member stars form a wind-blown bubble with a termination shock (TS) at which particle acceleration to PeV energies may occur. Furthermore, shock acceleration may occur at SNRs expanding inside the bubble. By applying a model of CR acceleration at both the wind TS and SNR shocks to catalogues of known SCs derived from Gaia DR2, we identify the most promising targets to search for evidence of PeVatron activity. Predictions for the secondary fluxes of gamma-ray and neutrino emission are derived based on particle acceleration at the collective wind TS and the subsequent hadronic interactions with the surrounding medium. Predictions from our modelling under baseline and optimistic scenarios are compared to data, finding consistent results. We estimate the detection prospects for future gamma-ray and neutrino experiments. We find that degree-scale angular sizes of the wind-blown bubbles are typical, that may pose a challenge for experimental detection. A shortlist of the most promising candidates is provided, with an anticipated flux range. Of order 10 SCs may be detectable with future facilities, and 1-5 could be currently operating as PeVatrons. Of these, three gamma-ray detected SCs have data within our predicted range. Our model can consistently describe gamma-ray measurements of SC emission. Several further as-yet-undetected SCs offer promising targets for future observations, although the flux range allowed by our model can be large (&gt; factor 10). The large angular size of the wind-blown bubble may lead to low surface brightness emission, worsening the problem of source confusion. Nevertheless, we discuss how further work will help to constrain SCs as PeVatron candidates. (abridged)</description>

      <title>On the Ambipolar Diffusion Formulation for Ion-neutral drifts in the non-negligible drift velocity limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ambipolar diffusion approximation is used to model partially ionised plasma dynamics in a single fluid setting. To correctly apply the commonly used version of ambipolar diffusion, a set of criteria should be satisfied including the requirement that the difference in velocity between charges and neutral species (known as drift velocity) is much smaller than the thermal velocity, otherwise the drift velocity will drive a non-negligible level of further collisions between the two species. In this paper we explore the consequence of relaxing this assumption. We show that a new induction equation can be formulated without this assumption. This formulation reduces to the ambipolar induction equation in the case the drift velocity is small. In the large drift velocity limit, the feedback of the drift velocity on the collision frequency results in decreased diffusion of the magnetic field compared with the standard ambipolar diffusion approximation for the same parameters. This has a natural consequence of reducing the frictional heating that can occur. Applying this to results from flux emergence simulations where the expansion of the magnetic field leads to strong adiabatic cooling of the partially ionised chromosphere resulted in a noticeable reduction in the magnitude of the predicted drift velocities.</description>

      <title>CHIANTI -- an atomic database for emission lines -- Paper XVIII. Version 11, advanced ionization equilibrium models: density and charge transfer effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Version 11 of the CHIANTI database and software package is presented. Advanced ionization equilibrium models have been added for low charge states of seven elements (C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si and S), and represent a significant improvement especially when modelling the solar transition region. The models include the effects of higher electron density and charge transfer on ionization and recombination rates. As an illustration of the difference these models make, a synthetic spectrum is calculated for an electron pressure of 7$\times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ K and compared with an active region observation from HRTS. Increases are seen of factors of two to five in the predicted radiances of the strongest lines in the UV from Si IV, C IV, and N V, compared to the previous modelling using the coronal approximation. Much better agreement (within 20\%) with the observation is found for the majority of the lines. The new atomic models better equip both those who are studying the transition region and those who are interpreting emission from higher density astrophysical and laboratory plasma. In addition to the advanced models, several ion datasets have been added or updated, and data for the radiative recombination energy loss rate have been updated.</description>

      <title>The Tarantula $-$ Revealed by X-rays (T-ReX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tarantula Nebula (30 Doradus) is the most important star-forming complex in the Local Group, offering a microscope on starburst astrophysics. At its heart lies the exceptionally rich young stellar cluster R136, containing the most massive stars known. Stellar winds and supernovae have carved 30 Dor into an amazing display of arcs, pillars, and bubbles. We present first results and advanced data processing products from the 2-Ms Chandra X-ray Visionary Project, "The Tarantula $-$ Revealed by X-rays" (T-ReX). The 3615 point sources in the T-ReX catalog include massive stars, compact objects, binaries, bright pre-main-sequence stars and compact young stellar (sub)clusters in 30 Dor. After removing point sources and excluding the exceptionally bright supernova remnant N157B (30 Dor B), the global diffuse X-ray maps reveal hot plasma structures resolved at 1$-$10 pc scales, with an absorption-corrected total-band (0.5$-$7 keV) X-ray luminosity of $2.110\times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Spatially-resolved spectral modeling provides evidence for emission lines enhanced by charge-exchange processes at the interfaces. We identify a candidate for the oldest X-ray pulsar detected to date in 30 Dor, PSR J0538-6902, inside a newly-resolved arctuate X-ray wind nebula, the Manta Ray. The long time baseline of T-ReX monitored dozens of massive stars, several showing periodic variability tied to binary orbital periods, and captured strong flares from at least three low-mass Galactic foreground stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Motivated by recent achievements of a full general relativistic method in determining black hole (BH) parameters, we continue to estimate the mass-to-distance ratio of the supermassive BHs hosted at the core of the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) of NGC 1320, NGC 1194, NGC 5495, and Mrk 1029.
  Aims .To study the properties of SMBHs at the centers of selected AGNs by a full general relativistic method which allows us to address the potential detection of relativistic effects within such astrophysical systems.
  Methods. In order to perform statistical estimations with publicly available observational data, we use a general relativistic model that describes black hole rotation curves and further employ a Bayesian fitting method.
  Results. We estimate the mass-to-distance ratio of the aforementioned BHs, their $x_0$-offset as well as the recessional redshifts of the host galaxies produced by both peculiar motion and cosmological expansion of the Universe. Finally, we calculate the gravitational redshift of the closest maser to the BH for each AGN. This gravitational redshift is a general relativistic effect produced by the gravitational field of the BH properly included in the modeling.</description>

      <title>Stellar cluster formation in a Milky Way-sized galaxy at z&gt;4 -- II. A hybrid formation scenario for the nuclear star cluster and its connection to the nuclear stellar ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are massive star clusters found in the innermost region of most galaxies. While recent studies suggest that low-mass NSCs in dwarf galaxies form largely out of the merger of globular clusters and NSCs in massive galaxies accumulate mass primarily through central star formation, the formation channel of the Milky Way's NSC is still uncertain. In this work, we use GigaEris, a high resolution N-body, hydrodynamical, cosmological ``zoom-in'' simulation, to investigate a possible formation path of the NSC in the progenitor of a Milky Way-sized galaxy, as well as its relation to the assembly and evolution of the galactic nuclear region. We study the possibility that bound, young, gas-rich, stellar clusters within a radius of 1.5 kpc of the main galaxy's centre at z&gt;4 are the predecessors of the old, metal-poor stellar population of the Milky Way's NSC. We identify 47 systems which satisfy our criteria, with a total stellar mass of $10^{7.5}$ M$_{\odot}$. We demonstrate that both stellar cluster accretion and in-situ star formation will contribute to the formation of the NSC, providing evidence for a hybrid formation scenario for the first time in an N-body, hydrodynamical, cosmological ``zoom-in'' simulation. Additionally, we find that the gas required for in-situ star formation can originate from two pathways: gas-rich stellar clusters and gas influx driven by large-scale non-axisymmetric structures within the galaxy. This is partly supported by the presence of a stellar ring, resulting from gas dynamics, with properties similar to those of the Milky Way's nuclear stellar disc.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Fields and Velocity Gradients in L1551: The Role of Stellar Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields play a crucial role in star formation, yet tracing them becomes particularly challenging, especially in the presence of outflow feedback in protostellar systems. We targeted the star-forming region L1551, notable for its apparent outflows, to investigate the magnetic fields. These fields were probed using polarimetry observations from the Planck satellite at 353 GHZ/849 $\mu$m, the SOFIA/HAWC+ measurement at 214 $\mu$m, and the JCMT/SCUPOL 850 $\mu$m survey. Consistently, all three measurements show that the magnetic fields twist towards the protostar IRS 5. Additionally, we utilized the Velocity Gradients Technique (VGT) on the $^{12}$CO (J = 1-0) emission data to distinguish the magnetic fields directly associated with the protostellar outflows. These were then compared with the polarization results. Notably, in the outskirts of the region, these measurements generally align. However, as one approaches the center of IRS 5, the measurements tend to yield mostly perpendicular relative orientations. This suggests that the outflows might be dynamically significant from a scale of approximately $\sim0.2$~pc, causing the velocity gradient to change direction by 90 degrees. Furthermore, we discovered that the polarization fraction $p$ and the total intensity $I$ correlate as $p \propto I^{-\alpha}$. Specifically, $\alpha$ is approximately $1.044\pm0.06$ for SCUPOL and around $0.858\pm0.15$ for HAWC+. This indicates that the outflows could significantly impact the alignment of dust grains and magnetic fields in the L1551 region.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved H$\alpha$ and ionizing photon production efficiency in the lensed galaxy MACS1149-JD1 at a redshift of 9.11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MIRI/JWST medium-resolution spectroscopy (MRS) and imaging (MIRIM) of the lensed galaxy MACS1149-JD1 at a redshift of $z$=9.1092$\pm$0.0002 (Universe age about 530 Myr). We detect, for the first time, spatially resolved H$\alpha$ emission in a galaxy at a redshift above nine. The structure of the H$\alpha$ emitting gas consists of two clumps, S and N. The total H$\alpha$ luminosity implies an instantaneous star-formation of 5.3$\pm$0.4 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for solar metallicities. The ionizing photon production efficiency, $\log(\zeta_\mathrm{ion})$, shows a spatially resolved structure with values of 25.55$\pm$0.03, 25.47$\pm$0.03, and 25.91$\pm$0.09 Hz erg$^{-1}$ for the integrated galaxy, and clumps S and N, respectively. The H$\alpha$ rest-frame equivalent width, EW$_{0}$(H$\alpha$), is 726$^{+660}_{-182}$ \'Angstrom for the integrated galaxy, but presents extreme values of 531$^{+300}_{-96}$ \'Angstrom and $\geq$1951 \'Angstrom for clumps S and N, respectively. The spatially resolved ionizing photon production efficiency is within the range of values measured in galaxies at redshift above six, and well above the canonical value (25.2$\pm$0.1 Hz erg$^{-1}$). The extreme difference of EW$_{0}$(H$\alpha$) for Clumps S and N indicates the presence of a recent (&lt;5 Myrs) burst in clump N and a star formation over a larger period of time (e.g., $\sim$50 Myr) in clump S. Finally, clump S and N show very different H$\alpha$ kinematics with velocity dispersions of 56$\pm$4 km s$^{-1}$ and 113$\pm$33 km s$^{-1}$, likely indicating the presence of outflows or increased turbulence in the clump N. The dynamical mass, $M_\mathrm{dyn}$= (2.4$\pm$0.5)$\times$10$^{9}$ $M_{\odot}$, is within the range measured with the spatially resolved [OIII]88$\mu$m line.</description>

      <title>Extragalactic Magnetism with SOFIA (SALSA Legacy Program). VII. A Tomographic View of Far-infrared and Radio Polarimetric Observations through MHD Simulations of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structure of magnetic fields in galaxies remains poorly constrained, despite the importance of magnetism in the evolution of galaxies. Radio synchrotron and far-infrared (FIR) polarization and polarimetric observations are the best methods to measure galactic scale properties of magnetic fields in galaxies beyond the Milky Way. We use synthetic polarimetric observations of a simulated galaxy to identify and quantify the regions, scales, and interstellar medium (ISM) phases probed at FIR and radio wavelengths. Our studied suite of magnetohydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations features high-resolutions (10 pc full-cell size) and multiple magnetization models. Our synthetic observations have a striking resemblance to those of observed galaxies. We find that the total and polarized radio emission extends to approximately double the altitude above the galactic disk (half-intensity disk thickness of $h_\text{I radio} \sim h_\text{PI radio} = 0.23 \pm 0.03$ kpc) relative to the total FIR and polarized emission that are concentrated in the disk midplane ($h_\text{I FIR} \sim h_\text{PI FIR} = 0.11 \pm 0.01$ kpc). Radio emission traces magnetic fields at scales of $\gtrsim 300$ pc, whereas FIR emission probes magnetic fields at the smallest scales of our simulations. These scales are comparable to our spatial resolution and well below the spatial resolution ($&lt;300$ pc) of existing FIR polarimetric measurements. Finally, we confirm that synchrotron emission traces a combination of the warm neutral and cold neutral gas phases, whereas FIR emission follows the densest gas in the cold neutral phase in the simulation. These results are independent of the ISM magnetic field strength. The complementarity we measure between radio and FIR wavelengths motivates future multiwavelength polarimetric observations to advance our knowledge of extragalactic magnetism.</description>

      <title>The Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public Near-Infrared Slitless Survey Epoch 1 (NGDEEP-NISS1): Extra-Galactic Star-formation and Active Galactic Nuclei at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.6</title>

Abstract: The Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public (NGDEEP) survey program was designed specifically to include Near Infrared Slitless Spectroscopic observations (\NGDEEP) to detect multiple emission lines in as many galaxies as possible and across a wide redshift range using the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS). We present early results obtained from the the first set of observations (Epoch 1, 50$\%$ of the allocated orbits) of this program (\NGDEEPA). Using a set of independently developed calibration files designed to deal with a complex combination of overlapping spectra, multiple position angles, and multiple cross filters and grisms, in conjunction with a robust and proven algorithm for quantifying contamination from overlapping dispersed spectra, \NGDEEPA\ has achieved a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity limit of 2 $\times$ 10$^{-18}$ erg/s/cm$^2$. We demonstrate the power of deep wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) to characterize the star-formation rates, and metallicity ([OIII]/H$\beta$), and dust content, of galaxies at $1&lt;z&lt;3.5$. The latter showing intriguing initial results on the applicability and assumptions made regarding the use of Case B recombination.
  Further, we identify the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and infer the mass of their supermassive black holes (SMBHs) using broadened restframe MgII and H$\beta$ emission lines. The spectroscopic results are then compared with the physical properties of galaxies extrapolated from fitting spectral energy distribution (SED) models to photometry alone. The results clearly demonstrate the unique power and efficiency of WFSS at near-infrared wavelengths over other methods to determine the properties of galaxies across a broad range of redshifts.</description>

      <title>The impact of an evolving stellar initial mass function on early galaxies and reionisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations with JWST have revealed an unexpected high abundance of bright z&gt;10 galaxy candidates. We explore whether a stellar initial mass function (IMF) that becomes increasingly top-heavy towards higher redshifts and lower gas-phase metallicities results in a higher abundance of bright objects in the early universe and how it affects the evolution of galaxy properties compared to a constant IMF. We incorporate such an evolving IMF into the Astraeus framework that couples galaxy evolution and reionisation in the first billion years. Our implementation accounts for the IMF dependence of supernova feedback, metal enrichment, ionising and ultraviolet radiation emission. We conduct two simulations: one with a Salpeter IMF and one with the evolving IMF. Compared to a constant Salpeter IMF, we find that (i) the higher abundance of massive stars in the evolving IMF results in more light per unit stellar mass, a slower build-up of stellar mass and lower stellar-to-halo mass ratio; (ii) due to the self-similar growth of the underlying dark matter halos, the evolving IMF's star formation main sequence hardly deviates from that of the Salpeter IMF; (iii) the evolving IMF's stellar mass-metallicity relation shifts to higher metallicities while its halo mass-metallicity relation remains unchanged; (iv) the evolving IMF's median dust-to-metal mass ratio is lower due to its stronger SN feedback; (v) the evolving IMF requires lower values of the escape fraction of ionising photons and exhibits a flatter median relation and smaller scatter between the ionising photons emerging from galaxies and the halo mass. Yet, the topology of the ionised regions hardly changes compared to the Salpeter IMF. These results suggest that a top-heavier IMF alone is unlikely to explain the higher abundance of bright z&gt;10 sources, since the lower mass-to-light ratio is counteracted by the stronger stellar feedback.</description>

      <title>Differences in the properties of disrupted and surviving satellites of Milky-Way-mass galaxies in relation to their host accretion histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the chemo-dynamical properties of tidal debris in the Milky Way, it has been inferred that the dwarf satellites that have been disrupted had different chemical abundances from their present-day counterparts of similar mass that survive today, specifically, they had lower [Fe/H] and higher [Mg/Fe]. Here we use the ARTEMIS simulations to study the relation between the chemical abundances of disrupted progenitors of MW-mass galaxies and their stellar mass, and the evolution of the stellar mass - metallicity relations (MZR) of this population with redshift. We find that these relations have significant scatter, which correlates with the accretion redshifts ($z_{\rm acc}$) of satellites, and with their cold gas fractions. We investigate the MZRs of dwarf populations accreted at different redshifts and find that they have similar slopes, and also similar with the slope of the MZR of the surviving population ($\approx 0.32$). However, the entire population of disrupted dwarfs displays a steeper MZR, with a slope of $\approx 0.48$, which can be explained by the changes in the mass spectrum of accreted dwarf galaxies with redshift. We find strong relations between the (mass-weighted) $\langle z_{\rm acc} \rangle$ of the disrupted populations and their global chemical abundances ($\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle$ and $\langle$[Mg/Fe]$\rangle$), which suggests that chemical diagnostics of disrupted dwarfs can be used to infer the types of merger histories of their hosts. For the case of the MW, our simulations predict that the bulk of the disrupted population was accreted at $\langle z_{\rm acc} \rangle \approx 2$, in agreement with other findings. We also find that disrupted satellites form and evolve in denser environments, closer to their hosts, than their present-day counterparts.</description>

      <title>High-precision astrometry with VVV -- II. A near-infrared extension of Gaia into the Galactic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims. We use near-infrared, ground-based data from the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey to indirectly extend the astrometry provided by the Gaia catalog to objects in heavily-extincted regions towards the Galactic bulge and plane that are beyond Gaia's reach. Methods. We make use of the state-of-the-art techniques developed for high-precision astrometry and photometry with the Hubble Space Telescope to process the VVV data. We employ empirical, spatially-variable, effective point-spread functions and local transformations to mitigate the effects of systematic errors, like residual geometric distortion and image motion, and to improve measurements in crowded fields and for faint stars. We also anchor our astrometry to the absolute reference frame of the Gaia Data Release 3. Results. We measure between 20 and 60 times more sources than Gaia in the region surrounding the Galactic center, obtaining an single-exposure precision of about 12 mas and a proper-motion precision of better than 1 mas yr$^{-1}$ for bright, unsaturated sources. Our astrometry provides an extension of Gaia into the Galactic center. We publicly release the astro-photometric catalogs of the two VVV fields considered in this work, which contain a total of $\sim$ 3.5 million sources. Our catalogs cover $\sim$ 3 sq. degrees, about 0.5% of the entire VVV survey area.</description>

      <title>Observing the Galactic Underworld: Predicting photometry and astrometry from compact remnant microlensing events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isolated black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs) are largely undetectable across the electromagnetic spectrum. For this reason, our only real prospect of observing these isolated compact remnants is via microlensing; a feat recently performed for the first time. However, characterisation of the microlensing events caused by BHs and NSs is still in its infancy. In this work, we perform N-body simulations to explore the frequency and physical characteristics of microlensing events across the entire sky. Our simulations find that every year we can expect $88_{-6}^{+6}$ BH, $6.8_{-1.6}^{+1.7}$ NS and $20^{+30}_{-20}$ stellar microlensing events which cause an astrometric shift larger than 2~mas. Similarly, we can expect $21_{-3}^{+3}$ BH, $18_{-3}^{+3}$ NS and $7500_{-500}^{+500}$ stellar microlensing events which cause a bump magnitude larger than 1~mag. Leveraging a more comprehensive dynamical model than prior work, we predict the fraction of microlensing events caused by BHs as a function of Einstein time to be smaller than previously thought. Comparison of our microlensing simulations to events in Gaia finds good agreement. Finally, we predict that in the combination of Gaia and GaiaNIR data there will be $14700_{-900}^{+600}$ BH and $1600_{-200}^{+300}$ NS events creating a centroid shift larger than 1~mas and $330_{-120}^{+100}$ BH and $310_{-100}^{+110}$ NS events causing bump magnitudes $&lt; -1$. Of these, $&lt;10$ BH and $5_{-5}^{+10}$ NS events should be detectable using current analysis techniques. These results inform future astrometric mission design, such as GaiaNIR, as they indicate that, compared to stellar events, there are fewer observable BH events than previously thought.</description>

      <title>W50 morphology and the dynamics of SS 433 formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.10042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The jets of SS 433 have punched through the supernova remnant from the explosion forming the compact object. The precessing jets collimate before reaching beyond the shell, some 40 pc downstream, just the region of origin of TeV gamma radiation. Collimation could be effected by ambient pressure in the SNR cavity; I investigate conditions under which W50 morphology and the origins of TeV gamma radiation can be explained in terms of collimation, with associated shocks, induced by ambient pressure. I consider the age of the SNR and hence the present ambient pressure. The cavity is now ~ 10^5 years after the supernova; with lower pressure, collimation and associated shocks would occur ~40 pc downstream, just the origin of TeV gamma radiation. Modelling of evolution of binary systems indicates that Roche lobe overflow and initiation of the jets is recent. Collimation would still occur ~40 pc downstream, but the cone angle of the precession must then have increased with time - driven by the Roche lobe overflow. The morphology of W50 and the site of the origin of TeV gamma radiation are readily explained in terms of collimation of the jets by internal SNR pressure.</description>

      <title>Probing the Anisotropy and Non-Gaussianity in the Redshift Space through the Conditional Moments of the First Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Focusing on the redshift space observations with plane-parallel approximation and relying on the rotational dependency of the general definition of excursion sets, we introduce the so-called conditional moments of the first derivative ($cmd$) measures for the smoothed matter density field in three dimensions. We derive the perturbative expansion of $cmd$ for the real space and redshift space where peculiar velocity disturbs the galaxies' observed locations. Our criteria can successfully recognize the contribution of linear Kaiser and Finger-of-God effects. Our results demonstrate that the $cmd$ measure has significant sensitivity for pristine constraining the redshift space distortion parameter $\beta=f/b$ and interestingly, the associated normalized quantity in the Gaussian linear Kaiser limit has only $\beta$ dependency. Implementation of the synthetic anisotropic Gaussian field approves the consistency between the theoretical and numerical results. Including the first-order contribution of non-Gaussianity perturbatively in the $cmd$ criterion implies that the N-body simulations for the Quijote suite in the redshift space have been mildly skewed with a higher value for the threshold greater than zero. The non-Gaussianity for the perpendicular direction to the line of sight in the redshift space for smoothing scales $R\gtrsim 20$ Mpc h$^{-1}$ is almost the same as the real space. In contrast, the non-Gaussianity along the line of sight direction in redshift space is magnified. The Fisher forecasts indicate an almost significant enhancement in constraining the cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and $n_s$ when using $cmd+cr$ jointly.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project X. Large-scale quantitative spectroscopic analysis of Galactic luminous blue stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blue supergiants (BSGs) are key objects for understanding the evolution of massive stars. However, discrepancies between theoretical predictions and empirical observations have opened up important questions yet to be answered. Studying statistically significant and unbiased samples of BSGs can help to improve the situation. We aim to perform a homogeneous and comprehensive quantitative spectroscopic analysis of a large sample of Galactic luminous blue stars (being the majority BSGs) from the IACOB spectroscopic database. We derive the projected rotational velocity ($v\sin i$) and macroturbulent broadening ($v_{\rm mac}$) using IACOB-BROAD. We used FASTWIND computations to derive effective temperatures ($T_{\rm eff}$), surface gravities, microturbulences ($\xi$), Si and He surface abundances, and the wind-strength parameter. We provide estimates of these quantities for the largest sample of Galactic luminous O9-B5 stars spectroscopically analyzed to date, with 527 targets. We find a drop in the relative number of stars at ~21 kK, coinciding with a scarcity of fast rotating stars below that temperature. We speculate that this feature might be roughly delineating the location of the Terminal-Age-Main-Sequence in the 15-85M$_\odot$ range. By investigating the main characteristics of the $v\sin i$ distribution as a function of $T_{\rm eff}$, we propose that an efficient mechanism transporting angular momentum from the stellar core to the surface might be operating along the main sequence. We find correlations between $\xi$, $v_{\rm mac}$ and the spectroscopic luminosity. We also find that no more than 20% of the stars in our sample have atmospheres clearly enriched in He, and suggest that the origin of this specific sub-sample might be in binary evolution. We do not find clear empirical evidence of an increase in the wind-strength over the wind bi-stability region towards lower temperatures.</description>
