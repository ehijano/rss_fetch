      <title>A Study on Library Resources with Services Satisfaction based on Library Users Affiliated Colleges to Solapur University</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of this study was to assess and evaluate user satisfaction with library resources and services among library users associated with Solapur University. The current research shows the level of users satisfaction with different library resources and services offered by college libraries. The research found that a vast number of respondents were pleased with library facilities and services. The research is designed to achieve users satisfaction in the library to investigate the level of satisfaction towards library resources and services with regards to 26 colleges of Solapur University based in Maharashtra. Information in the form of data has been collected from colleges and on the basis of users results; analysis needs to analyze users satisfaction.</description>

      <title>Russian Contribution to Coronary Artery Disease Research: A Scientometric Mapping of Publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study attempts to highlight the research output generated in Russia in coronary artery disease (CAD) research during the period 1990-2019 to understand the distribution of research output, top journals for publications, and most prolific authors, authorship pattern, and citation pattern. This study is based on secondary data extracted from the Science Citation Index (SCI), which is an integral component of the Web of Science. Descriptive and inferential statistical techniques were applied in the study. There were 5058 articles by Russian scholars in coronary artery disease during 1990-2019; they preferred to publish in Russian journals. The research contributions were in the form of research articles, meeting abstracts and reviews with a consistent drop in the number of editorial material and article; proceedings paper with time. Co-authorship was the norm in coronary artery disease research, with a steady increase in the number of multi-author documents in recent years.</description>

      <title>Interdisciplinary PhDs face barriers to top university placement within their disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary research has gained prominence as a necessity for addressing complex challenges, yet its impact on early academic careers remains unclear. This study examines how interdisciplinarity during doctoral training influences faculty placement at top universities across diverse fields. Analyzing the career trajectories of over 30,000 tenure-track faculty members who earned their Ph.D. degrees after 2005 and their initial faculty placement at 355 U.S. universities, we find that faculty newly hired by top-ranked universities tend to be less interdisciplinary in their Ph.D. research, particularly when they obtained Ph.D. from top universities and remain in their Ph.D. research field. This may reflect community trends towards homogeneity: at top universities, the existing faculty research is less interdisciplinary and more aligned with the candidates that they hire (who also exhibit lower interdisciplinarity). This preference disadvantages the placement of women graduates, who exhibit higher interdisciplinarity on average. Furthermore, we show that newly hired faculty with greater interdisciplinarity, when placed at top universities, tend to achieve higher long-term research productivity. This suggests a potential loss in knowledge production if top universities continue to undervalue interdisciplinary candidates. These findings highlight structural barriers in faculty hiring and raise concerns about the long-term consequences of prioritizing disciplinary specialization over interdisciplinary expertise.</description>

      <title>Novelty and Impact of Economics Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework that recasts scientific novelty not as a single attribute of a paper, but as a reflection of its position within the evolving intellectual landscape. We decompose this position into two orthogonal dimensions: \textit{spatial novelty}, which measures a paper's intellectual distinctiveness from its neighbors, and \textit{temporal novelty}, which captures its engagement with a dynamic research frontier. To operationalize these concepts, we leverage Large Language Models to develop semantic isolation metrics that quantify a paper's location relative to the full-text literature. Applying this framework to a large corpus of economics articles, we uncover a fundamental trade-off: these two dimensions predict systematically different outcomes. Temporal novelty primarily predicts citation counts, whereas spatial novelty predicts disruptive impact. This distinction allows us to construct a typology of semantic neighborhoods, identifying four archetypes associated with distinct and predictable impact profiles. Our findings demonstrate that novelty can be understood as a multidimensional construct whose different forms, reflecting a paper's strategic location, have measurable and fundamentally distinct consequences for scientific progress.</description>
