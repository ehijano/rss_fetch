      <title>Co-Translational mRNA Decay in Plants: Recent advances and future directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tight regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) stability is essential to ensure accurate gene expression in response to developmental and environmental cues. mRNA stability is controlled by mRNA decay pathways, which have traditionally been proposed to occur independently of translation. However, the recent discovery of a co-translational mRNA decay pathway (also known as CTRD) reveals that mRNA translation and decay can be coupled. While being translated, a mRNA can be targeted for degradation. This pathway was first described in yeast and rapidly identified in several plant species. This review explores recent advances in our understanding of CTRD in plants, emphasizing its regulation and its importance for development and stress response. The different metrics used to assess CTRD activity are also presented. Furthermore, this review outlines future directions to explore the importance of mRNA decay in maintaining mRNA homeostasis in plants.</description>

      <title>Towards an AI co-scientist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific discovery relies on scientists generating novel hypotheses that undergo rigorous experimental validation. To augment this process, we introduce an AI co-scientist, a multi-agent system built on Gemini 2.0. The AI co-scientist is intended to help uncover new, original knowledge and to formulate demonstrably novel research hypotheses and proposals, building upon prior evidence and aligned to scientist-provided research objectives and guidance. The system's design incorporates a generate, debate, and evolve approach to hypothesis generation, inspired by the scientific method and accelerated by scaling test-time compute. Key contributions include: (1) a multi-agent architecture with an asynchronous task execution framework for flexible compute scaling; (2) a tournament evolution process for self-improving hypotheses generation. Automated evaluations show continued benefits of test-time compute, improving hypothesis quality. While general purpose, we focus development and validation in three biomedical areas: drug repurposing, novel target discovery, and explaining mechanisms of bacterial evolution and anti-microbial resistance. For drug repurposing, the system proposes candidates with promising validation findings, including candidates for acute myeloid leukemia that show tumor inhibition in vitro at clinically applicable concentrations. For novel target discovery, the AI co-scientist proposed new epigenetic targets for liver fibrosis, validated by anti-fibrotic activity and liver cell regeneration in human hepatic organoids. Finally, the AI co-scientist recapitulated unpublished experimental results via a parallel in silico discovery of a novel gene transfer mechanism in bacterial evolution. These results, detailed in separate, co-timed reports, demonstrate the potential to augment biomedical and scientific discovery and usher an era of AI empowered scientists.</description>
