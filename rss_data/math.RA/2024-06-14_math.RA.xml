      <title>A geometry in the set of solutions to ill-posed linear problems with box constraints: Applications to probabilities on discrete sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When there are no constraints upon the solutions of the equation $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{\xi}= \mathbf{y},$ where $\mathbf{A}$ is a $K\times N-$matrix, $\mathbf{\xi}\in\mathbb{R}^N$ and $\mathbf{y}\in\mathbb{R}^K$ a given vector, the description of the set of solutions as $\mathbf{y}$ varies in $\mathbb{R}^K$ is well known. But this is not so when the solutions are required to satisfy $\mathbf{\xi} \in \mathcal{K}\prod_{i\leq j\leq N} [a_j,b_j],$ for finite $a_j\leq b_j: 1\leq j\leq N.$ Here we provide a description of the set of solutions as a surface in the constraint set, parameterized by the Lagrange multipliers that come up in a related optimization problem in which $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{\xi} = \mathbf{y}$ appears as a constraint. It is the dependence of the Lagrange multipliers on the data vector $\mathbf{y}$ that determines how the solution changes as the datum changes. The geometry on the solutions is inherited from a Riemannian geometry on the set of constraints induced by the Hessian of an entropy of the Fermi-Dirac type which is the objective in the restatement of the optimization problem mentioned above. We prove that the set of solutions is contained in $\ker(\mathbf{A})^\perp$ in the metric defined as the Hessian of the entropy.</description>

      <title>An effective criterion for a stable factorisation of strictly nonsingular 2x2 matrix functions. Utilisation of the ExactMPF package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to factorise of arbitrary strictly nonsingular 2x2 matrix functions allowing for stable factorisation. For this purpose, we utilise the ExactMPF package working within the Maple environment previously developed by the authors and performing an exact factorisation of a nonsingular polynomial matrix function. A crucial point in the present analysis is the evaluation of a stability region of the canonical factorisation of the polynomial matrix functions. This, in turn, allows us to propose a sufficient condition for the given matrix function admitting stable factorisation.</description>

      <title>Projection algebras and free projection- and idempotent-generated regular $*$-semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new family of semigroups - the free projection-generated regular $*$-semigroups - and initiate their systematic study. Such a semigroup $PG(P)$ is constructed from a projection algebra $P$, using the recent groupoid approach to regular $*$-semigroups. The assignment $P\mapsto PG(P)$ is a left adjoint to the forgetful functor that maps a regular $*$-semigroup $S$ to its projection algebra $P(S)$. In fact, the category of projection algebras is coreflective in the category of regular $*$-semigroups. The algebra $P(S)$ uniquely determines the biordered structure of the idempotents $E(S)$, up to isomorphism, and this leads to a category equivalence between projection algebras and regular $*$-biordered sets. As a consequence, $PG(P)$ can be viewed as a quotient of the classical free idempotent-generated (regular) semigroups $IG(E)$ and $RIG(E)$, where $E=E(PG(P))$; this is witnessed by a number of presentations in terms of generators and defining relations. The semigroup $PG(P)$ can also be viewed as the fundamental groupoid of a simplicial complex explicitly constructed from $P$. The theory is then illustrated on a number of examples. In one direction, the free construction applied to the projection algebras of adjacency semigroups yields a new family of graph-based path semigroups. In another, it turns out that, remarkably, the Temperley-Lieb monoid $TL_n$ is the free regular $*$-semigroup over its own projection algebra $P(TL_n)$.</description>

      <title>Gradings on associative triple systems of the second kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On this work we study associative triple systems of the second kind. We show that for simple triple systems the automorphism group scheme is isomorphic to the automorphism group scheme of the $3$-graded associative algebra with involution constructed by Loos. This result will allow us to prove our main result which is a complete classification up to isomorphism of the gradings of structurable algebras.</description>

      <title>The automorphisms of differential extensions of characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonassociative differential extensions are generalizations of associative differential extensions, either of a purely inseparable field extension $K$ of exponent one of a field $F$, $F$ of characteristic $p$, or of a central division algebra over a purely inseparable field extension of $F$. Associative differential extensions are well known central simple algebras first defined by Amitsur and Jacobson. We explicitly compute the automorphisms of nonassociative differential extensions. These are canonically obtained by restricting automorphisms of the differential polynomial ring used in the construction of the algebra. In particular, we obtain descriptions for the automorphisms of associative differential extensions of $D$ and $K$, which are known to be inner.</description>
