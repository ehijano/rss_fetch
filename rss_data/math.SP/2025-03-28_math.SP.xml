      <title>On the open TS/ST correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological string/spectral theory correspondence establishes a precise, non-perturbative duality between topological strings on local Calabi-Yau threefolds and the spectral theory of quantized mirror curves. While this duality has been rigorously formulated for the closed topological string sector, the open string sector remains less understood. Building on the results of [1-3], we make further progress in this direction by constructing entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the quantized mirror curve from open topological string partition functions. We focus on local $\mathbb{F}_0$, whose mirror curve corresponds to the Baxter equation of the two-particle, relativistic Toda lattice. We then study the standard and dual four-dimensional limits, where the quantum mirror curve for local $\mathbb{F}_0$ degenerates into the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, respectively. In these limits, our framework provides a way to construct entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the difference equations associated with these operators. Furthermore, we find a simple relation between the on-shell eigenfunctions of the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, leading to a functional relation between the operators themselves.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of kernel matrices in the flat limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.14067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel matrices are of central importance to many applied fields. In this manuscript, we focus on spectral properties of kernel matrices in the so-called ``flat limit'', which occurs when points are close together relative to the scale of the kernel. We establish asymptotic expressions for the determinants of the kernel matrices, which we then leverage to obtain asymptotic expressions for the main terms of the eigenvalues. Analyticity of the eigenprojectors yields expressions for limiting eigenvectors, which are strongly tied to discrete orthogonal polynomials. Both smooth and finitely smooth kernels are covered, with stronger results available in the finite smoothness case.</description>

      <title>Robust Eigenvectors of Symmetric Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tensor power method generalizes the matrix power method to higher order arrays, or tensors. Like in the matrix case, the fixed points of the tensor power method are the eigenvectors of the tensor. While every real symmetric matrix has an eigendecomposition, the vectors generating a symmetric decomposition of a real symmetric tensor are not always eigenvectors of the tensor.
  In this paper we show that whenever an eigenvector is a generator of the symmetric decomposition of a symmetric tensor, then (if the order of the tensor is sufficiently high) this eigenvector is robust, i.e., it is an attracting fixed point of the tensor power method. We exhibit new classes of symmetric tensors whose symmetric decomposition consists of eigenvectors. Generalizing orthogonally decomposable tensors, we consider equiangular tight frame decomposable and equiangular set decomposable tensors. Our main result implies that such tensors can be decomposed using the tensor power method.</description>

      <title>Bounds of restriction of characters to submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03178v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fruitful approach to the study of concentration of Laplacian eigenfunctions on a compact manifold as the eigenvalue grows to infinity is to bound their restriction to submanifolds. In this paper we take this approach in the setting of a compact Lie group, and provide sharp restriction bounds of general Laplacian eigenfunctions as well as important special ones such as sums of matrix coefficients and in particular characters of irreducible representations of the group. We deal with two classes of submanifolds, namely, maximal flats and all of their submanifolds, and the conjugation-invariant submanifolds. We prove conjecturally sharp asymptotic $L^p$ bounds of restriction of general Laplacian eigenfunctions to maximal flats and all of their submanifolds for all $p\geq 2$. We also prove sharp asymptotic $L^p$ bounds of restriction of characters to maximal tori and all of their submanifolds for all $p&gt;0$ and to the conjugation-invariant submanifolds for all $p\geq 2$, and of general sums of matrix coefficients to maximal flats and all of their submanifolds for all $p\geq 2$. In the appendix we present similar results for products of compact rank-one symmetric spaces.</description>

      <title>Limiting absorption principle for long-range perturbation in the discrete triangular lattice setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the discrete Laplacian acting on a triangular lattice, introducing long-range perturbations to both the metric and the potential. Our goal is to establish a Limiting Absorption Principle away frompossible embedded eigenvalues. Our study relies on a positive commutator technique.</description>

      <title>Spectral distribution of the free Jacobi process with equal rank projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The free Jacobi process is the radial part of the compression of the free unitary Brownian motion by two free orthogonal projections in a non commutative probability space. In this paper, we derive spectral properties of the free Jacobi process associated with projections having the same rank $\alpha \in (0,1)$. To start with, we determine the characteristic curves of the partial differential equation satisfied by the moment generating function of its spectral distribution. Doing so leads for any fixed time $t &gt;0$ to an expression of this function in a neighborhood of the origin, therefore extends our previous results valid for $\alpha = 1/2$. Moreover, the obtained characteristic curves are encoded by an $\alpha$-deformation of the compositional inverse of the $\chi$-transform of the spectral distribution of the free unitary Brownian motion. In this respect, we study mapping properties of this deformation and use the saddle point method to prove that the compositional inverse of a $\alpha$-deformation of the $\chi$-transform of the free unitary Brownian motion is analytic in the open unit disc (for large enough time $t$). The last part of the paper is devoted to a dynamical version of a recent identity pointed out by T. Kunisky in \cite{Kun}. Actually, this identity relates the stationary distributions of the free Jacobi processes corresponding to the sets of parameters $(\alpha, \alpha)$ and $(1/2,\alpha)$ respectively and we explain how it follows from the Nica-Speicher semi-group. Our dynamical version then relates the partial differential equations of the Cauchy-Stieltjes transforms of the densities of the finite-time spectral distributions. It also raises the problem of whether a dynamical analogue of the Nica-Speicher semi-group exists when the compressing projection has rank $1/2$.</description>
