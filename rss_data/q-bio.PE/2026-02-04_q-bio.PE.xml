      <title>Asymptotic Behavior of Integral Projection Models via Genealogical Quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-state structured population models, including integral projection models (IPMs) and age-structured McKendrick equations, link individual life histories to population growth and composition, yet the demographic meaning of their dominant eigenstructure can be difficult to interpret. A main goal of this paper is to derive interpretable demographic indicators for multi-state heterogeneity -- in particular expected generation numbers, which act as an effective genealogical memory length (in generations) of the ancestry-weighted contributions driving growth -- together with type reproduction numbers and generation intervals, directly from life-history transition kernels.
  To this end we develop a determinant-free genealogical framework based on a reference-point operator, a rank-one construction at the kernel level that singles out a biologically chosen reference state and organizes lineages by their contributions relative to that state. This yields stable distributions and reproductive values as convergent series of iterated kernels, and leads to an Euler--Lotka-like characteristic equation expressed by reference-point moments. The resulting expansion admits a closed combinatorial form via ordinary partial Bell polynomials, providing a direct bridge from transition kernels to genealogical quantities.
  We extend the approach to multi-state McKendrick equations and show how these indicators quantify how population scale and composition are determined by ancestry-weighted initial-state information. The framework avoids restrictive Hilbert--Schmidt assumptions and clarifies how temporal memory and multi-type heterogeneity emerge from cross-generational accumulation, yielding a unified and interpretable route from transition kernels to multi-state demographic indicators.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning-based pan-phenomic data reveals the explosive evolution of avian visual disparity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of biological morphology is critical for understanding the diversity of the natural world, yet traditional analyses often involve subjective biases in the selection and coding of morphological traits. This study employs deep learning techniques, utilising a ResNet34 model capable of recognising over 10,000 bird species, to explore avian morphological evolution. We extract weights from the model's final fully connected (fc) layer and investigate the semantic alignment between the high-dimensional embedding space learned by the model and biological phenotypes. The results demonstrate that the high-dimensional embedding space encodes phenotypic convergence. Subsequently, we assess the morphological disparity among various taxa and evaluate the association between morphological disparity and species richness, demonstrating that species richness is the primary driver of morphospace expansion. Moreover, the disparity-through-time analysis reveals a visual "early burst" after the K-Pg extinction.
  While mainly aimed at evolutionary analysis, this study also provides insights into the interpretability of Deep Neural Networks. We demonstrate that hierarchical semantic structures (biological taxonomy) emerged in the high-dimensional embedding space despite being trained on flat labels. Furthermore, through adversarial examples, we provide evidence that our model in this task can overcome texture bias and learn holistic shape representations (body plans), challenging the prevailing view that CNNs rely primarily on local textures.</description>

      <title>Indirect Reciprocity with Environmental Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indirect reciprocity maintains cooperation in stranger societies by mapping individual behaviors onto reputation signals via social norms. Existing theoretical frameworks assume static environments with constant resources and fixed payoff structures. However, in real-world systems, individuals' strategic behaviors not only shape their reputation but also induce collective-level resource changes in ecological, economic, or other external environments, which in turn reshape the incentives governing future individual actions. To overcome this limitation, we establish a co-evolutionary framework that couples moral assessment, strategy updating, and environmental dynamics, allowing the payoff structure to dynamically adjust in response to the ecological consequences of collective actions. We find that this environmental feedback mechanism helps lower the threshold for the emergence of cooperation, enabling the system to spontaneously transition from a low-cooperation state to a stable high-cooperation regime, thereby reducing the dependence on specific initial conditions. Furthermore, while lenient norms demonstrate adaptability in static environments, norms with strict discrimination are shown to be crucial for curbing opportunism and maintaining evolutionary resilience in dynamic settings. Our results reveal the evolutionary dynamics of coupled systems involving reputation institutions and environmental constraints, offering a new theoretical perspective for understanding collective cooperation and social governance in complex environments.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Lying in a Spatially-Explicit Prisoner's Dilemma Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present the results from a spatial model of the prisoner's dilemma, played on a toroidal lattice. Each individual has a default strategy of either cooperating ($C$) or defecting ($D$). Two strategies were tested, including ``tit-for-tat'' (TFT), in which individuals play their opponent's last play, or simply playing their default play. Each individual also has a probability of telling the truth ($0 \leq P_{truth} \leq 1$) about their last play. This parameter, which can evolve over time, allows individuals to be, for instance, a defector but present as a cooperator regarding their last play. This leads to interesting dynamics where mixed populations of defectors and cooperators with $P_{truth} \geq 0.75$ move toward populations of truth-telling cooperators. Likewise, mixed populations with $P_{truth} &lt; 0.7$ become populations of lying defectors. Both such populations are stable because they each have higher average scores than populations with intermediate values of $P_{truth}$. Applications of this model are discussed with regards to both humans and animals.</description>

      <title>Evolving genealogies in cultural evolution, the descendant process, and the number of cultural traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Moran-type model of cultural evolution, which describes how traits emerge, are transmitted, and get lost in populations. Our analysis focuses on the underlying cultural genealogies; they were first described by Aguilar and Ghirlanda (2015) and are closely related to the ancestral selection graph of population genetics, wherefore we call them ancestral learning graphs. We investigate their dynamical behaviour, that is, we are concerned with evolving genealogies. In particular, we consider the total length of the genealogy of the entire population as a function of the (forward) time where we start looking back. This quantity shows a sawtooth-like dynamics with linear increase interrupted by collapses to near-zero at random times. We relate this to the metastable behaviour of the stochastic logistic model, which describes the evolution of the number of ancestors as well as the number of descendants of a given sample.
  We superpose types to the model by assuming that new inventions appear independently in every individual, and all traits of the cultural parent are transmitted to the learner in any given learning event. The set of traits of an individual then agrees with the set of innovations along its genealogy. The properties of the genealogy thus translate into the properties of the trait set of a sample. In particular, the moments of the number of traits are obtained from the moments of the total length of the genealogy.</description>
