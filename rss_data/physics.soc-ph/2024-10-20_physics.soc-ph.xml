      <title>A spatiotemporal knowledge graph-based method for identifying individual activity locations from mobile phone data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, mobile phone data has been widely used for human mobility analytics. Identifying individual activity locations is the fundamental step for mobile phone data processing. Current methods typically aggregate spatially adjacent location records over multiple days to identify activity locations. However, only considering spatial relationships while overlooking temporal ones may lead to inaccurate activity location identification, and also affect activity pattern analysis. In this study, we propose a spatiotemporal knowledge graph-based (STKG) method for identifying activity locations from mobile phone data. An STKG is designed and constructed to describe individual mobility characteristics. The spatial and temporal relationships of individual stays are inferred and transformed into a spatiotemporal graph. The modularity-optimization community detection algorithm is applied to identify stays with dense spatiotemporal relationships, which are considering as activity locations. A case study in Shanghai was conducted to verify the performance of the proposed method. The results show that compared with two baseline methods, the STKG-based method can limit an additional 45% of activity locations with the longest daytime stay within a reasonable spatial range; In addition, the STKG-based method exhibit lower variance in the start and end times of activities across different days, performing approximately 10% to 20% better than the two baseline methods. Moreover, the STKG-based method effectively distinguishes between locations that are geographically close but exhibit different temporal patterns. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of STKG-based method in enhancing both spatial precision and temporal consistency.</description>

      <title>Online landmark replacement for out-of-sample dimensionality reduction methods</title>

Abstract: A strategy to assist visualization and analysis of large and complex data sets is dimensionality reduction, with which one maps each data point into a low-dimensional manifold. However, various dimensionality reduction techniques are computationally infeasible for large data. Out-of-sample techniques aim to resolve this difficulty; they only apply the dimensionality reduction technique on a small portion of data, referred to as landmarks, and determine the embedding coordinates of the other points using landmarks as references. Out-of-sample techniques have been applied to online settings, or when data arrive as time series. However, existing online out-of-sample techniques use either all the previous data points as landmarks or the fixed set of landmarks and therefore are potentially not good at capturing the geometry of the entire data set when the time series is non-stationary. To address this problem, we propose an online landmark replacement algorithm for out-of-sample techniques using geometric graphs and the minimal dominating set on them. We mathematically analyze some properties of the proposed algorithm, particularly focusing on the case of landmark multidimensional scaling as the out-of-sample technique, and test its performance on synthetic and empirical time series data.</description>

      <title>Optimal prevention strategies for chronic diseases in a compartmental disease trajectory model</title>

Abstract: In countries with growing elderly populations, multimorbidity poses a significant healthcare challenge. Despite its pressing development, important questions remain on how to model the development of multimorbidity. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset from approximately 45 million hospital stays spanning 17 years in Austria, we propose a compartmental model, traditionally used in infectious diseases, describing chronic disease trajectories across 132 distinct multimorbidity patterns (compartments). Our compartmental disease trajectory model (CDTM) forecasts changes in the incidence of 131 diagnostic groups and their combinations until 2030, highlighting patterns involving hypertensive diseases with cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders. We additionally use the model to pinpoint specific diagnoses with the greatest potential for preventive interventions to promote healthy aging. According to our model, a 5% reduction in new cases of hypertensive disease (I10-I15) leads to a 0.57 (0.06)% reduction in all-cause mortality over a 15-year period, and a 0.57 (0.07)% reduction in mortality for malignant neoplasms (C00-C97). Furthermore, we use the model to assess the long-term consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on hospitalizations, revealing earlier and more frequent hospitalizations across multiple diagnoses. Our fully data-driven approach identifies leverage points for proactive preparation by physicians and policymakers to reduce the overall disease burden in the population, emphasizing a shift toward patient-centered care.</description>

      <title>Social Dynamics of Consumer Response: A Unified Framework Integrating Statistical Physics and Marketing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how consumers react to advertising inputs is essential for marketers aiming to optimize advertising strategies and improve campaign effectiveness. This study examines the complex nature of consumer behaviour by applying theoretical frameworks derived from physics and social psychology. We present an innovative equation that captures the relation between spending on advertising and consumer response, using concepts such as symmetries, scaling laws, and phase transitions. By validating our equation against well-known models such as the Michaelis-Menten and Hill equations, we prove its effectiveness in accurately representing the complexity of consumer response dynamics. The analysis emphasizes the importance of key model parameters, such as marketing effectiveness, response sensitivity, and behavioural sensitivity, in influencing consumer behaviour. The work explores the practical implications for advertisers and marketers, as well as discussing the limitations and future research directions. In summary, this study provides a thorough framework for comprehending and forecasting consumer reactions to advertising, which has implications for optimizing advertising strategies and allocating resources.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cooperation in networks with well-connected cooperators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.05923v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperative behavior constitutes a key aspect of human society and non-human animal systems, but explaining how cooperation evolves represents a major scientific challenge. It is now well established that social network structure plays a central role for the viability of cooperation. However, not much is known about the importance of the positions of cooperators in the networks for the evolution of cooperation. Here, we investigate how the spread of cooperation is affected by correlations between cooperativeness and individual social connectedness (such that cooperators occupy well-connected network positions). Using simulation models, we find that these correlations enhance cooperation in standard scale-free networks but not in standard Poisson networks. In contrast, when degree assortativity is increased such that individuals cluster with others of similar social connectedness, we find that Poisson networks can maintain high levels of cooperation, which can even exceed those of scale-free networks. We show that this is due to dynamics where bridge areas between social clusters act as barriers to the spread of defection. We also find that this positive effect on cooperation is sensitive to the presence of Trojan horses (defectors placed within cooperator clusters), which allow defection to invade. The results provide new knowledge about the conditions under which cooperation may evolve, and are also relevant to consider in regard to the design of cooperation studies.</description>
