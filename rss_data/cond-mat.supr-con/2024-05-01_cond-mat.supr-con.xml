      <title>Investigating the superconducting state of 2$H$-NbS$_2$ as seen by the vortex lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2$H$-NbS$_2$ is a classic example of an anisotropic multi-band superconductor, with significant recent work focussing on the interesting responses seen when high magnetic fields are applied precisely parallel to the hexagonal niobium planes. It is often contrasted with its sister compound 2$H$-NbSe$_2$ because they have similar onset temperatures for superconductivity, but 2$H$-NbS$_2$ has no charge density wave whereas in 2$H$-NbSe$_2$ the charge density wave order couples strongly to the superconductivity. Using small-angle neutron scattering, a bulk-sensitive probe, we have studied the vortex lattice and how it responds to the underlying superconducting anisotropy. This is done by controlling the orientation of the field with respect to the Nb planes. The superconducting anisotropy, $\Gamma_{ac} = 7.07 \pm 0.2$, is found to be field independent over the range measured (0.15 to 1.25 T), and the magnetic field distribution as a function of the applied magnetic field is found to be in excellent quantitative agreement with anisotropic London theory modified with a core-size cut-off correction, providing the first complete validation of this model. We find values of $\lambda_{ab} = 141.9 \pm 1.5 $ nm for the in-plane London penetration depth, and $\lambda_{c} \sim$ 1 \textmu m for the out-of-plane response. The field-independence indicates that we are primarily sampling the larger of the two gaps generating the superconductivity in this material.</description>

      <title>Origin of Superconductivity in Rhombohedral Trilayer Graphene: Quasiparticle Pairing within the Inter-Valley Coherent Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity (SC) is observed in rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG) with an extremely low charge carrier densities, between the normal metal state and a probable inter-valley coherent (IVC) state. The measured coherence length in RTG is roughly two orders of magnitude shorter than the value predicted by a conventional BCS theory. To resolve these discrepancies, we propose that the RTG SC phase arises from the pairing of quasiparticles within the IVC phase. We illustrate the SC behavior using gapped Dirac cones with the chemical potential close to the conduction band's bottom and establish the Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our findings indicate that the mean-field transition temperature, $T_\mathrm{MF}$, is primarily determined by the density of states of quasiparticles within the IVC phase, and is more suppressed in comparison with the BCS relation. Interestingly, we discover that the coherence length behaves according to $\xi\sim 1/\sqrt{T_\mathrm{MF}}$. When the chemical potential lies within the band gap, the conventional coherence length becomes small, while the quantum metric contribution can diverge. Applying our approach to a microscopic model for RTG, our predictions align well with experimental data and effectively capture key measurable features of quantities such as the mean-field transition temperature $T_\mathrm{MF}$ and the coherence length $\xi$. Furthermore, we reveal that the quantum metric contribution, stemming from the multi-band properties of the IVC quasiparticles, plays a significant role in determining the coherence length around the transition regime from superconductivity to IVC. Lastly, experimental predictions are discussed on bebaviors of the upper critical field and coherence length at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic response of spinful Majorana fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A remarkable feature of topological superconductors is the emergence of Majorana fermions in electron systems. Whereas the emergent Majorana fermions share the self-anti-particle property with Majorana fermions in particle physics, they may have essentially different electromagnetic properties. In this paper, we argue the electromagnetic response of spinful Majorana fermions in topological superconductors. We present a general theory of the electromagnetic response of spinful Majorana fermions in topological superconductors and clarify how the pairing symmetry is encoded in the electromagnetic response. As an application, we predict the sublattice-dependent dipole (Ising)-type magnetic response of corner Majorana fermions in iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Observation of two-level critical-state in a van-der-Waals superconductor Pt(Bi$_{1-x}$Se$_x$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trigonal PtBi$_2$ is one of the attractive van-der-Waals materials because of the enhancement of its superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm{c}}$ by doping chalcogen elements such as Se and Te. Recently, it has been reported that $T_{\rm{c}}$ of Pt(Bi$_{1-x}$Se$_x$)$_2$ is enhanced by a factor of 4, compared to the pristine PtBi$_2$, together with the polar-nonpolar structural phase transition. Thus, it is desirable to study electrical transport properties for this new superconducting compound. Here, we have performed magnetotransport measurements for Pt(Bi$_{1-x}$Se$_x$)$_2$ ($x$ = 0.06 and 0.08) thin-film devices and have observed a peculiar magnetoresistance where a finite hysteresis appears when the superconducting state is broken. By measuring the magnetoresistance systematically, we have attributed this magnetoresistance to the two-level critical-state where fluxons pinned in Pt(Bi$_{1-x}$Se$_x$)$_2$ play an important role.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal electrodynamics and the penetration depth of superconducting Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal quasiparticles in a clean type-II superconductor with line nodes give rise to a quadratic low-temperature change of the penetration depth, $\Delta \lambda \sim T^2$, as first shown by Kosztin and Leggett [I. Kosztin and A. J. Leggett, Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 135 (1997)]. Here, we generalize this result to multiple nodes and compare it to numerically exact evaluations of the temperature-dependent penetration depth in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ using a high-precision tight-binding model. We compare the calculations to recent penetration depth measurements in high purity single crystals of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ [J. F. Landaeta et al., arXiv:2312.05129]. When assuming the order parameter to have $\mathrm{B}_{1\mathrm{g}}$ symmetry, we find that both a simple $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave and complicated gap structures with contributions from higher harmonics and accidental nodes can accommodate the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of the surface superconducting Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trigonal PtBi$_2$ is a layered semimetal without inversion symmetry, featuring 12 Weyl points in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. Its topological Fermi arcs were recently shown to superconduct at low temperatures where bulk superconductivity is absent. Here, we perform first-principles calculations to investigate in detail the bulk and surface electronic structure of PtBi$_2$, and obtain the spin texture as well as the momentum-dependent localization of the arcs. Motivated by the experimentally observed recovery of inversion symmetry under pressure or upon doping, we interpolate between the two structures and determine the energy and momentum dependence of the Weyl nodes. For deeper insights into the surface superconductivity of PtBi$_2$, we construct a symmetry-adapted effective four-band model that accurately reproduces the Weyl points of PtBi$_2$. We supplement this model with an analysis of the symmetry-allowed pairings between the Fermi arcs, which naturally mix spin-singlet and spin-triplet channels. Moreover, the presence of surface-only superconductivity facilitates an intrinsic superconductor-semimetal-superconductor Josephson junction, with the semimetallic phase sandwiched between the two superconducting surfaces. For a phase difference of $\pi$, zero-energy Andreev bound states develop between the two terminations.</description>

      <title>Density-wave-like gap evolution in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure revealed by ultrafast optical spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the quasiparticle dynamics in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ crystal using ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy at high pressure up to 34.2 GPa. At ambient pressure, the temperature dependence of relaxation indicates appearance of phonon bottleneck effect due to the opening of density-wave-like gap at 151 K. By analyzing the data with RT model, we identified the energy scale of the gap to be 70 meV at ambient pressure. The relaxation bottleneck effect is suppressed gradually by the pressure and disappears around 26 GPa. At high pressure above 29.4 GPa, we discover a new density-wave like order with transition temperature of $\sim$130 K. Our results not only provide the first experimental evidence of the density-wave like gap evolution under high pressure, but also offering insight into the underline interplay between the density wave order and superconductivity in pressured La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Composite antiferromagnetic and orbital order with altermagnetic properties at a cuprate/manganite interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures from complex oxides allow one to combine various electronic and magnetic orders as to induce new quantum states. A prominent example is the coupling between superconducting and magnetic orders in multilayers from high-Tc cuprates and manganites. A key role is played here by the interfacial CuO2 layer whose distinct properties remain to be fully understood. Here, we study with resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) the magnon excitations of this interfacial CuO2 layer. In particular, we show that the underlying antiferromagnetic exchange interaction at the interface is strongly suppressed to J ~ 70 meV, as compared to J ~ 130 meV for the CuO2 layers away from the interface. Moreover, we observe an anomalous momentum dependence of the intensity of the interfacial magnon mode and show that it suggests that the antiferromagnetic order is accompanied by a particular kind of orbital order that yields a so-called altermagnetic state. Such a two-dimensional altermagnet has recently been predicted to enable new spintronic applications and superconducting proximity effects.</description>

      <title>Signature of long-ranged spin triplets across a two-dimensional superconductor/helimagnet van der Waals interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combination of a superconductor with a magnetically inhomogeneous material has been established as an efficient mechanism for the generation of long-ranged spin-polarized (spin-triplet) Cooper pairs. Evidence for this mechanism, however, has been established based on studies done on three-dimensional systems, where the strong bonds existing at the interface between the superconductor and the magnetic material should in principle enhance proximity effects and strengthen any electronic correlations. Here, we fabricate devices based on van der Waals stacks of flakes of the two-dimensional superconductor $NbS_2$ combined with flakes of $Cr_{1/3}NbS_2$, which has a built-in magnetic inhomogeneity due to its helimagnetic spin texture at low temperatures. We find that the critical temperature of these vdW bilayers is strongly dependent on the magnetic state of $Cr_{1/3}NbS_2$, whose degree of magnetic inhomogeneity can be controlled via an applied magnetic field. Our results demonstrate evidence for the generation of long-ranged spin-triplet pairs across the $Cr_{1/3}NbS_2$/$NbS_2$ vdW interface.</description>

Abstract: Bogoliubov quasiparticles play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of a superconductor, and in achieving reliable operations of superconducting quantum circuits. Diagnosis of quasiparticle poisoning at the nanoscale provides invaluable benefits in designing superconducting qubits. Here, we use scanning tunneling noise microscopy to locally quantify quasiparticles by measuring the effective charge. Using the vortex lattice as a model system, we directly visualize the spatial variation of the quasiparticle concentration around superconducting vortices, which can be described within the Ginzburg-Landau framework. This shows a direct, noninvasive approach for the atomic-scale detection of relative quasiparticle concentration as small as 10-4 in various superconducting qubit systems. Our results alert of a quick increase in quasiparticle concentration with decreasing intervortex distance in vortex-based Majorana qubits.</description>

      <title>Feasible route to high-temperature ambient-pressure hydride superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge in materials discovery is to find high-temperature superconductors. Hydrogen and hydride materials have long been considered promising materials displaying conventional phonon-mediated superconductivity. However, the high pressures required to stabilize these materials have restricted their application. Here, we present results from high-throughput computation, considering a wide range of high-symmetry ternary hydrides from across the periodic table at ambient pressure. This large composition space is then reduced by considering thermodynamic, dynamic, and magnetic stability, before direct estimations of the superconducting critical temperature. This approach has revealed a metastable ambient-pressure hydride superconductor, Mg$_2$IrH$_6$, with a predicted critical temperature of 160 K, comparable to the highest temperature superconducting cuprates. We propose a synthesis route via a structurally related insulator, Mg$_2$IrH$_7$, which is thermodynamically stable above 15 GPa and discuss the potential challenges in doing so.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) intrinsic superconductors with nontrivial topological band and vertical ferroelectricity exhibit fascinating characteristics to achieving electrostatic control of quantum phases. While, only a few such 2D materials have been theoretically predicted. In this work, based on first principles calculations, we explore the superconductivity and ferroelectric properties in fluorinated 2D Nb2N. In the stable Nb2NF2, H3-Nb2NF2 breaks the spatial inversion symmetry, exhibiting vertical ferroelectric. More interestingly, it not only possesses intrinsic superconductivity with superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) of 10 K, but also exhibits nontrivial band topology. While, H1-Nb2NF2 shows topological band and superconductivity with Tc of 32 K, surpassing most of 2D conventional topological superconductors' candidates. Our research has enriched 2D superconducting materials with nontrivial band topology and ferroelectric properties, and provided a theoretical basis for the preparation of devices switching between superconducting and ferroelectric states with external electric field.</description>

      <title>Scheme for braiding Majorana zero modes in vortices using an STT-matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently conducted experiments on two-dimensional topological superconductors have revealed various indications of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, progress in the manipulation of MZM braiding has been limited, impeding the realization of topological quantum computing. In this study, we propose a potential braiding scheme based on a spintronic device matrix. This scheme involves utilizing a matrix composed of spin-transfer torque devices (STT-matrix) alongside a two-dimensional topological superconductor material. By programming the ON/OFF states of the spintronic devices within the STT-matrix, it becomes possible to manipulate vortices hosting MZMs in the two-dimensional topological superconductor. To further investigate this concept, we construct a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model and perform numerical simulations to analyze vortex-driving dynamics, MZM braiding processes, and MZM fusion phenomena. Our findings demonstrate that this system exhibits high versatility and flexibility in manipulating vortices. With advancements in spintronic device technology, our proposed scheme offers a feasible and practical method for operating MZMs within vortices present in topological superconductors.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a versatile class of quantum materials of interest to various fields including, e.g., nanoelectronics, optical devices, and topological and correlated quantum matter. Tailoring the electronic properties of TMDs is essential to their applications in many directions. Here, we report that a highly controllable and uniform on-chip 2D metallization process converts a class of atomically thin TMDs into robust superconductors, a property belonging to none of the starting materials. As examples, we demonstrate the introduction of superconductivity into a class of 2D air-sensitive topological TMDs, including monolayers of Td-WTe2, 1T'-MoTe2 and 2H-MoTe2, as well as their natural and twisted bilayers, metalized with an ultrathin layer of Palladium. This class of TMDs are known to exhibit intriguing topological phases ranging from topological insulator, Weyl semimetal to fractional Chern insulator. The unique, high-quality two-dimensional metallization process is based on our recent findings of the long-distance, non-Fickian in-plane mass transport and chemistry in 2D that occur at relatively low temperatures and in devices fully encapsulated with inert insulating layers. Highly compatible with existing nanofabrication techniques for van der Waals (vdW) stacks, our results offer a route to designing and engineering superconductivity and topological phases in a class of correlated 2D materials.</description>
