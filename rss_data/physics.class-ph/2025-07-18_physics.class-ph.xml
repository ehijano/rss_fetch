      <title>A New Framework for Unidimensional Structures Based on Generalised Continua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work introduces a family of beam models derived from a three-dimensional higher-order elasticity framework. By incorporating three kinematic fields - the macroscopic displacement u, the micro-distortion tensor P, and the third-order tensor N - the study systematically explores three regimes: holonomic, semi-holonomic, and non-holonomic. These regimes correspond to varying levels of kinematic constraints, ranging from classical elasticity to a fully relaxed model. The holonomic case reduces to a higher-order Euler--Bernoulli beam model, while the semi-holonomic case generalises the Timoshenko beam model. The non-holonomic case provides a unified framework that naturally incorporates both dislocations and disclinations. Furthermore, the holonomic and semi-holonomic models are shown to emerge as singular limits of the non-holonomic model by increasing specific penalty coefficients. Simplified ordinary differential equation systems are derived for specific cases, such as pure traction and bending, illustrating the practical applicability of the models. The results highlight the hierarchical structure of the proposed framework and its ability to capture material defects in beam-like structures.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics in Matter from First Principles: A Unified and Consistent Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For over a century, classical electrodynamics in matter has been plagued by paradoxes and competing formulations for force and energy-momentum. Foundational theories, including those of Minkowski, Abraham, and conventional textbook approaches, are demonstrably inconsistent, most notably in their failure to account for energy dissipation. This manuscript resolves these long-standing controversies by returning to a single, unshakable axiom of mechanics: that a physical force must act upon a well-defined mass.
  From this first principle, we derive a decisive \textbf{Force-Energy Consistency Criterion}. Application of this criterion reveals that all major historical formulations are physically untenable, as each suffers from a broken link between its postulated force and energy terms. This failure is traced to a flawed "arbitrary partition" paradigm and, at the deepest level, to a microscopic absurdity of placing force where there is no mass. Furthermore, we prove that the quest for a unique local force density is itself misguided, as this quantity is fundamentally indeterminable in any macroscopic theory due to information loss during spatial averaging.
  This systematic deconstruction reveals that a single, consistent formulation uniquely emerges from fundamental laws. In this framework, the field is described by the universal vacuum-form energy-momentum tensor, $T^{\mu\nu}_{EM}(\mathbf{E},\mathbf{B})$, and its interaction with matter is governed solely by the total Lorentz force on all charges. This approach provides a complete, relativistically sound, and physically unambiguous foundation for the classical electrodynamics of matter.</description>
