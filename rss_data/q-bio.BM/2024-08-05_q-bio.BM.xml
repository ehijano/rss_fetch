      <title>Peptide Sequencing Via Protein Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a protein language model for determining the complete sequence of a peptide based on measurement of a limited set of amino acids. To date, protein sequencing relies on mass spectrometry, with some novel edman degregation based platforms able to sequence non-native peptides. Current protein sequencing techniques face limitations in accurately identifying all amino acids, hindering comprehensive proteome analysis. Our method simulates partial sequencing data by selectively masking amino acids that are experimentally difficult to identify in protein sequences from the UniRef database. This targeted masking mimics real-world sequencing limitations. We then modify and finetune a ProtBert derived transformer-based model, for a new downstream task predicting these masked residues, providing an approximation of the complete sequence. Evaluating on three bacterial Escherichia species, we achieve per-amino-acid accuracy up to 90.5% when only four amino acids ([KCYM]) are known. Structural assessment using AlphaFold and TM-score validates the biological relevance of our predictions. The model also demonstrates potential for evolutionary analysis through cross-species performance. This integration of simulated experimental constraints with computational predictions offers a promising avenue for enhancing protein sequence analysis, potentially accelerating advancements in proteomics and structural biology by providing a probabilistic reconstruction of the complete protein sequence from limited experimental data.</description>

      <title>Learning Structurally Stabilized Representations for Multi-modal Lossless DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Reed-Solomon coded single-stranded representation learning (RSRL), a novel end-to-end model for learning representations for multi-modal lossless DNA storage. In contrast to existing learning-based methods, the proposed RSRL is inspired by both error-correction codec and structural biology. Specifically, RSRL first learns the representations for the subsequent storage from the binary data transformed by the Reed-Solomon codec. Then, the representations are masked by an RS-code-informed mask to focus on correcting the burst errors occurring in the learning process. With the decoded representations with error corrections, a novel biologically stabilized loss is formulated to regularize the data representations to possess stable single-stranded structures. By incorporating these novel strategies, the proposed RSRL can learn highly durable, dense, and lossless representations for the subsequent storage tasks into DNA sequences. The proposed RSRL has been compared with a number of strong baselines in real-world tasks of multi-modal data storage. The experimental results obtained demonstrate that RSRL can store diverse types of data with much higher information density and durability but much lower error rates.</description>

      <title>Free energy, rates, and mechanism of transmembrane dimerization in lipid bilayers from dynamically unbiased molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The assembly of proteins in membranes plays a key role in many crucial cellular pathways. Despite their importance, characterizing transmembrane assembly remains challenging for experiments and simulations. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations do not cover the time scales required to sample the typical transmembrane assembly. Hence, most studies rely on enhanced sampling schemes that steer the dynamics of transmembrane proteins along a collective variable that should encode all slow degrees of freedom. However, given the complexity of the condensed-phase lipid environment, this is far from trivial, with the consequence that free energy profiles of dimerization can be poorly converged. Here, we introduce an alternative approach, which relies only on simulating short, dynamically unbiased trajectory segments, avoiding using collective variables or biasing forces. By merging all trajectories, we obtain free energy profiles, rates, and mechanisms of transmembrane dimerization with the same set of simulations. We showcase our algorithm by sampling the spontaneous association and dissociation of a transmembrane protein in a lipid bilayer, the popular coarse-grained Martini force field. Our algorithm represents a promising way to investigate assembly processes in biologically relevant membranes, overcoming some of the challenges of conventional methods.</description>
