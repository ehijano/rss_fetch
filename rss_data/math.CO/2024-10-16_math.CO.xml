      <title>Clique factors in randomly perturbed graphs: the transition points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A randomly perturbed graph $G^p = G_\alpha \cup G(n,p)$ is obtained by taking a deterministic $n$-vertex graph $G_\alpha = (V, E)$ with minimum degree $\delta(G)\geq \alpha n$ and adding the edges of the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$ defined on the same vertex set $V$. For which value $p$ (depending on $\alpha$) does the graph $G^p$ contain a $K_r$-factor (a spanning collection of vertex-disjoint $K_r$-copies) with high probability? The order of magnitude of the minimal value of $p$ has been determined whenever $\alpha \neq 1- \frac{s}{r}$ for an integer $s$ (see Han, Morris, and Treglown [RSA, 2021] and Balogh, Treglown, and Wagner [CPC, 2019]).
  We establish the minimal probability $p_s$ (up to a constant factor) for all values of $\alpha = 1-\frac{s}{r} \leq \frac 12$, and show that the threshold exhibits a polynomial jump at $\alpha = 1-\frac{s}{r}$ compared to the surrounding intervals. An extremal example $G_{\alpha}$ which shows that $p_s$ is optimal up to a constant factor differs from the previous (usually multipartite) examples in containing a pseudorandom induced subgraph.</description>

      <title>Abelian groups with 3-chromatic Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an abelian group. The main theorem of this paper asserts that there exists a Cayley graph on $G$ with chromatic number 3 if and only if $G$ is not of exponent 1, 2, or 4. Although motivated by ideas from algebraic topology, our proof may be expressed purely combinatorially. As a by-product, we derive a topological result which is of independent interest. Suppose $X$ is a connected non-bipartite graph, and let $\mathcal N(X)$ denote its neighborhood complex. We show that if the fundamental group $\pi_1(\mathcal N(X))$ or first homology group $H_1(\mathcal N(X))$ is torsion, then the chromatic number of $X$ is at least 4. This strengthens a classical result of Lov\'asz, which derives the same conclusion if $\pi_1(\mathcal N(X))$ is trivial.</description>

      <title>The minimum size and maximum diameter of an edge-pancyclic graph of a given order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-cycle in a graph is a cycle of length $k.$ A graph $G$ of order $n$ is called edge-pancyclic if for every integer $k$ with $3\le k\le n,$ every edge of $G$ lies in a $k$-cycle. It seems difficult to determine the minimum size $f(n)$ of a simple edge-pancyclic graph of order $n.$ We give lower and upper bounds on $f(n),$ and determine the maximum diameter of such a graph. In the $3$-connected case, the precise value of $f(n)$ is determined. We also determine the minimum size of a graph of a given order with connectivity conditions in which every edge lies in a triangle.</description>

      <title>Partite saturation number of cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $H$ is said to be $F$-saturated relative to $G$, if $H$ does not contain any copy of $F$ but the addition of any edge $e$ in $E(G)\backslash E(H)$ would create a copy of $F$. The minimum size of a $F$-saturated graph relative to $G$ is denoted by $sat(G,F)$. We use $sat(n,k,F)$ to denote the partite saturation number $sat(K_{k \times n},F)$, where $K_{k \times n}$ is the complete $k$-partite graph with $n$ vertices in each part. In this paper we prove that $sat(n,k, C_{\ell+1})= kn + O(\ell^2)$ holds for all $\ell \geq k \geq 3$, and $sat(n,k, C_{\ell+1})= kn + O(\ell)$ holds for $\ell \geq 60k+11$. Also we determine the exact value of $sat(n,k, C_{\ell+1})$ for all $4 \geq \ell \geq k \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>A generalization of the Askey-Wilson relations using a projective geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalization of the Askey-Wilson relations that involves a projective geometry. A projective geometry is defined as follows. Let $h&gt;k\geq 1$ denote integers. Let $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ denote a finite field with $q$ elements. Let $\mathcal{V}$ denote an $(h+k)$-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. Let the set $P$ consist of the subspaces of $\mathcal{V}$. The set $P$, together with the inclusion partial order, is a poset called a projective geometry. We define a matrix $A\in \text{Mat}_{P}(\mathbb{C})$ as follows. For $u,v\in P$, the $(u,v)$-entry of $A$ is $1$ if each of $u,v$ covers $u\cap v$, and $0$ otherwise. Fix $y\in P$ with $\dim y=k$. We define a diagonal matrix $A^*\in \text{Mat}_{P}(\mathbb{C})$ as follows. For $u\in P$, the $(u,u)$-entry of $A^{*}$ is $q^{\dim(u\cap y)}$. We show that \begin{align*}
  &amp;A^2A^{*}-\bigl(q+q^{-1}\bigr)AA^{*}A+A^{*}A^{2}-\mathcal{Y}\bigl(AA^{*}+A^{*}A\bigr)-\mathcal{P} A^{*}=\Omega A+G, \newline
  &amp;A^{*2}A-\bigl(q+q^{-1}\bigr) A^*AA^*+AA^{*2}=\mathcal{Y}A^{*2}+\Omega A^{*}+G^{*}, \end{align*} where $\mathcal{Y}, \mathcal{P}, \Omega, G, G^*$ are matrices in $\text{Mat}_{P}(\mathbb{C})$ that commute with each of $A, A^*$. We give precise formulas for $\mathcal{Y}, \mathcal{P}, \Omega, G, G^*$.</description>

      <title>Tropicalizing Principal Minors of Positive Definite Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the tropicalization of the image of the cone of positive definite matrices under the principal minors map. It is a polyhedral subset of the set of $M$-concave functions on the discrete $n$-dimensional cube. We show it coincides with the intersection of the affine tropical flag variety with the submodular cone. In particular, any cell in the regular subdivision of the cube induced by a point in this tropicalization can be subdivided into base polytopes of realizable matroids. We also use this tropicalization as a guide to discover new algebraic inequalities among the principal minors of positive definite matrices of a fixed size.</description>

      <title>The Generation of All Regular Rational Orthogonal Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A \emph{rational orthogonal matrix} $Q$ is an orthogonal matrix with rational entries, and $Q$ is called \emph{regular} if each of its row sum equals one, i.e., $Qe = e$ where $e$ is the all-one vector. This paper presents a method for generating all regular rational orthogonal matrices using the classic Cayley transformation. Specifically, we demonstrate that for any regular rational orthogonal matrix $Q$, there exists a permutation matrix $P$ such that $QP$ does not possess an eigenvalue of $-1$. Consequently, $Q$ can be expressed in the form $Q = (I_n + S)^{-1}(I_n - S)P$, where $I_n$ is the identity matrix of order $n$, $S$ is a rational skew-symmetric matrix satisfying $Se = 0$, and $P$ is a permutation matrix. Central to our approach is a pivotal intermediate result, which holds independent interest: given a square matrix $M$, then $MP$ has $-1$ as an eigenvalue for every permutation matrix $P$ if and only if either every row sum of $M$ is $-1$ or every column sum of $M$ is $-1$.</description>

      <title>Maximal and maximum induced matchings in connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An induced matching in a graph is a set of edges whose endpoints induce a $1$-regular subgraph. Gupta et al. (2012,\cite{Gupta}) showed that every $n$-vertex graph has at most $10^{\frac{n}{5}}\approx 1.5849^n$ maximal induced matchings, which is attained by the disjoint union of copies of the complete graph $K_5$.
  In this paper, we show that the maximum number of maximal and maximum induced matchings in a connected graph of order $n$ is \begin{align*} \begin{cases} {n\choose 2} &amp;~ {\rm if}~ 1\leq n\le 8; \\ {{\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor}\choose 2}\cdot {{\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil}\choose 2} -(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor-1)\cdot (\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil-1)+1 &amp;~ {\rm if}~ 9\leq n\le 13; \\ 10^{\frac{n-1}{5}}+\frac{n+144}{30}\cdot 6^{\frac{n-6}{5}} &amp;~ {\rm if}~ 14\leq n\le 30;\\ 10^{\frac{n-1}{5}}+\frac{n-1}{5}\cdot 6^{\frac{n-6}{5}} &amp; ~ {\rm if}~ n\geq 31, \\ \end{cases} \end{align*} and also show that this bound is tight. This result implies that we can enumerate all maximal induced matchings of an $n$-vertex connected graph in time $O(1.5849^n)$. Moreover, our result provides an estimate on the number of maximal dissociation sets of an $n$-vertex connected graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An interaction is a certain symmetric graph that describes the possible transition of states of adjacent sites of large-scale interacting systems. In the series of studies Bannai-Kametani-Sasada arXiv:2009.04699, Bannai-Sasada arXiv:2111.08934, they defined the notion of the irreducibly quantified interactions which is suitable for considering the hydrodynamic limits via the conserved quantities. In this paper, we prove that the property that an interaction is irreducibly quantified is decidable.</description>

      <title>Cayley graphs on symmetric groups generated by $n$-cycles are hyperenergetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a simple graph with $n$ vertices. The energy of $\Gamma$, denoted by $\mathcal{E}(\Gamma)$, is defined as the sum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of $\Gamma$. The graph $\Gamma$ is said to be hyperenergetic if $\mathcal{E}(\Gamma)&gt;2n-2$. For the graph $\Gamma$, the multiplicity of the eigenvalue $0$, denoted by $\eta(\Gamma)$, is called the nullity of $\Gamma$. In this paper, we show that for every positive integer $n\geq 4$, the Cayley graph $\Gamma_n$ on the symmetric group $\mathrm{Sym}(n)$ generated by $n$-cycles is an integral hyperenergetic graph with $\mathcal{E}(\Gamma_n)=2^{n-1}(n-1)!$ and $\eta(\Gamma_n)=n!-\binom{2n-2}{n-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, given a rank 3 affine root system $\Phi$ with Weyl group $W$, there is a unique oriented matroid structure on $\Phi$ which is $W$-equivariant and restricts to the usual matroid structure on rank 2 subsystems. Such oriented matroids were called oriented matroid root systems in Dyer-Wang (2021), and are known to be non-unique in higher rank. We also show uniqueness for any finite root system or "clean" rank 3 root system (which conjecturally includes all rank 3 root systems).</description>

      <title>On two notions of total positivity for generalized partial flag varieties of classical Lie types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Grassmannians, Lusztig's notion of total positivity coincides with positivity of the Plucker coordinates. This coincidence underpins the rich interaction between matroid theory, tropical geometry, and the theory of total positivity. Bloch and Karp furthermore characterized the (type A) partial flag varieties for which the two notions positivity similarly coincide. We characterize the symplectic (type C) and odd-orthogonal (type B) partial flag varieties for which Lusztig's total positivity coincides with Plucker positivity.</description>

      <title>Adinkra height functions and the Jacobian of a generalized Fermat curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adinkras are highly structured graphs developed to study 1-dimensional supersymmetry algebras. A cyclic ordering of the edge colors of an Adinkra, or rainbow, determines a Riemann surface and a height function on the vertices of the Adinkra determines a divisor on this surface. We study the induced map from height functions to divisors on the Jacobian of the Riemann surface. In the first nontrivial case, a 5-dimensional hypercube corresponding to a Jacobian given by a product of 5 elliptic curves each with $j$-invariant 2048, we develop and characterize a purely combinatorial algorithm to compute height function images. We show that when restricted to a single elliptic curve, every height function is a multiple of a specified generating divisor, and raising and lowering vertices corresponds to adding or subtracting this generator. We also give strict bounds on the coefficients of this generator that appear in the collection of all divisors of height functions.</description>

Abstract: A recurring task in particle physics and statistics is to compute the complex critical points of a product of powers of affine-linear functions. The logarithmic discriminant characterizes exponents for which such a function has a degenerate critical point in the corresponding hyperplane arrangement complement. We study properties of this discriminant, exploiting its connection with the Hurwitz form of a reciprocal linear space.</description>

      <title>Probability that $n$ points are in convex position in a general convex polygon: Asymptotic results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{P}_K(n)$ be the probability that $n$ points $z_1,\ldots,z_n$ picked uniformly and independently in $K$, a non-flat compact convex polygon in $\mathbb{R}^2$, are in convex position, that is, form the vertex set of a convex polygon. In this paper, we give an equivalent of $\mathbb{P}_K(n)$ when $n\to\infty$. This improves on a famous result of B\'ar\'any (yet valid for a general convex domain $K$) and a result we initiated in the case where $K$ is a regular convex polygon.</description>

      <title>On Vu's theorem in Waring's problem for thinner sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k\in \mathbb{N}$ and $s\geq k(\log k+3.20032)$, and assume that $\psi, \varphi$ are increasing functions tending to infinity with $\psi(x)=o(\log x)$ and such that $\psi(n)\sim\psi\big(n/\varphi(n)\big).$ Then, there exists a subsequence $\mathfrak{X}_{k}\subset \mathbb{N}_{0}^{k}$ of the set of $k$-th powers of nonnegative integers for which the number of representations of each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ as $$n=x_{1}^{k}+\ldots+x_{s}^{k}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ x_{i}^{k}\in\mathfrak{X}_{k},$$ which we denote by $R_{s}(n;\mathfrak{X}_{k})$, satisfies the asymptotic formula $$ R_{s}(n;\mathfrak{X}_{k})\sim \mathfrak{S}(n)\psi(n)$$ for almost all natural numbers, with $\mathfrak{S}(n)$ being the singular series associated to Waring's problem. Moreover, the arguments herein show very roughly speaking for $k\geq 14$ that whenever current technology from the Hardy-Littlewod method permits one to show that all large integers are the sum of $T(k)$ $k$-th powers of natural numbers then there exist for every $s\geq T(k)$ a subsequence $\mathfrak{X}_{k,1}\subset \mathbb{N}_{0}^{k}$ for which the above formula holds for almost all $n\in [X,X+\log X]$ as $X\to\infty$, and $\mathfrak{X}_{k,2}\subset \mathbb{N}_{0}^{k}$ with $R_{s}(n;\mathfrak{X}_{k,2})\asymp \log n$ for every sufficiently large $n$. The latter conclusion sharpens a result of Wooley and addresses a question of Vu.</description>

      <title>Computing the Dimension of a Bipartition Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.05799v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dimension of a bipartition matrix (BPM) is the sum of the dimensions of its indecomposable factors. The dimension of an indecomposable BPM is the sum of its row, column, and entry dimensions. To compute these dimensions, we apply four routines of independent interest: (1) Factor a bipartition as a product of indecomposables; (2) recover a bipartition from its indecomposable factorization; (3) factor a BPM as a product of indecomposables; and (4) compute the ``transpose-rotation'' (the column dimension of a BPM is the row dimension of its transpose-rotation).</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Exploration: An algorithmic framework for enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial Exploration is a new domain-agnostic algorithmic framework to automatically and rigorously study the structure of combinatorial objects and derive their counting sequences and generating functions. We describe how it works and provide an open-source Python implementation. As a prerequisite, we build up a new theoretical foundation for combinatorial decomposition strategies and combinatorial specifications.
  We then apply Combinatorial Exploration to the domain of permutation patterns, to great effect. We rederive hundreds of results in the literature in a uniform manner and prove many new ones. These results can be found in a new public database, the Permutation Pattern Avoidance Library (PermPAL) at https://permpal.com. Finally, we give three additional proofs-of-concept, showing examples of how Combinatorial Exploration can prove results in the domains of alternating sign matrices, polyominoes, and set partitions.</description>

      <title>On generalized Ramsey numbers in the non-integral regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $(p,q)$-coloring of a graph $G$ is an edge-coloring of $G$ such that every $p$-clique receives at least $q$ colors. In 1975, Erd\H{o}s and Shelah introduced the generalized Ramsey number $f(n,p,q)$ which is the minimum number of colors needed in a $(p,q)$-coloring of $K_n$. In 1997, Erd\H{o}s and Gy\'arf\'as showed that $f(n,p,q)$ is at most a constant times $n^{\frac{p-2}{\binom{p}{2} - q + 1}}$. Very recently the first author, Dudek, and English improved this bound by a factor of $\log n^{\frac{-1}{\binom{p}{2} - q + 1}} $ for all $q \le \frac{p^2 - 26p + 55}{4}$, and they ask if this improvement could hold for a wider range of $q$.
  We answer this in the affirmative for the entire non-integral regime, that is, for all integers $p, q$ with $p-2$ not divisible by $\binom{p}{2} - q + 1$. Furthermore, we provide a simultaneous three-way generalization as follows: where $p$-clique is replaced by any fixed graph $F$ (with $|V(F)|-2$ not divisible by $|E(F)| - q + 1$); to list coloring; and to $k$-uniform hypergraphs. Our results are a new application of the Forbidden Submatching Method of the second and fourth authors.</description>

      <title>Local Configurations in Union-Closed Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Frankl or Union-Closed Sets conjecture states that for any finite union-closed family of sets $\mathcal{F}$ containing some nonempty set, there is some element $i$ in the ground set $U(\mathcal F) := \bigcup_{S \in \mathcal{F}} S$ of $\mathcal{F}$ such that $i$ is in at least half of the sets in $\mathcal{F}$. In this work, we find new values and bounds for the least integer $FC(k, n)$ such that any union-closed family containing $FC(k, n)$ distinct $k$-sets of an $n$-set $X$ satisfies Frankl's conjecture with an element of $X$. Additionally, we answer an older question of Vaughan regarding symmetry in union-closed families and we give a proof of a recent question posed by Ellis, Ivan and Leader. Finally, we introduce novel local configuration criteria through a generalization of Poonen's Theorem to prove the conjecture for many, previously unknown classes of families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a precise conjecture relating integral form partially-symmetric Macdonald polynomials and the parabolic flag Hilbert schemes of Carlsson, Gorsky, and Mellit. This extends, in an explicit fashion, Haiman's realization of modified Macdonald symmetric functions via Hilbert schemes of points in the plane. As evidence for our conjecture we prove that it is compatible with the action of certain elements in Carlsson and Mellit's algebra $\mathbb{A}_{t,q}$, including degree $1$ Pieri formulas.</description>

      <title>Cubic graphs with edges in exactly one perfect matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Petersen's seminal work in 1891 asserts that the edge-set of a cubic graph can be covered by distinct perfect matchings if and only if it is bridgeless. Actually, it is known that for a very large fraction of bridgeless cubic graphs, every edge belongs to at least two distinct perfect matchings. In this paper, we study the class of non-double covered cubic graphs, i.e.\ graphs having an edge, called lonely edge, which belongs to exactly one perfect matching. First of all, we provide a reduction of the problem to the subclass $\cal U$ of $3$-connected cubic graphs. Then, we furnish an inductive characterization of $\cal U$ and we study properties related to the count of lonely edges. In particular, denoting by $\mathcal{U}_k$ the subclass of graphs of $\cal U$ with exactly $k$ lonely edges, we prove that $\mathcal{U}_k$ is empty for $k&gt;6$, and we present a complete characterization for $3 \leq k \leq 6$. The paper concludes with some insights on ${\cal U}_1$ and ${\cal U}_2$.</description>

      <title>Chordal matroids arising from generalized parallel connections II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1961, Dirac showed that chordal graphs are exactly the graphs that can be constructed from complete graphs by a sequence of clique-sums. In an earlier paper, by analogy with Dirac's result, we introduced the class of $GF(q)$-chordal matroids as those matroids that can be constructed from projective geometries over $GF(q)$ by a sequence of generalized parallel connections across projective geometries over $GF(q)$. Our main result showed that when $q=2$, such matroids have no induced minor in $\{M(C_4),M(K_4)\}$. In this paper, we show that the class of $GF(2)$-chordal matroids coincides with the class of binary matroids that have none of $M(K_4)$, $M^*(K_{3,3})$, or $M(C_n)$ for $n\geq 4$ as a flat. We also show that $GF(q)$-chordal matroids can be characterized by an analogous result to Rose's 1970 characterization of chordal graphs as those that have a perfect elimination ordering of vertices.</description>

      <title>Solving systems of equations on antichains for the computation of the ninth Dedekind Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20904v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study systems of equations on antichains, together with a way to count the number of solutions. We start with a simple example, generalise and show more applications. One of the results was used in the recent computation of D(9), the others have potential to speed up existing techniques in the future.
  In fact, the result of two independent computations of D(9) were published nearly at the same time, in one of them the authors of the present paper were involved. D(n) counts the monotone Boolean functions or antichains on subsets of a set of n elements. The number rises doubly exponentially in the number of elements n, and until now no algorithm of a lower combinatorial complexity is known to compute D(n). In our computation, we use coefficients representing the number of solutions of a specific set of equations on antichains over a finite set. We refer to these coefficients as P-coefficients. These can be computed efficiently. In this paper, we generalise this coefficient and apply it to four different systems of equations. Finally we show how the coefficient was used in our computation of D(9), and how its generalisations can be used to compute D(n).</description>

      <title>Cycle Matroids of Graphings: From Convergence to Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent line of research has concentrated on exploring the links between analytic and combinatorial theories of submodularity, uncovering several key connections between them. In this context, Lov\'asz initiated the study of matroids from an analytic point of view and introduced the cycle matroid of a graphing. Motivated by the limit theory of graphs, the authors introduced a form of right-convergence, called quotient-convergence, for a sequence of submodular setfunctions, leading to a notion of convergence for matroids through their rank functions. In this paper, we study the connection between local-global convergence of graphs and quotient-convergence of their cycle matroids. We characterize the exposed points of associated convex sets, forming an analytic counterpart of matroid independence- and base-polytopes. Finally, we consider dual planar graphings and show that the cycle matroid of one is the cocycle matroid of its dual if and only if the underlying graphings are hyperfinite.</description>

      <title>Perfect coalition in graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \noindent A perfect dominating set in a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a subset $S \subseteq V$ such that each vertex in $V \setminus S$ has exactly one neighbor in $S$. A perfect coalition in $G$ consists of two disjoint sets of vertices $V_i$ and $V_j$ such that i) neither $V_i$ nor $V_j$ is a dominating set, ii) each vertex in $V(G) \setminus V_i$ has at most one neighbor in $V_i$ and each vertex in $V(G) \setminus V_j$ has at most one neighbor in $V_j$, and iii) $V_i \cup V_j$ is a perfect dominating set. A perfect coalition partition (abbreviated $prc$-partition) in a graph $G$ is a vertex partition $\pi= \lbrace V_1,V_2,\dots ,V_k \rbrace$ such that for each set $V_i$ of $\pi$ either $V_i$ is a singleton dominating set, or there exists a set $V_j \in \pi$ that forms a perfect coalition with $V_i$. In this paper, we initiate the study of perfect coalition partitions in graphs. We obtain a bound on the number of perfect coalitions involving each member of a perfect coalition partition, in terms of maximum degree. The perfect coalition of some special graphs are investigated. The graph $G$ with $\delta(G)=1$, the triangle-free graphs $G$ with prefect coalition number of order of $G$ and the trees $T$ with prefect coalition number in $\{n,n-1,n-2\}$ where $n=|V(T)|$ are characterized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $H$, we say a graph $G$ is properly rainbow $H$-saturated if there is a proper edge-coloring of $G$ which contains no rainbow copy of $H$, but adding any edge to $G$ makes such an edge-coloring impossible. The proper rainbow saturation number, denoted $\text{sat}^*(n,H)$, is the minimum number of edges in an $n$-vertex rainbow $H$-saturated graph. We determine the proper rainbow saturation number for paths up to an additive constant and asymptotically determine $\text{sat}^*(n,K_4)$. In addition, we bound $\text{sat}^*(n,H)$ when $H$ is a larger clique, tree of diameter at least 4, or odd cycle.</description>

      <title>A tower lower bound for the degree relaxation of the Regularity Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that if $(A,B)$ is an $\tfrac{\varepsilon}{2}$-regular pair (in the sense of Szemer\'edi) then there exist sets $A'\subset A$ and $B'\subset B'$ with $|A'|\leq \varepsilon|A|$ and $|B'|\leq \varepsilon|B|$ so that the degrees of all vertices in $A\setminus A'$ differ by at most $\varepsilon|B|$ and the degrees of all vertices in $B\setminus B'$ differ by at most $\varepsilon|A|$. We call such a property "$\varepsilon$-degularity". This leads to the notion of an "$\varepsilon$-degular" partition of a graph in the same way as the definition of $\varepsilon$-regular pairs leads to the notion of $\varepsilon$-regular partitions. We show that there exist graphs in which any $\varepsilon$-degular partition requires the number of clusters to be $\mathrm{tower}(\Theta(\varepsilon^{-1/3}))$. That is, even though degularity is a substantial relaxation of regularity, in general one cannot improve much on the bounds that come with Szemer\'edi's regularity lemma.</description>

      <title>Regions of Level $\ell$ of Catalan/Semiorder-Type Arrangements</title>

Abstract: By establishing a labeled Dyck path model for the regions of \(\mathcal{C}_{n,A}\) and \(\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*\), his paper explores several enumerative problems related to the number of regions of level \(\ell\), denoted as \(r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A})\) and \(r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*)\), which includes: \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)] proving a Stirling convolution relation between \(r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A})\) and \(r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*)\), refining a result by Stanley
  and Postnikov;
  \item[(2)] showing that the sequences $\left(r_\ell{(\mathcal{C}_{n,A})}\right)_{n\geq 0}$ and $(r_\ell {(\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*)})_{n\geq 0}$ exhibit properties
  of binomial type in the sense of Rota;
  \item[(3)] establishing the transformational significance of \(r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A})\) and \(r_{\ell}(\mathcal{C}_{n,A}^*)\) under Stanley's ESA framework:
  they can be viewed as transition matrices from binomial coefficients to their characteristic polynomials respectively. \end{enumerate} Further, we
  present two applications of the theories and methods: first, inspired by a question from Deshpande, Menon, and Sarkar, we provide a hyperplane arrangement
  counting interpretation of the two-parameter generalization of Fuss--Catalan numbers, which is closely related to the number of regions of level \(\ell\)
  in the \(m\)-Catalan arrangement. Second, using labeled Dyck paths to depict the number of regions in the \(m\)-Catalan arrangement, we algorithmically
  provide the inverse mapping of the Fu, Wang, and Zhu mapping.</description>

      <title>Entropy and the growth rate of universal covering trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the relation between two graph parameters, $\rho$ and $\Lambda$. For an undirected graph $G$, $\rho(G)$ is the growth rate of its universal covering tree, while $\Lambda(G)$ is a weighted geometric average of the vertex degree minus one, corresponding to the rate of entropy growth for the non-backtracking random walk (NBRW). It is well known that $\rho(G) \geq \Lambda(G)$ for all graphs, and that graphs with $\rho=\Lambda$ exhibit some special properties. In this work we derive an easy to check, necessary and sufficient condition for the equality to hold. Furthermore, we show that the variance of the number of random bits used by a length $\ell$ NBRW is $O(1)$ if $\rho = \Lambda$ and $\Omega(\ell)$ if $\rho &gt; \Lambda$. As a consequence we exhibit infinitely many non-trivial examples of graphs with $\rho = \Lambda$.</description>

      <title>The volume polynomial of lattice polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every indefinite quadratic form with non-negative integer coefficients is the volume polynomial of a pair of lattice polygons. This solves the discrete version of the Heine-Shephard problem for two bodies in the plane. As an application, we show how to construct a pair of planar tropical curves (or a pair of divisors on a toric surface) with given intersection number and self-intersection numbers.</description>

      <title>Probability that $n$ points are in convex position in a regular $\kappa$-gon : Asymptotic results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{P}_{\kappa}(n)$ be the probability that $n$ points $z_1,\ldots,z_n$ picked uniformly and independently in $\mathfrak{C}_\kappa$, a regular $\kappa$-gon with area $1$, are in convex position, that is, form the vertex set of a convex polygon. In this paper, we give an equivalent of $\mathbb{P}_{\kappa}(n)$ for all $\kappa\geq 3$, which improves on a famous result of B\'ar\'any. A second aim of the paper is to establish a limit theorem which describes the fluctuations around the limit shape of a $n$-tuple of points in convex position when $n\to+\infty$. Finally, we give an algorithm asymptotically exact for the random generation of $z_1,\ldots,z_n$, conditioned to be in convex position in $\mathfrak{C}_\kappa$.</description>

      <title>On unboundedness of some invariants of $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups in $\mathbb{N}^d$. We start with symmetric and almost symmetric $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups and prove that these notions are independent of term orders. We further investigate the conductor and the Ap\'ery set of a $\mathcal{C}$-semigroup with respect to a minimal extremal ray. Building upon this, we extend the notion of reduced type to $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups and study its extremal behavior. For all $d$ and fixed $e \geq 2d$, we give a class of $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups of embedding dimension $e$ such that both the type and the reduced type do not have any upper bound in terms of the embedding dimension. We further explore irreducible decompositions of a $\mathcal{C}$-semigroup and give a lower bound on the irreducible components in an irreducible decomposition. Consequently, we deduce that for each positive integer $k$, there exists a $\mathcal{C}$-semigroup $S$ such that the number of irreducible components of $S$ is at least $k$. A $\mathcal{C}$-semigroup is known as a generalized numerical semigroup when the rational cone spanned by the semigroup is full. We classify all the symmetric generalized numerical semigroups of embedding dimension $2d+1$. Consequently, when $d&gt;1$, we deduce that a generalized numerical semigroup of embedding dimension $2d+1$ is almost symmetric if and only if it is symmetric.</description>

      <title>Congruences for the Ap\'ery numbers modulo $p^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\{A'_n\}$ be the Ap\'ery numbers given by $A'_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk^2\binom{n+k}k.$ For any prime $p\equiv 3\pmod 4$ we show that $A'_{\frac{p-1}2}\equiv \frac{p^2}3\binom{\frac{p-3}2}{\frac{p-3}4}^{-2}\pmod {p^3}$. Let $\{t_n\}$ be given by $$t_0=1,\ t_1=5\quad\hbox{and}\quad t_{n+1}=(8n^2+12n+5)t_n-4n^2(2n+1)^2t_{n-1}\ (n\ge 1).$$ We also obtain the congruences for $t_p\pmod {p^3},\ t_{p-1}\pmod {p^2}$ and $t_{\frac{p-1}2}\pmod {p^2}$, where $p$ is an odd prime.</description>

      <title>A study of nil Hecke algebras via Hopf algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hopf algebroids are generalizations of Hopf algebras to less commutative settings. We show how the comultiplication defined by Kostant and Kumar turns the affine nil Hecke algebra associated to a Coxeter system into a Hopf algebroid without an antipode. The proof relies on mixed dihedral braid relations between Demazure operators and simple reflections. For researchers new to Hopf algebroids we include additional examples from ring theory, representation theory, and algebraic geometry.</description>
