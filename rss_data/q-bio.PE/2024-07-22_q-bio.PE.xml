      <title>Sackin Indices for Labeled and Unlabeled Classes of Galled Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sackin index is an important measure for the balance of phylogenetic trees. We investigate two extensions of the Sackin index to the class of galled trees and two of its subclasses (simplex galled trees and normal galled trees) where we consider both labeled and unlabeled galled trees. In all cases, we show that the mean of the Sackin index for a network which is uniformly sampled from its class is asymptotic to $\mu n^{3/2}$ for an explicit constant $\mu$. In addition, we show that the scaled Sackin index convergences weakly and with all its moments to the Airy distribution.</description>

      <title>Conformity to continuous and discrete ordinal traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of conformity and anti-conformity have typically focused on cultural traits with nominal (unordered) variants, such as baby names, strategies (cooperate/defect), or the presence/absence of an innovation. There have been fewer studies of conformity to "ordinal" cultural traits with ordered variants, such as level of cooperation (low to high) or fraction of time spent on a task (0 to 1). In these latter studies, conformity is conceptualized as a preference for the mean trait value in a population even if no members of the population have variants near this mean; e.g., 50% of the population has variant 0 and 50% has variant 1, producing a mean of 0.5. Here, we introduce models of conformity to ordinal traits, which can be either discrete or continuous and linear (with minimum and maximum values) or circular (without boundaries). In these models, conformists prefer to adopt more popular cultural variants, even if these variants are far from the population mean. To measure a variant's "popularity" in cases where no two individuals share precisely the same variant on a continuum, we introduce a metric called $k$-dispersal; this takes into account a variant's distance to its $k$ closest neighbors, with more "popular" variants having lower distances to their neighbors. We demonstrate through simulations that conformity to ordinal traits need not produce a homogeneous population, as has previously been claimed. Under some combinations of parameter values, conformity sustains substantial trait variation over many generations. Anti-conformist transmission may produce high levels of polarization.</description>
