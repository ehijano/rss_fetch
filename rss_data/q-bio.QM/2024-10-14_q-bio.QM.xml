      <title>LSTM networks provide efficient cyanobacterial blooms forecasting even with incomplete spatio-temporal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyanobacteria are the most frequent dominant species of algal blooms in inland waters, threatening ecosystem function and water quality, especially when toxin-producing strains predominate. Enhanced by anthropogenic activities and global warming, cyanobacterial blooms are expected to increase in frequency and global distribution. Early warning systems (EWS) for cyanobacterial blooms development allow timely implementation of management measures, reducing the risks associated to these blooms. In this paper, we propose an effective EWS for cyanobacterial bloom forecasting, which uses 6 years of incomplete high-frequency spatio-temporal data from multiparametric probes, including phycocyanin (PC) fluorescence as a proxy for cyanobacteria. A probe agnostic and replicable method is proposed to pre-process the data and to generate time series specific for cyanobacterial bloom forecasting. Using these pre-processed data, six different non-site/species-specific predictive models were compared including the autoregressive and multivariate versions of Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Long-Term Short-Term (LSTM) neural networks. Results were analyzed for seven forecasting time horizons ranging from 4 to 28 days evaluated with a hybrid system that combined regression metrics (MSE, R2, MAPE) for PC values, classification metrics (Accuracy, F1, Kappa) for a proposed alarm level of 10 ug PC/L, and a forecasting-specific metric to measure prediction improvement over the displaced signal (skill). The multivariate version of LSTM showed the best and most consistent results across all forecasting horizons and metrics, achieving accuracies of up to 90% in predicting the proposed PC alarm level. Additionally, positive skill values indicated its outstanding effectiveness to forecast cyanobacterial blooms from 16 to 28 days in advance.</description>

      <title>KinDEL: DNA-Encoded Library Dataset for Kinase Inhibitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA-Encoded Libraries (DEL) are combinatorial small molecule libraries that offer an efficient way to characterize diverse chemical spaces. Selection experiments using DELs are pivotal to drug discovery efforts, enabling high-throughput screens for hit finding. However, limited availability of public DEL datasets hinders the advancement of computational techniques designed to process such data. To bridge this gap, we present KinDEL, one of the first large, publicly available DEL datasets on two kinases: Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14 (MAPK14) and Discoidin Domain Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 1 (DDR1). Interest in this data modality is growing due to its ability to generate extensive supervised chemical data that densely samples around select molecular structures. Demonstrating one such application of the data, we benchmark different machine learning techniques to develop predictive models for hit identification; in particular, we highlight recent structure-based probabilistic approaches. Finally, we provide biophysical assay data, both on- and off-DNA, to validate our models on a smaller subset of molecules. Data and code for our benchmarks can be found at: https://github.com/insitro/kindel.</description>

      <title>Boosting drug-disease association prediction for drug repositioning via dual-feature extraction and cross-dual-domain decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncovering new therapeutic uses of existing drugs, drug repositioning offers a fast and cost-effective strategy and holds considerable significance in the realm of drug discovery and development. In recent years, deep learning techniques have emerged as powerful tools in drug repositioning due to their ability to analyze large and complex datasets. However, many existing methods focus on extracting feature information from nearby nodes in the network to represent drugs and diseases, without considering the potential inter-relationships between the features of drugs and diseases, which may lead to inaccurate representations. To address this limitation, we use two features (similarity and association) to capture the potential relationships between the features of drugs and diseases, proposing a Dual-Feature Drug Repositioning Neural Network (DFDRNN) model. DFDRNN uses a self-attention mechanism to extract neighbor features and incorporates two dual-feature extraction modules: the intra-domain dual-feature extraction (IntraDDFE) module for extracting features within a single domain (drugs or diseases) and the inter-domain dual-feature extraction (InterDDFE) module for extracting features across domains. By utilizing these modules, we ensure more appropriate encoding of drugs and diseases. Additionally, a cross-dual-domain decoder is designed to predict drug-disease associations in both domains. Our proposed DFDRNN model outperforms six state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets, achieving an average AUROC of 0.946 and an average AUPR of 0.597. Case studies on two diseases show that the proposed DFDRNN model can be applied in real-world scenarios, demonstrating its significant potential in drug repositioning.</description>
