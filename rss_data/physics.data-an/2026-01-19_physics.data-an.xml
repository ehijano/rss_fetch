      <title>Eigen Microstate Condensation and Critical Phenomena in the Lennard-Jones Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive study of the liquid-gas phase transition, accurately determining the critical point and the critical exponents in fluid systems through direct simulation remains a challenge. We employ the eigen microstate theory (EMT) to investigate the liquid-gas continuous phase transition in the Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid within the canonical ensemble. In EMT, the probability amplitudes of eigen microstates serve as the order parameter. Using finite-size scaling of probability amplitudes, we simultaneously determine the critical temperature, $T_c = 1.188(2)$, and critical density, $\rho_c = 0.320(4)$. Furturemore, we obtain critical exponents of the LJ fluid, $\beta = 0.32(2)$ and $\nu = 0.64(3)$, which demonstrate a great agreement with the Ising universality class. This method also reveals the mesoscopic structure of the emergent phase, characterizing the three-dimensional (3D) spatial configuration of the fluid in the critical region. This work also confirms the finite-size scaling behavior of the probability amplitudes of the eigen microstates in the critical region. The EMT provides a powerful tool for studying the critical phenomena of complex fluid system.</description>

      <title>OmniMol: Transferring Particle Physics Knowledge to Molecular Dynamics with Point-Edge Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present OmniMol, a state-of-the-art transformer-based small molecule machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP). OmniMol is built by adapting Omnilearned, a foundation model for particle jets found in high-energy physics (HEP) experiments such as at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Omnilearned is built with a Point-Edge-Transformer (PET) and pre-trained using a diverse set of one billion particle jets. It includes an interaction-matrix attention bias that injects pairwise sub-nuclear (HEP) or atomic (molecular-dynamics) physics directly into the transformer's attention logits, steering the network toward physically meaningful neighborhoods without sacrificing expressivity. We demonstrate OmniMol using the oMol dataset and find excellent performance even with relatively few examples for fine-tuning. This study lays the foundation for building interdisciplinary connections, given datasets represented as collections of point clouds.</description>

      <title>Study of circular cross-section plasmas in HL-2A tokamak: MHD equilibrium, stability and operational \b{eta} limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circular cross-section plasma is the most basic form of tokamak plasma and the fundamental configuration for magnetic confinement fusion experiments. Based on the HL-2A limiter discharge experiments, the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium and MHD instability of circular cross-section tokamak plasmas are investigated in this work. The results show that when q_0=0.95, the internal kink mode of m/n=1/1 is always unstable. The increase in plasma \b{eta} (the ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure) can lead to the appearance of external kink modes. The combination of axial safety factor q_0 and edge safety factor q_a determines the equilibrium configuration of the plasma and also affects the MHD stability of the equilibrium, but its growth rate is also related to the size of \b{eta}. Under the condition of q_a&gt;2 and q_0 slightly greater than 1, the internal kink mode and surface kink mode can be easily stabilized. However the plasma becomes unstable again and the instability intensity increases as q_0 continues to increase when q_0 exceeds 1. As the poloidal beta (\b{eta}_p) increases, the MHD instability develops, the equilibrium configuration of MHD elongates laterally, and the Shafranov displacement increases, which in turn has the effect on suppressing instability. Calculations have shown that the maximum \b{eta} value imposed by the ideal MHD mode in a plasma with free boundary in tokamak experiments is proportional to the normalized current I_N (I_N=I_p (MA)/a(m)B_0 (T)), and the achievable maximum beta \b{eta}(max) is calibrated to be 2.01I_N,i.e. \b{eta}(max)~2.01I_N. The operational \b{eta} limit of HL-2A circular cross-section plasma is approximately \b{eta}_N^c~2.0. Too high a value of q_0 is not conducive to MHD stability and leads the \b{eta} limit value to decrease. When q_0=1.3, we obtain a maximum value of \b{eta}_N of approximately 1.8.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Detection of Elastic Transient Morphology Across Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test whether a representation learned from interferometric strain transients in gravitational-wave observatories can act as a frozen morphology-sensitive operator for unseen sensors, provided the target signals preserve coherent elastic transient structure. Using a neural encoder trained exclusively on non-Gaussian instrumental glitches, we perform strict zero-shot anomaly analysis on rolling-element bearings without retraining, fine-tuning, or target-domain labels.
  On the IMS-NASA run-to-failure dataset, the operator yields a monotonic health index HI(t) = s0.99(t)/tau normalized to an early-life reference distribution, enabling fixed false-alarm monitoring at 1-q = 1e-3 with tau = Q0.999(P0). In discrete fault regimes (CWRU), it achieves strong window-level discrimination (AUC_win about 0.90) and file-level separability approaching unity (AUC_file about 0.99). Electrically dominated vibration signals (VSB) show weak, non-selective behavior, delineating a physical boundary for transfer.
  Under a matched IMS controlled-split protocol, a generic EfficientNet-B0 encoder pretrained on ImageNet collapses in the intermittent regime (Lambda_tail about 2), while the interferometric operator retains strong extreme-event selectivity (Lambda_tail about 860), indicating that the effect is not a generic property of CNN features. Controlled morphology-destruction transformations selectively degrade performance despite per-window normalization, consistent with sensitivity to coherent time-frequency organization rather than marginal amplitude statistics.</description>

      <title>Temporal Complexity and Self-Organization in an Exponential Dense Associative Memory Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense Associative Memory (DAM) models generalize the classical Hopfield model by incorporating n-body or exponential interactions that greatly enhance storage capacity. While the criticality of DAM models has been largely investigated, mainly within a statistical equilibrium picture, little attention has been devoted to the temporal self-organizing behavior induced by learning. In this work, we investigate the behavior of a stochastic exponential DAM (SEDAM) model through the lens of Temporal Complexity (TC), a framework that characterizes complex systems by intermittent transition events between order and disorder and by scale-free temporal statistics. Transition events associated with birth-death of neural avalanche structures are exploited for the TC analyses and compared with analogous transition events based on coincidence structures. We systematically explore how TC indicators depend on control parameters, i.e., noise intensity and memory load. Our results reveal that the SEDAM model exhibits regimes of complex intermittency characterized by nontrivial temporal correlations and scale-free behavior, indicating the spontaneous emergence of self-organizing dynamics. These regimes emerge in small intervals of noise intensity values, which, in agreement with the extended criticality concept, never shrink to a single critical point. Further, the noise intensity range needed to reach the critical region, where self-organizing behavior emerges, slightly decreases as the memory load increases. This study highlights the relevance of TC as a complementary framework for understanding learning and information processing in artificial and biological neural systems, revealing the link between the memory load and the self-organizing capacity of the network.</description>
