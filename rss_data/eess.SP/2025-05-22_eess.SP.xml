      <title>AI-Assisted NLOS Sensing for RIS-Based Indoor Localization in Smart Factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of Industry 4.0, precise indoor localization is vital for automation and efficiency in smart factories. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) are emerging as key enablers in 6G networks for joint sensing and communication. However, RIS faces significant challenges in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) and multipath propagation, particularly in localization scenarios, where detecting NLOS conditions is crucial for ensuring not only reliable results and increased connectivity but also the safety of smart factory personnel. This study introduces an AI-assisted framework employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) customized for accurate Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) classification to enhance RIS-based localization using measured, synthetic, mixed-measured, and mixed-synthetic experimental data, that is, original, augmented, slightly noisy, and highly noisy data, respectively. Validated through such data from three different environments, the proposed customized-CNN (cCNN) model achieves {95.0\%-99.0\%} accuracy, outperforming standard pre-trained models like Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16) with an accuracy of {85.5\%-88.0\%}. By addressing RIS limitations in NLOS scenarios, this framework offers scalable and high-precision localization solutions for 6G-enabled smart factories.</description>

      <title>Application of Quaternions to Obtain Analytic Solutions to Systems of Polarization Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The usual way to describe mathematically a beam of coherent light passing through a system of waveplates is via the Jones vector and Jones matrix. This paper will show that a quaternion can be used to represent both the optical signal and the waveplate component it passes through, replacing the Jones vector and the Jones matrix. The quaternion description is easier to manipulate than the matrix-vector description; for example it can be inverted. As well as the Jones vector, the state of polarization (SOP) of an optical signal is often described as a three-dimensional vector on the Poincar\'e sphere, or as a polarization ellipse, and it will be shown how these three forms are closely related to the quaternion representation. Similarly, the action of a waveplate may be represented as a rotation about an axis on the Poincar\'e sphere, and that rotation is shown to have a logarithm-exponential relationship to the waveplate's quaternion. The paper presents rules to decide if two optical signals are aligned or orthogonal in phase or in polarization from their quaternions, and presents the quaternion operations to change the phase or change the SOP. Light passing through a system of waveplates is written as a product of quaternions, and it can be hard to simplify or manipulate that expression because quaternion multiplication does not commute. The paper brings together several mathematical tools that allow such a quaternion product to be rearranged, including the new idea of partial conjugation. Finally, a worked example is included of the quaternion mathematics applied to a waveplate problem that has not been solved before. It is shown that an endless optical phase shifter can be built using three rotatable waveplates, and equations for the angles of rotation are derived to produce the desired phase shift for given input and output SOPs.</description>

      <title>Beamforming-Codebook-Aware Channel Knowledge Map Construction for Multi-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) has emerged as a crucial technology for next-generation communication, enabling the construction of high-fidelity mappings between spatial environments and channel parameters via electromagnetic information analysis. Traditional CKM construction methods like ray tracing are computationally intensive. Recent studies utilizing neural networks (NNs) have achieved efficient CKM generation with reduced computational complexity and real-time processing capabilities. Nevertheless, existing research predominantly focuses on single-antenna systems, failing to address the beamforming requirements inherent to MIMO configurations. Given that appropriate precoding vector selection in MIMO systems can substantially enhance user communication rates, this paper presents a TransUNet-based framework for constructing CKM, which effectively incorporates discrete Fourier transform (DFT) precoding vectors. The proposed architecture combines a UNet backbone for multiscale feature extraction with a Transformer module to capture global dependencies among encoded linear vectors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning (DL) approaches, yielding a 17\% improvement in RMSE compared to RadioWNet. The code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/github-whh/TransUNet.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Ventilator Dyssynchrony Waveforms using a Hybrid Generative Model and a Lung Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ventilator dyssynchrony (VD) is often described as a mismatch between a patient breathing effort and the ventilator support during mechanical ventilation. This mismatch is often associated with an increased risk of lung injury and longer hospital stays. The manual VD detection method is unreliable and requires considerable effort from medical professionals. Automating this process requires a computational pipeline that can identify VD breaths from continuous waveform signals. For that, while various machine learning (ML) models have been proposed, their accuracy is often limited due to the unavailability of a large, well-annotated VD waveform dataset. This paper presents a new approach combining mathematical and deep generative models to generate synthetic, clinically relevant VD waveforms. The mathematical model, which we call the VD lung ventilator model (VDLV), can accurately replicate clinically observable deformation in the pressure and volume waveforms. These temporal deformations are hypothesized to be related to specific VD breaths. We leverage the VDLV model to produce training waveform datasets covering normal and various VD breaths. These datasets are further diversified using deep learning models such as Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Conditional GAN (cGAN). The performance of both GAN and cGAN models is assessed through quantitative metrics, demonstrating that this hybrid approach effectively creates realistic and diverse VD waveforms. Notably, the pressure and volume cGAN models enable the generation of more precise and targeted VD signals. These improved synthetic waveform datasets have the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and robustness of VD detection algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Modeling, Architectures, System Design and Optimization, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Written by its inventors, this first tutorial on Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (BD-RISs) provides the readers with the basics and fundamental tools necessary to appreciate, understand, and contribute to this emerging and disruptive technology. Conventional (Diagonal) RISs (D-RISs) are characterized by a diagonal scattering matrix $\mathbf{\Theta}$ such that the wave manipulation flexibility of D-RIS is extremely limited. In contrast, BD-RIS refers to a novel and general framework for RIS where its scattering matrix is not limited to be diagonal (hence, the ``beyond-diagonal'' terminology) and consequently, all entries of $\mathbf{\Theta}$ can potentially help shaping waves for much higher manipulation flexibility. This physically means that BD-RIS can artificially engineer and reconfigure coupling across elements of the surface thanks to inter-element reconfigurable components which allow waves absorbed by one element to flow through other elements. Consequently, BD-RIS opens the door to more general and versatile intelligent surfaces that subsumes existing RIS architectures as special cases. In this tutorial, we share all the secret sauce to model, design, and optimize BD-RIS and make BD-RIS transformative in many different applications. Topics discussed include physics-consistent and multi-port network-aided modeling; transmitting, reflecting, hybrid, and multi-sector mode analysis; reciprocal and non-reciprocal architecture designs and optimal performance-complexity Pareto frontier of BD-RIS; signal processing, optimization, and channel estimation for BD-RIS; hardware impairments (discrete-value impedance and admittance, lossy interconnections and components, wideband effects, mutual coupling) of BD-RIS; benefits and applications of BD-RIS in communications, sensing, power transfer.</description>

      <title>Optimized Energy Harvesting in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Using Markov Process Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a discrete energy state transition model for energy harvesting (EH) in cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) networks. A Markov chain-based stochastic process is conceived to characterize the temporal evolution of the user equipment (UE) energy level by leveraging state transition probabilities (STP) based on the energy differential ($\Delta E$) between the EH and consumed energy within each coherence interval. Tractable mathematical relationships are derived for the STP cases using a new stochastic model of non-linear EH, approximated using a Gamma distribution. This derivation leverages closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the harvested energy. To improve the positive STP of the minimum energy UE among all network UEs, we aim to maximize the $\Delta E$ for this UE using two power allocation (PA) schemes. The first scheme is a heuristic PA using the relative channel characteristics to this UE from all access points (APs). The second scheme is the optimized PA based on the solution of a second-order conic problem to maximize the $\Delta E$ using a responsive primal-dual interior point method (PD-IPM) algorithm with modified backtracking line-search, iterating over multiple PA periods. Our simulation results illustrate that both the proposed PA schemes enhance the dynamic minimum UE energy level by around four-fold over full power control, along with the performance improvement attributed to spatial resource diversification of CF-mMIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Chirp Delay-Doppler Domain Modulation: A New Paradigm of Integrated Sensing and Communication for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving is reshaping the way humans travel, with millimeter wave (mmWave) radar playing a crucial role in this transformation to enabe vehicle-to-everything (V2X). Although chirp is widely used in mmWave radar systems for its strong sensing capabilities, the lack of integrated communication functions in existing systems may limit further advancement of autonomous driving. In light of this, we first design ``dedicated chirps" tailored for sensing chirp signals in the environment, facilitating the identification of idle time-frequency resources. Based on these dedicated chirps, we propose a chirp-division multiple access (Chirp-DMA) scheme, enabling multiple pairs of mmWave radar transceivers to perform integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) without interference. Subsequently, we propose two chirp-based delay-Doppler domain modulation schemes that enable each pair of mmWave radar transceivers to simultaneously sense and communicate within their respective time-frequency resource blocks. The modulation schemes are based on different multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar schemes: the time division multiplexing (TDM)-based scheme offers higher communication rates, while the Doppler division multiplexing (DDM)-based scheme is suitable for working in a lower signal-to-noise ratio range. We then validate the effectiveness of the proposed DDM-based scheme through simulations. Finally, we present some challenges and issues that need to be addressed to advance ISAC in V2X for better autonomous driving. Simulation codes are provided to reproduce the results in this paper: \href{https://github.com/LiZhuoRan0/2025-IEEE-Network-ChirpDelayDopplerModulationISAC}{https://github.com/LiZhuoRan0}.</description>

      <title>OWP-IMU: An RSS-based Optical Wireless and IMU Indoor Positioning Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Received signal strength (RSS)-based optical wireless positioning (OWP) systems are becoming popular for indoor localization because they are low-cost and accurate. However, few open-source datasets are available to test and analyze RSS-based OWP systems. In this paper, we collected RSS values at a sampling frequency of 27 Hz, inertial measurement unit (IMU) at a sampling frequency of 200 Hz and the ground truth at a sampling frequency of 160 Hz in two indoor environments. One environment has no obstacles, and the other has a metal column as an obstacle to represent a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenario. We recorded data with a vehicle at three different speeds (low, medium and high). The dataset includes over 110 k data points and covers more than 80 min. We also provide benchmark tests to show localization performance using only RSS-based OWP and improve accuracy by combining IMU data via extended kalman filter. The dataset OWP-IMU is open source1 to support further research on indoor localization methods.</description>

      <title>Refining Neural Activation Patterns for Layer-Level Concept Discovery in Neural Network-Based Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept discovery in neural networks often targets individual neurons or human-interpretable features, overlooking distributed layer-wide patterns. We study the Neural Activation Pattern (NAP) methodology, which clusters full-layer activation distributions to identify such layer-level concepts. Applied to visual object recognition and radio receiver models, we propose improved normalization, distribution estimation, distance metrics, and varied cluster selection. In the radio receiver model, distinct concepts did not emerge; instead, a continuous activation manifold shaped by Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) was observed -- highlighting SNR as a key learned factor, consistent with classical receiver behavior and supporting physical plausibility. Our enhancements to NAP improved in-distribution vs. out-of-distribution separation, suggesting better generalization and indirectly validating clustering quality. These results underscore the importance of clustering design and activation manifolds in interpreting and troubleshooting neural network behavior.</description>

      <title>Directional Sparsity Based Statistical Channel Estimation for 6D Movable Antenna Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is an innovative and transformative technology to improve wireless network capacity by adjusting the 3D positions and 3D rotations of antennas/surfaces (sub-arrays) based on the channel spatial distribution. For optimization of the antenna positions and rotations, the acquisition of statistical channel state information (CSI) is essential for 6DMA systems. In this paper, we unveil for the first time a new \textbf{\textit{directional sparsity}} property of the 6DMA channels between the base station (BS) and the distributed users, where each user has significant channel gains only with a (small) subset of 6DMA position-rotation pairs, which can receive direct/reflected signals from the user. By exploiting this property, a covariance-based algorithm is proposed for estimating the statistical CSI in terms of the average channel power at a small number of 6DMA positions and rotations. Based on such limited channel power estimation, the average channel powers for all possible 6DMA positions and rotations in the BS movement region are reconstructed by further estimating the multi-path average power and direction-of-arrival (DOA) vectors of all users. Simulation results show that the proposed directional sparsity-based algorithm can achieve higher channel power estimation accuracy than existing benchmark schemes, while requiring a lower pilot overhead.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Impact of Accent on English Speech: Acoustic and Articulatory Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in AI-driven speech-based applications have transformed diverse industries ranging from healthcare to customer service. However, the increasing prevalence of non-native accented speech in global interactions poses significant challenges for speech-processing systems, which are often trained on datasets dominated by native speech. This study investigates accented English speech through articulatory and acoustic analysis, identifying simpler coordination patterns and higher average pitch than native speech. Using eigenspectra and Vocal Tract Variable-based coordination features, we establish an efficient method for quantifying accent strength without relying on resource-intensive phonetic transcriptions. Our findings provide a new avenue for research on the impacts of accents on speech intelligibility and offer insights for developing inclusive, robust speech processing systems that accommodate diverse linguistic communities.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Optimization Framework Using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Task-Driven Bandwidth Allocation in 5G Teleoperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of 5G wireless technology has revolutionized connectivity, enabling a diverse range of applications. Among these are critical use cases such as real time teleoperation, which demands ultra reliable low latency communications (URLLC) to ensure precise and uninterrupted control, and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services, which cater to data-intensive applications requiring high throughput and bandwidth. In our scenario, there are two queues, one for eMBB users and one for URLLC users. In teleoperation tasks, control commands are received in the URLLC queue, where communication delays occur. The dynamic index (DI) controls the service rate, affecting the telerobotic (URLLC) queue. A separate queue models eMBB data traffic. Both queues are managed through network slicing and application delay constraints, leading to a unified Lagrangian-based Lyapunov optimization for efficient resource allocation. We propose a DRL based hierarchical optimization framework that consists of two levels. At the first level, network optimization dynamically allocates resources for eMBB and URLLC users using a Lagrangian functional and an actor critic network to balance competing objectives. At the second level, control optimization finetunes the best gains for robots, ensuring stability and responsiveness in network conditions. This hierarchical approach enhances both communication and control processes, ensuring efficient resource utilization and optimized performance across the network.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Biomarkers for Schizophrenia: Towards Individual Symptom Severity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies on schizophrenia assessments using deep learning typically treat it as a classification task to detect the presence or absence of the disorder, oversimplifying the condition and reducing its clinical applicability. This traditional approach overlooks the complexity of schizophrenia, limiting its practical value in healthcare settings. This study shifts the focus to individual symptom severity estimation using a multimodal approach that integrates speech, video, and text inputs. We develop unimodal models for each modality and a multimodal framework to improve accuracy and robustness. By capturing a more detailed symptom profile, this approach can help in enhancing diagnostic precision and support personalized treatment, offering a scalable and objective tool for mental health assessment.</description>

Abstract: Beyond diagonal intelligent reflecting surface (BD-IRS) is a new promising IRS architecture for which the reflection matrix is not limited to the diagonal structure as for conventional IRS. In this paper, we study a BD-IRS aided uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where sensing is performed in a device-based manner. Specifically, we aim to estimate the unknown and random location of an active target based on its uplink probing signals sent to a multi-antenna base station (BS) as well as the known prior distribution information of the target's location. Multiple communication users also simultaneously send uplink signals, resulting in a challenging mutual interference issue between sensing and communication. We first characterize the sensing performance metric by deriving the posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) of the mean-squared error (MSE) when prior information is available. Then, we formulate a BD-IRS reflection matrix optimization problem to maximize the minimum expected achievable rate among the multiple users subject to a constraint on the PCRB as well as the lossless and reciprocal constraints on the BD-IRS reflection matrix. The formulated problem is non-convex and challenging to solve. To tackle this problem, we propose a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) based algorithm which can find a high-quality suboptimal solution with polynomial-time complexity. In addition, we propose and optimize a time-division multiple access (TDMA) based scheme which removes the sensing-communication mutual interference. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed designs and provide useful design insights.</description>

      <title>Base Station Placement Optimization for Networked Sensing Exploiting Target Location Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a networked sensing system with multiple base stations (BSs), which collaboratively sense the unknown and random three-dimensional (3D) location of a target based on the target-reflected echo signals received at the BSs. Considering a practical scenario where the target location distribution is known a priori for exploitation, we aim to design the placement of the multiple BSs to optimize the networked sensing performance. Firstly, we characterize the posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) of the mean-squared error (MSE) in sensing the target's 3D location. Despite its complex form under networked sensing, we derive its closed-form expression in terms of the BS locations. Next, we formulate the BS placement optimization problem to minimize the sensing PCRB, which is non-convex and difficult to solve. By leveraging a series of equivalent transformations and the iterative inner approximation method, we devise an algorithm with polynomial-time complexity which is guaranteed to converge to a solution satisfying the Karush-Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions of the problem. Numerical results show that the proposed placement design significantly outperforms various benchmark designs.</description>

      <title>Covariance matrix estimation in the singular case using regularized Cholesky factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider estimating the population covariance matrix when the number of available samples is less than the size of the observations. The sample covariance matrix (SCM) being singular, regularization is mandatory in this case. For this purpose we consider minimizing Stein's loss function and we investigate a method based on augmenting the partial Cholesky decomposition of the SCM. We first derive the finite sample optimum estimator which minimizes the loss for each data realization, then the Oracle estimator which minimizes the risk, i.e., the average value of the loss. Finally a practical scheme is presented where the missing part of the Cholesky decomposition is filled. We conduct a numerical performance study of the proposed method and compare it with available related methods. In particular we investigate the influence of the condition number of the covariance matrix as well as of the shape of its spectrum.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Bayesian Tensor Reconstruction: An Approximate Message Passing Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD) is a fundamental model for tensor reconstruction. Although the Bayesian framework allows for principled uncertainty quantification and automatic hyperparameter learning, existing methods do not scale well for large tensors because of high-dimensional matrix inversions. To this end, we introduce CP-GAMP, a scalable Bayesian CPD algorithm. This algorithm leverages generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) to avoid matrix inversions and incorporates an expectation-maximization routine to jointly infer the tensor rank and noise power. Through multiple experiments, for synthetic 100x100x100 rank 20 tensors with only 20% elements observed, the proposed algorithm reduces runtime by 82.7% compared to the state-of-the-art variational Bayesian CPD method, while maintaining comparable reconstruction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Cooperative NOMA Meets Emerging Technologies: A Survey for Next-Generation Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging demands of sixth-generation wireless networks, such as ultra-connectivity, native intelligence, and cross-domain convergence, are bringing renewed focus to cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (C-NOMA) as a fundamental enabler of scalable, efficient, and intelligent communication systems. C-NOMA builds on the core benefits of NOMA by leveraging user cooperation and relay strategies to enhance spectral efficiency, coverage, and energy performance. This article presents a unified and forward-looking survey on the integration of C-NOMA with key enabling technologies, including radio frequency energy harvesting, cognitive radio networks, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, space-air-ground integrated networks, and integrated sensing and communication-assisted semantic communication. Foundational principles and relaying protocols are first introduced to establish the technical relevance of C-NOMA. Then, a focused investigation is conducted into protocol-level synergies, architectural models, and deployment strategies across these technologies. Beyond integration, this article emphasizes the orchestration of C-NOMA across future application domains such as digital twins, extended reality, and e-health. In addition, it provides an extensive and in-depth review of recent literature, categorized by relaying schemes, system models, performance metrics, and optimization paradigms, including model-based, heuristic, and AI-driven approaches. Finally, open challenges and future research directions are outlined, spanning standardization, security, and cross-layer design, positioning C-NOMA as a key pillar of intelligent next-generation network architectures.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Electrostatic Adhesion Forces via Acoustic Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrostatic adhesion is widely used in mobile robotics, haptics, and robotic end effectors for its adaptability to diverse substrates and low energy consumption. Force sensing is important for feedback control, interaction, and monitoring in the EA system. However, EA force monitoring often relies on bulky and expensive sensors, increasing the complexity and weight of the entire system. This paper presents an acoustic-pressure-based method to monitor EA forces without contacting the adhesion pad. When the EA pad is driven by a bipolar square-wave voltage to adhere a conductive object, periodic acoustic pulses arise from the EA system. We employed a microphone to capture these acoustic pressure signals and investigate the influence of peak pressure values. Results show that the peak value of acoustic pressure increased with the mass and contact area of the adhered object, as well as with the amplitude and frequency of the driving voltage. We applied this technique to mass estimation of various objects and simultaneous monitoring of two EA systems. Then, we integrated this technique into an EA end effector that enables monitoring the change of adhered object mass during transport. The proposed technique offers a low-cost, non-contact, and multi-object monitoring solution for EA end effectors in handling tasks.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Network Anomaly Detection with Autoencoders and Traffic Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the recent increase in the number of connected devices, the need to promptly detect security issues is emerging. Moreover, the high number of communication flows creates the necessity of processing huge amounts of data. Furthermore, the connected devices are heterogeneous in nature, having different computational capacities. For this reason, in this work we propose an image-based representation of network traffic which allows to realize a compact summary of the current network conditions with 1-second time windows. The proposed representation highlights the presence of anomalies thus reducing the need for complex processing architectures. Finally, we present an unsupervised learning approach which effectively detects the presence of anomalies. The code and the dataset are available at https://github.com/michaelneri/image-based-network-traffic-anomaly-detection.</description>

      <title>Joint Magnetometer-IMU Calibration via Maximum A Posteriori Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for jointly calibrating magnetometers and inertial measurement units, focusing on improving calibration accuracy and computational efficiency. The proposed method formulates the calibration problem as a maximum a posteriori estimation problem, treating both the calibration parameters and orientation trajectory of the sensors as unknowns. This formulation enables efficient optimization with closed-form derivatives. The method is compared against two state-of-the-art approaches in terms of computational complexity and estimation accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves lower root mean square error in calibration parameters while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Further validation through real-world experiments confirms the practical benefits of our approach: it effectively reduces position drift in a magnetic field-aided inertial navigation system by more than a factor of two on most datasets. Moreover, the proposed method calibrated 30 magnetometers in less than 2 minutes. The contributions include a new calibration method, an analysis of existing methods, and a comprehensive empirical evaluation. Datasets and algorithms are made publicly available to promote reproducible research.</description>

      <title>LLM-Based Emulation of the Radio Resource Control Layer: Towards AI-Native RAN Protocols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating large AI models (LAMs) into 6G mobile networks promises to redefine protocol design and control-plane intelligence by enabling autonomous, cognitive network operations. While industry concepts, such as ETSI's Experiential Networked Intelligence (ENI), envision LAM-driven agents for adaptive network slicing and intent-based management, practical implementations still face challenges in protocol literacy and real-world deployment. This paper presents an end-to-end demonstration of a LAM that generates standards-compliant, ASN.1-encoded Radio Resource Control (RRC) messages as part of control-plane procedures inside a gNB. We treat RRC messaging as a domain-specific language and fine-tune a decoder-only transformer model (LLaMA class) using parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on RRC messages linearized to retain their ASN.1 syntactic structure before standard byte-pair encoding tokenization. This enables combinatorial generalization over RRC protocol states while minimizing training overhead. On 30k field-test request-response pairs, our 8 B model achieves a median cosine similarity of 0.97 with ground-truth messages on an edge GPU -- a 61 % relative gain over a zero-shot LLaMA-3 8B baseline -- indicating substantially improved structural and semantic RRC fidelity. Overall, our results show that LAMs, when augmented with Radio Access Network (RAN)-specific reasoning, can directly orchestrate control-plane procedures, representing a stepping stone toward the AI-native air-interface paradigm. Beyond RRC emulation, this work lays the groundwork for future AI-native wireless standards.</description>

      <title>Including the magnitude variability of a signal into the ordinal pattern analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most popular and innovative methods to analyse signals is by using Ordinal Patterns (OPs). The OP encoding is based on transforming a (univariate) signal into a symbolic sequence of OPs, where each OP represents the number of permutations needed to order a small subset of the signal's magnitudes. This implies that OPs are conceptually clear, methodologically simple to implement, robust to noise, and can be applied to short signals. Moreover, they simplify the statistical analyses that can be carried out on a signal, such as entropy and complexity quantifications. However, because of the relative ordering, information about the magnitude of the signal at each timestamp is lost -- this being one of the major drawbacks in the method. Here, we propose a way to use the signal magnitudes discarded in the OP encoding as a complementary variable to its permutation entropy. To illustrate our approach, we analyse synthetic trajectories from logistic and H{\'e}non maps -- with and without added noise -- and intracranial electroencephalographic recordings from rats in different sleep-wake states. Our results show that, when complementing the permutation entropy with the variability in the signal magnitudes, the characterisation of the dynamical behaviours of the maps and the sleep-wake states is improved. This implies that our approach can be useful for feature engineering and improving AI classifiers, where typical machine learning algorithms need complementary signal features as inputs to improve classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>Partition-wise Graph Filtering: A Unified Perspective Through the Lens of Graph Coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filtering-based graph neural networks (GNNs) constitute a distinct class of GNNs that employ graph filters to handle graph-structured data, achieving notable success in various graph-related tasks. Conventional methods adopt a graph-wise filtering paradigm, imposing a uniform filter across all nodes, yet recent findings suggest that this rigid paradigm struggles with heterophilic graphs. To overcome this, recent works have introduced node-wise filtering, which assigns distinct filters to individual nodes, offering enhanced adaptability. However, a fundamental gap remains: a comprehensive framework unifying these two strategies is still absent, limiting theoretical insights into the filtering paradigms. Moreover, through the lens of Contextual Stochastic Block Model, we reveal that a synthesis of graph-wise and node-wise filtering provides a sufficient solution for classification on graphs exhibiting both homophily and heterophily, suggesting the risk of excessive parameterization and potential overfitting with node-wise filtering. To address the limitations, this paper introduces Coarsening-guided Partition-wise Filtering (CPF). CPF innovates by performing filtering on node partitions. The method begins with structure-aware partition-wise filtering, which filters node partitions obtained via graph coarsening algorithms, and then performs feature-aware partition-wise filtering, refining node embeddings via filtering on clusters produced by $k$-means clustering over features. In-depth analysis is conducted for each phase of CPF, showing its superiority over other paradigms. Finally, benchmark node classification experiments, along with a real-world graph anomaly detection application, validate CPF's efficacy and practical utility.</description>
