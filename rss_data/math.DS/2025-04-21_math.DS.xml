      <title>Universality of G-subshifts with specification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an infinite countable amenable group and let $(X,G)$ be a $G$-subshift with specification, containing a free element. We prove that $(X,G)$ is universal, i.e., has positive topological entropy and for any free ergodic $G$-action on a standard probability space, $(Y,\nu,G)$, with $h(\nu)&lt;h_{top}(X)$, there exists a shift-invariant measure $\mu$ on $X$ such that the systems $(Y,\nu,G)$ and $(X,\mu,G)$ are isomorphic. In particular, any $K$-shift (consisting of the indicator functions of all maximal $K$-separated sets) containing a free element is universal.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional dynamics in low-dimensional networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many networks that arise in nature and applications are effectively low-dimensional in the sense that their connectivity structure is dominated by a few dimensions. It is natural to expect that dynamics on such networks might also be low-dimensional. Indeed, recent results show that low-rank networks produce low-dimensional dynamics whenever the network is isolated from external perturbations or noise. However, networks in nature are rarely isolated. We show that recurrent networks with low-rank structure often produce high-dimensional dynamics in the presence of high-dimensional perturbations. Counter to intuition, dynamics in these networks are \textit{suppressed} in directions that are aligned with the network's low-rank structure, a phenomenon we term "low-rank suppression." Our results clarify important, but counterintuitive relationships between a network's connectivity structure and the structure of the dynamics it generates.</description>

      <title>Strict increase in the number of normally hyperbolic limit tori in 3D polynomial vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second part of Hilbert's 16th problem concerns determining the maximum number $H(m)$ of limit cycles that a planar polynomial vector field of degree $m$ can exhibit. A natural extension to the three-dimensional space is to study the maximum number $N(m)$ of limit tori that can occur in spatial polynomial vector fields of degree $m$. In this work, we focus on normally hyperbolic limit tori and show that the corresponding maximum number $N_h(m)$, if finite, increases strictly with $m$. More precisely, we prove that $N_h(m+1) \geqslant N_h(m) + 1$. Our proof relies on the torus bifurcation phenomenon observed in spatial vector fields near Hopf-Zero equilibria. While conditions for such bifurcations are typically expressed in terms of higher-order normal form coefficients, we derive explicit and verifiable criteria for the occurrence of a torus bifurcation assuming only that the linear part of the unperturbed vector field is in Jordan normal form. This approach circumvents the need for intricate computations involving higher-order normal forms.</description>

      <title>A Recursive Block Pillar Structure in the Kolakoski Sequence K(1,3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kolakoski sequence K(a,b) over {a, b} is the unique sequence starting with a that equals its own run-length encoding. While the classical case K(1,2) remains deeply enigmatic, generalizations exhibit markedly different behaviors depending on the parity of a and b. The sequence K(1,3), a same-parity case over the alphabet {1,3}, is known to possess regular structure and a calculable symbol frequency. This paper reveals a complementary structural property: a nested block-pillar recursion of the form B_{n+1} = B_n + P_n + B_n, and P_{n+1} = G(P_n, 3), where each B_n is a prefix of K(1,3), and G is a generation operator based on run-length encoding. We show that B_{n+1} = G(B_n, 1), leading to a self-replicating description of K(1,3). This structure allows derivation of exact recurrences for length, symbol counts, and density, proving exponential growth and convergence to the known limit d = (5 - sqrt(5)) / 10. Our analysis highlights the structured nature of same-parity Kolakoski sequences and offers a constructive alternative to morphic generation.</description>

      <title>New developments in MatCont: delay equation importer and Lyapunov exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MatCont is a powerful toolbox for numerical bifurcation analysis focussing on smooth ODEs. A user can study equilibria, periodic and connecting orbits, and their stability and bifurcations. Here, we report on additional features in version 7p6. The first is a delay equation importer enabling MatCont users to study a much larger class of models, namely delay equations with finite delay (including delay differential and renewal equations). This importer translates the delay equation into a system of ODEs using a pseudospectral approximation with an order specified by the user. We also implemented Lyapunov exponent computations, event functions for Poincar\'e maps, and enhanced homoclinic continuation. We demonstrate these features with test cases, such as the Mackey-Glass equation and a renewal equation, and provide additional examples in online tutorials.</description>

      <title>A theory of generalised coordinates for stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations are ubiquitous modelling tools in physics and the sciences. In most modelling scenarios, random fluctuations driving dynamics or motion have some non-trivial temporal correlation structure, which renders the SDE non-Markovian; a phenomenon commonly known as ``colored'' noise. Thus, an important objective is to develop effective tools for mathematically and numerically studying (possibly non-Markovian) SDEs. In this report, we formalise a mathematical theory for analysing and numerically studying SDEs based on so-called `generalised coordinates of motion'. Like the theory of rough paths, we analyse SDEs pathwise for any given realisation of the noise, not solely probabilistically. Like the established theory of Markovian realisation, we realise non-Markovian SDEs as a Markov process in an extended space. Unlike the established theory of Markovian realisation however, the Markovian realisations here are accurate on short timescales and may be exact globally in time, when flows and fluctuations are analytic. This theory is exact for SDEs with analytic flows and fluctuations, and is approximate when flows and fluctuations are differentiable. It provides useful analysis tools, which we employ to solve linear SDEs with analytic fluctuations. It may also be useful for studying rougher SDEs, as these may be identified as the limit of smoother ones. This theory supplies effective, computationally straightforward methods for simulation, filtering and control of SDEs; amongst others, we re-derive generalised Bayesian filtering, a state-of-the-art method for time-series analysis. Looking forward, this report suggests that generalised coordinates have far-reaching applications throughout stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <title>On Piecewise Affine Reachability with Bellman Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A piecewise affine map is one of the simplest mathematical objects exhibiting complex dynamics. The reachability problem of piecewise affine maps is as follows: Given two vectors $\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{t} \in \mathbb{Q}^d$ and a piecewise affine map $f$, is there $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f^{n}(\mathbf{s}) = \mathbf{t}$? Koiran, Cosnard, and Garzon show that the reachability problem of piecewise affine maps is undecidable even in dimension 2.
  Most of the recent progress has been focused on decision procedures for one-dimensional piecewise affine maps, where the reachability problem has been shown to be decidable for some subclasses. However, the general undecidability discouraged research into positive results in arbitrary dimension.
  In this work, we investigate a rich subclass of piecewise affine maps arising as Bellman operators of Markov decision processes (MDPs). We consider the reachability problem restricted to this subclass and examine its decidability in arbitrary dimensions. We establish that the reachability problem for Bellman operators is decidable in any dimension under either of the following conditions (i) the target vector $\mathbf{t}$ is not the fixed point of the operator $f$; or (ii) the initial and target vectors $\mathbf{s}$ and $\mathbf{t}$ are comparable with respect to the componentwise order. Furthermore, we show that the reachability problem for two-dimensional Bellman operators is decidable for arbitrary $\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{t}\in \mathbb{Q}^d$, in contrast to the known undecidability of reachability for general piecewise affine maps.</description>
