      <title>Integrating spatially-resolved transcriptomics data across tissues and individuals: challenges and opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies have propelled the development of new computational analysis methods to unlock biological insights. As the cost of generating these data decreases, these technologies provide an exciting opportunity to create large-scale atlases that integrate SRT data across multiple tissues, individuals, species, or phenotypes to perform population-level analyses. Here, we describe unique challenges of varying spatial resolutions in SRT data, as well as highlight the opportunities for standardized preprocessing methods along with computational algorithms amenable to atlas-scale datasets leading to improved sensitivity and reproducibility in the future.</description>

      <title>Refinement of genetic variants needs attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variant calling refinement is crucial for distinguishing true genetic variants from technical artifacts in high-throughput sequencing data. Manual review is time-consuming while heuristic filtering often lacks optimal solutions. Traditional variant calling methods often struggle with accuracy, especially in regions of low read coverage, leading to false-positive or false-negative calls. Here, we introduce VariantTransformer, a Transformer-based deep learning model, designed to automate variant calling refinement directly from VCF files in low-coverage data (10-15X). VariantTransformer, trained on two million variants, including SNPs and short InDels, from low-coverage sequencing data, achieved an accuracy of 89.26% and a ROC AUC of 0.88. When integrated into conventional variant calling pipelines, VariantTransformer outperformed traditional heuristic filters and approached the performance of state-of-the-art AI-based variant callers like DeepVariant. Comparative analysis demonstrated VariantTransformer's superiority in functionality, variant type coverage, training size, and input data type. VariantTransformer represents a significant advancement in variant calling refinement for low-coverage genomic studies.</description>

      <title>UnPaSt: unsupervised patient stratification by differentially expressed biclusters in omics data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most complex diseases, including cancer and non-malignant diseases like asthma, have distinct molecular subtypes that require distinct clinical approaches. However, existing computational patient stratification methods have been benchmarked almost exclusively on cancer omics data and only perform well when mutually exclusive subtypes can be characterized by many biomarkers. Here, we contribute with a massive evaluation attempt, quantitatively exploring the power of 22 unsupervised patient stratification methods using both, simulated and real transcriptome data. From this experience, we developed UnPaSt (https://apps.cosy.bio/unpast/) optimizing unsupervised patient stratification, working even with only a limited number of subtype-predictive biomarkers. We evaluated all 23 methods on real-world breast cancer and asthma transcriptomics data. Although many methods reliably detected major breast cancer subtypes, only few identified Th2-high asthma, and UnPaSt significantly outperformed its closest competitors in both test datasets. Essentially, we showed that UnPaSt can detect many biologically insightful and reproducible patterns in omic datasets.</description>
