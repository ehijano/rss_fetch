      <title>Metasurface Energy Harvesters: State-of-the-Art Designs and Their Potential for Energy Sustainable Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurface Energy Harvesters (MEHs) have emerged as a prominent enabler of highly efficient Radio Frequency (RF) energy harvesters. This survey delves into the fundamentals of the MEH technology, providing a comprehensive overview of their working principle, unit cell designs and prototypes over various frequency bands, as well as state-of-the art modes of operation. Inspired by the recent academic and industrial interest on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs)for the upcoming sixth-Generation (6G) of wireless networks, we study the interplay between this technology and MEHs aiming for energy sustainable RISs power by metasurface-based RF energy harvesting. We present a novel hybrid unit cell design capable of simultaneous energy harvesting and 1-bit tunable reflection whose dual-functional response is validated via full-wave simulations. Then, we conduct a comparative collection of real-world measurements for ambient RF power levels and power consumption budgets of reflective RISs to unveil the potential for a self-sustainable RIS via ambient RF energy harvesting. The paper is concluded with an elaborative discussion on open design challenges and future research directions for MEHs and energy sustainable hybrid RISs.</description>

      <title>Hurricane Evacuation Analysis with Large-scale Mobile Device Location Data during Hurricane Ian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hurricane Ian is the deadliest and costliest hurricane in Florida's history, with 2.5 million people ordered to evacuate. As we witness increasingly severe hurricanes in the context of climate change, mobile device location data offers an unprecedented opportunity to study hurricane evacuation behaviors. With a terabyte-level GPS dataset, we introduce a holistic hurricane evacuation behavior algorithm with a case study of Ian: we infer evacuees' departure time and categorize them into different behavioral groups, including self, voluntary, mandatory, shadow and in-zone evacuees. Results show the landfall area (Fort Myers, Lee County) had lower out-of-zone but higher overall evacuation rate, while the predicted landfall area (Tampa, Hillsborough County) had the opposite, suggesting the effects of delayed evacuation order. Out-of-zone evacuation rates would increase from shore to inland. Spatiotemporal analysis identified three evacuation waves: during formation, before landfall, and after landfall. These insights are valuable for enhancing future disaster planning and management.</description>

      <title>Problems in AI, their roots in philosophy, and implications for science and society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of today's most relevant emergent technologies. In view thereof, this paper proposes that more attention should be paid to the philosophical aspects of AI technology and its use. It is argued that this deficit is generally combined with philosophical misconceptions about the growth of knowledge. To identify these misconceptions, reference is made to the ideas of the philosopher of science Karl Popper and the physicist David Deutsch. The works of both thinkers aim against mistaken theories of knowledge, such as inductivism, empiricism, and instrumentalism. This paper shows that these theories bear similarities to how current AI technology operates. It also shows that these theories are very much alive in the (public) discourse on AI, often called Bayesianism. In line with Popper and Deutsch, it is proposed that all these theories are based on mistaken philosophies of knowledge. This includes an analysis of the implications of these mistaken philosophies for the use of AI in science and society, including some of the likely problem situations that will arise. This paper finally provides a realistic outlook on Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and three propositions on A(G)I and philosophy (i.e., epistemology).</description>

      <title>Comparing Algorithms for Loading Classical Datasets into Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers are gaining importance in various applications like quantum machine learning and quantum signal processing. These applications face significant challenges in loading classical datasets into quantum memory. With numerous algorithms available and multiple quality attributes to consider, comparing data loading methods is complex.
  Our objective is to compare (in a structured manner) various algorithms for loading classical datasets into quantum memory (by converting statevectors to circuits).
  We evaluate state preparation algorithms based on five key attributes: circuit depth, qubit count, classical runtime, statevector representation (dense or sparse), and circuit alterability. We use the Pareto set as a multi-objective optimization tool to identify algorithms with the best combination of properties. To improve comprehension and speed up comparisons, we also visually compare three metrics (namely, circuit depth, qubit count, and classical runtime).
  We compare seven algorithms for dense statevector conversion and six for sparse statevector conversion. Our analysis reduces the initial set of algorithms to two dense and two sparse groups, highlighting inherent trade-offs.
  This comparison methodology offers a structured approach for selecting algorithms based on specific needs. Researchers and practitioners can use it to help select data-loading algorithms for various quantum computing tasks.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal IRS Assisted Ultra Massive THz Systems: A Low Resolution Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The terahertz communications have the potential to revolutionize data transfer with unmatched speed and facilitate the development of new high-bandwidth applications. This paper studies the performance of downlink terahertz system assisted by beyond diagonal intelligent reconfigurable surface (BD-IRS). For enhanced energy efficiency and low cost, a joint precoding and BD-IRS phase shift design satisfying the $1$-bit resolution constraints to maximize the spectral efficiency is presented. The original problem is non-linear, NP-hard, and intricately coupled, and obtaining an optimal solution is challenging. To reduce the complexity, we first transform the optimization problem into two problems and then iteratively solve them to achieve an efficient solution. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach for the BD-IRS assisted terahertz system significantly enhances the spectral efficiency compared to the conventional diagonal IRS assisted system.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Federated Analytics: Taxonomy, Enabling Techniques, Applications and Open Issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The escalating influx of data generated by networked edge devices, coupled with the growing awareness of data privacy, has restricted the traditional data analytics workflow, where the edge data are gathered by a centralized server to be further utilized by data analysts. To continue leveraging vast edge data to support various data-incentive applications, a transformative shift is promoted in computing paradigms from centralized data processing to privacy-preserved distributed data processing. The need to perform data analytics on private edge data motivates federated analytics (FA), an emerging technique to support collaborative data analytics among diverse data owners without centralizing the raw data. Despite the wide applications of FA in industry and academia, a comprehensive examination of existing research efforts in FA has been notably absent. This survey aims to bridge this gap by first providing an overview of FA, elucidating key concepts, and discussing its relationship with similar concepts. We then conduct a thorough examination of FA, including its key challenges, taxonomy, and enabling techniques. Diverse FA applications, including statistical metrics, frequency-related applications, database query operations, FL-assisting FA tasks, and other wireless network applications are then carefully reviewed. We complete the survey with several open research issues, future directions, and a comprehensive lessons learned part. This survey intends to provide a holistic understanding of the emerging FA techniques and foster the continued evolution of privacy-preserving distributed data processing in the emerging networked society.</description>

      <title>LLM experiments with simulation: Large Language Model Multi-Agent System for Simulation Model Parametrization in Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel design of a multi-agent system framework that applies large language models (LLMs) to automate the parametrization of simulation models in digital twins. This framework features specialized LLM agents tasked with observing, reasoning, decision-making, and summarizing, enabling them to dynamically interact with digital twin simulations to explore parametrization possibilities and determine feasible parameter settings to achieve an objective. The proposed approach enhances the usability of simulation model by infusing it with knowledge heuristics from LLM and enables autonomous search for feasible parametrization to solve a user task. Furthermore, the system has the potential to increase user-friendliness and reduce the cognitive load on human users by assisting in complex decision-making processes. The effectiveness and functionality of the system are demonstrated through a case study, and the visualized demos and codes are available at a GitHub Repository: https://github.com/YuchenXia/LLMDrivenSimulation</description>

      <title>KANQAS: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Quantum Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum architecture search (QAS) is a promising direction for optimization and automated design of quantum circuits towards quantum advantage. Recent techniques in QAS focus on machine learning-based approaches from reinforcement learning, like deep Q-network. While multi-layer perceptron-based deep Q-networks have been applied for QAS, their interpretability remains challenging due to the high number of parameters. In this work, we evaluate the practicality of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in QAS problems, analyzing their efficiency in the task of quantum state preparation and quantum chemistry. In quantum state preparation, our results show that in a noiseless scenario, the probability of success and the number of optimal quantum circuit configurations to generate the multi-qubit maximally entangled states are $2\times$ to $5\times$ higher than Multi-Layer perceptions (MLPs). Moreover, in noisy scenarios, KAN can achieve a better fidelity in approximating maximally entangled state than MLPs, where the performance of the MLP significantly depends on the choice of activation function. In tackling quantum chemistry problems, we enhance the recently proposed QAS algorithm by integrating Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) with a KAN structure instead of the traditional MLP. This modification allows us to design a parameterized quantum circuit that contains fewer 2-qubit gates and has a shallower depth, thereby improving the efficiency of finding the ground state of a chemical Hamiltonian. Further investigation reveals that KAN requires a significantly smaller number of learnable parameters compared to MLPs; however, the average time of executing each episode for KAN is higher.</description>
