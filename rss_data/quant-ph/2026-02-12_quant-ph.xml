      <title>Permanents of matrix ensembles: computation, distribution, and geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a computational and experimental study of permanents. On the computational side, we use the GPU to greaatly accelerate the computation of permanents over $\mathbb{C},$ $\mathbb{R},$ $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{Q}.$ In particular, we use this to compute the permanents of DFT and Schur matrices far beyond the ranges hitherto known. On the experimental side, we present two new observations. First, for Haar-distributed unitary matrices~$U$, the permanent $\perm(U)$ follows a circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma^2)$ -- we confirm this via a number of tests for $n$ up to~23 with $50{,}000$ samples. The DFT matrix permanent is an extreme outlier for every prime $n\ge 7$. In contrast, for Haar-random \emph{orthogonal} matrices~$O$, the permanent $\perm(O)$ is approximately real Gaussian but with positive excess kurtosis that decays as~$O(1/n)$, indicating slower convergence. For matrices with Gaussian entries (GUE, GOE, Ginibre), the permanent follows an $\alpha$-stable distribution with stability index $\alpha\approx 1.0$--$1.4$, well below the Gaussian value $\alpha=2$.
  Secondly, we study the permanent along geodesics on the unitary group. For the geodesic from the identity to the $n$-cycle permutation matrix, we find a universal scaling function $f(t)=\frac{1}{n}\ln|\perm(\gamma(t))|$ that is independent of~$n$ in the large-$n$ limit, with a midpoint value \[
  \perm(\gamma({\textstyle\frac12}))
  = (-1)^{(n-1)/2}\cdot 2e^{-n}\bigl(1+\tfrac{1}{3n}+O(n^{-2})\bigr) \] for odd~$n$ and zero for even~$n$. For the geodesic to the DFT matrix, the permanent recovers $10$--$40$ times above its valley minimum when $n$ is prime, but not when $n$ is composite -- a geodesic fingerprint of primality.</description>

      <title>Entanglement percolation in random quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement percolation aims at generating maximal entanglement between any two nodes of a quantum network by utilizing strategies based solely on local operations and classical communication between the nodes. As it happens in classical percolation theory, the topology of the network is crucial, but also the entanglement shared between the nodes of the network. In a network of identically partially entangled states, the network topology determines the minimum entanglement needed for percolation. In this work, we generalize the protocol to scenarios where the initial entanglement shared between each two nodes of the network is not the same but has some randomness. In such cases, we find that for classical entanglement percolation, only the average initial entanglement is relevant. In contrast, the quantum entanglement percolation protocol generally performs worse under these more realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Expansion Induces Interference Between Communication and Entanglement Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between genuine entanglement harvesting and communication mediated correlations for local particle detectors in expanding cosmological spacetimes. Focusing on a conformally coupled scalar field in de Sitter spacetime, we analyze how spacetime expansion induces interference between these two sources of entanglement when the detectors are in causal contact. We compare two physically distinct detector models: detectors whose spatial profile expands with the Universe, and detectors whose proper size remains fixed despite cosmological expansion. We find that the lack of time-reversal symmetry in cosmological settings generically leads to constructive or destructive interference between communication mediated correlations and harvested field correlations, dramatically affecting the entanglement that detectors can acquire. In particular, rapid expansion can suppress entanglement entirely for expanding detectors through destructive interference, even when both communication and field correlations are individually large, whereas detectors that maintain a fixed proper size remain capable of acquiring significant entanglement. Our results show that cosmological expansion qualitatively reshapes the balance between communication and harvesting, and that the detector internal cohesion (whether it expands with the Universe or not) plays a crucial role in determining whether detectors' entanglement can survive in rapidly expanding universes.</description>

      <title>Communication complexity bounds from information causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication complexity, which quantifies the minimum communication required for distributed computation, offers a natural setting for investigating the capabilities and limitations of quantum mechanics in information processing. We introduce an information-theoretic approach to study one-way communication complexity based solely on the axioms of mutual information. Within this framework, we derive an extended statement of the information causality principle, which recovers known lower bounds on the communication complexities for a range of functions in a simplified manner and leads to new results. We further prove that the extended information causality principle is at least as strong as the principle of non-trivial communication complexity in bounding the strength of quantum correlations attainable in Bell experiments. Our study establishes a new route for exploring the fundamental limits of quantum technologies from an information-theoretic viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Quantum Integrated Sensing and Computation with Indefinite Causal Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum operations with indefinite causal order (ICO) represent a framework in quantum information processing where the relative order between two events can be indefinite. In this paper, we investigate whether sensing and computation, two canonical tasks in quantum information processing, can be carried out within the ICO framework. We propose a scheme for integrated sensing and computation that uses the same quantum state for both tasks. The quantum state is represented as an agent that performs state observation and learns a function of the state to make predictions via a parametric model. Under an ICO operation, the agent experiences a superposition of orders, one in which it performs state observation and then executes the required computation steps, and another in which the agent carries out the computation first and then performs state observation. This is distinct from prevailing information processing and machine intelligence paradigms where information acquisition and learning follow a strict causal order, with the former always preceding the latter. We provide experimental results and we show that the proposed scheme can achieve small training and testing losses on a representative task in magnetic navigation.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Rewiring of Two-Dimensional Ion Lattice Interactions Using Metastable State Shelving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped-ion lattice geometries, which determine the interactions between trapped-ion qubits, are typically governed by the balance of Coulomb repulsion forces with the external trapping potential. Here we demonstrate how the effective ion lattice geometry and resulting qubit-qubit interactions may be reconfigured in-situ, by shelving specific ions in metastable states outside the qubit subspace. Using a triangular lattice of three $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$ ions, we optically pump selected ions into the long-lived $^2F_{7/2}$ state. We then apply a global Ising-like Hamiltonian to the system and verify that the shelved qubits are fully removed from participation in the quantum dynamics. We characterize the metastable state lifetime in the presence of laser-driven ion-ion interactions, finding a deshelving rate that is orders of magnitude slower than the spin-spin interaction rate and scales quadratically with applied laser intensity.</description>

      <title>High-performance source of indistinguishable polarization-entangled photons with a local oscillator reference for quantum networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical quantum networking protocols impose stringent requirements on the states produced by sources of entanglement. We demonstrate a free-space, compact, source of indistinguishable pairs of polarization entangled photons, with an integrated local oscillator reference as a significant step towards this goal. This source achieves $(99.11 \pm 0.01)\%$ polarization entanglement visibility, $(96.3 \pm 0.6)\%$ successive-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility, $(68.0 \pm 0.1)\%$ heralded efficiency as detected, and $(88.6 \pm 0.2)\%$ interference visibility with a local oscillator. This simultaneous achievement of state-of-the-art metrics demonstrates an adaptable platform for quantum networking.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty and Wigner negativity in Hilbert-space classical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical mechanics, in the Koopman-von Neumann formulation, is described in Hilbert space. It is shown here that classical canonical transformations are generated by Hermitian operators that are in general noncommutative. This naturally brings about uncertainty relations inherent in classical mechanics, for example between position and the generator of space translations, between momentum and the generator of momentum translations, and between dynamical time and the Liouvillian, to name a few. Further, it is shown that the Wigner representation produces a quasi-probability distribution that can take on negative values. Thus, two of the hallmark features of quantum mechanics are reproduced, and become apparent, in a Hilbert-space formulation of classical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Comparing and correcting robustness metrics for quantum optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control pulses that nominally optimize fidelity are sensitive to routine hardware drift and modeling errors. Robust quantum optimal control seeks error-insensitive control pulses that maintain fidelity thresholds and obey hardware constraints. Distinct numerical approximations to the first-order error susceptibility include adjoint end-point and toggling-frame approaches. Although theoretically equivalent, we provide a novel, systematic study demonstrating important numerical differences between these two approaches. We also introduce a critical discretization correction to the widely-used toggling-frame robustness estimator, measurably improving its estimate of first-order error susceptibility. We accomplish our study by positioning robustness as a first-class objective within direct, constrained optimal control. Our approach uniquely handles control and fidelity constraints while cleanly isolating robustness for dedicated optimization. In both single- and two-qubit examples under realistic constraints, our approach provides an analytic edge for obtaining precise, physics-informed robustness.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Classical and Quantum Tensor PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral methods are a leading approach for tensor PCA with a ``spiked" Gaussian tensor. The methods use the spectrum of a linear operator in a vector space with exponentially high dimension and in Ref. 1 it was shown that quantum algorithms could then lead to an exponential space saving as well as a quartic speedup over classical. Here we show how to accelerate both classical and quantum algorithms quadratically, while maintaining the same quartic separation between them. That is, our classical algorithm here is quadratically faster than the original classical algorithm, while the quantum algorithm is eigth-power faster than the original classical algorithm. We then give a further modification of the quantum algorithm, increasing its speedup over the modified classical algorithm to the sixth power. We only prove these speedups for detection, rather than recovery, but we give a strong plausibility argument that our algorithm achieves recovery also.
  Note added: After this paper was prepared, A. Schmidhuber pointed out to me Ref. 3. This improves the best existing bounds on the spectral norm of a certain random operator. Because the norm of this operator enters into the runtime, with this improvement on the norm, we no longer have a provable polynomial speedup. Our results are phrased in terms of certain properties of the spectrum of this operator (not merely the largest eigenvalue but also the density of states). So, if these properties still hold, the speedup still holds. Rather than modify the paper, I have left it unchanged but added a section at the end discussing the needed property of density of states and considering for which problems (there are several problems for which this kind of quartic quantum speedup has been used and the techniques here will likely be applicable to several of them) the property is likely to hold.</description>

      <title>Quantum Brownian motion with non-Gaussian noises: Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation and nonlinear Langevin equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the work of Hu, Paz, and Zhang [1,2] on open quantum systems we consider the quantum Brownian motion (QBM) model with one oscillator (position variable $x$) as the system, {\it nonlinearly} coupled to an environment of $N$ harmonic oscillators (with mass $m_n$, natural frequency $\omega_n$, position $q_n$ and momentum $p_n$ variables) in the form $\sum_{n}\left(v_{n1}(x)q_{n}^{k}+v_{n2}(x)p_{n}^{l}\right)$ where $k, l$ are integers (the present work only considers the $k=l=2$ cases). The vertex functions $v_{n1}, v_{n2} $ are of the form $v_{n1}=\lambda C_{n1} f(x), v_{n2}(x)=-\lambda\,C_{n2}m_{n}^{-2}\omega_{n}^{-2}f(x)$ where $C_{n1,2}$ are the coupling constants with the $n$th oscillator, $f(x)$ is any arbitrary function of $x$, and $\lambda$ is a dimensionless constant. Employing the closed-time-path formalism the influence action $S_{IF}$ is calculated using a perturbative expansion in $\lambda$. It is possible to identify the terms in $S_{IF}$ quadratic or higher in $\Delta(s)\equiv f(x_{+}(s))-f(x_{-}(s))$ to constitute the noise kernel, while terms linear in $\Delta$ to that of the dissipation kernel. The non-Gaussian noise kernel gives rise to non-zero three-point correlation function of the corresponding stochastic force. The pathway presented here should be useful for the exploration of \textit{non-Gaussian properties of systems nonlinearly coupled with their environments}; examples in early universe cosmology and in quantum optomechanics (QOM) are mentioned. A modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) is also established, which ensures the consistency of the model and the accuracy of results even at higher perturbative orders. Another result of significance is the derivation of a nonlinear Langevin equation which is expected to be useful for many open quantum system applications.</description>

      <title>Erasure Thresholds for Hyperbolic and Semi-Hyperbolic Surface Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct 14 hyperbolic CSS surface codes from $\{8,3\}$, $\{10,3\}$, and $\{12,3\}$ tessellations and 11 semi-hyperbolic (fine-grained) codes. We simulate all 25 codes under circuit-level erasure and Pauli noise. Under circuit-level Pauli noise, pseudothresholds increase with code size within each family ($0.24$--$0.49\%$ for $\{8,3\}$, $0.11$--$0.43\%$ for $\{10,3\}$, $0.07$--$0.13\%$ for $\{12,3\}$). For erasure noise, most codes have $p^*_{\mathrm{E}} &gt; 5\%$. Per-observable family thresholds give erasure-to-Pauli ratios of $2.7$--$3.9\times$ for the base code families. Fine-grained scaling families achieve higher thresholds in both Pauli ($0.67$--$0.68\%$) and erasure ($3.0$--$3.5\%$), with ratios of $4.5$--$5.2\times$. Under phenomenological noise, per-logical $Z$-channel thresholds are ${\sim}2\%$ for $\{8,3\}$ and ${\sim}1\%$ for $\{10,3\}$; the $\{12,3\}$ threshold lies below $0.5\%$.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Utility Tradeoffs in Quantum Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When sensitive information is encoded in data, it is important to ensure the privacy of information when attempting to learn useful information from the data. There is a natural tradeoff whereby increasing privacy requirements may decrease the utility of a learning protocol. In the quantum setting of differential privacy, such tradeoffs between privacy and utility have so far remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study optimal privacy-utility tradeoffs for both generic and application-specific utility metrics when privacy is quantified by $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-quantum local differential privacy. In the generic setting, we focus on optimizing fidelity and trace distance between the original state and the privatized state. We show that the depolarizing mechanism achieves the optimal utility for given privacy requirements. We then study the specific application of learning the expectation of an observable with respect to an input state when only given access to privatized states. We derive a lower bound on the number of samples of privatized data required to achieve a fixed accuracy guarantee with high probability. To prove this result, we employ existing lower bounds on private quantum hypothesis testing, thus showcasing the first operational use of them. We also devise private mechanisms that achieve optimal sample complexity with respect to the privacy parameters and accuracy parameters, demonstrating that utility can be significantly improved for specific tasks in contrast to the generic setting. In addition, we show that the number of samples required to privately learn observable expectation values scales as $\Theta((\varepsilon \beta)^{-2})$, where $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ is the privacy parameter and $\beta$ is the accuracy tolerance. We conclude by initiating the study of private classical shadows, which promise useful applications for private learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Pilot-Wave Theories as Hidden Markov Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original version of the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory, also called Bohmian mechanics, attempted to treat the wave function or pilot wave as a part of the physical ontology of nature. More recent versions of the de Broglie-Bohm theory appearing in the last few decades have tried to regard the pilot wave instead as an aspect of the theory's nomology, or dynamical laws. This paper argues that neither of these views is correct, and that the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave is best understood as a collection of latent variables in the sense of a hidden Markov model, a construct that was not available when de Broglie and Bohm originally formulated what became their pilot-wave theory. This paper also discusses several other challenges for the ontological view of the pilot wave. One such challenge is due to Foldy-Wouthuysen gauge transformations, which connect up with the Deotto-Ghirardi ambiguity in the de Broglie-Bohm theory. Another challenge arises from the freedom to carry out canonical transformations in the wave function's own notion of phase space, as defined by Strocchi and Heslot.</description>

      <title>General Theory of Stable Microwave-Optical Quantum Resources in Hybrid-System Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general theoretical framework for characterizing stable quantum resources between microwave and optical modes in the dynamics of multipartite hybrid quantum systems with intermediary modes. The effective Hamiltonian for microwave-optical (MO) squeezing is formulated via strong interactions in the microwave-intermediary-optical hybrid system, and based on which rigorous solutions for the dynamics of MO entanglement and quantum steering are derived analytically. Remarkably, it is found that stable MO quantum resources can survive in the unsteady evolution beyond the steady one, and the unsteady evolution can exhibit the enhanced quality over the limit of quantum resources in the steady-state case. Furthermore, the stable MO entanglement as well as one-way and two-way quantum steerings are efficiently controllable by modulating the effective coupling strength. The validity of our theory is demonstrated by applying it to the typical models of electro-optomechanical and cavity optomagnomechanical hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Block encoding of sparse matrices with a periodic diagonal structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Block encoding is a successful technique used in several powerful quantum algorithms. In this work we provide an explicit quantum circuit for block encoding a sparse matrix with a periodic diagonal structure. The proposed methodology is based on the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) framework and on an efficient unitary operator used to project the complex exponential at a frequency $\omega$ multiplied by the computational basis into its real and imaginary components. We demonstrate a distinct computational advantage with a $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(n))$ gate complexity, where $n$ is the number of qubits, in the worst-case scenario used for banded matrices, and $\mathcal{O}(n)$ when dealing with a simple diagonal matrix, compared to the exponential scaling of general-purpose methods for dense matrices. Various applications for the presented methodology are discussed in the context of solving differential problems such as the advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) dynamics, using quantum algorithms with optimal scaling, e.g., quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). Numerical results are used to validate the analytical formulation.</description>

      <title>Practical quantum tokens: challenges and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of quantum tokens dates back alongside quantum cryptography to Stephen Wiesner's seminal work in 1983[1]. Already this initial work proposes society-relevant applications such as secure quantum banknotes, which can be exchanged between a bank and a customer. This quantum currency is based on various physical states that can be easily verified but is protected from being copied by the fundamental quantum laws. Four decades later, these ideas have flourished in the field of quantum information, and the concept of quantum banknotes has not only adopted many varying names, such as quantum money, quantum coins, quantum-digital payments, and quantum tokens, but also reached its first experimental demonstrations. In this perspective article, we discuss the current state-of-the-art of quantum tokens in the field of quantum information, as well as their future perspectives. We present a number of physical realizations of quantum tokens with integrated quantum memories and their applicability scenarios in detail. Finally, we discuss how quantum tokens fit into the information security ecosystem and consider their relationship to post-quantum cryptography.</description>

      <title>Projection-Based Memory Kernel Coupling Theory for Quantum Dynamics: A Stable Framework for Non-Markovian Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a projection-based, stability-preserving methodology for computing time correlation functions in open quantum systems governed by generalized quantum master equations with non-Markovian effects. Building upon the memory kernel coupling theory framework, our approach transforms the memory kernel hierarchy into a system of coupled linear differential equations through Mori-Zwanzig projection, followed by spectral projection onto stable eigenmodes to ensure numerical stability. By systematically eliminating unstable modes while preserving the physically relevant dynamics, our method guaranties long-time convergence without introducing artificial damping or ad hoc modifications. The theoretical framework maintains mathematical rigor through orthogonal projection operators and spectral decomposition. Benchmark calculations on the spin-boson model show excellent agreement with exact hierarchical equations of motion results while achieving significant computational efficiency. This approach provides a versatile and reliable framework for simulating non-Markovian dynamics in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Run-length certificates in quantum learning: sample complexity and noise thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum learning from state samples is often benchmarked in a fixed-budget paradigm, relating error to a prescribed number of copies. We instead adopt a stopping-time viewpoint: in minimal-feedback learning, the learning completion can be defined by an online run-length certificate extracted from a one-bit-per-copy record. As an instantiation, we analyze single-shot measurement learning (SSML), introduced in [Phys. Rev. A 98, 052302 (2018)] and [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 170504 (2021)], which tunes a unitary and halts after $M_H$ consecutive successes. Viewing the halting as a sequential certification linking the observed counter to infidelity, we derive sample-complexity bounds that separate search (driving success probability toward unity) from certification (run statistics of consecutive successes). The resulting trade-off among $M_H$, dimension $d$, and one-bit reliability clarifies when performance is control-limited versus certificate-limited. With label-flip noise probability $q$, we find a sharp feasibility threshold: once $qM_H \gtrsim 1$, the expected halting time grows exponentially, making the learning completion impractical even under ideal control. More broadly, this shows that under severely constrained feedback, the certification can dominate sample complexity and small label noise becomes the information bottleneck. Finally, the near-optimal accuracy enabled by run-length certification aligns with the quantum-state-estimation (and equivalently, no-cloning) limits, expressed in the stopping-time terms.</description>

      <title>Maximum residual strong monogamy inequality for multiqubit entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish two new inequalities, the weighted strong monogamy (WSM) and the maximum residual strong monogamy (MRSM), which sharpen the generalized Coffman-Kundu-Wootters inequity for multiqubit states. The WSM inequality distinguishes itself from the strong monogamy (SM) conjecture [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 110501 (2014)] by using coefficients rather than exponents to modulate the weight allocated to various m-partite contributions. In contrast, the MRSM inequality is formulated using only the maximum m-partite entanglement. We find that the residual entanglement of the MRSM inequality can effectively distinguish the separable states. We also compare the tightness of various SM inequalities and provide examples using a four-qubit mixed state and a five-qubit pure state to illustrate the MRSM inequality. These examples characterize the trade-off relations among entanglement components involving varying numbers of qubits. Our results provide a rigorous framework to characterize and quantify the monogamy of multipartite entanglement.</description>

      <title>Dimensional advantage in network cooling with hybrid oscillator-qudit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the cooling of networks of oscillators through repeated unitary evolution followed by conditional measurement on a finite-dimensional auxiliary system, coupled via Jaynes-Cummings type interaction. We prove that near-perfect cooling of the oscillator to vacuum is fundamentally impossible when the auxiliary system is a qubit, establishing a no-cooling theorem for a two-level regulator. Moving beyond this limitation, we reveal a twofold dimensional advantage of higher-dimensional auxiliaries - reducing the number of required cycles, and enabling the efficient cooling of oscillators with higher initial energies. We further show that, while extending the network leads to a saturation of this dimensional advantage at moderate auxiliary dimensions, near-perfect cooling remains achievable for linear network configurations but fails for star networks. Moreover, we highlight the adaptability of the proposed protocol by demonstrating efficient cooling of hybrid continuous- and discrete-variable systems that naturally support the generation of non-Gaussian and entangled quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical properties of the neutral silicon-vacancy center in diamond under extreme isotropic strain fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutral silicon--vacancy (SiV$^{0}$) center in diamond combines inversion symmetry with optical emission, making it a robust quantum emitter resilient to stray electric fields. Using first-principles density-functional theory, we quantify its response to isotropic strain spanning strong compression and tensile regimes (effective hydrostatic pressures of approximately $-80$ to $180$~GPa). The coexistence of doubly degenerate $e_g$ and $e_u$ levels produces a structural instability captured by a quadratic product Jahn--Teller model. Under isotropic compression, the zero-phonon line blue-shifts nearly linearly while the $E_g$ phonon stiffens, suppressing vibronic instabilities and reducing Jahn--Teller quenching. Consequently, the Ham-reduced excited-state spin--orbit splitting increases substantially and the dark--bright vibronic gap widens. In contrast, isotropic tensile strain enhances vibronic effects and induces symmetry breaking beyond a critical strain, with tunneling-mediated dynamical averaging at the onset. Throughout the symmetry-preserving regime, parity remains well defined, so isotropic strain alone does not activate the dark transition. Charge-transition levels indicate photostability of the emission deep into the compressive regime, and near the highest photostable deformation ($\sim 100$~GPa), the radiative lifetime increases due to a reduced transition dipole moment despite the increasing optical energy. These trends yield compact calibration relations linking optical and spin observables to isotropic strain and establish SiV$^{0}$ as a symmetry-protected, strain-tunable quantum emitter operating into the multi-megabar-equivalent regime.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration that qubits can be cloned at will, if encrypted with a single-use decryption key</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The no-cloning theorem forbids the creation of identical copies of qubits, thereby imposing strong limitations on quantum technologies. A recently-proposed protocol, encrypted cloning, showed, however, that the creation of perfect clones is theoretically possible - if the clones are simultaneously encrypted with a single-use decryption key. It has remained an open question, however, whether encrypted cloning is stable under hardware noise and thus practical as a quantum primitive. This is nontrivial because spreading quantum information widely could dilute it until barely exceeding the noise level, leading to catastrophic fidelity decay. Given the complexity of hardware noise, theory and classical simulation are insufficient to settle this. Here, we settle this question experimentally, on IBM Heron-R2 superconducting processors using up to 154 qubits. We find that encrypted cloning is stable under hardware noise, even when used as a module, namely in parallel, series or interleaved, while preserving pre-existing entanglement. This establishes it as a versatile quantum primitive for practical use, and it necessitates a refinement to our understanding of the no-cloning theorem: quantum information can be spread at will, in theory and in practice, without dilution or degradation, if encrypted or obscured. The actual constraint is that the decryption mechanism must be single-use.</description>

      <title>Error-Tolerant Quantum State Discrimination: Optimization and Quantum Circuit Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop error-tolerant quantum state discrimination(QSD) strategies that maintain reliable performance under moderate noise. Two complementary approaches are proposed: CrossQSD, which generalizes unambiguous discrimination with tunable confidence bounds to balance accuracy and efficiency, and FitQSD, which optimizes the measurement outcome distribution to approximate that of the ideal noiseless case. Furthermore, we provide a unified hybrid-objective QSD framework that continuously interpolates between minimum-error discrimination (MED) and FitQSD, allowing flexible trade-offs among competing objectives. The associated optimization problems are formulated as convex programs and efficiently solved via disciplined convex programming or, in many cases, semidefinite programming. Additionally, a circuit synthesis framework based on a modified Naimark dilation and isometry synthesis enables hardware-efficient implementations with substantially reduced qubit and gate resources. An open-source toolkit automates the full optimization and synthesis workflow, providing a practical route to QSD on current quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Efficient Operator Selection and Warm-Start Strategy for Excitations in Variational Quantum Eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for efficient preparation of electronic ground states, leveraging the optimizer ExcitationSolve [J\"ager et al., Comm. Phys. (2025)] and established variational quantum eigensolver-based operator selection methods, such as Energy Sorting. By combining these tools, we demonstrate a computationally efficient protocol that enables the construction of an approximate ground state from a unitary coupled cluster ansatz via a single sweep over the operator pool. Utilizing efficient classical pre-processing to select the majority of relevant operators, this approach reduces the computational complexity associated with traditional optimization methods. Furthermore, we show that this method can be seamlessly integrated with one-variational-parameter couple exchange operators, thereby further reducing the number of required CNOT operations. Overall, we empirically observe a quadratic convergence speedup beyond state-of-the-art methods, advancing the realization of quantum advantage in quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Emulation of large-scale qubit registers with a phase space approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A phase-space approach is used and benchmarked for the simulation of the continuous-time evolution of large registers of qubits. It is based on a statistical ensemble of independent mean-field trajectories, where mean-field is introduced at the level of the qubits, substituting quantum fluctuations/correlations with classical ones. The approach only involves at worse a quadratic cost in the system size, allowing to simulate up to several thousands of qubits on a classical computer. It provides qualitatively accurate description of one-qubit observables evolutions, making it a useful reference in comparison to techniques limited to small qubit numbers. The predictive power is however less robust for multi-qubits observables. We benchmark the method on the $k$-local transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), considering a large variety of systems ranging from local to all-to-all interactions, and from weak to strong coupling regimes, with up to 2000 qubits. To showcase the versatility of the approach, simulations on 2D and 3D Ising models are also made.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) systems, due to the existence of exceptional point (or ring, surface), exhibit exotic topological features which are inaccessible with the Hermition ones. Current studies on NH topology mainly focus on pure states at zero temperature, while those on mixed states remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the topological properties of mixed states in two-dimentional NH systems, by use of the Uhlmann phase and the thermal Uhlmann-Chern number which are structured via the Uhlmann connection at specific temperatures, revealing distinct topological features compared to their pure state counterparts. We further extend our study to the mixed states in the three-dimensional Abelian and four-dimentional non-Abelian NH systems and verify the high-order mixed-state topology. Our study provides a conceptual and practical pathway for exploring topological properties in the mixed-state regime of NH physics.</description>

      <title>Multi-spin control from one-spin pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling ensembles of weakly coupled spins typically requires computationally expensive multispin optimisations. We present a compact framework that enables control of weakly coupled spin systems (of any spin), but using RF pulses optimised for a single spin-1/2. We do this by explicitly creating a GRAPE pulse with fixed 'active' evolution times using single spin-1/2 methods, and pulsing on one spin at a time. By enforcing this form uniformly across offsets ('band-schematic' pulses),chemical shift and scalar coupling evolution of the entire system can be precisely controlled. We demonstrate the approach by constructing band-schematic pulses and a continuously irradiated joint INEPT (JINEPT) that achieves band-selective transfer $I_z \rightarrow 2I_zS_z$. The framework is implemented in the software Seedless, which both rapidly generates such pulses and analyses the schematic form of arbitrary pulses, enabling robust multi-spin control, without multi-spin optimisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies are powered by platforms to generate complex non-classical states of matter or light to realize applications. We investigate the non-classical properties of high-harmonic generation in semiconductors, an emerging photonic platform. Measuring the click statistics of three double-digit orders, we evaluate witness operators to certify the non-classicality of the generated states. We show that higher-order harmonics driven by a coherent laser are squeezed and entangled. The properties of the emission are well retrieved with an entangled Gaussian state model, obtained by numerical state optimization to multiple observables. Additionally, we perform inter-order heralded measurements to engineer the quantum state of the emission. The heralded states have distinct properties, showing anti-bunched photon statistics. Further, we witness the generation of a quantum non-Gaussian state, a resource highly relevant for quantum information. With this, we establish high-harmonic generation as a platform for generating quantum optical resources.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimization in Loc(Q)ation Science: QUBO Formulations, Benchmark Problems, and a Computational Study</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing and the increasing availability of quantum hardware have substantially enhanced the practical relevance of quantum approaches to discrete optimization. Among these, the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation provides a unifying modeling framework for a broad class of $\mathbf{NP}$-hard problems and is naturally suited to quantum computing and quantum-inspired algorithms. Location science, network design, and logistics represent core application domains of discrete optimization, combining high practical impact with substantial computational challenges. In this work, we develop QUBO formulations for several fundamental problems in these domains, including a nonlinear integer formulation of the Discrete Ordered Median Problem (DOMP). Beyond their modeling relevance, these QUBO formulations serve as representative benchmark problems for assessing quantum algorithms and quantum hardware. We further derive a tight bound for the penalty parameter ensuring equivalence between the QUBO formulation and its underlying integer program. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive computational study using QAOA, WS-QAOA, and classical heuristics for QUBO instances of the $p$-Median Problem and the Fixed-Charge Facility Location Problem (FCFLP), and introduce two effective warm-start strategies for WS-QAOA based on its linear programming relaxation.</description>

      <title>Improving Quantum Multi-Objective Optimization with Archiving and Substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding optimal solutions of conflicting objectives is a daily matter in many industrial applications, with multi-objective optimization trying to find the best solutions to them. The advent of quantum computing has led to researchers wondering if the promised exponential advantage can be obtained for these problems by variational quantum multi-objective optimization (QMOO) algorithm. Here, we improve it by introducing a Pareto Archive and dominated solutions substitution, clearly improving in hyper-volume convergence at additional quantum and classical cost. We propose the use of RMNK-landscapes as a unifying testbed for benchmarking QMOO, as it is common in classical multi-objective field. By devising a generic classical-to-quantum mapping of these landscapes, we perform a numerical hyperparameter tuning of QMOO, significantly enhancing its performance. Finally, we compare QMOO against well-known classical solvers for multi-objective tasks, NSGA-II/III, showing comparable results in small instances. Our results demonstrate that QMOO, when carefully tuned for the task at hand, might be advantageous on harder problems than its classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Recirculating Quantum Photonic Networks for Fast Deterministic Quantum Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in photonics-based deterministic quantum information processing is to realize key transformations on time scales shorter than those of detrimental decoherence and loss mechanisms. This challenge has been addressed through device-focused approaches that aim to increase nonlinear interactions relative to decoherence rates. In this work, we adopt a complementary architecture-focused approach by proposing a recirculating quantum photonic network (RQPN) that minimizes the duration of quantum information processing tasks, thereby reducing the requirements on nonlinear interaction rates. The RQPN consists of a network of all-to-all connected nonlinear cavities with dynamically controlled waveguide couplings, and it processes information by capturing a photonic input state, recirculating photons between the cavities, and releasing a photonic output state. We demonstrate the RQPN's architectural advantage through two examples: first, we show that processing all qubits simultaneously yields faster operations than single- and two-qubit decompositions of the three-qubit Toffoli gate. Second, we demonstrate implementations of a measurement-free correction for single-photon loss, achieving up to seven-fold speedups and significantly improved hardware efficiency relative to state-of-the-art architecture proposals. Our work shows that a single hardware-efficient recirculating architecture substantially reduces the temporal overhead of multi-qubit gates and quantum error correction, thereby lowering the barrier to experimental realizations of deterministic photonic quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Trainability of Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial Circuit Born Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instantaneous quantum polynomial quantum circuit Born machines (IQP-QCBMs) have been proposed as quantum generative models with a classically tractable training objective based on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and a potential quantum advantage motivated by sampling-complexity arguments, making them an exciting model worth deeper investigation. While recent works have further proven the universality of a (slightly generalized) model, the next immediate question pertains to its trainability, i.e., whether it suffers from the exponentially vanishing loss gradients, known as the barren plateau issue, preventing effective use, and how regimes of trainability overlap with regimes of possible quantum advantage. Here, we provide significant strides in these directions. To study the trainability at initialization, we analytically derive closed-form expressions for the variances of the partial derivatives of the MMD loss function and provide general upper and lower bounds. With uniform initialization, we show that barren plateaus depend on the generator set and the spectrum of the chosen kernel. We identify regimes in which low-weight-biased kernels avoid exponential gradient suppression in structured topologies. Also, we prove that a small-variance Gaussian initialization ensures polynomial scaling for the gradient under mild conditions. As for the potential quantum advantage, we further argue, based on previous complexity-theoretic arguments, that sparse IQP families can output a probability distribution family that is classically intractable, and that this distribution remains trainable at initialization at least at lower-weight frequencies.</description>

      <title>Ergotropic Mpemba crossings in finite-dimensional quantum batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a state initially farther from equilibrium relaxes more rapidly than one that starts nearer to equilibrium. In the context of finite-dimensional quantum batteries interacting with an environment, we introduce the notion of an ergotropic Mpemba crossing (EMC), defined by the intersection of ergotropy trajectories during the dynamics. For qubit batteries subjected to amplitude damping noise, we derive a condition for the occurrence of EMC in terms of the relative coherence of the initial states and fully characterize the region of state space that exhibits EMC with respect to a fixed reference state. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that under anisotropic Pauli noise, the emergence of EMC is jointly governed by the coherence and the energy of the initial states. To elucidate the physical origin of EMC, we decompose ergotropy into coherent and incoherent contributions and show that, in qubit systems, the coherent component plays a crucial role for EMC, an observation that strikingly does not extend to three-level batteries. Further, by extending our analysis to non-Markovian environments, we demonstrate that, unlike the Markovian case, non-Markovian dynamics can give rise to multiple Mpemba crossings, with the total number of crossings always being odd. Moreover, analyzing the connection between the EMC and the conventional state Mpemba effect reveals that, for qubits, an EMC necessarily entails a state Mpemba crossing while this correspondence breaks down for qutrits, where EMCs may arise without any state Mpemba crossing.</description>

      <title>Two-Level System Spectroscopy from Correlated Multilevel Relaxation in Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmon qubits are a cornerstone of modern superconducting quantum computing platforms. Temporal fluctuations of energy relaxation in these qubits are widely attributed to microscopic two-level systems (TLSs) in device dielectrics and interfaces, yet isolating individual defects typically relies on tuning the qubit or the TLS into resonance. We demonstrate a novel spectroscopy method for fixed-frequency transmons based on multilevel relaxation: repeated preparation of the second excited state and simultaneous $T_1$ extraction of the first and second excited states reveals characteristic correlations in the decay rates of adjacent transitions. From these correlations we identify one or more dominant TLSs and reconstruct their frequency drift over time. Remarkably, we find that TLSs detuned by $\gtrsim 100\,\mathrm{MHz}$ from the qubit transition can still significantly influence relaxation. The proposed method provides a powerful tool for TLS spectroscopy without the need to tune the transmon frequency, either via a flux-tunable inductor or AC-Stark shifts.</description>

      <title>Generalized Kramers-Wannier Self-Duality in Hopf-Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kramers-Wannier transformation of the 1+1d transverse-field Ising model exchanges the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases and, at criticality, manifests as a non-invertible symmetry. Extending such self-duality symmetries beyond gauging of abelian groups in tensor-product Hilbert spaces has, however, remained challenging. In this work, we construct a generalized 1+1d Ising model based on a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra $H$ that enjoys an anomaly-free non-invertible symmetry $\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. We provide an intuitive diagrammatic formulation of both the Hamiltonian and the symmetry operators using a non-(co)commutative generalization of ZX-calculus built from Hopf-algebraic data. When $H$ is self-dual, we further construct a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality operator that exchanges the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases and becomes a non-invertible symmetry at the self-dual point. This enlarged symmetry mixes with lattice translation and, in the infrared, flows to a weakly integral fusion category given by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ extension of $\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. Specializing to the Kac-Paljutkin algebra $H_8$, the smallest self-dual Hopf algebra beyond abelian group algebras, we numerically study the phase diagram and identify four of the six $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$-symmetric gapped phases, separated by Ising critical lines and meeting at a multicritical point. We also realize all six $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$-symmetric gapped phases on the lattice via the $H$-comodule algebra formalism, in agreement with the module-category classification of $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$. Our results provide a unified Hopf-algebraic framework for non-invertible symmetries, dualities, and the tensor product lattice models that realize them.</description>

      <title>Properties of Bose-Einstein condensates with altermagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a weakly interacting two-component Bose--Einstein condensate in the miscible regime in the presence of \emph{altermagnetism}, i.e., a collinear and globally compensated magnetic order that breaks spin-rotation symmetry while maintaining zero net magnetization. Within Bogoliubov theory, we derive the quasiparticle spectrum and coherence factors and show that altermagnetic order generically induces an angular dependence of the low-energy excitations. As a result, the sound velocity, momentum-resolved magnetization in the quantum depletion, and density--spin response functions acquire anisotropic components. We show that these anisotropic contributions vanish after angular averaging, consistent with the defining feature of altermagnetism: nontrivial local spin polarization without a global magnetization. Finally, we evaluate the Lee--Huang--Yang correction to the ground-state energy in the altermagnetic phase. Our results should be testable with ultracold-atom experiments in the foreseeable future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalization for the quantum information retrieval protocol recently illustrated by Verlinde and van der Heijden for evaporating black holes is provided to inclusions of type III von Neumann factors. The physical interest of such scenario arises in Quantum Field Theory, where local algebras are type III von Neumann algebras. The formula obtained can be easily interpreted in terms of the statistical dimension of superselection sectors in the case of black holes undergoing charge evaporation, thanks to the index-statistics theorem, leading to a thermodynamic interpretation. A constraint on the values of the index leads to a final remark about the quantization of the charge emitted by the black hole during the evaporation process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We critically revisit Einstein's 1905 heuristic argument for lightquanta, considering its internal coherence and the scope of its applicability. We argue that Einstein's reasoning, often celebrated for its originality, is ambiguous because it can be understood as a fluctuation or as a comparison between equilibrium states. A historical and conceptual analysis of Einstein's use of Boltzmann's principle in those years reveals his evolving stance on its meaning and the role of probability, as well as his persistent doubts about the nature of radiation. We use our analysis to examine the limitations of extending the notion of Einstein's lightquanta across the electromagnetic spectrum: the relevant parameter is not the frequency, but the occupancy number.</description>

      <title>Scaling and Universality at Noise-Affected Non-Equilibrium Spin Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate scaling and universality in nonequilibrium spin correlation functions in the presence of uncorrelated noise. In the absence of noise, spin correlation functions exhibit a crossover from monotonic decay at fast sweep velocities to oscillatory behavior at slow sweeps. We show that, under a stochastically driven field, the critical sweep velocity at which the spin correlation functions undergo an abrupt change decreases with increasing noise strength and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. Remarkably, when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are comparable, the excitation probability becomes locked to pk = 1/2 over a finite momentum window, signaling the emergence of noise-induced maximally mixed modes. This gives rise to a highly oscillatory region in the dynamical phase diagram, whose threshold sweep velocity increases with noise and likewise exhibits quadratic scaling with the noise strength. Finally, we identify a universal scaling function under which all boundary sweep-velocity curves collapse onto a single universal curve.</description>

      <title>Reaching the quantum noise limit for interferometric measurement of optical nonlinearity in vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Electrodynamics predicts that the vacuum must behave as a nonlinear optical medium:the vacuum optical index should increase when vacuum is stressed by intense electromagnetic fields.The DeLLight (Deflection of Light by Light) project aims to measure it by using intense and ultra-short laser pulses delivered by the LASERIX facility at IJCLab (Paris-Saclay University). Theprinciple is to measure by interferometry the deflection of a low-intensity probe pulse when crossingthe vacuum optical index gradient produced by an external high-intensity pump pulse. The detectionof the expected signal requires measuring the position of the interference intensity profile with a highspatial resolution, limited by the ultimate quantum noise. However, the spatial resolution is highlydegraded by the phase noise induced by the mechanical vibrations of the interferometer. In order tosuppress this interferometric phase noise, we have developed a new method, named High-FrequencyPhase Noise Suppression (HFPNS) method, based on the use of a delayed reference signal to correctany noise-related signal appearing in the probe beam. In this work, we present the experimentalvalidation of this novel method. The results demonstrate a robust path toward picometer-scalesensitivity and provide a key step toward the observation of QED-induced vacuum refraction.</description>

      <title>Photon counting beyond the rotating-wave approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems are often described by a Lindblad master equation, which relies on a set of approximations, most importantly the rotating-wave approximation which is only valid for weak damping. In the Lindblad setting, dissipative processes are described through jump operators, distinguishing between absorption and emission of photons. This enables the simple identification of emitted photons which provides a straightforward way to obtain the radiation statistics. Outside the rotating-wave limit, the Lindblad approach does not work. Open quantum systems can then be described by, e.g., the quantum Langevin equation. However, in this framework the number of emitted photons is not easily accessible. In this work, we point out how to obtain the photon counting statistics from a quantum Langevin equation and provide an expression for the photon current operator, for arbitrary systems coupled to linear environments. As an example, we employ the method to study the radiation statistics of a damped harmonic oscillator at finite temperature beyond the rotating-wave approximation. We show that even outside the rotating-wave limit, the most important contribution to the radiation statistics can be captured by an effective Lindblad equation, thus extending the range of possible applications of the Lindblad framework.</description>

Abstract: Identifying where quantum models may offer practical benefits in near term quantum machine learning (QML) requires moving beyond isolated algorithmic proposals toward systematic and empirical exploration across models, datasets, and hardware constraints. We introduce MerLin, an open source framework designed as a discovery engine for photonic and hybrid quantum machine learning. MerLin integrates optimized strong simulation of linear optical circuits into standard PyTorch and scikit learn workflows, enabling end to end differentiable training of quantum layers. MerLin is designed around systematic benchmarking and reproducibility. As an initial contribution, we reproduce eighteen state of the art photonic and hybrid QML works spanning kernel methods, reservoir computing, convolutional and recurrent architectures, generative models, and modern training paradigms. These reproductions are released as reusable, modular experiments that can be directly extended and adapted, establishing a shared experimental baseline consistent with empirical benchmarking methodologies widely adopted in modern artificial intelligence. By embedding photonic quantum models within established machine learning ecosystems, MerLin allows practitioners to leverage existing tooling for ablation studies, cross modality comparisons, and hybrid classical quantum workflows. The framework already implements hardware aware features, allowing tests on available quantum hardware while enabling exploration beyond its current capabilities, positioning MerLin as a future proof co design tool linking algorithms, benchmarks, and hardware.</description>

Abstract: Reciprocity is a fundamental symmetry present in many natural phenomena and engineered systems. Distinct situations where this symmetry is broken are typically grouped under the umbrella term "nonreciprocity", colloquially defined by: the action of A on B $\neq$ the action of B on A. In this review, we elucidate what nonreciprocity is by providing an introduction to its most salient classes: nonvariational dynamics, violations of Newton's third law, broken detailed balance, nonreciprocal responses and nonreciprocity of arbitrary linear operators. Next, we point out where to find these manifestations of non-reciprocity, from ensembles of particles with field mediated interactions to synthetic neural networks and open quantum systems. Given this breadth of contexts and the lack of an all-encompassing definition, it makes it all the more intriguing that some general conclusions can be gathered, when distinct definitions of nonreciprocity overlap. We explore what these universal consequences are with a special emphasis on collective phenomena that arise in nonreciprocal many-body systems. The topics covered include nonreciprocal phase transitions and non-normal amplification of noise and perturbations. We conclude with some open questions.</description>

      <title>Floquet Control of Electron and Exciton Transport in Kekul\'e-Distorted Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the Floquet dynamics of electrons and excitons (particle-hole pairs) in a Dirac material referred to as Kekul\'e-distorted graphene. Specifically, we examine the role played by a high frequency driving electromagnetic field on the tunneling and blocking by a potential barrier on both the charged single particles as well as the neutral composite particles. We demonstrate that the small effective masses of the electron and hole for the energy spectrum of this Kekul\'e distorted graphene leads to practically almost perfect transmission across a symmetric potential barrier for any angle of incidence of impinging excitons. However, this unexpected Klein paradox for excitons does not hold for the single-particle electrons. The reduced total transmission of electron due to Kekul\'e distortion is more suppressed due to irradiation. Additionally, we calculate and investigate the exciton binding energy since the quantum tunneling of a bound electron-hole pair across a potential barrier is governed by its mass measured in the center of mass and binding energy of the composite pair. Thus, irradiation with circularly polarized light fundamentally modifies exciton formation, coherence and transport properties, thereby producing unusual topological behaviors. These behaviors are unlike conventional Dirac materials. Possible technical applications of the results arising from our investigation include valleytronics due to the folding of the valleys, thereby making intervalley coupling feasible. Other practical applications include optoelectronics due to Floquet tuning of energy spectrum and transport properties.</description>

      <title>Characterization and generation of a SQL-beating catlike state through repetitive measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06829v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensitivity in metrology without entanglement is limited by the standard quantum limit (SQL). Recent studies have found that the Heisenberg-limited scaling, the ultimate sensitivity in quantum metrology, can be achieved by generalized cat states, which are characterized by an index that indicates coherence among macroscopically distinct states and are associated with additive observables. Although generalized cat states include diverse states, encompassing classical mixtures of exponentially large numbers of states, the preparation of large generalized cat states has not been demonstrated yet. Here we characterize SQL-beating catlike states using the index $q$ indicating macroscopic coherence and prove that any state with $q&gt;1.5$ has a potential to surpass the SQL when used as a sensor. We propose a protocol to generate them through repetitive measurements on a quantum spin system of $N$ spins, which we call a spin ensemble. Starting from a thermal equilibrium state of the spin ensemble, we demonstrate that we can increase the coherence among the spin ensemble via repetitive weak measurements of its total magnetization, which is indirectly measured through an ancillary qubit collectively coupled to the ensemble. Notably, our method for creating the SQL-beating catlike states requires no dynamical control over the spin ensemble. As a potential experimental realization, we discuss a hybrid system composed of a superconducting flux qubit and donor spins in silicon. Our results pave the way for the realization of entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology in state-of-the-art technology.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore both the internal and external atomic degrees of freedom to observe quantum entanglement between the modes produced by a mirrorless optical parametric oscillator operating below the oscillation threshold in a sample of free-space cold cesium atoms. Using a new heterodyne technique, we recover the covariance matrix that reveals the quantum entanglement for two different pairs of modes, thus demonstrating the generation of four entangled modes in this system. Applications to quantum networks, and the possibilities of studying higher orders of entanglement are a direct consequence of the present study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characterization of high-dimensional entanglement plays a crucial role in the field of quantum information science. Conventional entanglement criteria measuring coherent superpositions of multiple basis states face experimental bottlenecks on most physical platforms due to limited multi-channel control. Here, we introduce a practically efficient detection strategy based on randomized product projections. We show that the first-order moments of such projections can be used to estimate entanglement fidelity, thereby enabling practical and efficient certification of the Schmidt number in high-dimensional bipartite systems. By constructing optimal observables, it is sufficient to merely measure a single basis state, substantially reducing experimental overhead. Moreover, we present an algorithm to obtain a lower bound of the Schmidt number with a high confidence level from a limited number of experimental data. Our results open up resource-efficient experimental avenues to detect high-dimensional entanglement and test its implementations in modern information technologies.</description>

      <title>Lindblad many-body scars</title>

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars have received much recent attention for being both intriguing non-ergodic states in otherwise quantum chaotic systems and promising candidates to encode quantum information efficiently. So far, these studies have mostly been restricted to Hermitian systems. Here, we study many-body scars in many-body quantum chaotic systems coupled to a Markovian bath, which we term Lindblad many-body scars. They are defined as simultaneous eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian and dissipative parts of the vectorized Liouvillian. Importantly, because their eigenvalues are purely real, they are not related to revivals. The number and nature of the scars depend on both the symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the choice of jump operators. For a dissipative four-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with $N$ fermions, either Majorana or complex, we construct analytically some of these Lindblad scars while others could only be obtained numerically. As an example of the former, we identify $N/2+1$ scars for complex fermions due to the $U(1)$ symmetry of the model and two scars for Majorana fermions as a consequence of the parity symmetry. Similar results are obtained for a dissipative XXZ spin chain. We also characterize the physical properties of Lindblad scars. First, the operator size is independent of the disorder realization and has a vanishing variance. By contrast, the operator size for non-scarred states, believed to be quantum chaotic, is well described by a distribution centered around a specific size and a finite variance, which could be relevant for a precise definition of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in dissipative quantum chaos. Moreover, the entanglement entropy of these scars has distinct features such as a strong dependence on the partition choice and, in certain cases, a large entanglement.</description>

      <title>Distilled remote entanglement between superconducting qubits across optical channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A promising quantum computing architecture comprises modules of superconducting quantum processors linked via optical channels using quantum transducers. As quantum transducer hardware improves, a need has arisen to understand the quantitative relationship between transducer-device characteristics and the strength of the resulting remote entanglement. Using Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate 2-to-1 and 3-to-1 entanglement distillation methods, our model maps transducer device performance up to system-level channel performance, thereby allowing the performance of remote entanglement approaches to be compared and optimized. We find the extreme photon loss (EPL) distillation protocol to be particularly high performing. Moreover, even without distillation, present-day transducers with added noise of photons are at the threshold of enabling remote Bell pairs with fidelities exceeding 50%. If the next generation of transducers can improve by 3 orders of magnitude in added noise, efficiency, and repetition rates, then they would allow for remote two-qubit gates achieving 99.7% fidelities at MHz rates. These results set practical targets for transducers to be ready for deployment into modular quantum computing systems.</description>

      <title>Weighted Approximate Quantum Natural Gradient for Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most prominent algorithms using near-term quantum devices, designed to find the ground state of a Hamiltonian. In VQE, a classical optimizer iteratively updates the parameters in the quantum circuit. Among various optimization methods, the quantum natural gradient descent (QNG) stands out as a promising optimization approach for VQE. However, standard QNG only leverages the quantum Fisher information of the entire system and treats each subsystem equally in the optimization process, without accounting for the different weights and contributions of each subsystem corresponding to each local term in the Hamiltonian. To address this limitation, we propose a Weighted Approximate Quantum Natural Gradient (WA-QNG) method tailored for $k$-local Hamiltonians. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the potential advantages of WA-QNG compared to QNG from three distinct perspectives and reveal its connection with the Gauss-Newton method. We also show it outperforms the standard quantum natural gradient descent in the numerical simulations for seeking the ground state of the Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: We present efficient and practical protocols to measure the second R\'enyi entropy (RE), whose exponential is known as the purity. We achieve this by establishing a direct connection to a Loschmidt echo (LE) type measurement sequence, applicable to quantum many-body systems. Notably, our approach does not rely on random-noise averaging, a feature that can be extended to protocols to measure out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), as we demonstrate. By way of example, we show that our protocols can be practically implemented in superconducting qubit-based platforms, as well as in cavity-QED trapped ultra-cold gases.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers show potential for achieving computational advantage over classical computers, with many candidate applications in combinatorial optimisation. We present an application level benchmarking framework for near-term quantum optimisation algorithms using a dense Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) materials science problem as a representative test-case. To solve this problem, we implement two methods, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Annealing (QA), on commercially-available gate-based and quantum annealing devices that are accessible via Quantum-Computing-as-a-Service (QCaaS) models. To analyse the performance of these algorithms, we use a toolbox of relevant metrics and compare performance against three classical algorithms. We employ quantum methods to solve fully-connected QUBOs of up to $72$ variables, and find that algorithm performance beyond this is restricted by device connectivity, noise and classical computation time overheads. The applicability of our approach goes beyond the selected configurational analysis test-case, and we anticipate that our approach will be of use for optimisation problems in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of a discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) can be realized within a purely classical interacting particle system composed of some boxes and a large but finite number of balls, and can, in principle, be implemented in a tabletop experimental setting. The distribution of the balls evolves under stochastic, occupation-dependent update rules at each lattice site, producing quantum-walk dynamics without invoking a wavefunction. The update parameters are fixed by the parameters of coin and shift operations of the DTQW. This framework naturally yields a generalized active spin model and provides a minimal lattice-based microscopic understanding of the emergence of quantum-like dynamics in active matter systems. This interdisciplinary approach connects the Classical models to the broad range of applications where DTQWs are successfully employed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum kicked rotor in the near-resonant regime and observe distinct caustic structures, such as recurring cusps, cusp oscillations, and reticular cusp patterns in high-order resonant cases. By deriving a path integral expression for the wave function's time evolution, we analytically determine both the positions of the caustic singularities and their recurrence periods. We further derive and validate a power-law scaling with an Arnold index of $1/4$, which establishes a quantitative relationship between the amplification of the wave amplitude, the kicking strength, and the resonant detuning parameter. We also explore the classical-quantum correspondence of these caustic singularities, demonstrating that chaos disrupts phase matching and ultimately erodes the caustic structure. Finally, we address the feasibility of experimental implementations of our findings and their broader ramifications for related research fields.</description>

      <title>Simulating magic state cultivation with few Clifford terms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08658v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon [arXiv:2509.01224], we present a few methods on how to simulate the non-Clifford $d=5$ magic state cultivation circuits [arXiv:2409.17595] with a sum of $\approx 8$ Clifford ZX-diagrams on average, at $0.1\%$ noise. Compared to a magic cat state stabiliser decomposition of all $53$ non-Clifford spiders ($6{,}377{,}292$ terms required), this is more than $7 \times 10^{5}$ times reduction in the number of terms. Our stabiliser decomposition has the advantage of representing the final non-Clifford state (in light of circuit errors) as a sum of Clifford ZX-diagrams. This will be useful in simulating the escape stage of magic state cultivation, where one needs to port the resultant state of cultivation into a larger Clifford circuit with many more qubits. Still, it's necessary to only track $\approx 8$ Clifford terms. Our result sheds light on the simulability of operationally relevant, high $T$-count quantum circuits with some internal structure.
  Finally, we provide numerical results for full non-Clifford stabiliser rank simulation based on $\mathtt{tsim}$ along with optimisations using our cutting decompositions. Nearly $132,400$ shots per second can be obtained on a laptop for the smaller $d = 3$ circuits at SD6 circuit level noise $p=0.0005$, making it only $\sim 34$ times slower than its fully Clifford proxy simulation via $\mathtt{stim}$ using $S$ gates.</description>

Abstract: Encoding combinatorial optimization problems into physically meaningful Hamiltonians with tractable energy landscapes forms the foundation of quantum optimization. Numerous works have studied such efficient encodings for the class of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. However, many real-world tasks are constrained, and handling equality and, in particular, inequality constraints on quantum computers remains a major challenge. In this letter, we show that including inequality constraints is equivalent to solving a multi-objective optimization. This insight motivates the Multi-Objective Quantum Approximation (MOQA) framework, which approximates the maximum via smaller $p$-norms and comes with rigorous performance guarantees. MOQA operates directly at the Hamiltonian level and is compatible with, but not restricted to, ground-state solvers such as quantum adiabatic annealing, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), or imaginary-time evolution. Moreover, it is not limited to quadratic functions.</description>

      <title>Reducing measurements in quantum erasure correction by quantum local recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22890v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As measurements are costly and prone to errors on certain quantum computing devices, we should reduce the number of measurements and the number of measured qudits as small as possible in quantum erasure correction. It is intuitively obvious that a decoder can omit measurements of stabilizers that are irrelevant to erased qudits, but this intuition has not been rigorously formalized as far as the author is aware. In this paper, we formalize relevant stabilizers sufficient to correct erased qudits with a quantum stabilizer code, by using a recent idea from quantum local recovery. The minimum required number of measured stabilizer observables is also clarified. As an application, we also show that correction of $\delta$ erasures on a generalized surface code proposed by Delfosse, Iyer and Poulin requires at most $\delta$ measurements of vertexes and at most $\delta$ measurements of faces, independently of its code parameters.</description>

      <title>Scaling behavior of dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point-gap topology, characterized by spectral winding numbers, is crucial to non-Hermitian topological phases and dramatically alters real-time dynamics. In this paper, we study the evolution of quantum particles in dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing, using the saddle-point approximation method. For trivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points can also be saddle points. This leads to a single power-law decay of the local Green's function, with the asymptotic scaling behavior determined by the order of these saddle points. In contrast, for nontrivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points do not coincide with saddle points in general. This results in a dynamical behavior characterized by two different scaling laws for distinct time regimes. In the short-time regime, the local Green's function is governed by the dominant saddle points and exhibits an asymptotic exponential decay. In the long-time regime, however, the dynamics is controlled by imaginary gap-closing points, leading to a power-law decay envelope. Our findings advance the understanding of quantum dynamics in dissipative systems and provide predictions testable in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Ligand-like Molecules through Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization in Density Matrix Embedding Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate treatment of electron correlation in extended molecular systems remains computationally challenging using classical electronic structure methods. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms offer a potential route to overcome these limitations; however, their practical deployment on existing quantum computers requires strategies that both reduce problem size and mitigate hardware noise. In this work, we combine Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) to compute ground-state energies of a set of natural ligand-like molecules in the minimal Slater Type Orbital (STO-3G) basis set. DMET provides a systematic fragmentation of a molecule into embedded impurity subproblems, while SQD enables construction and classical diagonalization of reduced configuration spaces through quantum sampling enhanced by iterative configuration recovery. The resulting embedded Hamiltonians are solved on IBM's Eagle R3 superconducting quantum hardware (IBM Sherbrooke). The DMET-SQD energies obtained for all systems considered exhibit strong agreement with DMET-FCI benchmark values within chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol). These results demonstrate that sample-based quantum methods, when integrated with a robust embedding framework, can reliably extend quantum computation towards simulation of chemically relevant molecular systems, showcasing potential applications in the field of drug discovery.</description>

Abstract: A laser beam is often modelled by a pure coherent state. In fact its state is mixed, even if it has coherent-state photon-number statistics (Poissonian), because the phase must vary. We consider such an ideal laser beam, with phase diffusion rate $\ell$, equal to its (Lorentzian) spectral width. We show that the beam entropy is extensive, with an entropy flow of $\dot{S} = k_B \sqrt{\dot{N}\ell}$, where $\dot{N}$ is the number flow. We give an intuitive explanation for this remarkably simple result, and compare it to a unidirectional thermal beam's.</description>

      <title>Euler-Korteweg vortices: A fluid-mechanical analogue to the Schr\"odinger and Klein-Gordon equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum theory and relativity exhibit several formal analogies with fluid mechanics. This paper examines under which conditions a coherent classical fluid model may recover the most basic mathematical formalism of both theories. By assuming that the angular momentum of an irrotational vortex in an inviscid, barotropic, isothermal fluid with sound speed c is equal in magnitude to the reduced Planck constant, and incorporating Korteweg capillary stress, a complex wave equation describing the momentum and continuity equations of a Euler-Korteweg vortex is obtained. When uniform convection is introduced, the weak field approximation of this wave equation is equivalent to Schr\"odinger's equation. The model is shown to yield classical analogues to de Broglie wavelength, the Einstein-Planck relation, the Born rule and the uncertainty principle. Accounting for the retarded propagation of the wavefield of a vortex in convection produces the Lorentz transformation and the Klein-Gordon equation, with Schr\"odinger's equation appearing as the low-Mach-number limit. These results demonstrate that, under explicit assumptions, a classical continuum can recover some of the simplest mathematical formalisms of quantum and relativistic theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum trajectories for time-binned data and their closeness to fully conditioned quantum trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum trajectories are dynamical equations for quantum states conditioned on the results of a time-continuous measurement, such as a continuous-in-time current $\vec y_t$. Recently there has been renewed interest in dynamical maps for quantum trajectories with time-intervals of finite size $\Delta t$. Guilmin \emph{et al.} (unpublished) derived such a dynamical map for the (experimentally relevant) case where only the average current $I_t$ over each interval is available. Surprisingly, this binned data still generates a conditioned state $\rho_\text{\faFaucet}$ that is almost pure (for efficient measurements), with an impurity scaling as $(\Delta t)^{3}$. We show that, nevertheless, the typical distance of $\rho_\text{\faFaucet}$ from $\hat{\psi}_{\text{F}; \vec y_t}$ -- the projector for the pure state conditioned on the full current -- is as large as $(\Delta t)^{3/2}$. We introduce another finite-interval dynamical map (``$\Phi$-map''), which requires only one additional real statistic, $\phi_t$, of the current in the interval, that gives a conditioned state $\hat{\psi}_\Phi$ which is only $(\Delta t)^{2}$-distant from $\hat{\psi}_{\text{F}; \vec y_t}$. We numerically verify these scalings of the error (distance from the true states) for these two maps, as well as for the lowest-order (It\^o) map and two other higher-order maps. Our results show that, for a generic system, if the statistic $\phi_t$ can be extracted from experiment along with $I_t$, then the $\Phi$-map gives a smaller error than any other.</description>

Abstract: We improve on our version of the second law of thermodynamics as a deterministic theorem for quantum spin systems in two basic aspects. The first concerns the general statement of the second law: spontaneous changes in an adiabatically closed system will always be in the direction of increasing mean entropy, which rises to a maximal value. Two specific examples concern the transition from pure to mixed states in two different universality classes of dynamics in one dimension, one being the exponential model, the other the Dyson model, the dynamics of the latter exhibiting strong graphical evidence of quantum chaos, as a consequence of the results of Albert and Kiessling on the Cloitre function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and bright single photon sources on photonic chips are key to scaling quantum technologies. Spontaneous four wave mixing in micro-ring resonators creates excellent narrowband and tunable photon sources. We experimentally demonstrate the optimization of heralding efficiency and brightness by tuning the coupling of the pump, signal and idler modes into the resonator whilst operating in a pulsed pump regime. We observe a maximum detected pair rate of over 93,000~coincidences per second in a moderately over-coupled regime, alongside a high intrinsic idler heralding efficiency of 97.87$\pm$8.97\% when operating close to maximal over-coupling. The measured dependence on coupling strength is in strong agreement with theoretical predictions, experimentally validating the predicted trade-off between brightness and heralding efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin resonance phenomena are conventionally described using transition probabilities formulated in a rotating frame, whose physical meaning implicitly depends on the choice of quantum reference standard. In this Colloquium, we show that a spin in a rotating magnetic field constitutes a configuration involving two quantum descriptions that share a common quantization operator but differ in their kinematic and dynamical roles. The transition probability therefore emerges as a relational quantity between quantum reference standards rather than an intrinsic property of a single evolving spin state. By incorporating the kinematic motion of the spin vector together with the dynamical evolution, this framework restores consistent energy accounting and reveals the dual-reference structure underlying spin dynamics in rotating magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: The Rayleigh criterion is a widely known limit in the resolution of incoherent sources with classical measurements in the spatial domain. Unsurprisingly the estimation of the time delay between two weak incoherent signals is afflicted by an analogue problem. In this work, we show the emergence of two-photon quantum beats in the frequency domain from the interference at a beam splitter of a photon emitted by a reference source and one from the two incoherent weak signals. We demonstrate, based on this phenomena, that with a relatively low number of measurements of the frequencies of the interfering photons either bunching or antibunching at the beam splitter output one can achieve a precision amounting to half of the quantum limit, independently of both the mode structure of the photonic wavepackets and the time delay to be estimated. The feasibility of the technique makes it applicable in astronomy, microscopy, remote clocks synchronization and radar ranging</description>

      <title>Structural Theory of Information Backflow in Non-Markovian Relaxation: TC/TCL Formalism and Minimal Phase Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a structural theory of information backflow in minimal non-Markovian relaxation processes within the framework of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. The approach is based on the time-convolution (TC) and time-convolutionless (TCL) projection-operator formalisms for reduced dynamics and on the doubling construction of non-equilibrium thermo field dynamics, which provides an embedding representation of dissipative evolution.
  We introduce a general backflow functional associated with a time-dependent information measure and derive generator-based sufficient conditions for the absence of backflow in terms of divisibility properties and effective relaxation rates. This allows a direct connection between memory kernels in generalized master equations and observable transient phenomena such as entropy overshoot and revival.
  Furthermore, we propose a decomposition of backflow into classical mixing and intrinsic contributions in the doubled representation, leading to a unified classification of transient regimes. Minimal classical and quantum two-state models are analyzed as analytically tractable examples, yielding explicit phase diagrams and recovering Mittag-Leffler-type fractional relaxation as a universal envelope of non-Markovian damping.
  The framework provides a constructive TC-to-TCL procedure for extracting effective rates and organizing memory-induced phenomena in a model-independent manner.</description>

Abstract: Estimating quantum time-series such as the Loschmidt amplitude $f(t)=\langle\psi|\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}Ht}|\psi\rangle$ is central to spectroscopy, Hamiltonian analysis, and many phase-estimation algorithms. Direct estimation via the Hadamard test requires controlled implementations of $\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}Ht}$, and the depth of these controlled circuits grows with $t$, making long-time estimation challenging on near-term hardware. We introduce Quantum Phaselift, a lifting-based framework that estimates the rank-one matrix $Z = f f^\dagger$ rather than estimating $f$ directly. We propose simple quantum circuits for estimating the entries of $Z$ and show that measuring only a narrow band of this matrix around the diagonal is sufficient to uniquely recover $f$. Crucially, this reformulation decouples the controlled circuit depth from the maximum evolution time to scale instead with the width of the measured band. We prove that a $O(1)$ bandwidth suffices for generic signals, leading to substantial savings in controlled operations compared to direct estimation methods. We develop three recovery algorithms with provable exact recovery in the noiseless setting and stability under measurement noise. Finally, we numerically demonstrate that high-quality recovery is possible for the 2D Fermi-Hubbard and 2D transverse-field Ising model signals of size exceeding 100 time points using only a few million measurement shots and reasonable post-processing time, making our time-series estimation techniques efficient and effective for near-term implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two central qubits interacting with a transverse-field Ising chain that serves as their environment. The environment is driven linearly in time across its quantum critical points (QCPs) and, during the evolution, is subjected to quantum reset (QR), where it is returned at random times to its initial state. We investigate how such QR of the environmental spin chain modifies the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord between the qubits. Our results show that in the strong-coupling regime, entanglement and discord exhibit pronounced revivals within the interval bounded by the Ising QCPs, but these revivals diminish as the QR rate increases. In contrast, weak coupling leads to a monotonic reduction of quantum correlations. Numerically, we find that the revival peaks of concurrence decay and scale exponentially with the QR rate, while quantum discord shows no clear scaling behavior. In the weak-coupling regime without QR, the correlations decay monotonically as the driven field crosses the second QCP. When QR is applied, however, both entanglement and discord undergo oscillatory suppression, with the oscillation period increasing as either the QR rate or the ramp time scale is reduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While quantum algorithms for solving large scale systems of linear equations offer potential speedups, their application has largely been confined to sparse matrices. This work extends the scope of these algorithms to a broad class of structured dense matrices arise in potential theory, covariance modeling, and computational physics, namely, hierarchically block separable (HBS) matrices. We develop two distinct methods to make these systems amenable to quantum solvers. The first is a pre-processing approach that transforms the dense matrix into a larger but sparse format. The second is a direct block encoding scheme that recursively constructs the necessary oracles from the HBS structure. We provide a detailed complexity analysis and rigorous error bounds for both methods. Numerical experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of our approaches.</description>

      <title>Protection of quantum steering ellipsoids in non-Markovian environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum steering ellipsoid (QSE) provides a geometric representation, within the Bloch picture, of all possible states to which one qubit can be steered through measurements performed on another correlated qubit. However, in most realistic settings, quantum systems are inevitably coupled to their surrounding environment, resulting in decoherence and the consequent degradation of the QSE. Here, by investigating how local dissipative environments coupled separately to each qubit affect the steering properties geometrized by the QSE within an exact non-Markovian framework, we find that the geometry of each party's QSE is closely tied to whether a bound state forms in the energy spectrum of the total qubit-environment system. We systematically examine the characteristics of QSEs under three distinct scenarios: two-sided bound states, one-sided bound states, and no bound state, revealing a diverse range of steering types. Our work establishes quantum reservoir engineering as a tunable strategy for protecting and controlling quantum steering in open systems, offering a practical pathway toward robust steering-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Low-Power Evanescent-Field Atom Guides on Optical Nanofiber Testbeds for Benchmarking Membrane-Waveguide Photonic Integrated Circuit Platforms Toward On-Chip Quantum Inertial Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in cold atom interferometry with atom guides have set the stage for miniaturized quantum inertial sensors capable of operating in dynamic environments. In this work, we combine three key innovations - evanescent-field (EF) atom guides, optical nanofiber (NF) testbeds, and membrane-waveguide photonic integrated circuit (PIC) platforms - to advance EF-guided atom interferometry. First, we demonstrate the feasibility of EF atom guides on optical NF testbeds, providing a mean to benchmark membrane-waveguide PIC platforms. Second, we achieve low-power (~5 mW) guiding of freely moving, laser-cooled 133Cs atoms in two-color, traveling-wave EF optical dipole traps at the magic wavelengths of 793 nm and 937 nm - referred to here as 793/937-nm EF atom guides - in contrast to conventional 685/937-nm standing-wave EF optical lattices. The 793/937-nm EF atom guides map directly onto the membrane-waveguide PIC platforms, which can safely handle up to 4-6x times the minimum trap power under vacuum and enable dense cold atom generation for efficient loading into the EF atom guides. Third, we verify preserved atomic coherence via microwave fields and EF-coupled Doppler-free Raman beams. To our knowledge, this is the first report of coherence fringes driven by co-propagating EF-coupled Raman beams with only 150 nW of total optical power. By forging a direct link between optical NF testbeds to membrane-waveguide PIC platforms, our results lay critical groundwork for the on-chip realization of EF-guided atom interferometry and for fully integrated, low-SWaP (size, weight, and power) quantum accelerometers and gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>Cryptographic Censorship</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate and take two large strides towards proving a quantum version of the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. We first prove "Cryptographic Censorship": a theorem showing that when the time evolution operator of a holographic CFT is approximately pseudorandom (or Haar random) on some code subspace, then there must be an event horizon in the corresponding bulk dual. This result provides a general condition that guarantees (in finite time) event horizon formation, with minimal assumptions about the global spacetime structure. Our theorem relies on an extension of a recent quantum learning no-go theorem and is proved using new techniques of pseudorandom measure concentration. To apply this result to cosmic censorship, we separate singularities into classical, semi-Planckian, and Planckian types. We illustrate that classical and semi-Planckian singularities are compatible with approximately pseudorandom CFT time evolution; thus, if such singularities are indeed approximately pseudorandom, by Cryptographic Censorship, they cannot exist in the absence of event horizons. This result provides a sufficient condition guaranteeing that seminal holographic results on quantum chaos and thermalization, whose general applicability relies on typicality of horizons, will not be invalidated by the formation of naked singularities in AdS/CFT.</description>

      <title>Observation of Braid-Protected Unpaired Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral degeneracies (dubbed nodal points in momentum space) play fundamental roles in understanding exotic properties of light and matter. In lattice systems, unpaired band-structure degeneracies are subject to well-established no-go (doubling) theorems that universally apply to both closed Hermitian systems and open non-Hermitian systems. However, the non-Abelian braid topology of non-Hermitian multi-band systems provides a loophole to these constraints. Here we successfully leverage this loophole in a non-Hermitian three-band system, implementing an unpaired third-order exceptional point (EP3), which manifests as a non-Abelian monopole. We explicitly demonstrate the intricate braiding topology and non-Abelian, path-dependent, fusion rules underlying the unpaired EP3. The experiment uses a new design of single-photon interferometry, enabling eigenstate and spectral resolutions for multi-band systems with widely tunable parameters. Thus, the union of state-of-the-art experiments, fundamental theory, and everyday concepts such as braids pave the way toward the highly exotic non-Abelian topology unique to non-Hermitian settings.</description>

      <title>The $S=\frac{1}{2}$ XY and XYZ models on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice do not possess nontrivial local conserved quantities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18504v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum spin system on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ with uniform nearest-neighbor interaction of the XY or XYZ type and arbitrary uniform magnetic field. By extending the method recently developed for quantum spin chains, we prove that the model possesses no local conserved quantities except for the trivial ones, such as the Hamiltonian. This result strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. We note that our result applies to the XX model without a magnetic field, which is one of the easiest solvable models in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Mechanism of Anyon Superconductivity Emerging from Fractional Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and superconductors typically require contrasting conditions, yet recent experiments have observed them in the same device. A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to superconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally charged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has mostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how anyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show that such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) at fillings $\nu = 2/(4p \mp 1)$ when they are driven toward a quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the transition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional charge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we analyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model. Tensor network simulations at $\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with increasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable semion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state competing with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this transition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our theory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons. Doping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and charge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central charge $c = \pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our framework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it with strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moir\'e materials such as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Glass in the Two-Dimensional Disordered Heisenberg Model via Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional frustrated quantum Heisenberg model with bond disorder on nearest-neighbor couplings using the recently introduced Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States framework, which enables accurate and efficient computation of disorder-averaged observables with a single variational optimization. Simulations on large lattices reveal an extended region of the phase diagram where long-range magnetic order vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, while the overlap order parameter, which characterizes quantum spin glass states, remains finite. These findings, supported by a semiclassical analysis based on a large-spin expansion, provide compelling evidence that the spin glass phase is stable against quantum fluctuations, unlike the classical case where it disappears at any finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Properties of Single Crystal Calcium Tungstate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This investigation employed microwave whispering gallery mode (WGM) analysis to characterize the dielectric properties of a cylindrical, single-crystal sample of calcium tungstate (CaWO$_4$). Through investigation of quasi-transverse\hyp{}magnetic and quasi-transverse\hyp{}electric mode families, we can assess loss mechanisms and relative permittivity from room temperature down to cryogenic conditions. We report the biaxial permittivity values of $\epsilon_{||} = 9.029 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.761 \pm 0.01$ at $295$ K, and $\epsilon_{||} = 8.794 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.440 \pm 0.01$ at $4$ K. Components are denoted with respect to the c\hyp{}axis of the crystal unit cell. The parallel component agrees well with the published literature at MHz frequencies; however, the perpendicular component is $4.8$\% lower. The WGM technique offers greater precision, with accuracy limited primarily by the uncertainty in the crystal's dimensions. WGMs also serve as sensitive probes of lattice dynamics, enabling monitoring of temperature-dependent loss mechanisms. At room temperature, the measured loss tangents were $\tan\delta_{||}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (4.1 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{-5}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (3.64 \pm 0.92) \times 10^{-5}$. Upon cooling to 4 K, the loss tangents improved by approximately two orders of magnitude, reaching $\tan\delta_{||}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (1.56 \pm 0.52) \times 10^{-7}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (2.05 \pm 0.79) \times 10^{-7}$. These cryogenic values are higher than those reported in prior studies, likely due to a magnetic loss channel associated with an unidentified paramagnetic spin ensemble. These findings have implications for the use of CaWO$_4$ in applications such as spin-based quantum systems and cryogenic bolometry, highlighting the potential of WGMs for novel sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum typicality approach to energy flow between two spin-chain domains at different temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a quantum typicality approach to examine systems composed of two subsystems at different temperatures. While dynamical quantum typicality is usually used to simulate high-temperature dynamics, we also investigate low-temperature dynamics using the method. To test our method, we investigate the energy current between subsystems at different temperatures in various paradigmatic spin-1/2 chains, specifically the XX chain, the critical transverse-field Ising chain, and the XXZ chain. We compare our numerics to existing analytical results and find a convincing agreement for the energy current in the steady state for all considered models and temperatures.</description>

      <title>SO(n) Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states as conformal boundary states of integrable SU(n) spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13114v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos Diagnostics for non-Hermitian Systems from Bi-Lanczos Krylov Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Hermitian systems, Krylov complexity has emerged as a powerful diagnostic of quantum dynamics, capable of distinguishing chaotic from integrable phases, in agreement with established probes such as spectral statistics and out-of-time-order correlators. By contrast, its role in non-Hermitian settings, relevant for modeling open quantum systems, remains less understood due to the challenges posed by complex eigenvalues and the limitations of standard approaches based on orthogonality, such as singular value decomposition. Here we demonstrate that Krylov complexity, computed via the bi-Lanczos algorithm, provides a reliable probe of quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, clearly discriminating chaotic and integrable regimes. Our results agree with complex spectral statistics and complex spacing ratios, underscoring the robustness of the method. Universality is supported by extensive tests in both the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and non-Hermitian random-matrix ensembles across multiple non-Hermitian symmetry classes.</description>

      <title>Clifford quantum cellular automata from topological quantum field theories and invertible subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for constructing quantum cellular automata (QCA) from topological quantum field theories (TQFT) and invertible subalgebras (ISA) using the cup-product formalism. This approach explicitly realizes all $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ Clifford QCAs (for prime $p$) in all admissible dimensions, in precise agreement with the classification predicted by algebraic $L$-theory. We determine the orders of these QCAs by explicitly showing that finite powers reduce to the identity up to finite-depth quantum circuits (FDQC) and lattice translations. In particular, we demonstrate that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Clifford QCAs in $(4l{+}1)$ spatial dimensions can be disentangled by non-Clifford FDQCs. Our construction applies beyond cubic lattices, allowing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs to be defined on arbitrary cellulations. Furthermore, we explicitly construct invertible subalgebras in higher dimensions, obtaining $\mathbb{Z}_2$ ISAs in $2l$ spatial dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ ISAs in $(4l{-}2)$ spatial dimensions. These ISAs give rise to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs in $(2l{+}1)$ dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ QCAs in $(4l{-}1)$ dimensions. We further prove that the QCAs in $3$ spatial dimensions constructed via TQFTs and ISAs are equivalent by identifying their boundary algebras, and show that this approach extends to higher dimensions. Together, these results establish a unified and dimension-periodic framework for Clifford QCAs, connecting their explicit lattice realizations to field theories.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature dopant-induced spin reorganization explored via tensor networks in the two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04756v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional $t$--$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit using purification represented by an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS). We reach temperatures down to $T/t=0.1$ and hole concentrations up to $1-n\simeq0.25$, and provide benchmark thermodynamic-limit results for the specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and charge compressibility. We identify a susceptibility maximum $T^\ast$ that tracks the buildup of short-range antiferromagnetism and a shallow compressibility enhancement upon cooling in the same doping window. To expose the underlying microscopic mechanism, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that quantify how holes reorganize nearby exchange: single holes weaken adjacent antiferromagnetic bonds, while nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the parallel plaquette edge. Over the same parameter window, $d$-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of finite-temperature spin-texture reorganization in doped Mott insulators.</description>

      <title>Beyond the non-Hermitian skin effect: scaling-controlled topology from Exceptional-Bound Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a novel mechanism for topological transitions in non-Hermitian systems that are controlled by the system size. Based on a new paradigm known as exceptional-bound (EB) band engineering, its mechanism hinges on the unique critical scaling behavior near an exceptional point, totally unrelated to the well-known non-Hermitian skin effect. Through a series of ansatz models, we analytically derive and numerically demonstrate how topological transitions depend on the system size with increasingly sophisticated topological phase boundaries. Our approach can be generically applied to design scaling-dependent bands in multi-dimensional lattices, gapped or gapless, challenging established critical and entanglement behavior. It can be experimentally demonstrated in any non-Hermitian platform with versatile couplings or multi-orbital unit cells, such as photonic crystals, as well as classical and quantum circuits. The identification of this new EB band mechanism provides new design principles for engineering band structures through scaling-dependent phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Strong-field Driven Sub-cycle Band Structure Modulation and Dephasing Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, ultrafast electron dynamics in the solid state have been extensively studied using various strong light-matter interaction techniques, such as high-harmonic generation. These studies lead to multiple interpretations of light-matter interaction in the strong-field regime, with exact mechanisms not yet fully understood. It is well known that strong-field interaction with a crystalline solid leads to significant modification of its band structure and, hence, its optical properties on ultrafast timescales. In this work, we present measurements of ultrafast electric-field observables in magnesium oxide using a non-resonant nonlinear optical interaction. Using field observables, we show that strong laser fields modulate the band structure on sub-cycle timescales, thereby altering the material's nonlinear optical response. We perform time-dependent perturbation theory calculations using a field-dependent dispersion relation and non-perturbative semiconductor Bloch equation calculations, both of which agree with experimental observations. Furthermore, we directly extract dephasing times from the real-time signal electric field envelope and show sub-cycle control of dephasing times. Our work offers a new perspective on strong-field-driven electron dynamics in solids through electric-field observables. The demonstrated attosecond modulation of the nonlinear response could have important implications for quantum light generation and quantum spectroscopy using nonlinear optical processes.</description>

      <title>Repulsively Bound Hadrons in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory is a paradigmatic model that exhibits gauge-field-mediated-confinement of pairs of particles into mesons, drawing connections to quantum chromodynamics. In the absence of any additional attractive interactions between particles, mesons are not known to bind in this model. Here, we show that resonant pair-production terms give rise to two separate mechanisms to form stable ``hadron'' bound states of two mesons: either induced by an effective attractive interaction, or a new dynamical binding mechanism induced by an effective repulsion. The repulsively bound hadron is a high-energy state stabilized by being energetically separated from the two-meson continuum through quantum fluctuations of the gauge fields. We study the dynamical formation of this bound state starting from local excitations. We use matrix product state techniques based on the time-evolving block decimation algorithm to perform our numerical simulations and analyze the effect of model parameters on hadron formation. Furthermore, we derive an effective model that explains its formation. Our findings are amenable to experimental observation on modern quantum hardware such as superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in C$^*$-algebras: tensor products of state spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Namioka-Phelps minimal and maximal tensor products of compact convex sets arising as state spaces of C$^*$-algebras, and, relatedly, study entanglement in (infinite dimensional) C$^*$-algebras. The minimal Namioka-Phelps tensor product of the state spaces of two C$^*$-algebras is shown to correspond to the set of separable (= un-entangled) states on the tensor product of the C$^*$-algebras. We show that these maximal and minimal tensor product of the state spaces agree precisely when one of the two C$^*$-algebras is commutative. This confirms an old conjecture by Barker in the case where the compact convex sets are state spaces of C$^*$-algebras.
  The Namioka-Phelps tensor product of the trace simplexes of two C$^*$-algebras is shown always to be the trace simplex of the tensor product of the C$^*$-algebras. This can be used, for example, to show that the trace simplex of (any) tensor product of C$^*$-algebras is the Poulsen simplex if and only if the trace simplex of each of the C$^*$-algebras is the Poulsen simplex or trivial (and not all trivial).</description>

      <title>Theory of Out-of-Time-Ordered Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an effective field theory (EFT) that captures the universal behavior of out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) at late times in generic quantum many-body systems with conservation laws. The EFT hinges on a generalization of the strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern adapted to out-of-time-order observables, and reduces to conventional fluctuating hydrodynamics when time-ordered observables are probed. We use the EFT to explain different power-law behavior observed in OTOCs at late times, and show that many OTOCs are entirely fixed by conventional transport data. Nevertheless, we show that a specific combination of OTOCs is sensitive to novel transport parameters, not visible in regular time-ordered correlators. We test our predictions in Hamiltonian and Floquet spin chains in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of Quantum-Induced Stochastic Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum-Induced Stochastic Dynamics arises from the coupling between a classical system and a quantum environment. Unlike standard thermal reservoirs, this environment acts as a dynamic bath, capable of simultaneously exchanging heat and performing work. We formulate a thermodynamic framework for this semi-classical regime, defining heat, work, and entropy production. We derive a modified Second Law that accounts for non-equilibrium quantum features, such as squeezing. The framework is exemplified by an optomechanical setup, where we characterize the thermodynamics of the non-stationary noise induced by the cavity field.</description>

      <title>Turning non-superconducting elements into superconductors by quantum confinement and proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elemental good metals, including noble metals (Cu, Ag, Au) and several $s$-block elements, do not exhibit superconductivity in bulk at ambient pressure, primarily due to weak electron--phonon coupling that fails to overcome Coulomb repulsion. In this perspective, we examine whether quantum confinement alone, or in combination with proximity effects, can induce an observable superconducting instability in metals that are non-superconducting in bulk form. We review recent theoretical progress and present a unified framework based on a confinement-generalized, isotropic one-band Eliashberg theory, in which the normal density of states becomes energy dependent and key material parameters ($E_F$, $\lambda$, and $\mu^{*}$) acquire an explicit thickness dependence. By numerically solving the resulting Eliashberg equations using ab-initio or experimentally determined electron--phonon spectral functions $\alpha^{2}F(\Omega)$ and Coulomb pseudopotentials $\mu^{*}$, and without introducing adjustable parameters, we compute the critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of film thickness for representative noble, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals. The theory predicts that superconductivity can emerge only in selected cases and within extremely narrow thickness windows, typically centered around sub-nanometer scales ($L \sim 0.4$--$0.6$ nm). We further discuss layered superconductor/normal-metal systems, where quantum confinement and proximity effects coexist. In these heterostructures, a substantial enhancement of the critical temperature is predicted, even when the constituent materials are non-superconducting or poor superconductors in bulk form.</description>

      <title>Coherence Protection for Mobile Spin Qubits in Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile spin qubit architectures promise flexible connectivity for efficient quantum error correction and relaxed device layout constraints, but their viability rests on preserving spin coherence during transport. While shuttling transforms spatial disorder into time-dependent noise, its net impact on spin coherence remains an open question. Here we demonstrate systematic noise mitigation during spin shuttling in a linear $^{28}$Si/SiGe quantum dot device. First, by passively reducing magnetic field gradients, we minimize charge-noise coupling to the spin and double the spatially averaged dephasing time $T_2^*(x_n)$ from $4.4$ to $8.5\,\mu\text{s}$. Next, we exploit motional narrowing by periodically shuttling the qubit, achieving a further enhancement in coherence time up to $T_{2}^{*,sh} = 11.5\,\mu\text{s}$. Finally, we incorporate dynamical decoupling techniques while periodically shuttling over distances exceeding $200\,\text{nm}$, reaching $T_\text{2}^{H,sh}= 32\,\mu\text{s}$. For the same setup, we demonstrate that dressed-state shuttling provides robust protection against low-frequency noise with a decay time $T_R^{\text{sh}} = 21\,\mu\text{s}$, without the overhead of pulsed control and allowing protection during one-way spin transport. By preserving coherence over timescales exceeding typical gate and readout operations, the demonstrated strategies establish mobile spin qubits as a viable solution for scalable silicon quantum processors.</description>
