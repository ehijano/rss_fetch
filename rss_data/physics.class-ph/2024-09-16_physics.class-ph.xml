      <title>The Law of Closest Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Law of Closest Approach which is derived from the properties of conic orbits and can be considered an addendum to the laws of Kepler. It states that on the closest approach, the distance between the objects is minimal and the velocity vector is perpendicular to the position vector with maximum speed. The ratio of twice the kinetic energy to the negative potential energy is equal to the eccentricity plus one. The advantage of this law is that both speed and position are at extremum making the calculation of the eccentricity more robust.</description>

      <title>Effective Youngs Modulus of Two-Phase Elastic Composites by Repeated Isostrain and Isostress Constructions and Arithmetic-Geometric Mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relationship is established between the effective Youngs modulus of a two-phase elastic composite and a known mathematical mean value. Specifically, the effective Youngs modulus of a composite obtained from repeated parallel and serial constructions is equal to the arithmetic-geometric mean of the Youngs moduli of the component materials. This result also applies to electric circuits with resistors in repeated parallel and serial connections.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Lattice Resonances and Generalised Rayleigh--Bloch Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrigue of waves on periodic lattices and gratings has resonated with physicists and mathematicians alike for decades. In-depth analysis has been devoted to the seemingly simplest array system: a one-dimensionally periodic lattice of two-dimensional scatterers embedded in a dispersionless medium governed by the Helmholtz equation. We investigate such a system and experimentally confirm the existence of a new class of generalised Rayleigh--Bloch waves that have been recently theorised to exist in classical wave regimes, without the need for resonant scatterers. Airborne acoustics serves as such a regime and here we experimentally observe the first generalised Rayleigh--Bloch waves above the first cut-off, i.e., in the radiative regime. We consider radiative acoustic lattice resonances along a diffraction grating and connect them to generalised Rayleigh--Bloch waves by considering both short and long arrays of non-resonant 2D cylindrical Neumann scatterers embedded in air. On short arrays, we observe finite lattice resonances under continuous wave excitation, and on long arrays, we observe propagating Rayleigh--Bloch waves under pulsed excitation. We interpret their existence by considering multiple wave scattering theory and, in doing so, unify differing nomenclatures used to describe waves on infinite periodic and finite arrays and the interpretation of their dispersive properties.</description>

      <title>31 Lectures on Geometric Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This textbook for learning geometric mechanics is written in the format of lecture notes. These lecture notes in geometric mechanics are meant to convey insight through clear definitions and workable examples. The lecture format adopted here is intended to convey the immediacy of the taught course and to be useful as a basis for other courses. The lecture notes comprise:
  AP = Applications of Pure maths, e.g., Noether's theorem: Lie group symmetry of Hamilton's variational principle implies conservation laws for its equations of motion.\smallskip
  PA = Purifications of Applied maths, e.g., Euler fluid dynamics describes geodesic flow on the manifold of smooth invertible maps acting on the domain of flow. \smallskip
  Both AP and PA appear here, though the difference is not mentioned. It is left to the reader to decide whether it was AP or PA in each of the lectures containing well over sixty solved exercises.
  An aspect of modern applications emphasised here is the use of the composition of evolutionary maps for multi-physics, multi-timescale interactions including waves interacting with flows in the Euler--Poincar\'e framework in geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) for ocean and atmosphere dynamics, and in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for applications in plasma physics such as magnetic confinement fusion (MFC) and astrophysical processes such as Alfv\'en waves and gravity waves propagating on the Solar tachocline. The topics covered in each lecture can also be gleaned from its table of contents listed at the onset of each lecture.</description>

      <title>Calculus and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is an introduction to calculus, and its applications to basic questions from physics. We first discuss the theory of functions $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$, with the notion of continuity, and the construction of the derivative $f'(x)$ and of the integral $\int_a^bf(x)dx$. Then we investigate the case of the complex functions $f:\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$, and notably the holomorphic functions, and harmonic functions. Then, we discuss the multivariable functions, $f:\mathbb R^N\to\mathbb R^M$ or $f:\mathbb R^N\to\mathbb C^M$ or $f:\mathbb C^N\to\mathbb C^M$, with general theory, integration results, maximization questions, and basic applications to physics.</description>
