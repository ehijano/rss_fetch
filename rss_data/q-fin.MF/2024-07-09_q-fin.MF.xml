      <title>Kullback-Leibler Barycentre of Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem where an agent aims to combine the views and insights of different experts' models. Specifically, each expert proposes a diffusion process over a finite time horizon. The agent then combines the experts' models by minimising the weighted Kullback-Leibler divergence to each of the experts' models. We show existence and uniqueness of the barycentre model and proof an explicit representation of the Radon-Nikodym derivative relative to the average drift model. We further allow the agent to include their own constraints, which results in an optimal model that can be seen as a distortion of the experts' barycentre model to incorporate the agent's constraints.
  Two deep learning algorithms are proposed to find the optimal drift of the combined model, allowing for efficient simulations. The first algorithm aims at learning the optimal drift by matching the change of measure, whereas the second algorithm leverages the notion of elicitability to directly estimate the value function. The paper concludes with a extended application to combine implied volatility smiles models that were estimated on different datasets.</description>

      <title>Subleading correction to the Asian options volatility in the Black-Scholes model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The short maturity limit $T\to 0$ for the implied volatility of an Asian option in the Black-Scholes model is determined by the large deviations property for the time-average of the geometric Brownian motion. In this note we derive the subleading $O(T)$ correction to this implied volatility, using an asymptotic expansion for the Hartman-Watson distribution. The result is used to compute subleading corrections to Asian options prices in a small maturity expansion, sharpening the leading order result obtained using large deviations theory. We demonstrate good numerical agreement with precise benchmarks for Asian options pricing in the Black-Scholes model.</description>

      <title>Unified Approach for Hedging Impermanent Loss of Liquidity Provision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop static and dynamic approaches for hedging of the impermanent loss (IL) of liquidity provision (LP) staked at Decentralised Exchanges (DEXes) which employ Uniswap V2 and V3 protocols. We provide detailed definitions and formulas for computing the IL to unify different definitions occurring in the existing literature. We show that the IL can be seen a contingent claim with a non-linear payoff for a fixed maturity date. Thus, we introduce the contingent claim termed as IL protection claim which delivers the negative of IL payoff at the maturity date. We apply arbitrage-based methods for valuation and risk management of this claim. First, we develop the static model-independent replication method for the valuation of IL protection claim using traded European vanilla call and put options. We extend and generalize an existing method to show that the IL protection claim can be hedged perfectly with options if there is a liquid options market. Second, we develop the dynamic model-based approach for the valuation and hedging of IL protection claims under a risk-neutral measure. We derive analytic valuation formulas using a wide class of price dynamics for which the characteristic function is available under the risk-neutral measure. As base cases, we derive analytic valuation formulas for IL protection claim under the Black-Scholes-Merton model and the log-normal stochastic volatility model. We finally discuss estimation of risk-reward of LP staking using our results.</description>

      <title>Risk Budgeting Allocation for Dynamic Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and develop an approach for risk budgeting allocation - a risk diversification portfolio strategy - where risk is measured using a dynamic time-consistent risk measure. For this, we introduce a notion of dynamic risk contributions that generalise the classical Euler contributions and which allow us to obtain dynamic risk contributions in a recursive manner. We prove that, for the class of coherent dynamic distortion risk measures, the risk allocation problem may be recast as a sequence of strictly convex optimisation problems. Moreover, we show that self-financing dynamic risk budgeting strategies with initial wealth of 1 are scaled versions of the solution of the sequence of convex optimisation problems. Furthermore, we develop an actor-critic approach, leveraging the elicitability of dynamic risk measures, to solve for risk budgeting strategies using deep learning.</description>

      <title>Decentralised Finance and Automated Market Making: Execution and Speculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated market makers (AMMs) are a new prototype of decentralised exchanges which are revolutionising market interactions. The majority of AMMs are constant product markets (CPMs) where exchange rates are set by a trading function. This work studies optimal trading and statistical arbitrage in CPMs where balancing exchange rate risk and execution costs is key. Empirical evidence shows that execution costs are accurately estimated by the convexity of the trading function. These convexity costs are linear in the trade size and are nonlinear in the depth of liquidity and in the exchange rate. We develop models for when exchange rates form in a competing centralised exchange, in a CPM, or in both venues. Finally, we derive computationally efficient strategies that account for stochastic convexity costs and we showcase their out-of-sample performance.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space-Valued LQ Mean Field Games: An Infinite-Dimensional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games (MFGs) in Hilbert spaces, generalizing the classic LQ MFG theory to scenarios involving $N$ agents with dynamics governed by infinite-dimensional stochastic equations. In this framework, both state and control processes of each agent take values in separable Hilbert spaces. All agents are coupled through the average state of the population which appears in their linear dynamics and quadratic cost functional. Specifically, the dynamics of each agent incorporates an infinite-dimensional noise, namely a $Q$-Wiener process, and an unbounded operator. The diffusion coefficient of each agent is stochastic involving the state, control, and average state processes. We first study the well-posedness of a system of $N$ coupled semilinear infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations establishing the foundation of MFGs in Hilbert spaces. We then specialize to $N$-player LQ games described above and study the asymptotic behaviour as the number of agents, $N$, approaches infinity. We develop an infinite-dimensional variant of the Nash Certainty Equivalence principle and characterize a unique Nash equilibrium for the limiting MFG. Finally, we study the connections between the $N$-player game and the limiting MFG, demonstrating that the empirical average state converges to the mean field and that the resulting limiting best-response strategies form an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium for the $N$-player game in Hilbert spaces.</description>
