      <title>Stable beam operation of approximately 1 mA beam under highly efficient energy recovery conditions at compact energy-recovery linac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A compact energy-recovery linac (cERL) has been un-der construction at KEK since 2009 to develop key technologies for the energy-recovery linac. The cERL began operating in 2013 to create a high-current beam with a low-emittance beam with stable continuous wave (CW) superconducting cavities. Owing to the development of critical components, such as the DC gun, superconducting cavities, and the design of ideal beam transport optics, we have successfully established approximately 1 mA stable CW operation with a small beam emittance and extremely small beam loss. This study presents the details of our key technologies and experimental results for achieving 100% energy recovery operation with extremely small beam loss during a stable, approximately 1 mA CW beam operation.</description>

      <title>Beamline Steering Using Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam steering involves the calibration of the angle and position at which a particle accelerator's electron beam is incident upon the x-ray target with respect to the rotation axis of the collimator. Beam Steering is an essential task for light sources. The Linac To Undulator is very difficult to steer and aim due to the changes of each use of the accelerator there must be re-calibration of magnets. However with each use of the Beamline its current method of steering runs into issues when faced with calibrating angles and positions. Human operators spend a substantial amount of time and resources on the task. We developed multiple different feed-forward-neural networks with varying hyper-parameters, inputs, and outputs, seeking to compare their performance. Specifically, our smaller models with 33 inputs and 13 outputs outperformed the larger models with 73 inputs and 50 outputs. We propose the following explanations for this lack of performance in larger models. First, a lack of training time and computational power limited the ability of our models to mature. Given more time, our models would outperform SVD. Second, when the input size of the model increases the noise increases as well. In this case more inputs corresponded to a greater length upon the LINAC accelerator. Less specific and larger models that seek to make more predictions will inherently perform worse than SVD.</description>

      <title>Online regularization of Poincar\'e map of storage rings with Shannon entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shannon Entropy is adopted to quantify the chaos of measured Poincar\'e maps in the National Synchrotron Light Source-II (NSLS-II) storage ring. The recurrent Poincar\'e maps, constructed from beam position monitor's turn-by-turn readings, are commonly used to observe the nonlinearity in ring-based accelerators. However, these observations typically only provide a qualitative observation. With some canonical transformations on Poincar\'e maps, not only can the commonly used nonlinear characterizations be extracted, but more importantly, the chaos can be quantitatively measured with entropy. Entropy, therefore as a chaos indicator, is used for online Poincar\'e map regularization and dynamic aperture optimization in the NSLS-II ring.</description>

      <title>Quantum free-electron laser oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If the quantum mechanical recoil of the electron due to its scattering from the undulator and laser fields dominates the dynamics, a regime of the free-electron laser emerges where quantum effects lead to a drastic change in the radiation properties. However, the large interaction length required for a single-pass quantum free-electron laser impedes the experimental realization. The quantum free-electron laser oscillator, proposed in the present article, is a possible scheme to resolve this issue. Here we show that this device features a photon statistics that is closer to a coherent state in comparison to existing classical free-electron lasers. The device can be even operated in such a way that a sub-Poissonian statistics is obtained. Beside the benefit of demonstrating this pure quantum effect, the narrowing of the photon distribution implies reduced intensity fluctuations of the emitted radiation, which in turn lead to decreased noise in imaging experiments or to an enhanced sensitivity in interferometric applications.</description>

      <title>Experiment Research on Feasibility of In-Situ Plasma Cleaning in Normal-conducting Copper Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To assess the feasibility of in-situ plasma cleaning for copper cavities, a 13.56 MHz inductively coupled plasma platform with a built-in coil was developed at Tsinghua University. Experiments were conducted using this platform to optimize plasma discharge parameters and procedures specific to copper cavities. The results indicate that the "Ar/O + Ar/H method" significantly enhances the work function of the copper surface while reducing field enhancement effects induced by surface burrs. Consequently, this study confirms that in-situ plasma cleaning effectively mitigates field emission within copper cavities, thereby enhancing the stability and acceleration gradient of the accelerator system.</description>

      <title>Simulation studies on compensation for space-charge-induced half-integer and 3rd-order resonance crossing in HIAF-BRing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space-charge-induced resonance crossing is one notable limitation of beam intensity in high-intensity synchrotrons. This paper proposes a modification to the Resonance Driving Terms (RDTs) to compensate for the combined effects of space charge and magnetic field imperfections under resonance crossing. The new RDTs are named modified RDTs. The effectiveness of the modified RDTs is demonstrated through simulations of half-integer and 3rd-order resonance crossings using the lattice of the High Intensity Heavy-Ion Accelerator Facility Booster Ring (HIAF-BRing). The simulations illustrate that the compensation provided by the modified RDTs significantly suppresses emittance growth and reduces distortion in the phase space.</description>

      <title>Response of negative ion beamlet to RF field in beam extraction region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beam-focusing characteristics of negative ion beams have been experimentally investigated with a superimposition of a controlled perturbation of RF field in a filament-arc discharge negative ion source. Oscillations of a negative-ion beamlet width and axis responding to the RF perturbation were observed, which may be a cause of the larger beam divergence angle of the RF negative ion source for ITER. It is pointed out that the oscillation of the beamlet width depends on the perveance and on the RF frequency such that the oscillation is suppressed at perveance-matched conditions and at low RF frequency.</description>
