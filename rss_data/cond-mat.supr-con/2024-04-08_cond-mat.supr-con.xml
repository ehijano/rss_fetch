      <title>Optical absorption signatures of superconductors driven by Van Hove singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the diverging density of states (DOS), Van Hove singularities (VHS) near the Fermi level are known to boost the susceptibility to a wide variety of electronic instabilities, including superconductivity. We theoretically show that the number of VHS in the normal state can be qualitatively inferred from the optical absorption spectra Re $\sigma_{ii}(\omega)$ in the superconducting state. The key feature is the absorption peak at frequency $\omega=2\Delta$ from the optical transition across the superconducting gap $\Delta$, which is forbidden in a single-band clean superconductor when the inversion symmetry is preserved and the band is quadratic. Although VHS dispersions are mostly quadratic, we find that a divergent peak occurs when there are multiple VHS on the Fermi surface under an applied current. In contrast, we find non-diverging weak peaks when there is only a single VHS. Depending on whether this single VHS has logarithmically or power-law divergent DOS, the peaks in Re $\sigma_{xx}(\omega)$ and Re $\sigma_{yy}(\omega)$ are nearly isotropic and anisotropic, respectively. Therefore, we propose that experimentally measured peak magnitude and anisotropy in the optical absorption spectra of VH-driven superconductors can be used to determine the number and type of VHS on the Fermi surface. Disorders could even facilitate in distinguishing the multiple and single VHS scenarios since only the diverging peak in the latter case is expected to survive.</description>

      <title>Flat-Band Enhanced Antiferromagnetic Fluctuations and Unconventional Superconductivity in Pressurized CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interrelationship between flat bands and correlated phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity stands as an intriguing subject in condensed matter physics. Here, by first-principles calculations and random phase approximation analyses, we investigate the electronic structure, superconducting instability, as well as roles of the incipient flat bands in kagome superconductor CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$. Our calculations reveal strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$, which mediates two sets of spin-singlet superconducting orders with $s_{\pm}$- and ($d_{xy}$, $d_{x^2-y^2}$)-wave symmetries. Under the dominance of local Coulomb interactions, the unoccupied incipient flat bands are shown to be crucial for the momentum dependence of spin fluctuations and thus the superconductivity. Our further analyses unveil a sublattice-momentum-coupling-driven mechanism for this momentum-dependent enhancement of the fluctuations, which provides us a new perspective for future studies of geometrically frustrated systems.</description>

      <title>Vortex matching at 6 T in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films by imprinting a 20 nm-periodic pinning array with a focused helium ion beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlled engineering of vortex pinning sites in copper-oxide superconductors is a critical issue in manufacturing devices based on magnetic flux quanta. To address this, we employed a focused He-ion beam (He-FIB) to irradiate thin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films and create ultradense hexagonal arrays of defects with lattice spacings as small as 20 nm. Critical current and magnetoresistance measurements demonstrate efficient pinning by an unprecedentedly high matching field of 6 T visible in a huge temperature range from the critical temperature $T_c$ down to 2 K. These results show that He-FIB irradiation provides excellent opportunities for the development and application of superconducting fluxonic devices based on Abrikosov vortices. In particular, our findings suggest that such devices can operate at temperatures far below $T_c$, where superconductivity is robust.</description>

      <title>Double loop dc-SQUID as a tunable Josephson diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of superconducting electronics requires careful characterization of the components that make up electronic circuits. Superconducting weak links are the building blocks of most superconducting electronics components and are characterized by highly nonlinear current-to-phase relations (CPR), which are often not perfectly known. Recent research has found that the Josephson diode effect (JDE) can be related to the high harmonic content of the current-to-phase relation of the weak links embedded in superconducting interferometers. This makes the JDE a natural tool for exploring the harmonic content of weak links beyond single-harmonic CPR. In this study, we present the theoretical model and experimental characterization of a double-loop superconducting quantum interference device (DL-SQUID) that embeds all-metallic superconductor-normal metal-superconductor junctions. The proposed device exhibits the JDE due to the interference of the supercurrents of three weak links in parallel, and this feature can be adjusted through two magnetic fluxes, which act as experimental knobs. We carry out a theoretical study of the device in terms of the relative weight of the interferometer arms and the experimental characterization concerning flux tunability and temperature.</description>

      <title>Formation and Microwave Losses of Hydrides in Superconducting Niobium Thin Films Resulting from Fluoride Chemical Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting Nb thin films have recently attracted significant attention due to their utility for quantum information technologies. In the processing of Nb thin films, fluoride-based chemical etchants are commonly used to remove surface oxides that are known to affect superconducting quantum devices adversely. However, these same etchants can also introduce hydrogen to form Nb hydrides, potentially negatively impacting microwave loss performance. Here, we present comprehensive materials characterization of Nb hydrides formed in Nb thin films as a function of fluoride chemical treatments. In particular, secondary-ion mass spectrometry, X-ray scattering, and transmission electron microscopy reveal the spatial distribution and phase transformation of Nb hydrides. The rate of hydride formation is determined by the fluoride solution acidity and the etch rate of Nb2O5, which acts as a diffusion barrier for hydrogen into Nb. The resulting Nb hydrides are detrimental to Nb superconducting properties and lead to increased power-independent microwave loss in coplanar waveguide resonators. However, Nb hydrides do not correlate with two-level system loss or device aging mechanisms. Overall, this work provides insight into the formation of Nb hydrides and their role in microwave loss, thus guiding ongoing efforts to maximize coherence time in superconducting quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Site-selective insulating phase in twisted bilayer Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paramagnetic phase diagrams of the half-filled Hubbard model on a twisted bilayer square lattice are investigated using coherent potential approximation. Besides the conventional metallic, band insulating, and Mott insulating phases, we find two site-selective insulating phases where certain sites exhibit band insulating behaviors while the others display Mott insulating behaviors. These phases are identified by the band gap, the double occupancy, the density of states, as well as the imaginary part of self-energy. Furthermore, we examine the effect of on-site potential on the stability of the site-selective insulating phases. Our results indicate that fruitful site-selective phases can be engineered by twisting.</description>

      <title>Many-body quantum dynamics of spin-orbit coupled Andreev states in a Zeeman field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical framework to describe the quantum many-body dynamics of Andreev states in Josephson junctions with spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic Zeeman field. In such cases, employing a doubled Nambu spinor description is technically advantageous but one then has to be careful to avoid double-counting problems. By deriving the Lindblad master equation in the socalled excitation picture, we show that a physically consistent many-body theory free from doublecounting problems follows. We apply our formalism to a study of dynamical parity stabilization of the Andreev sector at intermediate times after an initial microwave pulse, in particular addressing the combined effects of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen crystals reduce dissipation in superconducting resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the internal quality factors of high impedance superconducting resonators made of granular aluminum can be improved by coating them with micrometric films of solid para-hydrogen molecular crystals. We attribute the average measured $\approx 8\%$ reduction in dissipation to absorption of stray terahertz radiation at the crystal-resonator interface and the subsequent dissipation of its energy in the form of phonons below the pair-breaking gap. Our results prove that, contrary to expectations, replacing the vacuum dielectric atop a superconducting resonator can be beneficial, thanks to the added protection against Cooper pair-braking terahertz radiation. Moreover, at the level of internal quality factors in the $10^5$ range, the hydrogen crystal does not introduce additional losses, which is promising for embedding impurities to couple to superconducting thin-film devices in hybrid quantum architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the direct observation of superconductivity in nitridized-aluminum thin films. The films are produced by sputtering deposition of aluminum in a controlled mixture of nitrogen diluted in argon. The concentration of applied nitrogen directly determines the properties of the superconducting thin films. We observe samples displaying critical temperatures up to 3.38$\pm$0.01K and resilience to in-plane magnetic fields well above 1T, with good reproducibility of the results. This work represents an unambiguous demonstration of tunable superconductivity in aluminum-based nitridized thin films. Our results put forward nitridized aluminum as a promising material to be employed in superconducting quantum circuits for quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>Discovery of smectic charge and pair-density-wave orders in topological monolayer 1T$^\prime$-MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic liquid-crystal phases are observed in numerous strongly-correlated systems including high-temperature superconductors. However, identifying these exotic phases and understanding their interplay with superconductivity in topological materials remain challenging. Here we employ a cryogenic scanning tunneling microscopy to discover a smectic (stripe) charge order (CO) and a primary pair-density-wave (PDW) in topological monolayer 1T$^\prime$-MoTe$_2$. The two orders are spatially modulated unidirectionally at the same wavevector, but have a marked spatial phase difference of about 2$\pi$/5. Importantly, the primary PDW state features a two-gap superconductivity below the transition temperature of 6.0 K and induces another unique particle-hole-symmetric CO at twice the PDW wavevector. Combining these results and our density functional calculations, we reveal that the two smectic orders are primarily driven by nesting behaviors between electron and hole pockets. Our findings establish monolayer 1T$^\prime$-MoTe$_2$ as a topological paradigm for exploring electronic smecticity, which intertwines with multiple preexisting symmetry-breaking states.</description>

      <title>Vortex formation and exotic superconducting states in field-cooled Sn-Pb solders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formation of vortices is a typical phenomenon of type-II superconductors under magnetic fields (H). In contrast, type-I superconductors do not host vortices because of their Meissner state. As rare cases, vortices have been observed in intermediate states of type-I superconductors; in addition, the recent observation of type-II superconductivity with vortices in a (originally type-I) Pb crystal film at extremely low temperature (T) under H has opened new pathway to study vortex physics. However, thermodynamic characteristics of such type-II-like superconducting states with vortices in originally type-I element superconductors have not been detected because of the lack of bulk example. In this study, we investigated superconducting states of phase-separated Sn-Pb solders using specific heat and magnetization to reveal magnetic-flux-trapping mechanisms. Here, we show that Sn islands in the Sn-Pb solders exhibit type-II-like superconducting states with vortices when the solders host extremely high magnetic fluxes after field cooling. Furthermore, with increasing T, the amount of trapped flux decreases, and the driving force of the magnetic flux changes from type-II superconducting states of Sn to supercurrent of Pb regions surrounding the Sn islands. The field-cooled Sn-Pb solders are rich in physics of bulk vortex formation and anomalously enhanced supercurrent in element (originally type-I) superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Diode Effect Sign Change in Epitaxial Al-InAs Josepshon Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has recently been a surge of interest in studying the superconducting diode effect (SDE) partly due to the possibility of uncovering the intrinsic properties of a material system. A change of sign of the SDE at finite magnetic field has previously been attributed to different mechanisms. Here, we observe the SDE in epitaxial Al-InAs Josephson junctions with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We show that this effect strongly depends on the orientation of the in-plane magnetic field. In the presence of a strong magnetic field, we observe a change of sign in the SDE. Simulation and measurement of supercurrent suggest that depending on the superconducting widths, $W_\text{S}$, this sign change may not necessarily be related to 0--$\pi$ or topological transitions. We find that the strongest sign change in junctions with narrow $W_\text{S}$ is consistent with SOC-induced asymmetry of the critical current under magnetic-field inversion, while in wider $W_\text{S}$, the sign reversal could be related to 0--$\pi$ transitions and topological superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fu and Kane have taught us that a Majorana zero-mode appears on the quantum spin Hall edge at the interface with a superconductor. If a magnetic scatterer is placed on the edge, the zero-point energy of massless edge excitations exerts a force on the scatterer. This is the fermionic analogue of the electromagnetic Casimir effect. We show that the Majorana zero-mode produces a repulsive Casimir force, pushing the scatterer away from the superconductor. Unlike some other signatures of Majorana zero-modes, the repulsive Casimir force is directly tied to the topological invariant of the system (the sign of the determinant of the reflection matrix from the superconductor).</description>

      <title>Retaining Landau quasiparticles in the presence of realistic charge fluctuations in cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge excitation spectra are getting clear in cuprate superconductors in momentum-energy space especially around a small momentum region, where plasmon excitations become dominant. Here, we study whether Landau quasiparticles survive in the presence of charge fluctuations observed in experiments. We employ the layered t-J model with the long-range Coulomb interaction, which can reproduce the realistic charge fluctuations. We find that Landau quasiparticles are retained in a realistic temperature and doping region, although the quasiparticle spectral weight is strongly reduced to 0.08-0.24. Counterintuitively, the presence of this small quasiparticle weight does not work favorably to generate a pseudogap.</description>
