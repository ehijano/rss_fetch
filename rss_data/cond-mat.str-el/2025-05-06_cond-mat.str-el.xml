      <title>Symmetry constrained field theories for chiral spin liquid to spin crystal transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the spin rotationally invariant Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid (CSL) in systems with broken time-reversal symmetry and explore symmetry constraints on possible conventional spin crystal states accessible via a direct transition. These constraints provide a framework to identify topological invariants of the magnetically ordered state. We show that the existence of a direct transition from a CSL requires a precise compatibility condition between the topological invariants of the ordered state and the anomaly of the CSL. The lattice symmetries also constrain the functional form of the low-energy theory to describe these transitions. This allows us to construct explicit Chern-Simons-matter field theories for the transition into a class of noncoplanar orders identified as candidates directly accessible from the CSL, including the octahedral spin crystal on the kagom\'e lattice, and the tetrahedral order on the triangular and honeycomb lattice. These transitions can either be described using coupled fractionalized $ \mathbb{CP}^1 $ theories or fractionalized matrix principal chiral models. We also discuss extensions to more general magnetic ordering transitions out of the CSL.</description>

      <title>Fractionalized fermionic multicriticality in anisotropic Kitaev spin-orbital liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the low-temperature phase diagram of quantum Kitaev-Heisenberg spin-orbital models with XXZ anisotropy on the honeycomb lattice. Within a parton mean-field theory, we identify three different quantum phases, distinguished by their symmetries. Besides a disordered spin-orbital liquid with unbroken U(1) x Z2 spin rotational symmetry, there are two orbital liquid phases characterized by spin long-range order. In these phases, the spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken down to residual U(1) and Z2 symmetries, respectively. The symmetric spin-orbital liquid features three flavors of linearly dispersing gapless Majorana fermions. In the symmetry-broken phases, one of the three Majorana excitations remains gapless, while the other two acquire a band gap. The transitions from the symmetric to the symmetry-broken phases are continuous and fall into the fractionalized Gross-Neveu-Z2* and Gross-Neveu-SO(2)* universality classes, respectively. The transition between the ordered phases is discontinuous. Using a renormalization group analysis based on the epsilon expansion, we demonstrate that the triple point in the phase diagram features fractionalized fermionic multicriticality with emergent SO(3) symmetry.</description>

      <title>Observing two-electron interactions with correlation-ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying and studying the underlying two-electron interactions that give rise to emergent phenomena is a key step in developing a holistic understanding of quantum materials. This step is hindered by the lack of an experiment that can directly interrogate the interactions and the specific quasiparticles involved in the interaction simultaneously. We introduce correlation-ARPES (C-ARPES) as a new experimental method that overcomes this difficulty and directly measures the interactions between specific, chosen quasiparticles by measuring the correlations between two electrons photoemitted from the same pulse (but not the same photon). We illustrate how this technique can extract the underlying interactions, and demonstrate this with an example of phonon-mediated electron-electron interactions, such as those that give rise to charge density waves through the Kohn anomaly mechanism.</description>

      <title>Driven Non-Unitary Dynamics of Quantum Critical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between unitary and non-unitary driven many-body dynamics in (1+1)-dimensional quantum critical systems described by conformal field theory (CFT). By formulating a coherent state approach, we demonstrate that the growth of entanglement entropy and energy can be found analytically for a class of non-unitary driven CFTs, where the evolution alternates between real and imaginary time evolution, the latter corresponding to postselected weak measurements. We find that non-unitary evolution leads to the emergence of steady states at infinite times for the cases of periodic, quasiperiodic, and random drives. In a special class of drives, for mixed initial states, we uncover purification phase transitions that arise as a result of the competition between unitary evolution and weak measurements. We compare the CFT evolution with the corresponding non-unitary dynamics of critical lattice models, finding remarkable agreement.</description>

      <title>Spin liquid phase in the Hubbard model: Luttinger-Ward analysis of the slave-rotor formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an approach for studying the spin liquid phase of the Hubbard model on the triangular lattice by combining the Baym--Kadanoff formalism with the slave rotor parton construction. This method enables the computation of a series of two-body Feynman diagrams for the Luttinger--Ward (LW) functional using a one-loop truncation. This approach enables us to study the U(1) quantum spin liquid phase characterized by a spinon Fermi surface and to derive the Green's functions for spinons, chargons, and electrons. Our findings extend beyond the standard mean-field approximation by accounting for the effects of gauge field fluctuations.The spatial components of the U(1) gauge field are equivalently represented by interactions that incorporate corrections from the spinon-chargon two-particle random phase approximation. This framework effectively captures the long-range correlations inherent to the U(1) quantum spin liquid and combines non-perturbative quantum field theory with the projective construction, providing new insights into the study of quantum spin liquids and other strongly correlated electron systems. We demonstrate that our approach correctly reprodues the anomalous low-temperature behavior of specific heat -- namely, the upturn in $C_V/T$ as a function of $T^2$-- in agreement with recent measurments on 1$T$ - TaS$_2$. Moreover, this approach reproduces the resonant peaks in the Mott gap, as observed in cobalt atoms on single-layer 1$T$-TaSe$_{2}$</description>

      <title>Trivalent network model for d3 transition metal dichalcogenides in the 1T structure: Distortions from an effective boundary theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimer models are well known as prototypes for locally constrained physics. They describe systems where every site on a lattice must be attached to one dimer. Loop models are an extension of this idea, with the constraint that two dimers must touch at each site. Here, we present a further generalization where every site must have three dimers attached -- a trivalent network model. As concrete physical realizations, we discuss d$^3$ transition metal dichalcogenides in the 1T structure -- materials with the structural formula MX$_2$ (M = Tc, Re) or AM$'$X$_2$ (A = Li or Na; M$'$ = Mo, W), where X is a chalcogen atom. These materials have a triangular layer of transition metal atoms, each with three valence electrons in $t_{2g}$ orbitals. Each atom forms valence bonds with three of its nearest neighbours. The geometry of the 1T structure imbues each bond with sharp orbital character. We argue that this enforces a `bending constraint' where two dimers attached to the same site cannot be parallel. This leads to a highly structured space of configurations, with alternating bonds along each line of the underlying triangular lattice. There is no dynamics, as constraints forbid local rearrangements of dimers. We construct a phase diagram, identifying configurations that minimize potential energy. We find a rhombus-stripe phase in a wide region of parameter space that explains a distortion pattern seen across several materials. Remarkably, this model can be recast as an effective boundary theory, in terms of three Ising chains that are coupled by mutual long-range interactions. As a testable prediction, we propose that a single impurity will generate long-ranged domain walls.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet/infrared mixing-driven suppression of Kondo screening in the antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a magnetic impurity immersed in the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal (AFQCM). Critical spin fluctuations represented by a bosonic field compete with itinerant electrons to couple with the impurity through the spin-spin interaction. At long distances, the antiferromagnetic electron-impurity (Kondo) coupling dominates over the boson-impurity coupling. However, the Kondo screening is weakened by the boson with an increasing severity as the hot spots connected by the magnetic ordering wave-vector are better nested. For $v_{0,i} \ll 1$, where $v_{0,i}$ is the bare nesting angle at the hot spots, the temperature $T_K^{\mathrm{AFQCM}}$ below which Kondo coupling becomes $O(1)$ is suppressed as $\frac{\log \Lambda/T_K^{\mathrm{AFQCM}}}{\log \Lambda/T_K^{\mathrm{FL}}} \sim \frac{g_{f,i}}{v_{0,i} \log 1/v_{0,i} }$, where $T_K^{\mathrm{FL}}$ is the Kondo temperature of the Fermi liquid with the same electronic density of states, and $g_{f,i}$ is the boson-impurity coupling defined at UV cutoff energy $\Lambda$. The remarkable efficiency of the single collective field in hampering the screening of the impurity spin by the Fermi surface originates from a ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing: bosons with momenta up to a UV cutoff actively suppress Kondo screening at low energies.</description>

      <title>Probing fractional quantum Hall effect by photoluminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states - fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states realized without an external magnetic field - in twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) bilayers represents a significant development in condensed matter physics. Notably, these states were first observed via photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Surprisingly, a general theoretical understanding of PL is not available even for the standard FQH states. For an ideal two-dimensional system, the energy of the emitted photon is predicted to be independent of the correlations, but we show that the PL intensity contains valuable information. Specifically, we predict that at finite temperatures, the PL intensity peaks at the Jain fillings \nu = n/(2n \pm 1), and away from these fillings, the binding energies of the composite-fermion excitons and trions can be deduced from the temperature dependence of the intensity. We discuss implications for PL experiments in semiconductor quantum wells and twisted TMD bilayers.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Driven Charge Frustration and Emergent Phases in the One-Dimensional Extended Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frustration is a key driver of exotic quantum phases, yet its role in charge dynamics remains largely unexplored. We show that charge frustration - induced by electronic polarization effects - stabilizes unconventional insulating states in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model. Using exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group, we uncover a charge-disordered phase that remains insulating despite lacking long-range order and possessing an effectively attractive on-site interaction - a behavior reminiscent of gapful spin liquids in frustrated spin systems. We also identify a fragile ferroelectric phase and a charge-density-wave state with emergent eight-site periodicity. These findings establish charge frustration, driven by charge-dipole interactions, as a robust mechanism for realizing exotic phases in low-dimensional correlated systems, with implications for organic conductors, transition-metal oxides, and ultracold polar molecules.</description>

      <title>Exact diagonalization study of triangular Heisenberg model with four-spin ring-exchange interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Lanczos exact diagonalization (ED), we study the spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model with the four-spin ring-exchange interaction $J_r$ on triangular lattice. We mainly use the level spectroscopic technique of two 36-site tori to investigate the ground-state phase diagram, and further characterize phases by spin, dimer and chiral correlation functions. The ground state has rich phases including several magnetic ordered phases like zigzag phase and tetrahedral phase, as well as several novel nonmagnetic phases, some of which exhibit valence bond solid behavior in their dimer correlation functions. However, we do not find direct evidence of a quantum spin liquid phase with spinon Fermi surface in this model. Our results can give a better understanding of the ground-state properties of the triangular Heisenberg model with ring-exchange interaction, and help to understand the relevant triangular materials.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dimerization and subdiffusive transport of strongly correlated neutral-ionic systems coupled to lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Monte Carlo dynamics of strongly correlated classical particles coupled to lattice degrees of freedom that exhibit the neutral-ionic transitions in one dimension, relevant to the organic compounds TTF-CA and TTF-BA. The particles carrying up and down spins suffer strong Coulomb interactions and undergo a neutral-to-ionic transition when the alternating site potentials become small, accompanying the charge transfer to the higher energy sites. The model is already shown to exhibit the enhancement of conductivity near the neutral-to-ionic crossover, which is carried by the neutral-ionic domain walls (NIDWs) that show diffusive character. Here, by incorporating local lattice dimerization effects, the motion of NIDWs becomes subdiffusive, and the conductivity is enhanced by one order of magnitude. When the ionic and dimerized states coexist, the strong fluctuation of dimer configuration supports the antiferromagnetic spin correlation, suppresses Pauli blocking, and subsequently enhances the motion of NIDWs. Our results highlight the crucial role of local and fluctuating dimerization in governing transport and ferroelectric properties near neutral-ionic transitions.</description>

Abstract: The magnetization process of the $S=3/2$ quantum spin chain with the $XXZ$ anisotropy and the single-ion anisotropy $D$ is investigated using the numerical diagonalization of finite-size clusters and the level spectroscopy analysis. We obtain the phase diagrams at 1/3 and 2/3 of the saturation magnetization to find that the translational-symmetry-broken magnetization plateau appears for the first time. The similarity and the difference between the phase diagrams of the present model and the related models are discussed by use of the discrete parameters of the models.

      <title>A Unified Theory of Unusual Anisotropic Magnetoresistance and Unidirectional Magnetoresistance in Nanoscale Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale bilayers containing at least one magnetic layer exhibit universal unusual anisotropic magnetoresistance (UAMR) and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR). They are currently understood through various mechanisms related to the interconversion of charge current and spin current, giant magnetoresistance, thermal magnonic effects, thermoelectric effects, and diverse spindependent scattering processes. This raises a fundamental question: do the universal behaviors observed in a wide range of systems stem from underlying general principles? We demonstrate here that both UAMR and UMR arise from electron transport influenced by the magnetization vector present in the magnetic material and the interfacial potential inherent in heterostructures. Specifically, UAMR represents current-independent resistance (resistivity) of bilayers. UMR is the resistance proportional to the current although electron transports of the bilayers are the linear response to high current densities and their induced thermal gradients. Our theory introduces a novel approach that considers the interplay between the magnetization vector, thermal gradients, and the effective internal electric field at the interface. This framework provides a unified explanation for both UMR and UAMR, effectively capturing key experimental features such as dependence on current direction, magnetization orientation, film thickness, and magnetic field strength. Furthermore, it offers a universal perspective that bridges UMR and UAMR effects, enhancing our understanding of spin-dependent transport phenomena in bilayers.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Driven Intervalley Coherence with Emergent Kekul\'e Orbitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $p$-orbital doublet in a honeycomb lattice is concretely studied with interacting spinless fermions at half filling. The Dirac fermions with linear dispersion at $\pm K$ valleys govern the non-interacting low-energy physics. In the weak-coupling regime, the Dirac fermions are gaped due to the spontaneous generation of mass terms through a uniform axial orbital ordering, rendering the system into the quantum anomalous Hall insulator phase with a nonzero Chern number. Surprisingly, the intermediate many-particle interaction produces the intervalley coherence between $\pm K$ valleys by developing complex polar orbital orderings in a tripled Wigner-Seitz cell. This phase is shown to have a deep connection with the low-energy physical behavior described by the orbital exchange model in the Mott insulating phase. The classical ground-state manifold in the Mott regime enjoys a continuous symmetry characterized by the intervalley coherent phase. Finally, the quantum fluctuation selects a unique ground state with emergent Kekul\'e orbitons through the order-by-disorder mechanism. Our findings provide insights for a direction of searching for Kekul\'e distortion in correlated multi-orbital systems.</description>

      <title>Hidden Quantum State and Signature of Mott Transition in Two-dimensional 1T-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report a comprehensive inelastic light scattering studies on 1T-TaS2 with different thickness. This compound is well known for its rich charge density wave phases. Along with that it has been one of the promising candidates for a quantum spin liquid state as the spins reside on a triangular lattice and it does not show any signature of magnetic ordering. We performed a thickness dependent Raman measurement in a regime of completely commensurate charge density wave (C-CDW) to a nearly commensurate charge density wave (NC-CDW) with varying temperature (4K-330K) and polarization direction of the incident light. We observed the signature of CDW transition and in addition to that we have also found the signature of a well sought hidden quantum CDW state at low temperature around TH ~ 80K. The emergence of CDW, both normal and hidden one, is marked by the emergence of new phonon modes and distinct renormalized phonon self-energy parameters for the most prominent modes. A transition from metallic to the Mott insulating state is gauged via the Raman response using low frequency slope , reflected in the renormalized slope below TCDW and TH.</description>

      <title>Giant Gate Response of the Charge in an Electron-Lattice Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient electrical capacitive control is important for the next generation of ultra-low-power and ultra-fast electronics and energy-storage devices. Correlated electronic phases offer a powerful route to enhancing field-effect control beyond the limits of conventional capacitive gating. In such systems, modest gate voltages can couple to an order parameter, producing responses far larger than expected from the electrostatics of non-interacting carriers. It was demonstrated that electron-electron interactions, in which the exchange and correlation energies among electrons lower the chemical potential of an electron system as the electron density increases, can significantly increase the effective capacitance over its geometric capacitance value. Here, we show that the electron-lattice or electron-phonon correlations in charge density wave (CDW) condensate can lead to a giant gate response with the corresponding capacitance enhancement. This unusual phenomenon is demonstrated in the quasi-one-dimensional CDW material, where the gate-induced change in CDW charge density exceeds predictions based on geometrical gate capacitance by one to two orders of magnitude. This "giant gating" effect arises from the coupling of the electric field to the CDW electron-lattice condensate, demonstrating a mechanism for massively amplifying gate response via collective electronic behavior. We quantify the effect by determining the quantum capacitance of the CDW charge and by constructing a band diagram for the gated CDW device. The obtained results can lead to an alternative strategy for continuing the downscaling of the transistor feature size in electronic technology.</description>

      <title>Partons from stabilizer codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gutzwiller projection of fermionic wave functions is a well-established method for generating variational wave functions describing exotic states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids. We investigate the conditions under which a projected wave function constructed from fermionic partons can be rigorously shown to possess topological order. We demonstrate that these conditions can be precisely determined in the case of projected Majorana stabilizer codes. We then use matrix product states to study states that interpolate between two distinct Majorana fermion codes, one yielding a $\mathbb Z_2$ spin liquid and the other a trivial polarized state upon projection. While the free-fermion states are adiabatically connected, we find that the projected states undergo a phase transition detected by the topological entanglement entropy. Our work underscores the profound impact of the Gutzwiller projection and cautions against inferring properties of quantum spin liquids solely from their unprojected counterparts.</description>

      <title>Van-Hove singularities and competing instabilities in an altermagnetic metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van-Hove (VH) singularities in the single-particle band spectrum are important for interaction-driven quantum phases. Whereas VH points are usually spin-degenerate, in newly proposed altermagnets VH singularities can become spin-dependent, due to momentum-dependent spin polarization of the Fermi surfaces arising from combined rotation and time-reversal symmetry. We consider two altermagnetic models ($d_{x^2-y^2}$- and $d_{xy}$-wave) on a square lattice with spin-polarized VH points, and study their stable fixed-point solutions indicating interaction-induced instabilities using parquet renormalization group. In particular, for the $d_{xy}$-wave model, we find new stable fixed-point solutions of the renormalization group equations which are not connected to the solution in the spin-degenerate limit. This implies that on the square lattice, the system with VH singularities is unstable with respect to altermagnetic perturbations. The leading instability for the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-model is real transverse spin density wave. For the $d_{xy}$-wave model, it is found to be real transverse spin density wave at large altermagnetic splitting. At small altermagnetic splitting both imaginary charge density wave and real longitudinal spin density waves are dominant.</description>

      <title>Emergent heavy-fermion physics in a new family of topological insulators RAsS (R = Y, La, and Sm)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing topological phases in strongly correlated materials has become a major impetus in condensed matter physics. Although many compounds are now classified as topological insulators, $f$-electron systems (with their strong electron correlations) provide an especially fertile platform for emergent heavy-fermion phenomena driven by the interplay of topology and many-body effects. In this study, we examine the crystalline topology of a new RAsS series (R = Y, La, Sm), revealing a structural variant from previous reports. We demonstrate that YAsS and SmAsS host hourglass fermions protected by glide symmetry. SmAsS notably exhibits a strong effective-mass enhancement, placing it alongside SmB${}_6$ and YbB${}_{12}$ as a material that couples topological surface states with emergent Kondo physics, yet distinguished by its crystalline symmetry constraints and $f$-$p$ orbital hybridization. To capture these features, we construct a minimal model incorporating $f$-electron degrees of freedom, which reproduces the observed topological properties and predicts that the surface states survive in the correlated regime, albeit shifted in energy. Our work thus introduces a new family of correlated topological materials and forecasts the robustness of their surface states under Kondo correlations.</description>

Abstract: Arrays of Rydberg atoms interacting via dipole-dipole interactions offer a powerful platform for probing quantum many-body physics. However, these intrinsic interactions also determine and constrain the models -- and parameter regimes thereof -- for quantum simulation. Here, we propose a systematic framework to engineer arbitrary desired long-range interactions in Rydberg-atom lattices, enabling the realization of fully tunable $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg models. Using site-resolved periodic modulation of Rydberg states, we develop an experimentally feasible protocol to precisely control the interaction ratios $J_2/J_1$ and $J_3/J_1$ in a kagome lattice. This control can increase the effective range of interactions and drive transitions between competing spin-ordered and spin liquid phases. To generalize this approach beyond the kagome lattice, we reformulate the design of modulation patterns through a graph-theoretic approach, demonstrating the universality of our method across all 11 planar Archimedean lattices. Our strategy overcomes the inherent constraints of power-law-decaying dipolar interactions, providing a versatile toolbox for exploring frustrated magnetism, emergent topological phases, and quantum correlations in systems with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Observation of Half-Quantum Vorticity in an Iron-based Superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Half-quantum vortices -- topological excitations carrying half the superconducting flux quantum -- are predicted to emerge in spin-triplet superconductors, where the spin component of order parameter enables fractional flux quantization. We present direct transport signatures of half-quantum vorticity in single-crystal Fe(Te,Se), an iron-based superconductor with helical Dirac surface states. Using mesoscopic superconducting ring devices, we observe half-integer quantum oscillations arising from the splitting of quantized fluxoid states, further supported by distinct signatures of trapped half-integer fluxoids. The quantum oscillations are modulated by a background symmetry, set by the relative orientation of the DC bias current and perpendicular magnetic field, consistent with strong spin-orbit coupling. These findings demonstrate the long-sought half-quantum vorticity in spin-polarized superconductors and open new directions toward non-Abelian excitations in quantum materials and scalable topological qubits.</description>

      <title>A Unified Simulation Framework for Correlated Driven-Dissipative Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy provides a unique and direct way to explore the real-time nonequilibrium dynamics of electrons and holes. The formal theory of the spectral function evolution requires inclusion of electronic correlations and dissipation, which are challenging due to the associated long simulation timescales which translate to a high computational cost. Recent methodological developments, namely the Real-Time Dyson Expansion, as well as theoretical developments of many-body perturbation theory for dissipative systems, have allowed for the study of driven-dissipative interacting quantum systems. In this work, we implement the hitherto unrealized study of driven-dissipative interacting quantum systems which includes driven dynamical correlations and utilizes these new methods and perturbative expansions. We illustrate the combined formalism on a prototypical two-band semiconductor model with long-range density-density Coulomb interactions. We show that the intraband thermalization of conduction band electrons induces nontrivial time-dependent changes in the system's bandstructure and a time-evolving band-gap renormalization (with a reduction by up to 10\%). We show that the qualitative features are preserved for a variety of parameters, discuss the corresponding spectral dynamics, and provide an outlook on the newly introduced simulation framework, which enables treating electron-electron scattering and dissipation effects on equal footing.</description>

      <title>Effect of interatomic repulsion on a Kitaev-transmon qubit based on double quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of interatomic Coulomb repulsion $V$ on the Kitaev-transmon system proposed by Pino \textit{et al.} \cite{pino} which consists of a Josephson junction between two double quantum dots (DQDs) modeled by the spinless Kitaev Hamiltonian. For an isolated DQD, we demonstrate that a "sweet spot" hosting "poor man's Majorana" states can still be achieved in the presence of $V$ by appropriately tuning the system parameters. This adjustment allows the extension of previous results to the case of finite Coulomb repulsion $V \neq 0$. However, we observe modifications in the microwave spectrum, due to the presence of previously overlooked states. Additionally, we find that at the sweet spot of both DQDs, all eigenstates of the transmon system exhibit exact double degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the interplay of magnetic order and electronic band structure on the evolution of anomalous Hall effect in MnPtGa single crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent studies on the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) have revealed an intrinsic relationship between the topological band structure and the experimentally observed transverse conductivity. Consequently, this has led to a heightened focus on examining the topological aspects of AHE. Here we have studied sign reversal of anomalous Hall conductivity with temperature in the single crystalline MnPtGa (space group: $P6_3/mmc$). From the interdependence of the linear resistance, we claim that the origin of such behavior is intrinsic. By systematically studying the electronic band structure and Berry curvature of MnPtGa using first principle calculations supported by magnetic susceptibility and isothermal magnetization measurements we demonstrate that the temperature dependent complex magnetic structure plays a significant role and leads to the sign reversal of anomalous Hall conductivity. We proposed a continuous evolution of the magnetic structure, supported by the ab initio calculations, which is consistent with the experimental data. Our studies have established that the critical temperature ($\approx$110 K), where the sign reversal appears is associated with the magnetic structure and the magnitude of Mn moments.</description>

Abstract: Autferroics, recently proposed as a sister branch of multiferroics, exhibit strong intrinsic magnetoelectricity, but ferroelectricity and magnetism are mutually exclusive rather than coexisting. Here, a general model is considered based on the Landau theory, to clarify the distinction between multi and autferroics by qualitative change-rotation in Landau free energy landscape and in particular phase mapping. The TiGeSe$_3$ exemplifies a factual material, whose first-principles computed Landau coefficients predict its autferroicity. Our investigations pave the way for an alternative avenue in the pursuit of intrinsically strong magnetoelectrics.</description>

      <title>R\'{e}nyi Markov length in one-dimensional non-trivial mixed state phases and mixed state phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering and classifying non-trivial mixed states and mixed state phase transitions are some of the most important current issues in condensed matter and quantum information. In this study, we investigate some non-trivial mixed states and phase transitions between them by using the second R\'{e}nyi conditional mutual information (CMI). The CMI can measure mixed state ``gap'', estimated by the exponential decay rate of the second R\'{e}nyi CMI under a tripartition of system, which provides the second R\'{e}nyi version of the Markov length. We introduce an efficient numerical scheme for the calculation of the second R\'{e}nyi CMI based on the doubled Hilbert space formalism, and study the classification of non-trivial mixed states and the emergence of mixed state phase transitions for (i) the cluster model under odd-site local $Z$ decoherence and (ii) transverse field Ising model under both $ZZ$ and $X$ decoherence. The second R\'{e}nyi CMI is a powerful measure to study non-trivial mixed ``gapped" quantum matters and mixed phase transitions. In addition to this, the present study shows that the second R\'{e}nyi CMI exhibits specific behavior for the transition to strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking mixed phase.</description>

      <title>Many-body critical phase in a quasiperiodic chain and dynamical Widom lines in Fock space properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a quasiperiodic model in one dimension, namely the extended Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (EAAH) chain, that realizes a critical phase comprising entirely single-particle critical states in the non-interacting limit. In the presence of short-range interactions, the non-interacting critical phase transforms to a many-body critical (MBC) phase, separated by lines of MBC-ergodic, MBC-many-body localized (MBL) and ergodic-MBL phase transitions that meet at a triple point. We elucidate the unusual characteristics of the MBC phase compared to the ergodic and MBL phases through the localization properties of the excitations in real space and Fock space (FS), and eigenstate inverse participation ratio (IPR). We show that the MBC phase, like the MBL phase, is well described by a multifractal scaling of the IPR and a linear finite-size scaling ansatz near the transition to the ergodic and MBL phases. However, the MBC phase, at the same time, exhibits delocalization of all single-particle excitations and a system-size dependent Fock-space localization length, analogous to the ergodic phase. Remarkably, we find evidence of unusual Widom lines on the phase diagram in the form of lines of pronounced peaks or dips in the FS localization properties inside the MBC and MBL phases. These Widom lines either emerge as a continuation of the precursor phase transition line, terminating at the triple point, or originate from a phase boundary.</description>

Abstract: Magnetism has played a central role in the long and rich history of modern condensed matter physics, with many foundational insights originating from theoretical studies of two-dimensional (2D) spin systems. The discovery of 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnets has revolutionized this area by providing real, atomically thin magnetic systems for experimental investigation. Since the first experimental reports of antiferromagnetic vdW insulators in 2016 - followed by studies on ferromagnetic vdW systems in 2017 - the field has witnessed rapid and expansive growth, with more than two dozen vdW magnetic materials now identified, including both ferro- and antiferromagnets. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the major scientific and technological developments in this rapidly evolving field. These include experimental realizations of various 2D spin Hamiltonians as well as unexpected phenomena such as magnetic excitons, Floquet-engineered states, and light-induced metastable magnetic phases. In parallel, 2D vdW magnets have shown significant promise in spintronics and related applications, offering a new platform for engineering quantum functionalities. We organize this review by tracing the historical development of the field, synthesizing key milestones, and highlighting its broader impact across condensed matter physics and materials science. We conclude with an Outlook section that outlines several promising directions for future research, aiming to chart a path forward in this vibrant and still rapidly growing area.</description>

      <title>Field Theory of Superconductor and Charged Vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Lagrangian of a Schr\"{o}dinger type complex scalar field of Cooper pair, a U(1) gauge field of electromagnetism, and a neutral scalar field of acoustic phonon with constant background charge density is proposed for an effective field theory of conventional superconductivity. We find static charged vortex solutions of finite energy and, for the critical couplings of the quartic self-interaction coupling of complex scalar field and the cubic Yukawa type coupling between neutral and complex scalar field, these charged vortices saturate the BPS (Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield) bound, that guarantees the nonperturbative classification of type I and II superconductors.</description>

      <title>Studying the Seebeck coefficient and exploring the possibility of enhancing ZT upto 1.8 for NaCo$_2$O$_4$ in high temperature region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we have studied the temperature dependent Seebeck coefficient (S) of the NaCo$_2$O$_4$ (NCO) by using experimental and computational methods. The range of experimentally obtained S is $\sim$55 to 103 $\mu$V/K in the temperature range of 300-600 K, which confirms the p-type behaviour of NCO. The electronic structure of this compound is obtained via DFT+U formalism. The band dispersion and partial density of states confirms the magnetic and half metallic nature. Furthermore, in the transport properties, the obtained S using a U = 4 eV gives the best match with experimental data. The temperature and chemical potential dependent S$^{2}$$\sigma$$/$$\tau$ is calculated using the obtained electronic transport properties, in which the maximum value obtained for p(n)-type doping is $\sim$22(61)$\times$10$^1$$^4$ $\mu$WK$^{-2}$cm$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. The possibility of enhancing the ZT is identified, and it is calculated in temperature range 300-1200 K. The maximum calculated value of ZT is 0.64 for p-type and 1.8 for n-type doping at 1200 K. The calculated carrier concentration obtained for p(n) type doping at 1200 K is $\sim$1.17 (1.6)$\times$10$^2$$^2$ cm$^-$$^3$. This study suggests that the careful doping of p and n type can enhance the applicability of this compound in thermoelectric for high temperature application.</description>

      <title>Anomalous valley Hall effect in monolayer chromium-based triple-Q magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the density functional theory calculations, we predict that several monolayer chromium-based materials exhibit a triple-Q tetrahedral magnetic insulating ground state. By studying the effect of biaxial strain on monolayer CrSi$\rm{_2}$P$\rm{_4}$ under various on-site Coulomb interactions, we reveal that this magnetic insulating state, sandwiched between the itinerant $120^{\circ}$ coplanar noncollinear antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states, originates from the competition between antiferromagnetic exchange and double exchange interactions of Cr 3$d$ electrons which can also be applied to account for the ground states in other chromium-based materials. Remarkably, anomalous valley Hall effect with giant valley splitting is discovered in the magnetic states of these inversion-asymmetric systems without requiring spin-orbit coupling or net magnetization. Our findings open a new avenue towards exploring monolayer materials for valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Nodal and Nodeless Pairing Symmetry in Superconducting 6R-SnNbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Majorana fermions, a fundamental idea to fault-tolerant quantum computing, can emerge in systems where superconductivity coexists with nontrivial band topology. One promising route to realizing such topological superconductors (TSCs) involves inducing superconductivity in topological materials, particularly in systems lacking inversion symmetry. In this study, we report the synthesis and detailed characterization of Sn-intercalated NbSe2, forming a new polytype, 6R-SnNbSe2. This compound crystallizes in the non-centrosymmetric space group R3m and exhibits bulk superconductivity below Tc around 4 K. Structural, electronic, and magnetic measurements confirm the emergence of a superconducting phase derived from Sn intercalation into the non-superconducting 3R-NbSe2. Temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth and superfluid density measurements down to 1.5 K are performed using the tunnel diode oscillator technique. The findings suggest the mixing of nodal and nodeless superconductivity in 6R-SnNbSe2. Given the non-centrosymmetric nature of the crystal structure and the theoretical prediction of topological nodal-line features in SnNbSe2, it is an interesting candidate to investigate unconventional pairing mechanisms. Our findings highlight the potential of this material to host nontrivial superconducting states among the transition-metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Surface topological quantum criticality: Conformal manifolds and Discrete Strong Coupling Fixed Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study quantum critical phenomena in surfaces of symmetry-protected topological matter, i.e. surface topological quantum criticality. A generic phase boundary of gapless surfaces in a symmetry-protected state shall be a co-dimension one manifold in an interaction parameter space of dimension $D_p$ (where $p$ refers to the parameter space) where the value of $D_p$ further depends on bulk topologies. In the context of fermionic topological insulators that we focus on, $D_p$ depends on the number of half-Dirac cones $\mathcal{N}$. We construct such manifolds explicitly for a few interaction parameter spaces with various $D_p$ values. Most importantly, we further illustrate that in cases with $D_p=3$ and $6$, there are sub-manifolds of fixed points that dictate the universalities of surface topological quantum criticality. These infrared stable manifolds are associated with emergent symmetries in the renormalization-group-equation flow naturally appearing in the loop expansion. Unlike in the usual order-disorder quantum critical phenomena, typically governed by an isolated Wilson-Fisher fixed point, we find in the one-loop approximation surface topological quantum criticalities are naturally captured by conformal manifolds where the number of marginal operators uniquely determines their co-dimensions. Isolated strong coupling fixed points also appear, usually as the endpoints in the phase boundary of surface topological quantum phases. However, their extreme infrared instabilities along multiple directions suggest that they shall be related to multi-critical surface topological quantum critical phenomena rather than generic surface topological quantum criticality. We also discuss and classify higher-loop symmetry-breaking effects, which can either distort the conformal manifolds or further break the conformal manifolds down to a few distinct fixed points.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Evolution of a Dense Ensemble of Optically Pumped Excitons to a Charge Transfer State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase transformations induced by short optical pulses are mainstream in studies on the dynamics of cooperative electronic states. We present a semi-phenomenological modeling of spacio-temporal effects expected when optical excitons are intricate with the order parameter as in, e.g., organic compounds with neutral-ionic ferroelectric phase transitions. A conceptual complication appears here, where both the excitation and the ground state ordering are built from the intermolecular electronic transfer. To describe both thermodynamic and dynamic effects on the same root, we adopt, for the phase transition, a view of the Excitonic Insulator - a hypothetical phase of a semiconductor that appears if the exciton energy becomes negative. After the initial pumping pulse, a quasi-condensate of excitons can appear as a macroscopic quantum state that then evolves, while interacting with other degrees of freedom which are prone to an instability. The self-trapping of excitons enhances their density, which can locally surpass a critical value to trigger the phase transformation. The system is stratified in domains that evolve through dynamical phase transitions and may persist even after the initiating excitons have recombined.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, we demonstrate the emergence of $X$ states in the long-time response of a locally perturbed many-body quantum impurity model. The emergence of the double-qubit state is heralded by the lack of decay of the response function as well as the out-of-time order correlator, signifying the trapping of excitations and hence information in edge modes. Surprisingly, after carrying out a quantum information theory characterization, we show that such states exhibit genuine quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Non-ergodic Phase Transition in the Global Hysteresis of the Frustrated Magnet DyRu2Si2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some frustrated magnets exhibit a huge hysteresis called "global hysteresis (GH)", where the magnetic plateaus appearing in the increasing field process are skipped in the decreasing field process from the high magnetic field state. In this paper, we focused on the frustrated magnet DyRu2Si2 and measured magnetization relaxations from two plateau states inside the GH loop, the phases III and IV, and investigated the phase transitions into them. As a result of the relaxation measurements, no relaxation is observed in the phase III, whereas long-time relaxations of more than 105 sec are observed at the phase IV plateau. Moreover, a Mpemba-effect-like relaxation phenomenon where the relaxation from an initial state prepared in the zero-field-cooled condition overtakes that from an initial state prepared in the field-cooled condition is observed. These results indicate that the phase IV is the non-ergodic state with a complex free-energy landscape with multiple local minima, while the phase III has a simple free energy structure. Therefore, the III-IV phase transition is considered to be the ergodic to non-ergodic phase transition. Although this type of phase transition typically occurs in random glassy systems, the phase IV in DyRu2Si2 has a regular long-range ordered magnetic structure and yet exhibits non-ergodic properties, which is highly nontrivial. Our findings open the possibility of observing non-ergodic states in frustrated magnets with regular long-range orders.</description>

      <title>How quantum fluctuations freeze a classical liquid and then melt it into a topological one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topologically ordered quantum liquids are highly sought-after quantum phases of matter, and recently, fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) joined the few experimental realizations of such phases. Here, we ask whether a gapped classical, highly degenerate liquid can be the birthplace of FCIs upon the addition of suitable quantum fluctuations. Two competing tendencies can be anticipated: (i) following the quantum order-by-disorder paradigm, quantum fluctuations could induce symmetry-breaking (charge) order, or (ii) the classical liquid builds up long-range entanglement and turns into a quantum liquid. We study spinless fermions on a honeycomb lattice subject to cluster-charging interactions and introduce quantumness through a Haldane kinetic term, featuring complex second-nearest-neighbor hopping. Based on extensive exact diagonalization calculations and high-order perturbation theory, we find that neither scenario (i) nor (ii) prevails, but (i) and (ii) manifest sequentially as the kinetic energy is increased. We demonstrate how the gradual lifting of kinematic constraints gives rise to this sequence of phases. Our results relate to the regime of intermediate-scale interactions present in moir\'e systems, where band projections are not suitable to model FCIs and competing charge-ordered phases have been identified.</description>

      <title>Interacting Chern insulator transition on the sphere: revealing the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, the transition between topological and trivial Chern insulators exemplifies a class of beyond-Landau critical phenomena. We show that the interaction-driven multicritical point of this transition falls into the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) universality class, a topic of considerable interest in both high-energy and condensed matter physics. In this work, we focus on the $N=2$ case of the GNY criticality. We employ exact diagonalization of Dirac fermions on a sphere to circumvent the parity anomaly, capitalize on full SO(3) symmetry to reduce finite-size effects, and directly extract operator scaling dimensions from the excitation spectrum. Despite working with only modest system sizes, our results closely match conformal bootstrap predictions for low-scaling dimension operators and reveal several previously uncharacterized higher primaries. These findings highlight the efficacy of spherical geometry for probing interacting Dirac criticality.</description>

      <title>Slow decay rate of correlations induced by long-range extended Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the impact of long-range Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction in the extended $XY$ model on the phase diagram as well as the static and dynamical properties of quantum and classical correlation functions. It is known that in the nearest-neighbor $XY$ model with DM interaction, the transition from the gapless chiral phase to a gapped one occurs when the strengths of the DM interaction and anisotropy coincide. We exhibit that the critical line gets modified with the range of interactions which decay according to power-law. Specifically, instead of being gapless in the presence of a strong DM interaction, a gapped region emerges which grows with the increase of the moderate fall-off rate (quasi-long range regime) in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. The gapless chiral phase can also be separated from a gapped one by the decay patterns of quantum mutual information and classical correlation with distant sites of the ground state which are independent of the fall-off rate in the gapless zone. We observe that the corresponding critical lines that depend on the fall-off rate can also be determined from the effective central charge involved in the scaling of entanglement entropy. We illustrate that in a non-equilibrium setting, the relaxation dynamics of classical correlation, the decay rate of total correlation, and the growth rate of entanglement entropy can be employed to uncover whether the evolving Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian corresponding to the initial state are gapped or gapless.</description>

      <title>Tunable atomically enhanced moir\'e Berry curvatures in twisted triple bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a twisted triple bilayer graphene platform consisting of three units of Bernal bilayer graphene consecutively twisted at 1.49{\deg} and 1.68{\deg}. We demonstrate the atomic reconstruction between the two competing moir\'e superlattices strongly enhances the Berry curvature of each moir\'e band insulator state, characterized by measured strong nonlocal valley Hall effect that sensitively depends on the inter-moir\'e competition strength, tunable by manipulating the out-of-plane carrier distribution. Our study sheds light on the microscopic mechanism of atomic and electronic reconstruction in twisted multilayer systems, by systematically investigating transport signatures of moir\'e Berry curvature and its enhancement from moir\'e-of-moir\'e lattice reconstruction. We show that the reconstructed electronic band can be versatilely tuned by electrostatics, providing an approach toward engineering the band structure and its topology for a quantum material platform with designer electrical and optical properties.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel multi-scale embedding scheme that links conventional QM/MM embedding and bootstrap embedding (BE) to allow simulations of large chemical systems on limited quantum devices. We also propose a mixed-basis BE scheme that facilitates BE calculations on extended systems using classical computers with limited memory resources. Benchmark data suggest the combination of these two strategies as a robust path in attaining the correlation energies of large realistic systems, combining the proven accuracy of BE with chemical and biological systems of interest in a lower computational cost method. Due to the flexible tunability of the resource requirements and systematic fragment construction, future developments in the realization of quantum computers naturally offer improved accuracy for multi-scale BE calculations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scars beyond the PXP model in Rydberg simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent revivals recently observed in Rydberg atom simulators have challenged our understanding of thermalization and attracted much interest to the concept of quantum many-body scars (QMBSs). QMBSs are non-thermal highly excited eigenstates that coexist with typical eigenstates in the spectrum of many-body Hamiltonians, and have since been reported in multiple theoretical models, including the so-called PXP model, approximately realized by Rydberg simulators. At the same time, questions of how common QMBSs are and in what models they are physically realized remain open. In this Letter, we demonstrate that QMBSs exist in a broader family of models that includes and generalizes PXP to longer-range constraints and states with different periodicity. We show that in each model, multiple QMBS families can be found. Each of them relies on a different approximate $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebra, leading to oscillatory dynamics in all cases. However, in contrast to the PXP model, their observation requires launching dynamics from weakly entangled initial states rather than from a product state. QMBSs reported here may be experimentally probed using Rydberg atom simulator in the regime of longer-range Rydberg blockades.</description>

      <title>A Gapless Phase with Haagerup Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)d gapless theory which has Haagerup $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry. The construction relies on the recent exploration of the categorical Landau paradigm applied to fusion category symmetries. First, using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory, we construct all gapped phases with Haagerup symmetry. Extending this construction to gapless phases, we study the second order phase transition between gapped phases, and determine analytically a Haagerup-symmetric conformal field theory. This is given in terms of two copies of the three-state Potts model, on which we realise the full $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry action and determine the relevant deformations to the $\mathcal{H}_3$-symmetric gapped phases. This continuum analysis is corroborated by a lattice model construction of the gapped and gapless phases, using the anyon chain.</description>

      <title>Transitions from Composite Fermi Liquid to Moore-Read States in Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals represent a significant class of topological gapless materials in three dimensions and have been shown to exhibit three-dimensional quantum Hall effect. However, existing research mainly focuses on scenarios without interactions. Recent studies suggest that the fractional quantum Hall effect can arise in a Weyl semimetal with a one-third filled Landau level under a magnetic field. However, it remains unclear whether more exotic states, such as composite Fermi liquid and MooreRead states, can appear at half filling. Here we surprisingly find the existence of composite Fermi liquid, Moore-Read states and charge density waves in the same Weyl-orbit-based Landau level of a Weyl semimetal and their transitions induced by varying the distance between Weyl points. We attribute these transitions to a significant change in the single-particle wave functions of the Landau level as the distance between Weyl points is varied. Finally, we demonstrate that a transition from composite Fermi liquid to Moore-Read states can be induced by tuning the direction of a magnetic field, a process that is more experimentally accessible.</description>

      <title>Analog charged black hole formation via percolation: Exploring cosmic censorship and Hoop conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an analog model of charged black hole (BH) formation using the framework of classical percolation. By analyzing the scaling behavior of key quantities, including surface gravity and Komar mass, we establish a robust correspondence between this analog system and gravitational collapse in general relativity. Our numerical simulations of the lattice model show excellent agreement with analytical predictions for the continuum limit, highlighting the potential of analog systems to capture essential features of BH physics. Interestingly, we find that while geometric criteria related to the hoop conjecture are necessary, they are not sufficient for BH formation in our model. Instead, the exponential growth of energy and cluster size emerges as the key indicator, suggesting a novel interpretation of the hoop conjecture and providing further support for cosmic censorship within our analog framework by ensuring horizon formation. This work offers a fresh perspective on the organization of matter within BH event horizons and lays the groundwork for future quantum extensions that could shed light on Hawking radiation and the BH information paradox by linking entanglement entropy in quantum percolation models to BH entropy.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phases of Higher Dimensional Floquet CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical phases of Floquet Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) in space-time dimensions greater than two. Building upon our previous work [1] which introduced quaternionic representations for studying Floquet dynamics in higher-dimensional CFTs, we now explore more general square pulse drive protocols that go beyond a single SU(1,1) subgroup. We demonstrate that, for multi-step drive protocols, the system exhibits distinct dynamical phases characterized by the nature of the eigenvalues of the quaternionic matrix representing time evolution in a single cycle, leading to different stroboscopic responses. Our analysis establishes a fundamental geometric interpretation where these dynamical phases directly correspond to the presence or absence of Killing horizons in the base space of the CFT and in a higher dimensional AdS space on which a putative dual lives. The heating phase is associated with a non-extremal horizon, the critical phase with an extremal horizon which disappears in the non heating phase. We develop perturbative approaches to compute the Floquet Hamiltonians in different regimes and show, how tuning drive parameters can lead to horizons, providing a geometric framework for understanding heating phenomena in driven conformal systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient mutual magic and magic capacity with matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs) probe the non-stabilizerness (or magic) of many-body systems and quantum computers. Here, we introduce the mutual von-Neumann SRE and magic capacity, which can be efficiently computed in time $O(N\chi^3)$ for matrix product states (MPSs) of bond dimension $\chi$. We find that mutual SRE characterizes the critical point of ground states of the transverse-field Ising model, independently of the chosen local basis. Then, we relate the magic capacity to the anti-flatness of the Pauli spectrum, which quantifies the complexity of computing SREs. The magic capacity characterizes transitions in the ground state of the Heisenberg and Ising model, randomness of Clifford+T circuits, and distinguishes typical and atypical states. Finally, we make progress on numerical techniques: we design two improved Monte-Carlo algorithms to compute the mutual $2$-SRE, overcoming limitations of previous approaches based on local update. We also give improved statevector simulation methods for Bell sampling and SREs with $O(8^{N/2})$ time and $O(2^N)$ memory, which we demonstrate for $24$ qubits. Our work uncovers improved approaches to study the complexity of quantum many-body systems.</description>
