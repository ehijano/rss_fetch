      <title>Multi-scale topology optimization of porous heat sinks with voided lattice structure using a two-layer Darcy-Forchheimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a topology optimization framework for the design of water cooled heat sinks that incorporate voided lattice structures, formulated using a two-layer Darcy-Forchheimer model. Conventional porous heat sinks often suffer from excessive pressure drops due to their intricate geometries, which limit their practical applicability. To overcome this issue, the proposed method introduces an explicit representation of both void and porous regions, together with graded lattice density, within a multi-material optimization framework. The two-layer Darcy-Forchheimer model enables efficient reduced-order simulations, allowing direct consideration of the heterogeneous porous-void distribution during the optimization process. The optimized designs are reconstructed into full-scale lattice geometries and validated through coupled thermo-fluid finite element analyses under fixed pressure-drop conditions. The results demonstrate that the voided lattice configurations significantly outperform conventional plate-fin and uniform lattice heat sinks, achieving approximately 20-30 percent higher maximum Nusselt numbers while maintaining lower pressure losses.</description>

      <title>Machine-learned domain partitioning for computationally efficient coupling of continuum and particle simulations of membrane fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All simulation approaches eventually face limits in computational scalability when applied to large spatiotemporal domains. This challenge becomes especially apparent in molecular-level particle simulations, where high spatial and temporal resolution leads to rapidly increasing computational demands. To overcome these limitations, hybrid methods that combine simulations with different levels of resolution offer a promising solution. In this context, we present a machine learning-based decision model that dynamically selects between simulation methods at runtime. The model is built around a Multilayer perceptron (MLP) that predicts the expected discrepancy between particle and continuum simulation results, enabling the localized use of high-fidelity particle simulations only where they are expected to add value. This concurrent approach is applied to the simulation of membrane fabrication processes, where a particle simulation is coupled with a continuum model. This article describes the architecture of the decision model and its integration into the simulation workflow, enabling efficient, scalable, and adaptive multiscale simulations.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network for Unified Electronic and Interatomic Potentials: Strain-tunable Electronic Structures in 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce UEIPNet, an equivariant graph neural network designed to predict both interatomic potentials and tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonians for an atomic structure. The UEIPNet is trained using density functional theory calculations followed by Wannier projection to predict energies and forces as node-level targets and Wannier-projected TB matrices as edge-level targets. This enables physically consistent modeling of coupled mechanical electronic responses with near-DFT accuracy. Trained on bilayer graphene and monolayer MoS2 DFT data, UEIPNet captures key deformation-electronic effects: in twisted bilayer graphene, it reveals how interlayer spacing, in-plane strain, and out-of-plane corrugation drive isolated flat-band formation, and further shows that modulating substrate interaction strength can generate flat bands even away from the magic angle. For monolayer MoS2, the UEIPNet accurately reproduces phonon dispersions, strain-dependent band-gap evolution, and local density of states modulations under non-uniform strain. The UEIPNet offers a generalized, efficient, and scalable framework for studying deformation-electronic coupling in large-scale atomistic systems, bridging classical atomistic simulations and electronic-structure calculations.</description>

      <title>HARPPP: Autonomous Geometric Design Optimisation of Stirred Tank Reactor Impellers and Baffles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing and optimising the geometry of industrial process equipment remains slow and still largely ad hoc: engineers make small tweaks to one standard shape at a time, build prototypes, and hope for gains. We introduce HARPPP, an autonomous design loop that couples a compact, programmable geometry model to power-controlled CFD and evolutionary search. The geometry model is a single mathematical description that reproduces every standard impeller as a special case while spanning an unlimited set of manufacturable shapes. Working with Johnson Matthey on an industrial vessel, HARPPP explored a 23-parameter impeller-baffle space at constant power (3024 W), executing 3,000 simulation cycles in 15 days. The search uncovered multiple design families that outperform a Rushton/4-baffle baseline in both mixing intensity and uniformity, including twisted-plate impellers and pitched/curved baffles (intensity +18 to +78 percent; uniformity CoV -16 to -64 percent). A clear intensity-uniformity Pareto frontier emerged, enabling application-specific choices. Because HARPPP treats the simulator as the objective, it generalises to other equipment wherever credible physics models exist.</description>

      <title>Simulating high-accuracy nuclear motion Hamiltonians in discrete variable representation using Walsh-Hadamard QROM with fault-tolerant quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for simulating rovibrational Hamiltonians on fault-tolerant quantum computers. The method integrates exact curvilinear kinetic energy operators and general-form potential energy surfaces expressed in a hybrid finite-basis/discrete-variable representation. The Hamiltonian is encoded as a unitary quantum circuit using a quantum read-only memory construction based on the Walsh--Hadamard transform, enabling high-accuracy quantum phase estimation of rovibrational energy levels. Our technique provides asymptotic reductions in both logical-qubit count and T-gate complexity that are exponential in the number of atoms and at least polynomial in the total Hilbert-space size, relative to existing block-encoding techniques based on linear combinations of unitaries. Compared with classical variational methods, it offers exponential memory savings and polynomial reductions in time complexity. The quantum volume required for computing the rovibrational spectrum of water can be reduced by up to $10^{5}$ times compared with other quantum methods, increasing to at least $10^{6}$ for a 30-dimensional (12-atom) model system. For this case with a six-body coupled potential, estimating spectroscopic-accuracy energy levels would require about three months on a $1~\mathrm{MHz}$ fault-tolerant quantum processor with fewer than 300 logical qubits, versus over 30,000 years on the fastest current classical supercomputer. These estimates are approximate and subject to technological uncertainties, and realizing the asymptotic advantage will require substantial quantum resources and continued algorithmic progress.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Nonrelativistic Charge-Spin Conversion in X-Type Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets have attracted considerable interest for their capacity to generate spin splitting while preserving zero net magnetization. This work proposes a distinct class of antiferromagnetic materials, termed X-type antiferromagnets, which are shown to produce more efficient $\cal T$-odd spin currents than altermagnets along specific crystallographic directions due to their unique Fermi surface geometry. The spin current polarization is controlled by the N\'eel vector orientation. In the (110)-oriented $\beta-\mathrm{Fe}_2\mathrm{PO}_5$, the Fermi surface exhibits a $d$-wave altermagnetic-like characteristic and becomes compressed into an approximately X-shaped $d$-wave configuration, yielding highly efficient $\cal T$-odd spin currents with a charge-to-spin conversion efficiency reaching 90%. Moreover, when the N\'eel vector is tilted via unit cell selection or external means, the system generates out-of-plane spin-polarized currents with efficiencies substantially exceeding those of known ferromagnets, altermagnets, noncollinear antiferromagnets, and low-symmetry materials. The highly efficient charge-spin conversion in X-type antiferromagnets provides a novel and highly effective spin source system for the development of low-power spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Synergistic effects of rare-earth doping on the magnetic properties of orthochromates: A machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiferroic materials, particularly rare-earth orthochromates (RECrO$_3$), have garnered significant interest due to their unique magnetic and electric-polar properties, making them promising candidates for multifunctional devices. Although extensive research has been conducted on their antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition temperature (N$\acute{\textrm{e}}$el temperature, $T_\textrm{N}$), ferroelectricity, and piezoelectricity, the effects of doping and substitution of rare-earth (RE) elements on these properties remain insufficiently explored. In this study, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were employed to predict and analyze the physical properties of RECrO$_3$ compounds under various doping scenarios. Experimental and literature data were integrated to train machine learning models, enabling accurate predictions of $T_\textrm{N}$, besides remanent polarization ($P_\textrm{r}$) and piezoelectric coefficients ($d_{33}$). The results indicate that doping with specific RE elements significantly impacts $T_\textrm{N}$, with optimal doping levels identified for enhanced performance. Furthermore, high-entropy RECrO$_3$ compounds were systematically analyzed, demonstrating how the inclusion of multiple RE elements influences magnetic properties. This work establishes a robust framework for predicting and optimizing the properties of RECrO$_3$ materials, offering valuable insights into their potential applications in energy storage and sensor technologies.</description>

      <title>Lattice-reflection symmetry in tensor-network renormalization group with entanglement filtering in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor-network renormalization group (TNRG) is an efficient real-space renormalization group method for studying the criticality in both classical and quantum lattice systems. Exploiting symmetries of a system in a TNRG algorithm can simplify the implementation of the algorithm and can help produce correct tensor RG flows. Although a general framework for considering a global on-site symmetry has been established, it is still unclear how to incorporate a lattice symmetry like rotation or reflection in TNRG. As a first step for lattice symmetries, we propose a method to incorporate the lattice-reflection symmetry in the context of a TNRG with entanglement filtering in both two and three dimensions (2D and 3D). To achieve this, we write down a general definition of lattice-reflection symmetry in tensor-network language. Then, we introduce a transposition trick for exploiting and imposing the lattice-reflection symmetry in two basic TNRG operators: projective truncations and entanglement filtering. Using the transposition trick, the detailed algorithms of the TNRG map in both 2D and 3D are laid out, where the lattice-reflection symmetry is preserved and imposed. Finally, we demonstrate how to construct the linearization of the TNRG maps in a given lattice-reflection sector, with the help of which it becomes possible to extract scaling dimensions in each sector separately. Our work paves the way for understanding the lattice-rotation symmetry in TNRG.</description>

      <title>Practical algorithm for simulating thermal pure quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of novel quantum many-body computational algorithms relies on robust benchmarking. However, generating such benchmarks is often hindered by the massive computational resources required for exact diagonalization or quantum Monte Carlo simulations, particularly at finite temperatures. In this work, we propose a new algorithm for obtaining thermal pure quantum states, which allows efficient computation of both mechanical and thermodynamic properties at finite temperatures. We implement this algorithm in our open-source C++ template library, Physica. Combining the improved algorithm with state-of-the-art software engineering, our implementation achieves high performance and numerical stability. As an example, we demonstrate that for the $4 \times 4$ Hubbard model, our method runs approximately $10^3$ times faster than $\mathcal{H}\Phi$ 3.5.2. Moreover, the accessible temperature range is extended down to $\beta = 32$ across arbitrary doping levels. These advances significantly push forward the frontiers of benchmarking for quantum many-body systems.</description>

Each triangular structure had both left- and right-handed profile orientations. For all variants, a modified version with a reflective gold coating was additionally considered. The maximum energy gains and accelerating gradients were determined and quantified for all structure classes: transparent and reflective (with both rectangular and triangular profiles).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermionic cold atoms in optical traps provide viable quantum simulators of correlation effects in electronic systems. For dressed Rydberg atoms in two-dimensional traps with out-of-plane dipole moments, a realistic model of the pairwise interaction is of repulsive dipolar $1/r^3$ form at long range, softened to a constant at short range. This study provides parameterizations of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo energy data for ferromagnetic (one-component) and paramagnetic (two-component) two-dimensional homogeneous Fermi fluids of interacting dipolar atoms. We find itinerant ferromagnetism to be unstable within our parameter spaces for dipolar interactions both with and without softening. Our parameterization of the energy as a function of density will enable density functional theory to support experimental studies of inhomogeneous fermionic cold atom systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are central to both practical applications and the development of optimization methods. While classical and quantum algorithms have been refined over decades, machine learning-assisted approaches are comparatively recent and have not yet consistently outperformed simple, state-of-the-art classical methods. Here, we focus on a class of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, specifically the challenge of finding minimum energy configurations in three-dimensional Ising spin glasses. We use a Global Annealing Monte Carlo algorithm that integrates standard local moves with global moves proposed via machine learning. We show that local moves play a crucial role in achieving optimal performance. Benchmarking against Simulated Annealing and Population Annealing, we demonstrate that Global Annealing not only surpasses the performance of Simulated Annealing but also exhibits greater robustness than Population Annealing, maintaining effectiveness across problem hardness and system size without hyperparameter tuning. These results provide, to our knowledge, the first clear and robust evidence that a machine learning-assisted optimization method can exceed the capabilities of classical state-of-the-art techniques in a combinatorial optimization setting.</description>

      <title>Time crystalline solitons and their stochastic dynamics in a driven-dissipative \phi^4 model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodical driven systems provide unique opportunities to investigate the dynamics of topological structures far from equilibrium. In this paper, we report a time-crystalline soliton (TCS) state in a driven-dissipative $\phi^4$ model. This state exhibits spontaneous breaking of discrete time-translational symmetry alongside spatial soliton behavior. During time evolution, the soliton pattern periodically oscillates between kink and anti-kink configurations. We further study TCS dynamics under noise, demonstrating that soliton random walk can induce a dynamical transition between two distinct $Z_2$ symmetry-breaking time-crystalline phases in time domain. Finally, we examine the annihilation of two spatially separated TCSs under noise. Importantly, in contrast to the confined behavior of time-crystalline monopoles reported in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 056502 (2023)], the dynamics of time-crystalline solitons is deconfined despite the nonequilibrium nature of our model: the statistically averaged annihilation time scales as a power law with the solitons' initial separation.</description>

      <title>Collisional Excitation in Space: Recent Advances and Future Challenges in the JWST Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This perspective offers a viewpoint on how the challenges of molecular scattering investigations of astrophysical interest have evolved in recent years. Computational progress has steadily expanded collisional databases and provided essential tools for modeling non-LTE astronomical regions. However, the observational leap enabled by the JWST and new observational facilities has revealed critical gaps in these databases. In this framework, two major frontiers emerge: the characterization of collisional processes involving heavy projectiles, and the treatment of ro-vibrational excitation. The significant computational effort of these investigations emphasizes the need to test and develop robust theoretical methods and approximations, capable of extending the census of collisional coefficients required for reliable astrophysical modeling. Recent developments in these directions are outlined, with particular attention to their application and their potential to broaden the coverage of molecular systems and physical environments.</description>

      <title>Fast, Modular, and Differentiable Framework for Machine Learning-Enhanced Molecular Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an end-to-end differentiable molecular simulation framework (DIMOS) for molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. DIMOS easily integrates machine-learning-based interatomic potentials and implements classical force fields including an efficient implementation of particle-mesh Ewald. Thanks to its modularity, both classical and machine-learning-based approaches can be easily combined into a hybrid description of the system (ML/MM). By supporting key molecular dynamics features such as efficient neighborlists and constraint algorithms for larger time steps, the framework makes steps in bridging the gap between hand-optimized simulation engines and the flexibility of a \verb|PyTorch| implementation. We show that due to improved linear instead of quadratic scaling as function of system size DIMOS is able to obtain speed-up factors of up to $170\times$ for classical force field simulations against another fully differentiable simulation framework. The advantage of differentiability is demonstrated by an end-to-end optimization of the proposal distribution in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). Using these optimized simulation parameters a $3\times$ acceleration is observed in comparison to ad-hoc chosen simulation parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/nec-research/DIMOS.</description>

      <title>High-order Equivariant Flow Matching for Density Functional Theory Hamiltonian Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is a fundamental method for simulating quantum chemical properties, but it remains expensive due to the iterative self-consistent field (SCF) process required to solve the Kohn-Sham equations. Recently, deep learning methods are gaining attention as a way to bypass this step by directly predicting the Hamiltonian. However, they rely on deterministic regression and do not consider the highly structured nature of Hamiltonians. In this work, we propose QHFlow, a high-order equivariant flow matching framework that generates Hamiltonian matrices conditioned on molecular geometry. Flow matching models continuous-time trajectories between simple priors and complex targets, learning the structured distributions over Hamiltonians instead of direct regression. To further incorporate symmetry, we use a neural architecture that predicts SE(3)-equivariant vector fields, improving accuracy and generalization across diverse geometries. To further enhance physical fidelity, we additionally introduce a fine-tuning scheme to align predicted orbital energies with the target. QHFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing Hamiltonian error by 71% on MD17 and 53% on QH9. Moreover, we further show that QHFlow accelerates the DFT process without trading off the solution quality when initializing SCF iterations with the predicted Hamiltonian, significantly reducing the number of iterations and runtime.</description>

      <title>A meshless method for computational electromagnetics with improved dispersion properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The finite difference time domain method is one of the simplest and most popular methods in computational electromagnetics. This work considers two possible ways of generalising it to a meshless setting by employing local radial basis function interpolation. The resulting methods remain fully explicit and are convergent if properly chosen hyperviscosity terms are added to the update equations. We demonstrate that increasing the stencil size of the approximation has a desirable effect on numerical dispersion. Furthermore, our proposed methods can exhibit a decreased dispersion anisotropy compared to the finite difference time domain method.</description>

      <title>Rippled Moire Superlattices for Decoupled Ferroelectric Bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry considerations suggest that moire superlattices formed by twisted two-dimensional materials should preserve overall inversion symmetry. However, experiments consistently report robust ferroelectricity in systems such as twisted bilayer h-BN, posing a fundamental discrepancy between theory and experiment regarding its microscopic origin. Here, using large-scale finite-field molecular dynamics simulations, we challenge the prevailing defect-pinning hypothesis and instead identify an out-of-plane bending field, induced by in-plane compressive strain, as the key symmetry-breaking mechanism. This strain-induced rippling drives spatially heterogeneous interlayer sliding and distorts the moire domain wall network, resulting in a four-state ferroelectric system. Remarkably, we show this mechanism can be harnessed at the nanoscale, where localized nanobubbles designate the moire lattice's fundamental hexagonal domain clusters as the smallest individually addressable ferroelectric bits, thereby imposing local control on an otherwise globally defined structure. Our findings establish a geometry-driven framework for understanding and engineering moire ferroelectrics, offering not only a route toward ultra-high-density, rewritable memory, but also a strategy for locally tuning the moire potential itself, a critical step for manipulating emergent correlated and topological quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Committors without Descriptors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of rare events is one of the major challenges in atomistic simulations, and several enhanced sampling methods towards its solution have been proposed. Recently, it has been suggested that the use of the committor, which provides a precise formal description of rare events, could be of use in this context. We have recently followed up on this suggestion and proposed a committor-based method that promotes frequent transitions between the metastable states of the system and allows extensive sampling of the process transition state ensemble. One of the strengths of our approach is being self-consistent and semi-automatic, exploiting a variational criterion to iteratively optimize a neural-network-based parametrization of the committor, which uses a set of physical descriptors as input. Here, we further automate this procedure by combining our previous method with the expressive power of graph neural networks, which can directly process atomic coordinates rather than descriptors. Besides applications on benchmark systems, we highlight the advantages of a graph-based approach in describing the role of solvent molecules in systems, such as ion pair dissociation or ligand binding.</description>

      <title>AeroDiT: Diffusion Transformers for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Simulations of Airfoil Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17394v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time and accurate prediction of aerodynamic flow fields around airfoils is crucial for flow control and aerodynamic optimization. However, achieving this remains challenging due to the high computational costs and the non-linear nature of flow physics. Traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods face limitations in balancing computational efficiency and accuracy, hindering their application in real-time scenarios. To address these challenges, this study presents AeroDiT, a novel surrogate model that integrates scalable diffusion models with transformer architectures to address these challenges. Trained on Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation data for high Reynolds-number airfoil flows, AeroDiT accurately captures complex flow patterns while enabling real-time predictions. The model demonstrates impressive performance, with mean relative $L_2$ errors of 0.1, 0.025, and 0.050 for pressure $p$ and velocity components $u_x, u_y$, confirming its reliability. To further enhance physical consistency, we incorporate explicit physics-informed losses based on RANS residuals, including mass and momentum conservation constraints. The transformer-based structure allows for real-time predictions within seconds, enabling efficient aerodynamic simulations. This work underscores the potential of generative machine learning techniques to advance computational fluid dynamics, offering potential solutions to challenges in simulating high-fidelity aerodynamic flows.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics in a villi-patterned channel due to pendular-wave activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by small intestine motility, we investigate the flow induced by a propagating pendular-wave along the walls of a channel lined with rigid, villi-like microstructures. The villi undergo harmonic axial oscillations with a phase lag relative to their neighbours, generating travelling patterns of intervillous contraction. Using two-dimensional lattice Boltzmann simulations, we resolve the flow within the villi zone and the lumen, sampling small to moderate Womersley numbers. We uncover a mixing boundary layer (MBL) just above the villi, composed of semi-vortical structures that travel with the imposed wave. In the lumen, an axial steady flow emerges, surprisingly oriented opposite to the wave propagation direction, contrary to canonical peristaltic flows. We attribute this flow reversal to the non-reciprocal trajectories of fluid trapped between adjacent villi, and derive a geometric scaling law that captures its magnitude in the Stokes regime. The MBL thickness is found to depend solely on the wave kinematics given by intervillous phase lag in the low-inertia limit. Above a critical threshold, oscillatory inertia induces dynamic confinement, limiting the radial extent of the MBL and leading to non-monotonic behaviour of the axial steady flux. We further develop an effective boundary condition at the villus tips, incorporating both steady and oscillatory components across relevant spatial scales. This framework enables coarse-grained simulations of intestinal flows without resolving individual villi. Our results shed light on the interplay between active microstructure, pendular-wave and finite inertia in biological flows, and suggests new avenues for flow control in biomimetic and microfluidic systems.</description>

      <title>Ground states of quasi-two-dimensional correlated systems via energy expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generic method for computing groundstates that is applicable to a wide range of spatially anisotropic 2D many-body quantum systems. By representing the 2D system using a low-energy 1D basis set, we obtain an effective 1D Hamiltonian that only has quasi-local interactions, at the price of a large local Hilbert space. We apply our new method to three specific 2D systems of weakly coupled chains: hardcore bosons, a spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and spinful fermions with repulsive interactions. In particular, we showcase a non-trivial application of the energy expansion framework, to the anisotropic triangular Heisenberg lattice, a highly challenging model related to 2D spin liquids. Treating lattices of unprecedented size, we provide evidence for the existence of a quasi-1D gapless spin liquid state in this system. We also demonstrate the energy expansion-framework to perform well where external validation is possible. For the fermionic benchmark in particular, we showcase the energy expansion-framework's ability to provide results of comparable quality at a small fraction of the resources required for previous computational efforts.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for Simulating Nonlinear Solid Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph-based learned simulators have emerged as a promising approach for simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes, offering speed and generalization across diverse geometries. However, they often struggle with capturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations usually occurring in solid mechanics, and suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on local message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these limitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network (ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i) Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference (ROBI), a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across different mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via Algebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local dynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending or multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities. ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.</description>

      <title>Influence of an external static magnetic field on prebreakdown electron emission and heating</title>

Abstract: High magnetic fields can increase the occurrence of vacuum arcing, suggesting that both electric and magnetic fields can play a role in the vacuum arcing process. The mechanism of vacuum arcing in high magnetic fields is believed to involve both the cathode and the anode, with the cathode serving as the originator of field-emitting nanoprotrusions or tips, while the anode serves a secondary role. Significant heating of the anode surface can be achieved by magnetic focusing of the emitted electron beam, leading to increased heat flux due to greater current density. We simulated the emitted electron beam in different configurations of the electric and magnetic fields using the particle-in-cell (PIC) and finite element methods (FEM). The heating caused by the impacting electron beam was simulated for magnetic fields ranging from 0 T to 30 T. The directions of the electric and magnetic fields were found to play a major role in the focusing of the electron beam. We found that a sufficient temperature increase on the anode surface for evaporation can be reached at magnetic fields on the order of 10-30 T, suggesting the possibility of plasma initiation on the anode side.</description>

Abstract: The boundary between classically simulable and computationally superior quantum systems is fundamental to identifying true quantum advantage. We investigate this within the framework of quantum reservoir computing by introducing a tunable $N$-qubit random circuit model, where a fraction $p$ of Clifford gates are probabilistically substituted with nonstabilizing conditional-$\hat{T}$ gates. We establish a direct correspondence between the reservoir's performance on temporal processing tasks and its entanglement spectrum statistics and long-range nonstabilizer resource content. To assess scalability, we study the scaling of the anti-flatness of states in the large-$N$ limit at a fixed circuit depth ratio $d/N \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$. This is taken as a witness to concentration of measures, a known impediment to learning in thermalizing systems. We demonstrate that the learnability and scalability of the reservoir can be continuously controlled by the parameter $p$, allowing us to navigate from classically tractable to maximally expressive quantum dynamics. These architecture-agnostic results offer a general strategy for designing powerful and trainable quantum machine learning systems and clarify the physical resources underpinning quantum computational advantage.</description>
