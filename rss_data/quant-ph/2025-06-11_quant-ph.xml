      <title>On whether quantum theory needs complex numbers: the foil theories perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work by Renou et al. (2021) has led to some controversy concerning the question of whether quantum theory requires complex numbers for its formulation. We promote the view that the main result of that work is best understood not as a claim about the relative merits of different representations of quantum theory, but rather as a claim about the possibility of experimentally adjudicating between standard quantum theory and an alternative theory -- a foil theory -- known as real-amplitude quantum theory (RQT). In particular, the claim is that this adjudication can be achieved given only an assumption about the causal structure of the experiment. Here, we aim to shed some light on why this is possible, by reconceptualizing the comparison of the two theories as an instance of a broader class of such theory comparisons. By recasting RQT as the subtheory of quantum theory that arises by symmetrizing with respect to the collective action of a time-reversal symmetry, we can compare it to other subtheories that arise by symmetrization, but for different symmetries. If the symmetry has a unitary representation, the resulting foil theory is termed a twirled quantum world, and if it does not (as is the case in RQT), the resulting foil theory is termed a swirled quantum world. We show that, in contrast to RQT, there is no possibility of distinguishing any twirled quantum world from quantum theory given only an assumption about causal structure. We also define analogues of twirling and swirling for an arbitrary generalized probabilistic theory and identify certain necessary conditions on a causal structure for it to be able to support a causal compatibility gap between the theory and its symmetrized version. We draw out the implications of these analyses for the question of how a lack of a shared reference frame state features into the possibility of such a gap.</description>

      <title>Kirkwood-Dirac Nonpositivity is a Necessary Resource for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical computers can simulate models of quantum computation with restricted input states. The identification of such states can sharpen the boundary between quantum and classical computations. Previous works describe simulable states of odd-dimensional systems. Here, we further our understanding of systems of qubits. We do so by casting a real-quantum-bit model of computation in terms of a Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability distribution. Algorithms, throughout which this distribution is a proper (positive) probability distribution can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer. We leverage recent results on the geometry of the set of KD-positive states to construct previously unknown classically-simulable (bound) states. Finally, we show that KD nonpositivity is a resource monotone for quantum computation, establishing KD nonpositivity as a necessary resource for computational quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Divisibility of dynamical maps: Schr\"odinger vs. Heisenberg picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Divisibility of dynamical maps is a central notion in the study of quantum non-Markovianity, providing a natural framework to characterize memory effects via time-local master equations. In this work, we generalize the notion of divisibility of quantum dynamical maps from the Schr\"odinger to the Heisenberg picture. While the two pictures are equivalent at the level of physical predictions, we show that the divisibility properties of the corresponding dual maps are, in general, not equivalent. This inequivalence originates from the distinction between left and right generators of time-local master equations, which interchange roles under duality. We demonstrate that Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg divisibility are distinct concepts by constructing explicit dynamics divisible only in one picture. Furthermore, we introduce a quantifier for the violation of Heisenberg P-divisibility, analogous to the trace-distance-based measure of non-Markovianity, and provide it with an operational interpretation in terms of the guessing probability between effects. Our results show that Heisenberg divisibility is an independent witness of memory effects and highlight the need to consider both pictures when characterizing non-Markovian quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Probing Kirkwood-Dirac nonpositivity and its operational implications via moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) distribution has recently emerged as a powerful quasiprobability framework with wide-ranging applications in quantum information processing tasks. In this work, we introduce an experimentally motivated criterion for detecting nonclassical signatures of the KD distribution using its statistical moments and demonstrate its effectiveness through explicit examples. We further show that this approach extends naturally to identifying other quantum resources, such as quantum coherence and nonclassical extractable work -- that are intrinsically connected to the KD distribution. Our criteria involves the evaluation of simple functionals, making it well-suited for efficient experimental implementation.</description>

      <title>Network nonlocality with continuous variables: probing nonbilocality through pseudospin measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks offer a compelling platform for probing nonlocal correlations beyond the Bell scenario. While network nonlocality has been well studied in discrete-variable (DV) systems, its exploration in continuous-variable (CV) systems remains limited. In this work, we study the bilocal scenario, the simplest quantum network, in a CV framework using pseudospin measurements. We show that two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) states violate the bilocality inequality for any nonzero squeezing, with the violation increasing monotonically and reaching the algebraic maximum in the infinite squeezing limit. The robustness of this violation is explored in the presence of local thermal noise. Next, we demonstrate nonbilocality in two key non-Gaussian states, viz., the entangled coherent state and the CV Werner state. Finally, we investigate the enhancement of nonbilocal correlations through photon subtraction applied to the TMSV state. We show that a coherent superposition of single-photon subtractions across modes enables maximal bilocality violation even at zero squeezing, demonstrating non-Gaussianity as a strong resource in the low-squeezing regime. Our findings underscore the potential of CV systems for realizing network-based quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Broadband and high-precision two-level system loss measurement using superconducting multi-wave resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-level systems (TLS) are known to be a dominant source of dissipation and decoherence in superconducting qubits. Superconducting resonators provide a convenient way to study TLS-induced loss due to easier design and fabrication in comparison to devices that include non-linear elements. However, accurately measuring TLS-induced loss in a resonator in the quantum regime is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the temporal fluctuations of the TLS, leading to uncertainties of 30% or more. To address these limitations, we develop a multi-wave resonator device that extends the resonator length from a standard quarter-wave $\lambda/4$ to $N\lambda/4$ where $N = 37$ at 6GHz. This design provides two key advantages: the TLS-induced fluctuations are reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$ due to spatial averaging over an increased number of independent TLS, and the measurement SNR for a given intra-resonator energy density improves by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$. The multi-wave resonator also has fundamental and harmonic resonances that allow one to study the frequency dependence of TLS-induced loss. In this work we fabricate both multi-wave and quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators formed from thin-film aluminum on a silicon substrate, and characterize their TLS properties at both 10mK and 200mK. Our results show that the power-dependent TLS-induced loss measured from both types of resonators agree well, with the multi-wave resonators achieving a five-fold reduction in measurement uncertainty due to TLS fluctuations, down to 5%. The $N\lambda/4$ resonator also provides a measure of the fully unsaturated TLS-induced loss due to the improved measurement SNR at low intra-resonator energy densities. Finally, measurements across seven harmonic resonances of the $N\lambda/4$ resonator between 4GHz - 6.5GHz reveals no frequency dependence in the TLS-induced loss over this range.</description>

      <title>How to Write a Simulator for Quantum Circuits from Scratch: A Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This tutorial guides a competent programmer through the crafting of a quantum circuit simulator from scratch, even for readers with almost no prior experience in quantum computing. Open source simulators for quantum circuits already exist, but a deeper understanding is gained by writing ones own. With roughly 1000-2000 lines of code, one can simulate Hadamard, Pauli X, Y, Z, SWAP, and other quantum logic gates, with arbitrary combinations of control and anticontrol qubits, on circuits of up to 20+ qubits, with no special libraries, on a personal computer. We explain key algorithms for a simulator, in particular: qubit-wise multiplication for updating the state vector, and partial trace for finding a reduced density matrix. We also discuss optimizations, and how to compute qubit phase, purity, and other statistics. A complete example implementation in JavaScript is available at https://github.com/MJMcGuffin/muqcs.js , which also demonstrates how to compute von Neumann entropy, concurrence (to quantify entanglement), and magic, while remaining much smaller and easier to study than other popular software packages.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resource Comparison for Two Leading Surface Code Lattice Surgery Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is one of the most promising candidates for the demonstration of quantum advantage within the next ten years, and several studies have proposed end-to-end resource estimates for executing such algorithms on fault-tolerant quantum processors. Usually, these resource estimates are based upon the assumption that quantum error correction is implemented using the surface code, and that the best surface code compilation scheme involves serializing input circuits by eliminating all Clifford gates. This transformation is thought to make best use of the native multi-body measurement (lattice surgery) instruction set available to surface codes. Some work, however, has suggested that direct compilation from Clifford+T to lattice surgery operations may be beneficial for circuits that have high degrees of logical parallelism. In this study, we analyze the resource costs for implementing Hamiltonian simulation using example approaches from each of these leading surface code compilation families. The Hamiltonians whose dynamics we consider are those of the transverse-field Ising model in several geometries, the Kitaev honeycomb model, and the $\mathrm{\alpha-RuCl_3}$ complex under a time-varying magnetic field. We show, among other things, that the optimal scheme depends on whether Hamiltonian simulation is implemented using the quantum signal processing or Trotter-Suzuki algorithms, with Trotterization benefiting by orders of magnitude from direct Clifford+T compilation for these applications. Our results suggest that surface code quantum computers should not have a one-size-fits-all compilation scheme, but that smart compilers should predict the optimal scheme based upon high-level quantities from logical circuits such as average circuit density, numbers of logical qubits, and T fraction.</description>

      <title>Quantum noise in a squeezed-light-enhanced multiparameter quantum sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum enhancement of sensitivity using squeezed light in a multi-parameter quantum sensor, the hybrid rf-dc optically pumped magnetometer (hOPM) [Phys. Rev. Applied 21, 034054, (2024)]. Using a single spin ensemble, the hOPM acquires both the dc field strength (scalar magnetometry), and resonantly detects one quadrature of the ac magnetic field at a chosen frequency (rf magnetometry). In contrast to the Bell-Bloom scalar magnetometer (BBOPM) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193601 (2021)], the back-action evasion in the hOPM is incomplete, leading to a complex interplay of the three quantum noise sources in this system: photon shot noise, spin projection noise, and measurement back-action noise. We observe these interactions using squeezed light as a tool to control the distribution of optical quantum noise between $S_2$ and $S_3$ polarization Stokes components, and the resulting effect on readout quantum noise and measurement back-action.</description>

      <title>Delayed Arrow-of-Time Detection in Signed Laplacian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how rapidly the direction of time becomes operationally detectable from mesoscopic data when state-weights may be positive or negative. In contrast with classical Markov processes -- where forward evolution is instantly distinguishable from its reverse -- signed dynamics can render the arrow of time undetectable during an initial interval. Assume the generator of the signed dynamics is a symmetric signed Laplacian (with a single linear invariant) and a phase-space Second Law holds in the form of non-decreasing R\'enyi-$2$ entropy. Drawing on recent results on eventual exponential positivity of signed Laplacians (Chen et al., 2021), we define a test that correctly identifies the direction of thermodynamic time if conducted over a time interval of length at least $\tau$. We go on to prove that the test cannot deliver an incorrect conclusion if conducted over a shorter interval. Dropping symmetry, we exhibit a no-signaling example where $\tau = +\infty$, so that the arrow of time remains permanently undetectable under our test. We comment briefly on quantum realizability of our framework.</description>

      <title>Photon-resolved Floquet theory approach to spectroscopic quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic methods play a vital role in quantum sensing, which uses the quantized nature of atoms or molecules to reach astonishing precision for sensing of, e.g., electric or magnetic fields. In the theoretical treatment, one typically invokes semiclassical methods to describe the light-matter interaction between quantum emitters, e.g., atoms or molecules, and a strong coherent laser field. However, these semiclassical approaches struggle to predict the stochastic measurement fluctuations beyond the mean value, necessary to predict the sensitivity of spectroscopic quantum sensing protocols. Here, we develop a theoretical framework based on the recently developed Photon-resolved Floquet theory (PRFT) which is capable to predict the measurement statistics describing higher order statistics of coherent quantum states of light. The PRFT constructs flow equations for the cumulants of the photonic measurement statistics utilizing only the semiclassical dynamics of the matter system. We apply the PRFT to spectroscopic quantum sensing using dissipative two-level and four-level systems (describing electric field sensing with Rydberg atoms), and demonstrate how to calculate the Fisher information of the measurement statistics with respect to various system parameters. In doing so, we demonstrate that the PRFT is a flexible tool allowing to improve the sensitivity of spectroscopic quantum sensing devices by several orders of magnitudes.</description>

      <title>Correcting a noisy quantum computer using a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers require error correction to achieve universal quantum computing. However, current decoding of quantum error-correcting codes relies on classical computation, which is slower than quantum operations in superconducting qubits. This discrepancy makes the practical implementation of real-time quantum error correction challenging. In this work, we propose a decoding scheme that leverages the operations of the quantum circuit itself. Given a noisy quantum circuit $A$, we train a decoding quantum circuit $B$ using syndrome measurements to identify the logical operators needed to correct errors in circuit $A$. The trained quantum circuit $B$ can be deployed on quantum devices, such as superconducting qubits, to perform real-time decoding and error correction. Our approach is applicable to general quantum codes with multiple logical qubits and operates efficiently under various noise conditions, and the decoding speed matches the speed of the quantum circuits being corrected. We have conducted numerical experiments using surface codes up to distance 7 under circuit-level noise, demonstrating performance on par with the classical minimum-weight perfect matching algorithm. Interestingly, our method reveals that the traditionally classical task of decoding error-correcting codes can be accomplished without classical devices or measurements. This insight paves the way for the development of self-correcting quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Matrix Product State on a Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving quantum many-body systems is one of the most significant regimes where quantum computing applies. Currently, as a hardware-friendly computational paradigms, variational algorithms are often used for finding the ground energy of quantum many-body systems. However, running large-scale variational algorithms is challenging, because of the noise as well as the obstacle of barren plateaus. In this work, we propose the quantum version of matrix product state (qMPS), and develop variational quantum algorithms to prepare it in canonical forms, allowing to run the variational MPS method, which is equivalent to the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method, on near term quantum devices. Compared with widely used methods such as variational quantum eigensolver, this method can greatly reduce the number of qubits used in local optimization, and thus mitigate the effects of barren plateaus while obtaining better accuracy. Our method holds promise for distributed quantum computing, offering possibilities for fusion of different computing systems.</description>

      <title>Systematic and Efficient Construction of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization Forms for High-order and Dense Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) can efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems whose objective functions are represented by Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations. For broader applicability of QA, quadratization methods are used to transform higher-order problems into QUBOs. However, quadratization methods for complex problems involving Machine Learning (ML) remain largely unknown. In these problems, strong nonlinearity and dense interactions prevent conventional methods from being applied. Therefore, we model target functions by the sum of rectified linear unit bases, which not only have the ability of universal approximation, but also have an equivalent quadratic-polynomial representation. In this study, the proof of concept is verified both numerically and analytically. In addition, by combining QA with the proposed quadratization, we design a new black-box optimization scheme, in which ML surrogate regressors are inputted to QA after the quadratization process.</description>

      <title>Universality of Photonic Interlacing Architectures for Learning Discrete Linear Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent investigations suggest that the discrete linear unitary group $U(N)$ can be represented by interlacing a finite sequence of diagonal phase operations with an intervening unitary operator. However, despite rigorous numerical justifications, no formal proof has been provided. Here, we show that elements of $U(N)$ can be decomposed into a sequence of $N$-parameter phases alternating with $1$-parameter propagators of a lattice Hamiltonian. The proof is based on building a Lie group by alternating these two operators and showing its completeness to represent $U(N)$ for a finite number of layers, which is numerically found to be exactly $N$. This architecture can be implemented using elementary optical components and can successfully reconstruct arbitrary unitary matrices. We propose example devices such as optical logic gates, which perform logic gate operations using a single-layer lossless and passive optical circuit design.</description>

      <title>The interplay of robustness and generalization in quantum machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While adversarial robustness and generalization have individually received substantial attention in the recent literature on quantum machine learning, their interplay is much less explored. In this chapter, we address this interplay for variational quantum models, which were recently proposed as function approximators in supervised learning. We discuss recent results quantifying both robustness and generalization via Lipschitz bounds, which explicitly depend on model parameters. Thus, they give rise to a regularization-based training approach for robust and generalizable quantum models, highlighting the importance of trainable data encoding strategies. The practical implications of the theoretical results are demonstrated with an application to time series analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave-particle duality, intertwining two inherently contradictory properties of quantum systems, remains one of the most conceptually profound aspects of quantum mechanics. By using the concept of energy capacity, the ability of a quantum system to store and extract energy, we derive a device-independent uncertainty relation for wave-particle duality. This relation is shown to be independent of both the representation space and the measurement basis of the quantum system. Furthermore, we experimentally validate this wave-particle duality relation using a photon-based platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A gradient-based optimization approach combined with automatic differentiation is employed to ensure high accuracy and scalability when working with high-dimensional parameter spaces. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method: the population is reliably transferred to the target state with minimal occupation of intermediate levels, while the control pulses remain smooth and physically implementable. The developed framework serves as a universal and experimentally applicable tool for automated control pulse design in quantum systems. It is particularly useful in scenarios where analytical methods or manual parameter tuning--such as standard schemes like STIRAP--prove to be inefficient or inapplicable.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between quasiparticle dissipation and quantum information decay in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagrammatic techniques simplify a weakly interacting many-body problem into an effective few-quasiparticle problem within a system of interest (SOI). If scattering events, mediated by a bath, between those quasiparticles can be approximated as density-density interactions, the bath behaves like an effective external potential. On the other hand, exchange interactions could entangle those quasiparticles and the bath, leading to an open quantum system that induces quantum decoherence and spectral broadening. We investigate the renormalized interaction between the SOI and the bath, employing a projection operator technique similar to the one used in the Nakajima-Zwanzig method. We find that the frequency variation of this renormalized interaction is analogous to the quasiparticle residue and provides a measure of the SOI-bath separability that serves as the lower bound of the SOI-bath entanglement entropy. In the weak-coupling regime and continuum limit, we demonstrate that the degree of SOI-bath separability corresponds to the quasiparticle spectral weight in the single-impurity Anderson model and find that the loss of quantum information to the continuum of the bath can be understood as a decay process where an initial single-impurity state escapes to a thermal bath. This work provides a direction for connecting energy dissipation in quasiparticles propagation to the loss of quantum information in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Insightful Approach to Quantum Noise Suppression Below the Standard Quantum Limit Using a Single Mirror and Beam Splittert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a coherent electromagnetic wave passes through a 50:50 beam splitter (BS), it is divided equally into two parts. However, the quantum noise associated with the resulting coherent states, despite being reduced in amplitude by half, remains fundamentally constrained by the quantum noise limit, independent of the intensity. By placing a mirror at the unused input port of the BS, a standing wave is formed in the vicinity of the mirror, which influences the vacuum fluctuations of the coherent state at the BS output. Using semi-classical and quantum mechanical approaches, we calculate the vacuum fluctuations induced by the mirror and demonstrate that the vacuum noise originating from the mirror side periodically reaches zero at the BS output. Leveraging this effect, we show that the vacuum fluctuations of the light split by the BS can be readily reduced below the quantum noise limit. Furthermore, through feedback mechanisms, the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field at the other output port can also be suppressed below the quantum noise limit. These findings provide a pivotal insight into the manipulation of electromagnetic noise, with broad implications for all experiments involving quantum noise control.</description>

      <title>A Refined Algorithm For the EPR model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen~(EPR) model is an analogous model of the anti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg model or the equivalent quantum maximum-cut problem, proposed by R. King two years ago. Adjacent qubits in the model prefer symmetric EPR/Bell parings rather than the antisymmetric one, in order to maximize the energy. Recently, two groups independently develop specific algorithms for the highest-energy state with approximation ratio $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{4}\approx.809$, based on maximum fractional matchings. Here we try to refine one of the two algorithms by devising homogeneous/quasi-homogeneous fractional matchings, with the aim to distribute quantum entanglement as much as possible. For regular graphs $G_d$, we immediately obtain increasing approximation ratios $r_d$ with $r_2=\frac{3+\sqrt{5}}{6}\approx.872$. For irregular graphs, we show such a refinement could still guarantee nice performance if the fractional matchings are chosen properly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian edge burst is a phenomenon observed in non-Hermitian quantum dynamics, characterized by a significant accumulation of loss at the boundaries of a system. We present an example of the edge burst effect in a lossy lattice with bipolar non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). By introducing a weak coupling between two such non-Hermitian lattices, we demonstrate that the system exhibits bipolar scale-free localization. Through an analysis of local decay distributions and their sensitivity to system parameters, we confirm the occurrence of the edge burst effect in the system displaying scale-free localization. Our findings support the notion that the skin effect is not a necessary condition for the edge burst effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an entanglement protocol where ions illuminated by optical tweezers serve as control qubits. We experimentally demonstrate this proposal with a controlled M$\o$lmer-S$\o$rensen operation on a three-ion chain, analogous to the canonical Toffoli gate. Our demonstration features cases in which the control qubit was in one of its logical basis states, and not in their superposition, due to dephasing by tweezer beam intensity fluctuations. Finally, we discuss how our protocol generalizes to a broad class of unitary operations and larger qubit systems, enabling a single-pulse implementation of $n$-controlled unitaries.</description>

      <title>Robust Spin Polarization by Adiabatic Dynamical Decoupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity multi-qubit initialization is vital for quantum simulation, quantum information processing (QIP), and quantum sensing. In diamond platforms, nuclear spin registers can be initialized through polarization transfer from a nearby electronic spin whose high gyromagnetic ratio enables efficient dynamical nuclear polarization (DNP). These hybrid systems are typically controlled using diabatic spin rotations, which require precise knowledge of all system parameters. Adiabatic DNP protocols on the other hand have less strict requirements and could enable robust and high fidelity spin transfer. However, due to the slow adiabatic sweeps and limited electron spin coherence times, this approach has remained inaccessible. Here, we demonstrate adiabatic pulsed nuclear spin polarization at room temperature in diamond. We achieve enhanced polarization efficiency, a broad resonance window, and improved tolerance to hyperfine coupling uncertainties relative to conventional diabatic pulsed protocols. We also show how this approach can benefit the initialization of spin clusters. These results set the scene for enhanced qubit initialization in solid state through adiabatic pulsed driving, with applications in solid-state quantum sensor and quantum memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Adaptive quantum dynamics with the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation. This adaptive tVMC approach addresses numerical instabilities that arise when the variational ansatz is overparameterized or contains redundant degrees of freedom. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\"atze.</description>

      <title>Solving excited states for long-range interacting trapped ions with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of excited states in strongly interacting quantum many-body systems is of fundamental importance. Yet, it is notoriously challenging due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the system size. Here, we introduce a neural network-based algorithm that can simultaneously output multiple low-lying excited states of a quantum many-body spin system in an accurate and efficient fashion. This algorithm, dubbed the neural quantum excited-state (NQES) algorithm, requires no explicit orthogonalization of the states and is generally applicable to higher dimensions. We demonstrate, through concrete examples including the Haldane-Shastry model with all-to-all interactions, that the NQES algorithm is capable of efficiently computing multiple excited states and their related observable expectations. In addition, we apply the NQES algorithm to two classes of long-range interacting trapped-ion systems in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. For non-decaying all-to-all interactions with alternating signs, our computed low-lying excited states bear spatial correlation patterns similar to those of the ground states, which closely match recent experimental observations that the quasi-adiabatically prepared state accurately reproduces analytical ground-state correlations. For a system of up to 300 ions with power-law decaying antiferromagnetic interactions, we successfully uncover its gap scaling and correlation features. Our results establish a scalable and efficient algorithm for computing excited states of interacting quantum many-body systems, which holds potential applications ranging from benchmarking quantum devices to photoisomerization.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resource Assay for the Grid-Based Simulation of the Photodynamics of Pyrazine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish and analyse the performance and resource requirements of an end-to-end fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for computing the absorption spectrum and population dynamics of photoexcited pyrazine. The quantum circuit construction consists of initial state preparation using uniformly controlled rotations, the time-dependent Hamiltonian propagation based on the grid-based Split Operator Quantum Fourier Transform (SO-QFT) method, and cost-effective measurements including statistical and canonical phase estimation. We use classical emulations to validate the quantum resources required for the task, and propose generalised formulae for the qubit count and gate depth calculation. Simulating the vibronic dynamics of pyrazine in a low-dimensional abstraction requires 17-qubit circuits with a gate depth of $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$, whereas a full-dimensional simulation of pyrazine in 24 modes requires at least 97-qubit circuits with a gate depth of $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$. Our work provides a foundational framework for understanding high-dimensional wavepacket-based quantum simulations of photo-induced dynamics and vibronic spectra, anticipating future applications in the simulation of even larger molecular systems on fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We Trotterize the mean-field dynamics of the integrable BCS model using symplectic integrators. The resulting chaotic dynamics is characterized by its Lyapunov spectrum and rescaled Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. The chaos quantifiers depend on the Trotterization time step $\tau$. We observe a Trotter transition at a finite step value $\tau_c \approx \sqrt{N}$. While the dynamics is weakly chaotic for time steps $\tau \ll \tau_c$, the regime of large Trotterization steps is characterized by short temporal correlations. We derive two different scaling laws for the two different regimes by numerically fitting the maximum Lyapunov exponent data. The scaling law of the large $\tau$ limit agrees well with the one derived from the kicked top map. Beyond its relevance to current quantum computers, our work opens new directions -- such as probing observables like the Loschmidt echo, which lie beyond standard mean-field description -- across the Trotter transition we uncover.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finite speed of light of pulses implies propagation delays between the generation of light, the interaction with different elements along its path and the final detection at the output of networks and interferometers. We show that it is possible to take these delays into account with a theoretical method which evades quantization of the full continuum of field modes. We illustrate the use of this method by analyzing Ramsey excitation of an atom by a split and delayed quantum pulse.</description>

      <title>Observation of Power Superbroadening of Spectral Line Profiles on IBM Quantum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power broadening refers to the widening of the spectral line profile in a two-state quantum transition as the strength of the driving field increases. This phenomenon commonly arises in continuous-wave driving when the radiation field's intensity exceeds the transition's saturation intensity and it has been extensively studied in spectroscopy. For pulsed-field excitation, the spectral response of the quantum system may differ significantly: while a rectangular-shaped pulse leads to a linear power broadening, pulses with smooth shapes show significantly reduced power broadening, for instance, logarithmic for the Gaussian shape and none for the hyperbolic-secant shape. Recently [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{132}, 020802 (2024)], in a dramatic paradigm shift, we have demonstrated experimentally that for Lorentzian-shaped pulses, the opposite effect -- power narrowing -- takes place: the width of the spectral profile decreases when the driving pulse amplitude increases, with a narrowing factor of as much as 10 observed.
  While in high-resolution spectroscopy the push is for eliminating or even inverting the power broadening, there are applications where it is used to an advantage for it facilitates off-resonance excitation. Here, we present a number of shaped pulses that exhibit power broadening much greater than that of the rectangular pulse of the same pulse area. They are grouped in two families of pulse shapes. In particular, in regard to the width of the second Rabi oscillation maximum, the quadratic pulse family shows an increase by a factor of 3.3 whereas the even-exponent pulse family exhibits an increase by a factor of more than 3.5.</description>

      <title>Superposed Parameterised Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning has shown promise for high-dimensional data analysis, yet many existing approaches rely on linear unitary operations and shared trainable parameters across outputs. These constraints limit expressivity and scalability relative to the multi-layered, non-linear architectures of classical deep networks. We introduce superposed parameterised quantum circuits to overcome these limitations. By combining flip-flop quantum random-access memory with repeat-until-success protocols, a superposed parameterised quantum circuit embeds an exponential number of parameterised sub-models in a single circuit and induces polynomial activation functions through amplitude transformations and post-selection. We provide an analytic description of the architecture, showing how multiple parameter sets are trained in parallel while non-linear amplitude transformations broaden representational power beyond conventional quantum kernels. Numerical experiments underscore these advantages: on a 1D step-function regression a two-qubit superposed parameterised quantum circuit cuts the mean-squared error by three orders of magnitude versus a parameter-matched variational baseline; on a 2D star-shaped two-dimensional classification task, introducing a quadratic activation lifts accuracy to 81.4% and reduces run-to-run variance three-fold. These results position superposed parameterised quantum circuits as a hardware-efficient route toward deeper, more versatile parameterised quantum circuits capable of learning complex decision boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuit simulation is crucial for quantum computing such as validating quantum algorithms. We present Qymera, a system that repurposes relational database management systems (RDBMSs) for simulation by translating circuits into SQL queries, allowing quantum operations to run natively within an RDBMS. Qymera supports a wide range of quantum circuits, offering a graphical circuit builder and code-based interfaces to input circuits. With a benchmarking framework, Qymera facilitates comparison of RDBMS-based simulation against state-of-the-art simulation methods. Our demonstration showcases Qymera's end-to-end SQL-based execution, seamless integration with classical workflows, and its utility for development, benchmarking, and education in quantum computing and data management.</description>

      <title>Designing toroidal cavities for quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toroidal microwave cavities are investigated for potential use in quantum information storage and computation. Since exact analytical results are not available for this geometry, extensive numerical simulation has been used to develop a universal phenomenological model ("spectral flow diagram"). This model is needed to guide the non-trivial design of toroidal resonators. A host of new modes that do not exist in cylindrical cavities are classified, including novel counter-intuitive ground states, and "dark nodal modes" that are decoupled from the environment in the absence of antennae. Numerical results are found to be in good agreement with experimental data. The existence of dark nodal modes in a shallow smooth cavity geometry that offers easy access for high quality surface treatment, suggests that high-Q toroidal cavities may be exploited for long-term storage of quantum information used in quantum processors.</description>

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) for Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the predominant AI technology to date. An important perspective for Quantum Computing (QC) is the question whether QC has the potential to reduce the vast resource requirements for training and operating GenAI models. While large-scale generative NLP tasks are currently out of reach for practical quantum computers, the generation of short semantic structures such as passwords is not. Generating passwords that mimic real user behavior has many applications, for example to test an authentication system against realistic threat models. Classical password generation via deep learning have recently been investigated with significant progress in their ability to generate novel, realistic password candidates. In the present work we investigate the utility of adiabatic quantum computers for this task. More precisely, we study different encodings of token strings and propose novel approaches based on the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and the Unit-Disk Maximum Independent Set (UD-MIS) problems. Our approach allows us to estimate the token distribution from data and adiabatically prepare a quantum state from which we eventually sample the generated passwords via measurements. Our results show that relatively small samples of 128 passwords, generated on the QuEra Aquila 256-qubit neutral atom quantum computer, contain human-like passwords such as "Tunas200992" or "teedem28iglove".</description>

      <title>Superactivation of Bell nonlocality in pure anyonic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard quantum information theory is founded on the assumption that multi-party state space possesses a tensor product structure. Anyons, as quasiparticles in two-dimensional systems, exhibit unique entanglement properties that differ from the conventional quantum systems, resulting from the absence of a tensor product structure in their state spaces. This motivates us to investigate the relationship between Bell nonlocality and entanglement in anyonic states. Specifically, we find that certain pure anyonic states with non-zero anyonic entanglement entropy (AEE) are local, yet exhibit nonlocality when subjected to collective measurements on multiple copies--a phenomenon known as superactivation of nonlocality, which is typically observed in conventional mixed states. To analyze this, we decompose the total entanglement of anyonic states into two components: one from the tensor product structure and the other representing residual contributions. By studying their asymptotic behavior, we find that the former gradually increases and approaches the AEE while the latter diminishes with the number of copies. Crucially, the entanglement component associated with the tensor product structure demonstrates a significant correlation with nonlocality, which explains the observed superactivation of nonlocality. Our findings provide new insights into the connection between entanglement and nonlocality in anyonic systems.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Heterodyne Receiver for Quantum Information Processing in a Laser Written Integrated Photonic Platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CV-QKD) and Quantum Random Number Generation (CV-QRNG) are critical technologies for secure communication and high-speed randomness generation, exploiting shot-noise-limited coherent detection for their operation. Integrated photonic solutions are key to advancing these protocols, as they enable compact, scalable, and efficient system implementations. In this work, we introduce Femtosecond Laser Micromachining (FLM) on borosilicate glass as a novel platform for producing Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) realizing coherent detection suitable for quantum information processing. We exploit the specific features of FLM to produce a PIC designed for CV-QKD and CV-QRNG applications. The PIC features fully adjustable optical components that achieve precise calibration and reliable operation under protocol-defined conditions. The device exhibits low insertion losses ($\leq 1.28$ dB), polarization-insensitive operation, and a Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) exceeding 73 dB. These characteristics allowed the experimental realization of a source-device-independent CV-QRNG with a secure generation rate of 42.74 Gbps and a QPSK-based CV-QKD system achieving a secret key rate of 3.2 Mbit/s. Our results highlight the potential of FLM technology as an integrated photonic platform, paving the way for scalable and high-performing quantum communication systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have constructed and run a Bell test of local realism focusing on the objectivity criterion. The objectivity means that the outcomes are confirmed macroscopically by a few observers at each of party. The IBM Quantum devices turn out to be sufficiently accurate to pass such an extended Bell-type test, although at the price of communication loopholes and residual but statistically significant signaling. The test serves also as the benchmark of entanglement spread across larger sets of qubits.</description>

      <title>Scaling Portfolio Diversification with Quantum Circuit Cutting Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (QAOA) have demonstrated a strong potential in addressing graph-based optimization problems. However, the execution of large-scale quantum circuits remains constrained by the limitations of current quantum hardware. In this work, we introduce QuantCut, an automatic framework for circuit cutting that enables efficient execution of large quantum circuits by decomposing entangling two-qubit gates into manageable sub-circuits. Specifically, we focus on gate-cutting techniques. We apply QuantCut to a 71-qubit QAOA circuit ansatz for portfolio diversification in the S&amp;P 500 stock market, aiming to maximize asset diversification. Our approach iteratively optimizes the expectation value while leveraging circuit-cutting strategies to reduce the qubit register size. To validate our framework, we first conduct experiments on a toy model using quantum noise simulations for the Max-Cut problem, analyzing performance improvements with an increasing number of layers. Subsequently, we extend our methodology to a real-world financial optimization scenario, showing competitive results. The results suggest that QuantCut effectively facilitates large-scale quantum computations with circuit-cutting technologies.</description>

      <title>A Sagnac-based arbitrary time-bin state encoder for quantum communication applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-bin encoding of quantum information is highly advantageous for long-distance quantum communication protocols over optical fibres due to its inherent robustness in the channel and the possibility of generating high-dimensional quantum states. The most common implementation of time-bin quantum states using unbalanced interferometers presents challenges in terms of stability and flexibility of operation. In particular, a limited number of states can be generated without modifying the optical scheme. Here we present the implementation of a fully controllable arbitrary time-bin quantum state encoder, which is easily scalable to arbitrary dimensions and time-bin widths. The encoder presents high stability and low quantum bit error rate QBER, even at high speeds of operation. Additionally, we demonstrate phase randomization and phase encoding without additional resources.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Superconducting Three-Qubit Gates for Surface-Code Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is one of the crucial building blocks for developing quantum computers that have significant potential for reaching a quantum advantage in applications. Prominent candidates for QEC are stabilizer codes for which periodic readout of stabilizer operators is typically implemented via successive two-qubit entangling gates, and is repeated many times during a computation. To improve QEC performance, it is thus beneficial to make the stabilizer readout faster and less prone to fault-tolerance-breaking errors. Here we design a 3-qubit CZZ gate for superconducting transmon qubits that maps the parity of two data qubits onto one measurement qubit in a single step. We find that the gate can be executed in a duration of $35\,$ns with a fidelity of F$=99.96 \, \%$. To optimize the gate, we use an error model obtained from the microscopic gate simulation to systematically suppress Pauli errors that are particularly harmful to the QEC protocol. Using this error model, we investigate the implementation of this 3-qubit gate in a surface code syndrome readout schedule. We find that for the rotated surface code, the implementation of CZZ gates increases the error threshold by nearly 50\% to $\approx 1.2\,\%$ and decreases the logical error rate, in the experimental relevant regime, by up to one order of magnitude, compared to the standard CZ readout protocol. We also show that for the unrotated surface code, strictly fault-tolerant readout schedules can be found. This opens a new perspective for below-threshold surface-code error correction, where it can be advantageous to use multi-qubit gates instead of two-qubit gates to obtain a better QEC performance.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Stabilizer Measurements in Surface Codes with Three-Qubit Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is considered a deciding component in enabling practical quantum computing. Stabilizer codes, and in particular topological surface codes, are promising candidates for implementing QEC by redundantly encoding quantum information. While it is widely believed that a strictly fault-tolerant protocol can only be implemented using single- and two-qubit gates, several quantum computing platforms, based on trapped ions, neutral atoms and also superconducting qubits support native multi-qubit operations, e.g. using multi-ion entangling gates, Rydberg blockade or parallelized tunable couplers, respectively. In this work, we show that stabilizer measurement circuits for unrotated surface codes can be fault-tolerant using single auxiliary qubits and three-qubit gates. These gates enable lower-depth circuits leading to fewer fault locations and potentially shorter QEC cycle times. Concretely, we find that in an optimistic parameter regime where fidelities of three-qubit gates are the same as those of two-qubit gates, the logical error rate can be up to one order of magnitude lower and the threshold can be significantly higher, increasing from $\approx 0.76 \%$ to $\approx 1.05 \%$. Our results, which are applicable to a wide range of platforms, thereby motivate further investigation into multi-qubit gates as components for fault-tolerant QEC, as they can lead to substantial advantages in terms of time and physical qubit resources required to reach a target logical error rate.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Sparse SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the ground state of strongly-interacting fermionic systems is often the prerequisite for fully understanding both quantum chemistry and condensed matter systems. The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model is a representative example of such a system; it is particularly interesting not only due to the existence of efficient quantum algorithms preparing approximations to the ground state such as Hastings--O'Donnell (STOC 2022), but also known no-go results for many classical ansatzes in preparing low-energy states. However, this quantum-classical separation is known to \emph{not} persist when the SYK model is sufficiently sparsified, i.e., when terms in the model are discarded with probability $1-p$, where $p=\Theta(1/n^3)$ and $n$ is the system size. This raises the question of how robust the quantum and classical complexities of the SYK model are to sparsification.
  In this work we initiate the study of the sparse SYK model where $p \in [\Theta(1/n^3),1]$. We show there indeed exists a certain robustness of sparsification. First, we prove that the quantum algorithm of Hastings--O'Donnell for $p=1$ still achieves a constant-factor approximation to the ground energy when $p\geq\Omega(\log n/n)$. Additionally, we prove that with high probability, Gaussian states cannot achieve better than a $O(\sqrt{\log n/pn})$-factor approximation to the true ground state energy of sparse SYK. This is done through a general classical circuit complexity lower-bound of $\Omega(pn^3)$ for any quantum state achieving a constant-factor approximation. Combined, these show a provable separation between classical algorithms outputting Gaussian states and efficient quantum algorithms for the goal of finding approximate sparse SYK ground states when $p \geq \Omega(\log n/n)$, extending the analogous $p=1$ result of Hastings--O'Donnell.</description>

      <title>Altermagnet-Superconductor Heterostructure: a Scalable Platform for Braiding of Majorana Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum computation, featuring qubits built out of anyonic excitations known as Majorana zero modes (MZMs), have long presented an exciting pathway towards scalable quantum computation. Recently, the advent of altermagnetic materials has presented a new pathway towards localized MZMs on the boundary of two-dimensional materials, consisting of an altermagnetic film, subject to a superconducting proximity effect from a superconducting substrate. In this work, we demonstrate the possibility for an altermagnet-superconductor heterostructure, to not only harbor MZMs, but also freely manipulate their position along the topological boundary of the material, via rotation of the N\'eel vector. Using this mechanism, on a square platform, we utilize a time-dependent method to simulate the Z-gate via braiding, and then extend this to a larger H-junction, where we implement the $\sqrt{X}$ and $\sqrt{Z}$ gate on a single-qubit system. Further, this structure is eminently scalable to many-qubit systems, thus providing the essential ingredients towards universal quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: Exploring strongly correlated spinful states of few fermionic ultracold atoms in a rapidly rotating trap, an example of which was recently realized for two fermionic $^6$Li atoms in an optical tweezer, we derive analytical (algebraic) total-spin-eigenstate wavefunctions through the development and employment of a theoretical platform that integrates exact numerical diagonalization (full configuration interaction, FCI) with symbolic language processing. For such rapid rotations, where the atoms occupy the lowest Landau level (LLL), the obtained algebraic expressions can address the full LLL spectrum in all its complexity, demonstrating that their spatial, spectral, and spin characteristics manifest formation of collectively rotating and vibrating Wigner molecules. The explicitly exhibited analytic wavefunctions (for two and three spinful $^6$Li atoms) reproduce precisely the corresponding numerical FCI results, and they are shown to reach beyond the limited range of applicability of previous Jastrow-type treatments. These results, and their extension to bosonic systems, provide the impetus and analysis tools for future experimental and theoretical simulations of larger mesoscopic systems</description>

      <title>Pilot-waves and copilot-particles: A novel approach to objective collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension of Schr\"odinger's equation that incorporates the macroscopic measurement-induced wavefunction collapse phenomenon. Our approach relies on a hybrid between Bohm-de Broglie pilot-wave and objective collapse theories. The Bohmian particle is guided by the wavefunction and, conversely, the wavefunction gradually localizes towards the particle's position. As long as the particle can visit any state, as in a typical microscopic system, the localization effect does not favor any particular quantum state and, on average, the usual Schr\"odinger-like time evolution results. However, when the wavefunction develops spatially well-separated lobes, as would happen during a macroscopic measurement, the Bohmian particle can remain trapped in one lobe, and the wavefunction eventually localizes there. The end result, in macroscopic systems, is a wavefunction collapse that is consistent with Born's rule. We illustrate the theory with a simple double-slit experiment simulation.</description>

      <title>Recovering Exact Vibrational Energies Within a Phase Space Electronic Structure Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a push to go beyond Born-Oppenheimer theory and build electronic states from a phase space perspective, i.e. parameterize electronic states by both nuclear position(R) and nuclear momentum(P). Previous empirical studies have demonstrated that such approaches can yield improved single-surface observables, including vibrational energies, electronic momenta, and vibrational circular dichroism spectra. That being said, unlike the case of BO theory, there is no unique phase space electronic Hamiltonian, nor any theory for using phase space eigenvectors (as opposed to BO eigenvectors) so as to recover exact quantum vibrational eigenvalues. As such, one might consider such phase space approaches ad hoc. To that end, here we show how to formally extract exact quantum energies from a coupled nuclear-electronic Hamiltonian using perturbation theory on top of a phase space electronic framework. Thus, while we cannot isolate an "optimal" phase space electronic Hamiltonian, this work does justify a phase space electronic structure approach by offering a rigorous framework for correcting the zeroth order phase space electronic states.</description>

      <title>A non-local exchange potential for electronic structure calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we describe a model for the exchange interaction of electrons, as it follows from the Pauli exclusion principle. Starting from Hartree-Fock theory and making use of the free electron-gas model we propose a simple scheme to calculate the exchange-potential for atoms as well as simple molecules and solids. This method assures the correct asymptotic long-range behavior of the potential, contrary to local-density approximations that rely on a strongly simplified generalization of the well-known Kohn-Sham or Slater exchange interaction. Furthermore, our results approach the Kohn-Sham results in the interstitial space of solids. As a benchmark test, total energies and eigenenergies for atoms from He to Xe computed within our model are compared to other calculations as well as to experimental data.</description>

      <title>Rogue waves collision under incident momentum modulation in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collision dynamics of two first-order rogue waves (RWs) with opposite incident momentum in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) is studied by solving the two-component one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. It is demonstrated that the introduction of appropriate incident momentum successfully promotes the generation of second-order RWs in the case of relatively weaker interspecies interactions compared to intraspecific interactions. The range of incident momentum that can facilitate the generation of second-order RWs under different interspecies interaction strengths is determined, and machine learning is employed to find and analyze relationships among the interspecies interaction, the incident momentum, and the offset that can lead to the generation of second-order RWs. It shows that any two parameters above exhibit a positive or negative correlation when the third parameter is fixed. These findings provide additional possibilities for generating and controlling high-order RWs.</description>

      <title>Topological Invariants in Nonlinear Thouless Pumping of Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent explorations of quantized solitons transport in optical waveguides have thrust nonlinear topological pumping into the spotlight. In this work, we introduce a unified topological invariant applicable across both weakly and strongly nonlinear regimes. In the weak nonlinearity regime, where the nonlinear bands are wellseparated, the invariant reduces to the Abelian Chern number of the occupied nonlinear band. Consequently, the pumped charge is quantized to an integer value. As the nonlinearity increases, the nonlinear bands start to intertwine, leading to a situation where the invariant is expressed as the non-Abelian Chern number divided by the number of interacting bands. This could result in a fractional quantization of the pumped charge. Our unified topological invariant approach not only advances the understanding of the soliton dynamics, but also provides implications for the future design of nonlinear topological systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, the non-Hermitian scattering of gravitational waves is examined, and their behavior at spectral singularities is discussed. We investigate the non-Hermitian properties of gravitational waves through the construction of a transfer matrix. By examining spectral singularity points obtained from the transfer matrix, we explore the behavior of gravitational waves at these spectral singularity points and compare the theoretical results with observed measurements. Our findings demonstrate that the frequency values of gravitational waves measured on Earth at spectral singularity points exhibit perfect agreement with the corresponding Hubble constant values. This alignment underscores the significance of the non-Hermitian characteristics of gravitational waves. We anticipate that this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of non-Hermitian phenomena in gravitational physics and provide a foundation for future studies in the field.</description>

Abstract: A conditional diffusion model has been developed to analyze intricate conductance fluctuations called universal conductance fluctuations or quantum fingerprints appearing in quantum transport phenomena. The model reconstructs impurity arrangements and quantum interference patterns in nanometals by using magnetoconductance data, providing a novel approach to analyze complex data based on machine learning. In addition, we visualize the attention weights in the model, which efficiently extract information on the non-local correlation of the electron wave functions, and the score functions, which represent the force fields in the wave-function space.</description>

      <title>Reed-Muller Codes for Quantum Pauli and Multiple Access Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reed-Muller (RM) codes have undergone significant analytical advancements over the past decade, particularly for binary memoryless symmetric (BMS) channels. We extend the scope of RM codes development and analysis to multiple-access channels (MACs) and quantum Pauli channels, leveraging a unified approach. Specifically, we first derive the achievable rate region for RM codes on so-called Q-MACs, a class of MACs with additive correlated noise. This is achieved via a generalization of the bending and boosting arguments defined in arXiv:2304.02509. We then put forward a connection between the rate region of these QMACs and quantum RM codes designed for Pauli noise channels. This connection highlights a universality property of quantum RM codes, demonstrating their rate-optimal performance across a range of channel parameters, rather than for a single Pauli channel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-particle dynamics in interacting systems in the presence of disorder challenges the notion of internal thermalization, but proves difficult to investigate theoretically for large particle numbers. Engineered quantum systems may offer a viable alternative, as witnessed in experimental demonstrations in a variety of physical platforms, each with its own capabilities and limitations. Semiconductor gate-defined quantum dot arrays are of particular interest since they offer both a direct mapping of their Hamiltonian to Fermi-Hubbard and Heisenberg models and the in-situ tunability of (magnetic) interactions and onsite potentials. In this work, we use an array of germanium quantum dots to simulate the dynamics of both single-spin excitations (magnons) and two-spin excitations (triplons). We develop a methodology that combines digital spin qubit operations for state preparation and readout with analog evolution under the full system Hamiltonian. Using these techniques, we can reconstruct quantum walk plots for both magnons and triplons, and for various configurations of Heisenberg exchange couplings. We furthermore explore the effect of single-site disorder and its impact on the propagation of spin excitations. The obtained results can provide a basis for simulating disorder-based solid-state phenomena such as many-body localization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Krylov complexity in Lifshitz-type Dirac field theories with a generic dynamical critical exponent z. By computing the Lanczos coefficients for massless and massive cases, we analyze the growth and saturation behavior of K-complexity in different regimes. We incorporate a hard UV cutoff and investigate the effects of lattice discretization, revealing fundamental differences between continuum and lattice models. In the presence of a UV cutoff, Krylov complexity exhibits an initial exponential growth followed by a linear regime, with saturation values dictated by the cutoff scale. For the lattice model, we find a fundamental departure from the continuum case: due to the finite Krylov basis, Krylov complexity saturates rather than growing indefinitely. Our findings suggest that Lifshitz scaling influences operator growth and information spreading in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Mediated Gas-Liquid Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the gas-liquid transition in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, where the two Zeeman-shifted hyperfine spin components are coupled by cavity-assisted Raman processes. Below a critical Zeeman field, the cavity becomes superradiant for an infinitesimally small pumping strength, where the enhanced superradiance is facilitated by the simultaneous formation of quantum droplet, a self-bound liquid phase stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Above the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place after the system becomes superradiant at a finite pumping strength. As the back action of the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Suppression, Quantum Statistics and Symmetries in Spin-3/2 Baryon Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the interplay among entanglement suppression, quantum statistics and enhanced symmetries in the non-relativistic $S$-wave scattering involving the lowest-lying spin-3/2 baryons, which can be considered as four-dimensional qudits. These baryons form a ten-dimensional representation (decuplet) under the $\text{SU}(3)$ light-flavor symmetry and, in this limit, are considered indistinguishable under strong interactions. Treating the $S$-matrix in the spin-3/2 baryon-baryon scattering as a quantum logic gate in the spin space, we study the consequence of entanglement suppression and compute the entanglement power of the $S$-matrix. When the entanglement power vanishes, the $S$-matrix is either an Identity or a SWAP gate and spin-flavor symmetries and/or non-relativistic conformal invariance emerge, as previously observed in spin-1/2 baryons. In the case of scattering identical particles, the entanglement power never vanishes due to constraints from spin statistics, which we interpret as projection-valued measurements onto symmetric or antisymmetric Hilbert space and define the entanglement power accordingly. When the entanglement power is non-vanishing but sits at a global or local minimum, enhanced symmetries still emerge and the $S$-matrix can be interpreted as an Identity or a SWAP gate acting on the restricted Hilbert space allowed by quantum statistics. In general, when scattering identical spin-$s$ particles, we identify an enhanced $\text{SU}(2s+1)_{\text{spin}}$ symmetry for the Identity gate.</description>

      <title>Tuning the the fundamental periodicity of the current-phase relation in multiterminal diffusive Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional superconductor/insulator/superconductor (SIS) Josephson junctions, devices where two superconductors are separated by a tunnel barrier are technologically important as elements in quantum circuits, particularly with their key role in superconducting qubits. An important characteristic of Josephson junctions is the relation between the supercurrent Is and the phase difference {\phi} between them. For SIS junctions, the current-phase relation is sinusioidal and 2{\pi} periodic. Other types of Josephson junctions, where the material between the superconductors is a weak link or a normal metal (N) may have non-sinusoidal current-phase relations that are still 2{\pi} periodic. We show here that a multi-terminal diffusive SNS Josephson junction with 4 superconducting contacts can show a current phase relation between two of the contacts that is a superposition of 2{\pi} and 4{\pi} periodic components whose relative strength is controlled by the phase difference between the other two contacts, becoming 2{\pi} or 4{\pi} periodic for certain values of this phase difference. This tunability might have applications in tailoring the Hamiltonians of superconducting quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Isotope-agnostic motional ground-state cooling of neutral Yb atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient high-fidelity ground-state cooling of motional degrees of freedom is crucial for applications in quantum simulation, computing and metrology. Here, we demonstrate direct ground-state cooling of fermionic $^{171}$Yb and bosonic $^{174}$Yb atoms in two- and three-dimensional magic-wavelength optical lattices on the ultranarrow clock transition. Its high spectral resolution offers the potential for reaching extremely low temperatures. To ensure efficient cooling, we develop a chirped sideband cooling scheme, where we sweep the clock-laser frequency to mitigate the effects of spatial trap inhomogeneities. We further generalize the theoretical description of sideband spectra to higher-dimensional lattices for precise thermometry. We achieve 2D ground state fractions of $97\%$ for $^{171}$Yb with an average motional occupation of $\bar{n}\simeq0.015$ and provide a direct comparison with $^{174}$Yb, reaching similar cooling performance. Applying the same scheme in 3D results in $\bar{n}\simeq0.15$ limited by layer-to-layer inhomogeneities in the vertical direction. These results demonstrate efficient motional ground-state cooling in optical lattices, especially for bosonic alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, where other methods are not applicable, opening the door to novel protocols for quantum science applications with neutral atoms.</description>

It is known, however, that the achievable accuracy of measurements and unitary operations are generally limited by conservation laws according to the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem (WAY theorem) and its generalizations. Although many researches have extended the WAY theorem quantitatively, most of them, as well as the original WAY theorem, concern only additive conservation laws like the angular momentum conservation law. In this paper, we explore the limitation incurred by the energy conservation law, which is universal but is one of the non-additive conservation laws. We present a lower bound for the error of a quantum measurement using a scattering process satisfying the energy conservation law. We obtain conditions that a control system Hamiltonian must fulfill in order to implement a controlled unitary gate with zero error when a scattering process is considered. We also show the quantitative relationship between the upper bound of the gate fidelity of a controlled unitary gate and the energy fluctuation of systems when a target system and a control system are both one qubit.</description>

      <title>Low-crosstalk optical addressing system for atomic qubits based on multiple objectives and acousto-optic deflectors</title>

Abstract: Large-scale programmable trapped ion hardware, featuring high gate fidelity and long coherence times, is promising for realizing a practical fault-tolerant quantum computer (FTQC). However, individual addressing (IA) methods, which are important for implementing programmable gates in near-term quantum devices, can lead to undesired errors between the target ions and neighboring ions. In this work, we present a low-crosstalk optical addressing system based on multiple optical objectives and acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) with a symmetrical configuration. Two counter-propagating Raman operation beams are both tightly focused, generating an overlapping spot with a waist radius of approximately $1~\upmu\mathrm{m}$, to address the target ion. As a result, IA crosstalk, characterized by Rabi rate crosstalk on the spectator ion, is measured to be $1.19(5)\times10^{-3}$, with the two ions separated by approximately 5.5~$\upmu\mathrm{m}$. This low-crosstalk optical addressing system holds promise for high-fidelity entangling operations, and the symmetrically-configured AODs in our method can be readily extended to two dimensions to address a two-dimensional ion crystal.</description>

      <title>Chiral excitation flows of a multinode network based on synthetic gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral excitation flows have attracted significant attention due to their unique unidirectionality. Such flows have been studied in three-node networks with synthetic gauge fields (SGFs), but the general theory of chiral flows in multinode networks requires further research and development. In this work, we propose a scheme to achieve chiral flows in $n$-node networks, where an auxiliary node is introduced to govern the system. This auxiliary node is coupled to all the network nodes, forming subtriangle structures with interference paths in these networks. We find the implicit chiral symmetry behind the perfect chiral flow and propose the universal criteria that incorporate previous models, facilitating the implementation of chiral transmission in various networks. By investigating the symmetries within these models, we present different features of chiral flows in bosonic and spin networks. Furthermore, we extend the four-node model into a ladder network, which is promising for remote state transfer in practical systems with reduced complexity. Our scheme can be realized in state-of-the-art experimental systems, such as superconducting circuits, magnetic photonic lattices, and ultracold atoms, thereby opening up possibilities for future quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Architecture Search with Unsupervised Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11576v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning presents new opportunities for advancing Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. QAS is designed to optimize quantum circuits for Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs). Most QAS algorithms tightly couple the search space and search algorithm, typically requiring the evaluation of numerous quantum circuits, resulting in high computational costs and limiting scalability to larger quantum circuits. Predictor-based QAS algorithms mitigate this issue by estimating circuit performance based on structure or embedding. However, these methods often demand time-intensive labeling to optimize gate parameters across many circuits, which is crucial for training accurate predictors. Inspired by the classical neural architecture search algorithm Arch2vec, we investigate the potential of unsupervised representation learning for QAS without relying on predictors. Our framework decouples unsupervised architecture representation learning from the search process, enabling the learned representations to be applied across various downstream tasks. Additionally, it integrates an improved quantum circuit graph encoding scheme, addressing the limitations of existing representations and enhancing search efficiency. This predictor-free approach removes the need for large labeled datasets. During the search, we employ REINFORCE and Bayesian Optimization to explore the latent representation space and compare their performance against baseline methods. We further validate our approach by executing the best-discovered MaxCut circuits on IBM's ibm_sherbrooke quantum processor, confirming that the architectures retain optimal performance even under real hardware noise. Our results demonstrate that the framework efficiently identifies high-performing quantum circuits with fewer search iterations.</description>

      <title>Spectral invariance and maximality properties of the frequency spectrum of quantum neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) are a popular approach in Quantum Machine Learning.
  We analyze this frequency spectrum using the Minkowski sum for sets and the set of differences, which makes it particularly easy to express and calculate the frequency spectrum algebraically, and prove different maximality results for a large class of models.
  Furthermore, we prove that under some mild conditions there exists a bijection between classes of models with the same area $A:=R\cdot L$ that preserves the frequency spectrum, where $R$ denotes the number of qubits and $L$ the number of layers, which we consequently call spectral invariance under area-preserving transformations. With this we explain the symmetry in $R$ and $L$ in the results often observed in the literature and show that the maximal frequency spectrum depends only on the area $A=RL$ and not on the individual values of $R$ and $L$. Moreover, we collect and extend existing results and specify the maximum possible frequency spectrum of a QNN with arbitrarily many layers as a function of the spectrum of its generators. In the case of arbitrary dimensional generators, where our two introduces notions of maximality differ, we extend existing results based on the so-called Golomb ruler and introduce a second novel approach based on a variation of the turnpike problem, which we call the relaxed turnpike problem.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Min-Entropy Calculation Of Classical-Quantum States And Its Application To Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum Shannon theory, various kinds of quantum entropies are used to characterize the capacities of noisy physical systems. Among them, min-entropy and its smooth version attract wide interest especially in the field of quantum cryptography as they can be used to bound the information obtained by an adversary. However, calculating the exact value or non-trivial bounds of min-entropy are extremely difficult because the composite system dimension may scale exponentially with the dimension of its subsystem. Here, we develop a one-shot lower bound calculation technique for the min-entropy of a classical-quantum state that is applicable to both finite and infinite dimensional reduced quantum states. Moreover, we show our technique is of practical interest in at least three situations. First, it offers an alternative tight finite-data analysis for the BB84 quantum key distribution scheme. Second, it gives the best finite-key bound known to date for a variant of device independent quantum key distribution protocol. Third, it provides a security proof for a novel source-independent continuous-variable quantum random number generation protocol. These results show the effectiveness and wide applicability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Preparation via Free Binary Decision Diagram</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01671v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation (QSP) is a fundamental task in quantum computation to prepare a quantum state for a given classical description of the quantum state. The classical description of an $n$-qubit quantum state may have $\exp(O(n))$ parameters in general, which are inherently inefficient to prepare the corresponding state in the worst case. However, in many practical cases, we may be able to employ suitable data structures for QSP. An ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) and a free BDD (FBDD) are such data structures to represent the large-scale data in a compressed way. An efficient QSP for a subclass of OBDDs is known, but requires an $O(2^n)$-sized quantum circuit in general, while QSP based on FBDDs, which includes OBDDs as a special case, remains unexplored. We here construct a quantum algorithm for QSP when the classical description of a quantum state is given by an FBDD with weighted edges, and analyze the space, and time complexity of QSP in this setting. We provide a nontrivial example of an $n$-qubit state that can be represented by a weighted FBDD with $N=O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ nodes rather than $\mathrm{exp}(O(n))$. We show that any quantum state represented by the weighted FBDD with $N$ nodes can be prepared by an $O(N)$-sized quantum circuit using $N$ ancillary qubits, exponentially improving the required circuit size for QSP compared to other BDD-based QSPs. We also provide another example of an $n$-qubit state that can be represented by a weighted FBDD with $N=O(n^2)$ nodes, and $O(n^2)$ ancillary qubits, but cannot be prepared efficiently by a QSP based on the amplitude amplification. These results provide techniques to employ FBDDs as a tool for broadening the possibility of efficient QSP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the DODAG-X protocol for multipartite entanglement distribution in quantum networks. Leveraging the power of Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs), our protocol optimizes resource consumption and enhances robustness to noise in dynamic and lossy networks. Implementing a variation on the X-protocol within the DODAG, we minimize graph verification and path-finding calculations, significantly reducing computational overhead when compared to other entanglement routing schemes. Additionally, our benchmarks on grid lattice and small-world topologies reveal substantial measurement reduction compared to existing protocols. We demonstrate the success of DODAG-X for generating maximal three-party entanglement in arbitrary networks, and describe the potential for scaling to generic $n$-party entanglement. The DODAG-X protocol provides a scalable and efficient solution for entanglement routing, advancing current techniques for reliable quantum communication and network applications.</description>

      <title>Fighting Exponentially Small Gaps by Counterdiabatic Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the efficiency of approximate counterdiabatic driving (CD) in accelerating adiabatic passage through a first-order quantum phase transition. Specifically, we analyze a minimal spin-glass bottleneck model that is analytically tractable and exhibits both an exponentially small gap at the transition point and a change in the ground state that involves a macroscopic rearrangement of spins. Using the variational Floquet-Krylov expansion to construct CD terms, we find that while the formation of excitations is significantly suppressed, achieving fully adiabatic evolution remains challenging, necessitating high-order nonlocal terms in the expansion. Our results demonstrate that local CD strategies have limited effectiveness when crossing the extremely small gaps characteristic of NP-hard Ising problems. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative method, termed quantum brachistochrone counterdiabatic driving (QBCD), which significantly increases the fidelity to the target state over the expansion method by directly addressing the gap-closing point and the associated edge states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, variational quantum algorithms are promising approaches for solving optimization tasks by training parameterized quantum circuits with the aid of classical routines informed by quantum measurements. In this context, photonic platforms based on reconfigurable integrated optics are an ideal candidate for implementing these algorithms. Among various techniques to train variational circuits, the parameter shift rule enables the exact calculation of cost-function derivatives efficiently, facilitating gradient descent-based optimization. In this paper, we derive a formulation of the parameter shift rule for computing derivatives and integrals tailored to reconfigurable optical linear circuits and based on the Boson Sampling paradigm. This allows us to naturally embed common types of experimental noise, such as partial distinguishability and mixedness of the states, thus obtaining a resilient approach. Finally, we employ the developed approach to experimentally test variational algorithms with single-photon states processed in a reconfigurable 6-mode universal integrated interferometer. Specifically, we apply the photonic parameter shift rules to the variational implementation, on a photonic platform, of both an eigensolver and a Universal-Not gate.</description>

Abstract: We present the first computationally-efficient algorithm for average-case learning of shallow quantum circuits with many-qubit gates. Specifically, we provide a quasi-polynomial time and sample complexity algorithm for learning unknown QAC$^0$ circuits -- constant-depth circuits with arbitrary single-qubit gates and polynomially many $CZ$ gates of unbounded width -- with at most logarithmic ancilla, up to inverse-polynomially small error. Furthermore, we show that the learned unitary can be efficiently synthesized in poly-logarithmic depth. This work expands the family of efficiently learnable quantum circuits, notably since in finite-dimensional circuit geometries, QAC$^0$ circuits require polynomial depth to implement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noise remains one of the most significant challenges in the development of reliable and scalable quantum processors. While quantum error correction and mitigation techniques offer potential solutions, they are often limited by the substantial overhead required. To address this, tailored approaches that exploit specific hardware characteristics have emerged. In quantum computing architectures utilizing cat-qubits, the inherent exponential suppression of bit-flip errors can significantly reduce the qubit count needed for effective error correction. In this work, we explore how the unique noise bias of cat-qubits can be harnessed to enhance error mitigation efficiency. Specifically, we demonstrate that the sampling cost associated with probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) methods can be exponentially reduced with the depth of the circuit when gates act on cat-qubits and preserve the noise bias. Similar results also hold for Clifford circuits and Pauli channels. Our error mitigation scheme is benchmarked across various quantum machine learning circuits, showcasing its practical advantages for near-term applications on cat-qubit architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kirkwood-Dirac distribution, serving as an informationally complete representation of a quantum state, has recently garnered increasing attention. We investigate the Kirkwood-Dirac classicality with respect to mutually unbiased bases. For prime dimensional Hilbert spaces, {we demonstrate that a quantum state exhibits Kirkwood-Dirac classicality for two distinct sets of mutually unbiased bases $(A,B)$ and $(A,B')$ if and only if it is incoherent with respect to $A$}. We subsequently introduce a coherence monotone based on Kirkwood-Dirac nonclassicality with respect to mutually unbiased bases. Additionally, we establish that this coherence monotone can be expressed through weak values, suggesting that quantum coherence can be utilized to detect anomalous weak values.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant quantum computation with a neutral atom processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing experiments are transitioning from running on physical qubits to using encoded, logical qubits. Fault-tolerant computation can identify and correct errors, and has the potential to enable the dramatically reduced logical error rates required for valuable algorithms. However, it requires flexible control of high-fidelity operations performed on large numbers of qubits. We demonstrate fault-tolerant quantum computation on a quantum processor with 256 qubits, each an individual neutral Ytterbium atom. The operations are designed so that key error sources convert to atom loss, which can be detected by imaging. Full connectivity is enabled by atom movement. We demonstrate the entanglement of 24 logical qubits encoded into 48 atoms, at once catching errors and correcting for, on average 1.8, lost atoms. We also implement the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm with up to 28 logical qubits encoded into 112 atoms, showing better-than-physical error rates. In both cases, "erasure conversion," changing errors into a form that can be detected independently from qubit state, improves circuit performance. These results begin to clear a path for achieving scientific quantum advantage with a programmable neutral atom quantum processor.</description>

      <title>Measurement-free code-switching for low overhead quantum computation using permutation invariant codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transversal gates on quantum error correction codes have been a promising approach for fault-tolerant quantum computing, but are limited by the Eastin-Knill no-go theorem. Existing solutions like gate teleportation and magic state distillation are resource-intensive. We present a measurement-free code-switching protocol for universal quantum computation, switching between a stabiliser code for transversal Cliffords and a permutation-invariant code for transversal non-Cliffords that are logical $Z$ rotations for any rational multiple of $\pi$. The novel non-Clifford gates enabled by this code-switching protocol enable implementation of a universal gate set more efficient than the Clifford$+T$ gate set in terms of gate-count. To achieve this, we present a protocol for performing controlled-NOTs between the codes using near-term quantum control operations that employ a catalytic bosonic mode.</description>

      <title>Solving Constrained Optimization Problems Using Hybrid Qubit-Qumode Quantum Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) offer a promising approach for solving complex optimization problems on near-term quantum hardware. In this work, we show how hybrid qubit-qumode quantum devices can address Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems using the Echoed Conditional Displacement Variational Quantum Eigensolver (ECD-VQE). Leveraging circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architectures, we encode QUBO instances into multiple qumodes weakly coupled to a single qubit and extract solutions directly from photon-number measurements. As a demonstration, we apply ECD-VQE to the Binary Knapsack Problem and find that it outperforms the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) implemented on conventional qubit circuits. These results highlight the potential of ECD-VQE for a broad class of NP-hard problems. We conclude that hybrid qubit-qumode platforms can efficiently realize variational ECD ansatze that would otherwise require deep circuits on standard qubit-based quantum computers, positioning them as promising candidates for constrained optimization in early fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an enhanced sensitivity for detecting linear perturbations near hybrid (doubly degenerated) exceptional-diabolic (HED) singular points in a four mode bosonic system. The sensitivity enhancement is attributed to a singular response function, with the pole order determining the scaling of estimation error. At HED singular points, the error scaling exhibits a twofold improvement over non-HED singular points. The ultimate bound on estimation error is derived via quantum Fisher information, with heterodyne detection identified as the measurement achieving this optimal scaling.</description>

      <title>Generation of Frequency-Tunable Shaped Single Microwave Photons Using a Fixed-Frequency Superconducting Qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling up a superconducting quantum computer will likely require quantum communication between remote chips, which can be implemented using an itinerant microwave photon in a transmission line. To realize high-fidelity communication, it is essential to control the frequency and temporal shape of the microwave photon. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of frequency-tunable shaped microwave photons without resorting to any frequency-tunable circuit element. We develop a framework which treats a microwave resonator as a band-pass filter mediating the interaction between a superconducting qubit and the modes in the transmission line. This interpretation allows us to stimulate the photon emission by an off-resonant drive signal. We characterize how the frequency and temporal shape of the generated photon depends on the frequency and amplitude of the drive signal. By modulating the drive amplitude and frequency, we achieve a frequency tunability of 40 MHz while maintaining the photon mode shape time-symmetric. Through measurements of the quadrature amplitudes of the emitted photons, we demonstrate consistently high state and process fidelities around 95\% across the tunable frequency range. Our hardware-efficient approach eliminates the need for additional biasing lines typically required for frequency tuning, offering a simplified architecture for scalable quantum communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between nonstabilizerness and entanglement is crucial for uncovering the fundamental origins of quantum complexity. Recent studies have proposed entanglement spectral quantities, such as antiflatness of the entanglement spectrum and entanglement capacity, as effective complexity measures, establishing direct connections to stabilizer R\'enyi entropies. In this work, we systematically investigate quantum complexity across a diverse range of spin models, analyzing how entanglement structure and nonstabilizerness serve as distinctive signatures of quantum phases. By studying entanglement spectra and stabilizer entropy measures, we demonstrate that these quantities consistently differentiate between distinct phases of matter. Specifically, we provide a detailed analysis of spin chains including the XXZ model, the transverse-field XY model, its extension with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, as well as the Cluster Ising and Cluster XY models. Our findings reveal that entanglement spectral properties and magic-based measures serve as intertwined, robust indicators of quantum phase transitions, highlighting their significance in characterizing quantum complexity in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Contextuality sans incompatibility in the simplest scenario: Communication supremacy of a qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom asserts that measurement incompatibility is necessary for revealing the non-locality and contextuality. In contrast, a recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 230201 (2023)] demonstrates the generalized contextuality without measurement incompatibility by using a five-outcome qubit measurement. In this paper, we introduce a two-party prepare-measure communication game involving specific constraints on preparations, and we demonstrate contextuality sans incompatibility in the simplest measurement scenario, requiring only a three-outcome extremal qubit measurement. This contrasts with the aforementioned five-outcome qubit measurement, which can be simulated by an appropriate convex mixture of five three-outcome incompatible qubit measurements. Furthermore, we illustrate that our result has a prominent implication in information theory. Our communication game can be perceived as a constrained Holevo-Frankle-Weiner (HFW) scenario, as operational restrictions are imposed on preparations. We show that the maximum success probability of the game by using a qubit surpasses that attainable by a c-bit, even when shared randomness is a free resource. Consequently, this finding exemplifies the supremacy of a qubit over a c-bit within a constrained HFW framework. Thus, alongside offering fresh insights into quantum foundations, our results pave a novel pathway for exploring the efficacy of a qubit in information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Effects of superradiance on relativistic Foldy-Wouthuysen densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent interest in the studies of structured states obtained in relativistic electron beams has highlighted the use of two alternative descriptions, each based on a different wavefunction and the related space-time density. Although both wavefunctions obey the Dirac equation (one directly and the other through a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation) they lead to different dynamics and properties, such as the presence or absence of spin-orbit interactions. In this work we investigate wavepacket dynamics for the Klein-Gordon equation, which displays the same ambiguity regarding the choice of different densities, in a setting involving Klein tunneling across a series of supercritical potential barriers. Relying on the superradiant character of this setting, we obtain solutions to the wavepacket dynamics indicating that the density based on a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation of the wavefunction can be locally amplified outside the light-cone. In principle, the exponential increase of the charge due to the field inhomogeneities can lead to an arbitrarily large amplification over macroscopic distances. These results question the interpretation of the Foldy-Wouthuysen density as a fundamentally correct probability or charge density.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Optimal Timing in Discriminating Quantum Dynamical Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I investigate the problem of optimally discriminating between two open quantum dynamical processes in a single-shot scenario, with the goal of minimizing the error probability of identification. This task involves optimising both the input state -- potentially entangled with an ancillary system that remains isolated from the dynamics -- and the time at which the resulting time-dependent quantum channels, induced by the two distinct dynamical maps, becomes most distinguishable. To illustrate the complexity and richness of this problem, I focus on Pauli dynamical maps and their associated families of time-dependent Pauli channels. I identify a regime in which separable strategies require waiting indefinitely for the dynamics to reach the stationary state, whereas entangled input states enable optimal discrimination at a finite time, with a strict reduction in error probability. These results highlight the crucial interplay between entanglement and timing in enhancing the distinguishability of quantum dynamical processes.</description>

      <title>Realization of maximally-entangling two-qutrit gates using the Cross-Resonance scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we introduce the generalized cross-resonance scheme (GCR) which is a comprehensive theoretical framework that generalize the qubit-centric cross-resonance (CR) interaction beyond the 0-1 subspace for realizing maximally entangling two-qutrit gates on fixed-frequency transmons and is a microwave-only technique compatible with existing hardware. We use the GCR scheme to design parametric two-qutrit gates, namely, $U_{CR}^{01}$ and $U_{CR}^{12}$, that act on the $0{-}1$ and $1{-}2$ energy transitions of transmons. Our gates improve upon the existing works in two aspects. First, our gates directly allow for entanglement on the $1{-}2$ levels rather than merely relying on $0{-}1$ entanglement, as in previous works. Second, our gates are parametric in nature, enabling us to construct multiple entangling gates of interest, whereas the purview of prior works that use cross-resonance for qutrits was limited to individual gates. Using numerical simulation in Qiskit Dynamics, we demonstrate two-qutrit generalized controlled-$X$ ($U_{CX}^{01}$ and $U_{CX}^{12}$) and controlled-$H$ ($U_{CH}^{01}$ and $U_{CH}^{12}$) gates, which are instances of the proposed $U_{CR}$ gates, with reported gate fidelities of $99.73\pm 0.01\%, 97.88\pm 0.01\%, 99.39\pm 0.01\%$, and $98.99\pm 0.01\%$, respectively. Finally, we prepare a two-qutrit Bell state $|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle + |22\rangle)$ with a fidelity of $99.06 \pm 0.01\%$. We note that, in our setup, the complete time taken for Bell state preparation is $\sim 514$ ns and is less than the gate time of cross-Kerr-based entangling gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics has introduced a new theoretical framework for the study of molecules, enabling the prediction of properties and dynamics through the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation applied to these systems. However, solving this equation is computationally expensive, which has led to the development of various mathematical frameworks and computational methods designed to balance the available resources with the desired level of accuracy. In particular, quantum computers have emerged as a promising technology with the potential to address these problems more efficiently in the coming decades, whether through reductions in memory, time, and energy consumption, $\textit{i. e.}$, reductions in computational complexity or by enhancing precision. This research field is known as Quantum Simulation. Given the current technological limitations of quantum computers, Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), especially the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), stand out as a feasible approach to demonstrating advantages over classical methods in the near term. This feasibility arises from their lower demand for quantum gates and the reduced depth of the circuits required for their implementation. In this work, we present the application of quantum mechanics to the study of molecules, provide an introduction to the fundamentals of quantum computing, and explore the integration of these fields by employing the VQE in molecular simulations. Finally, we discuss the spatial and temporal complexity associated with the algorithm, highlighting its implications and challenges.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Quantum Device Benchmarking via LXEB with Particle-Number-Conserving Random Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear cross-entropy benchmarking (LXEB) with random quantum circuits is a standard method for evaluating quantum computers. However, LXEB requires classically simulating the ideal output distribution of a given quantum circuit with high numerical precision, which becomes infeasible beyond approximately 50 qubits, even on state-of-the-art supercomputers. As a result, LXEB cannot be directly applied to evaluate large-scale quantum devices, which now exceed 100 qubits and continue to grow rapidly in size. To address this limitation, we introduce a constraint known as particle-number conservation into the random quantum circuits used for benchmarking. This restriction significantly reduces the size of the Hilbert space for a fixed particle number, enabling classical simulations of circuits with over 100 qubits when the particle number is $O(1)$. Furthermore, we propose a modified version of LXEB, called MLXEB, which enables fidelity estimation under particle-number-conserving dynamics. Through numerical simulations, we investigate the conditions under which MLXEB provides accurate fidelity estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to probe the quantum statistics of two identical particles. The transition between the quantum and classical statistics of two identical particles is described by the particles having identical multiple internal energy levels. We show that effective distinguishability emerges as the thermal energy increases with respect to the energy level spacing, and the mesoscopic regime bridges quantum indistinguishability and classical distinguishability. A realistic experimental approach is proposed using a two-particle interferometer, where the particles reach statistical equilibrium before the two-particle distribution is measured. The unitarity of the scattering/separation process ensures the preservation of the equilibrium distribution and allows a direct measurement of the two-particle statistical distribution. Our results show the transition between quantum and classical behavior of the two-particle distribution, which can be directly probed by a realistic experiment.</description>

      <title>The Lie Algebra of XY-mixer Topologies and Warm Starting QAOA for Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The XY-mixer has widespread utilization in modern quantum computing, including in variational quantum algorithms, such as Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA). The XY ansatz is particularly useful for solving Cardinality Constrained Optimization tasks, a large class of important NP-hard problems. First, we give explicit decompositions of the dynamical Lie algebras (DLAs) associated with a variety of $XY$-mixer topologies. When these DLAs admit simple Lie algebra decompositions, they are efficiently trainable. An example of this scenario is a ring $XY$-mixer with arbitrary $R_Z$ gates. Conversely, when we allow for all-to-all $XY$-mixers or include $R_{ZZ}$ gates, the DLAs grow exponentially and are no longer efficiently trainable.
  We provide numerical simulations showcasing these concepts on Portfolio Optimization, Sparsest $k$-Subgraph, and Graph Partitioning problems. These problems correspond to exponentially-large DLAs and we are able to warm-start these optimizations by pre-training on polynomial-sized DLAs by restricting the gate generators. This results in improved convergence to high quality optima of the original task, providing dramatic performance benefits in terms of solution sampling and approximation ratio on optimization tasks for both shared angle and multi-angle QAOA.</description>

      <title>Fluxonium as a control qubit for bosonic quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic codes in superconducting resonators are a hardware-efficient avenue for quantum error correction and benefit from favorable error hierarchies provided by long-lived cavities compared to typical superconducting qubits. The required coupling to an ancillary control qubit, however, can negate these benefits by inducing highly detrimental effects such as excess decoherence and undesired nonlinearities. An important question is thus whether a cavity-qubit coupling can be realized that offers readout and control capabilities without spoiling the cavity. Here, motivated by its long lifetime and design flexibility of its Hamiltonian, we experimentally investigate the fluxonium as a control qubit for superconducting cavities. We couple a fluxonium qubit to a superconducting resonator in the strong-dispersive regime and use it to measure the coherence and inherited nonlinearities of the resonator. We then demonstrate universal control by preparing and characterizing resonator Fock states and their superpositions, with fidelities limited by resonator decay in our planar prototype device. Finally, we use the predictability of the resonator's inherited nonlinearities to show numerically that the fluxonium can reach cavity-coupling regimes that eliminate undesirable cavity nonlinearities. These results demonstrate the potential of the fluxonium as a high-performance bosonic control qubit for superconducting cavities.</description>

      <title>Supervised Quantum Machine Learning: A Future Outlook from Qubits to Enterprise Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supervised Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents an intersection of quantum computing and classical machine learning, aiming to use quantum resources to support model training and inference. This paper reviews recent developments in supervised QML, focusing on methods such as variational quantum circuits, quantum neural networks, and quantum kernel methods, along with hybrid quantum-classical workflows. We examine recent experimental studies that show partial indications of quantum advantage and describe current limitations including noise, barren plateaus, scalability issues, and the lack of formal proofs of performance improvement over classical methods. The main contribution is a ten-year outlook (2025-2035) that outlines possible developments in supervised QML, including a roadmap describing conditions under which QML may be used in applied research and enterprise systems over the next decade.</description>

      <title>A fidelity-driven approach to quantum circuit partitioning via weighted hypergraphs for noise-resilient computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective circuit partitioning is critical for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which are hampered by high error rates and limited qubit connectivity. Standard partitioning heuristics often neglect gate-specific error impacts, leading to suboptimal divisions with significant communication overhead and reduced fidelity. This paper introduces Fidelipart, a novel framework that transforms quantum circuits into a fidelity-aware hypergraph. In this model, gate error rates and structural dependencies inform the weights of nodes (gates) and hyperedges (representing multi-qubit interactions and qubit timelines), guiding an Mt-KaHyPar partitioner to minimize cuts through error-prone operations.
  We evaluated Fidelipart against BQSKit's QuickPartitioner on 6-qubit/22-gate, 10-qubit/55-gate, and 24-qubit/88-gate benchmarks under a linear topology with a consistent local contiguous re-mapping strategy. Results demonstrate Fidelipart's superior performance. It achieved SWAP gate reductions ranging from 77.3% to 100% and up to a 52.2% decrease in cut qubits. These physical improvements directly translated to estimated fidelity gains ranging from 27.3% to over 250%. While Fidelipart showed a modest runtime increase of 8-13% and variable effects on maximum partition depth, its substantial enhancement of circuit fidelity highlights the significant benefits of integrating detailed error-awareness into the partitioning process for more reliable NISQ computations.</description>

      <title>Deep reinforcement learning for near-deterministic preparation of cubic- and quartic-phase gates in photonic quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cubic-phase states are a sufficient resource for universal quantum computing over continuous variables. We present results from numerical experiments in which deep neural networks are trained via reinforcement learning to control a quantum optical circuit for generating cubic-phase states, with an average success rate of 96%. The only non-Gaussian resource required is photon-number-resolving measurements. We also show that the exact same resources enable the direct generation of a quartic-phase gate, with no need for a cubic gate decomposition.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly and internode scatterings in multifold semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our quest to unravel the topological properties of nodal points in three-dimensional semimetals, one hallmark property which warrants our attention is the \textit{chiral anomaly}. In the Brillouin zone (BZ), the sign of the Berry-curvature field's monopole charge is referred to as the chirality ($\chi$) of the node, leading to the notion of chiral quasiparticles sourcing chiral currents, induced by internode scatterings proportional to the chiral anomaly. Here, we derive the generic form of the chiral conductivity when we have multifold nodes. Since the sum of all the monopole charges in the BZ is constrained to vanish, the nodes appear in pairs of $\chi =\pm 1$. Hence, the presence of band-crossing degeneracies of order higher than two make it possible to have two distinct scenarios: the pair of conjugate nodes in question comprise bands of (1) the same pseudospin variety and exhibiting Berry-curvature profiles differing by an overall factor of $\chi$, or (2) two distinct pseudospin representations. Covering these two possibilities, we apply our derived formula to semimetals harbouring triple-point (threefold-degenerate) and Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (fourfold-degenerate) nodes, and show the resulting expressions for the conductivity featuring the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Bose-Einstein condensates at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the geometric quantum complexity of Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) at finite temperature. Specifically, we use the Bures and Sj\"oqvist metrics -- generalizations of the Fubini-Study metric for mixed quantum states, as well as the Nielsen geometric complexity approach based on purification of mixed states. Starting from the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian of BEC, which exhibits an $SU(1,1)$ symmetry, we explicitly derive and compare the complexities arising from these three distinct measures. For the Bures and Sj\"oqvist metrics, analytical and numerical evaluations of the corresponding geodesics are provided, revealing characteristic scaling behaviors with respect to temperature. In the Nielsen complexity approach, we rigorously handle the gauge freedoms associated with mixed state purification and non-uniqueness unitary operations, demonstrating that the resulting complexity aligns precisely with the Bures metric. Our work provides a comparative study of the geometric complexity of finite-temperature Bose-Einstein condensates, revealing its intimate connections to symmetry structures and temperature effects in BEC systems.</description>

      <title>Rotation angles of a rotating disc -- A toy model exhibiting the geometric phase --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a simple kinematic model, which is a rotating disc on the edge of another fixed disc without slipping, and study the rotation angle of the rotating disc. The rotation angle consists of two parts, the dynamical phase $\Delta_d$ and the geometric phase $\Delta_g$. The former is a dynamical rotation of the disc itself, and the geometric motion of the disc characterizes the latter. In fact, $\Delta_g$ is regarded as the geometric phase appearing in several important contexts in physics. The clue to finding the explicit form of $\Delta_g$ is the Baumkuchen lemma, which we called. Due to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, in the case that the rotating disc comes back to the initial position, $\Delta_g$ is interpreted as the signed area of a two-sphere enclosed by the trajectory of the Gauss vector, which is a unit normal vector on the moving disc. We also comment on typical models sharing the common underlying structure, which include Foucault's pendulum, Dirac's monopole potentials, and Berry phase. Hence, our model is a very simple but distinguished one in the sense that it embodies the essential concepts in differential geometry and theoretical physics such as the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the geometric phase, and the fiber bundles.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Negativity of Spin-Orbit Correlations in a general Qubit-Qudit Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the complete eigenvalue spectrum of the partially transposed density matrix for a pure bipartite quantum state acting on a generic $2 \otimes n$ Hilbert space. The spectrum contains four non-zero eigenvalues, as, \begin{eqnarray} \lambda_{1,2}=\pm \sqrt{A}, ~~~ \lambda_{3,4}= \frac{1}{2}(1\pm\sqrt{1-4 A}), \nonumber \end{eqnarray} where $A$ is the determinant of the reduced density matrix (traced over the larger subspace). As $0 \leqslant A \leqslant1/4$, only one is negative among the four non-trivial eigenvalues. Within this qubit-qudit framework, we further studied the negativity as a measure of entanglement for the case of spin-orbit correlation of partons inside a proton. The entanglement negativity for spin-orbit correlations is found to be related to the gluon helicity PDF and the Hermitian angle of the associated Hilbert space for linearly polarized protons.</description>

      <title>Expansion-contraction duality breaking in a Planck-scale sensitive cosmological quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the experimental simulation of cosmological perturbations governed by a Planck-scale induced Lorentz violating dispersion, aimed at distinguishing between early-universe models with similar power spectra. Employing a novel variant of the scaling approach for the evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate with both contact and dipolar interactions, we show that scale invariance, and in turn, the duality of the power spectrum is broken at large momenta for an inflating gas, and at small momenta for a contracting gas. We thereby furnish a Planck-scale sensitive approach to analogue quantum cosmology that can readily be implemented in the quantum gas laboratory.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic dynamics in a V-type quantum system by oppositely chirped counterrotating circularly polarized laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shaped free electron vortices (SEVs) have recently been studied using atomic (1+2) resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) by oppositely chirped counterrotating circularly polarized (OC-CRCP) femtosecond laser pulses. By transitioning from the perturbative to the non-perturbative REMPI regime, we identify an adiabatic excitation mechanism in a resonant V-type three-level system, termed V-RAP due to its similarities to rapid adiabatic passage (RAP). Experimentally, we observe a pronounced change in the shape of the measured three-dimensional photoelectron momentum distribution (3D PMD), which we trace back to this mechanism via analytical calculations and numerical simulations of the bound state and ionization dynamics. In V-RAP, the atom adiabatically follows the OC-CRCP field, with the two excited states driven in anti-phase, leading to an adiabatic cancellation of specific ionization pathways and explaining the observed changes in the PMD. In the experiment, we combine supercontinuum polarization pulse shaping to generate OC-CRCP femtosecond laser pulses with velocity map imaging-based photoelectron tomography to reconstruct the 3D PMD. The reconstructed PMDs are decomposed by 3D Fourier analysis into SEVs of different rotational symmetry, revealing a significant enhancement of the $c_6$-symmetric contribution, which is the signature of the V-RAP.</description>
