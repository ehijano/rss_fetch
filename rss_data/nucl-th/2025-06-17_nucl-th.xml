      <title>KHIFC-user friendly program for studying Heavy ion fusion barrier characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed an application for studying heavy ion fusion barrier characteristics such as such as fusion barrier heights ($V_B$), positions ($R_B$) and curvature of the inverted parabola ($\hbar\omega$). We call this application as KHIFC (Kolar Heavy Ion fusion barrier Characteristics). This software application hosted in the domain "https://systematics-of-heavy-ion-fusion.vercel.app/". This KHIFC produces fusion cross-sections with the simple input of projectile, target and center of mass energy. The values produced by the KHIFC is validated with experiments. Efficient tools like KHIFC are essential for researchers in nuclear physics, particularly when dealing with complex systems such as actinide and superheavy nuclei. By providing quick calculations and insights, it can significantly aid in experiment planning and theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Particle Spectra in the Integrated HydroKinetic Model at RHIC BES Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the description and prediction of particle production in Au+Au collisions at various center-of-mass energies ($\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27.0, \text{ and } 39.0$ GeV), using the Integrated HydroKinetic model (iHKM). The iHKM, initially created for the description of ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions, has been extended to cover intermediate and low relativistic energies, ranging from 2.5 to 50 GeV per colliding nucleon pair, and in cases where this distinction is needed, we refer to the modified version as iHKMe. The study explores the sensitivity of model predictions to variations in key parameters, including the relaxation time and thermalization degree during the prethermal stage, as well as the nature of the equation of state transition in the hydrodynamic phase. The iHKM successfully reproduces experimental results from the STAR experiment within the RHIC Beam Energy Scan program, with particular emphasis on midrapidity ($|y| &lt; 0.1$) observables such as particle multiplicity densities ($dN/dy$), average transverse momenta ($\langle p_T \rangle$), and particle yield ratios. In addition, the paper examines the evolution of chemical and kinetic freeze-out across different collision energies and centrality classes. These results offer a consistent description of the collective properties of strongly interacting matter formed in heavy-ion collisions, spanning a wide range of energies and baryon chemical potentials at RHIC.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological approach for introducing three-nucleon-force contributions into $p$-$d$ elastic scattering cross section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ($p,pd$) reaction is expected to be a powerful tool for probing three-nucleon forces (3NFs) in nuclear medium since it can be essentially regarded as the $p$-$d$ elastic scattering inside nuclei. One of the important points in the theoretical description of the ($p,pd$) reaction is to calculate the $p$-$d$ scattering in a nucleus including both two-nucleon (2N) force and 3NF contributions. This work aims to develop a phenomenological approach to incorporate 3NF contributions into $p$-$d$ elastic scattering in free space. The $p$-$d$ elastic scattering amplitude is decomposed into a 2N part, described using 2N effective interactions, and a residual part, assumed to primarily reflect 3NF contributions. The latter is approximated by a superposition of Legendre polynomials, with coefficients treated as adjustable parameters. These parameters are determined to reproduce experimental $p$-$d$ differential cross-section data at various incident energies. The obtained parameters exhibit smooth energy dependence, which is approximated by quadratic functions. The numerical results with the analytic energy dependence also reproduce the experimental data. The developed approach works well for incorporating the 3NF contributions into the $p$-$d$ elastic scattering cross section in a wide range of incident energies. This work can be regarded as the first step toward the description of ($p,pd$) reactions with taking 3NF effect in nuclear medium into account.</description>

      <title>Quantitative predictions of alpha-charmonium correlation functions in high-energy collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-body $ ^{4}{He}\left(\alpha\right)$-charmonium $ \left(c\bar{c}\right) $ potentials in the single-folding potential (SFP) approach are built by using a first principles HAL QCD low-energy $ NJ/\psi$ and $ N\eta_{c} $ interactions. It is found that the $ \alpha-c\bar{c} $ system based on the spin-$ 1/2 $ $NJ/\psi $ appears to be loosely bound with a binding energy of $ \sim 0.1 $ MeV, while for those based on spin-$3/2$ $ NJ/\psi $, spin-$ 1/2 $ $N\eta_{c}$ and the spin-averaged $ NJ/\psi $, no bound or resonance state (with respect to the $ \alpha + c\bar{c} $ threshold) was found. The $ \alpha c\bar{c} $ correlation function in high-energy collisions is examined to explore the $ N c\bar{c} $ interaction. The analysis revealed that variations in spin-dependent $N c\bar{c}$ interactions, spin-$3/2$ $NJ/\psi$, spin-$1/2$ $NJ/\psi$, spin-$1/2$ $N\eta_c$, and the spin-averaged $NJ/\psi$,produce noticeable differences in the $\alpha c\bar{c}$ correlation function, especially when the source size is around $ 3 $ fm. It is found that different results are produced by the Lednicky-Lyuboshits formula at small source sizes. This indicates that a relatively long-range interaction exists for the $ \alpha c\bar{c} $ system.</description>

      <title>Deep-Inelastic Scattering at TeV Energies with LHC Muons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LHC far-forward experiments FASER and SND@LHC have pioneered the detection of TeV-energy neutrinos produced in hard-scattering proton-proton collisions at the LHC. In addition to neutrinos, an intense flux of TeV-energy muons reaches these detectors, representing a dominant background for both neutrino studies and beyond the Standard Model searches. Here we demonstrate that this forward muon flux enables a comprehensive neutral-current deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) program at FASER with a strong kinematical overlap with the Electron Ion Collider. For the Run 3 luminosity of $\mathcal{L}_{\rm pp}=250$~fb$^{-1}$, more than $10^5$ inclusive muon DIS events, of which up to $10^4$ for charm production, are expected at FASER$\nu$. As a representative application, we demonstrate the sensitivity of muon DIS at FASER$\nu$ to probe the (intrinsic) charm content of the proton at large-$x$. We also provide predictions for event yields of muon DIS for future FASER runs and for the proposed Forward Physics Facility.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of axial anomaly effects in hot two-color QCD: FRG approach in the linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal properties of hadrons in two-color quantum chromodynamics (QC$_2$D) using the functional renormalization group (FRG) method, with particular focus on modifications of the $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects. The hadrons are described by a linear sigma model (LSM) based on the Pauli-G\"{u}rsey $SU(4)$ symmetry, which incorporates both low-lying $0^\pm$ mesons and diquark baryons. We find that all quartic couplings are comparably suppressed when physical values of the pion mass and decay constant are taken as inputs, for which a reasonably smooth chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature is reproduced. Consequently, mass differences among chiral partners remain small. Despite these tiny mass differences, mass degeneracies of chiral partners in the hot medium are clearly demonstrated, consistent with chiral symmetry restoration. Moreover, we find that the couplings responsible for the $U(1)$ axial anomaly are enhanced upon entering the finite temperature regime. Baryonic fluctuations also provide sizable contributions to these enhancements. Finally, the fate of the topological susceptibility in the hot QC$_2$D medium is examined.</description>

      <title>Study of the beyond standard model interaction using Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phenomenological studies are carried out to find the potential reach of a detector to constraints on possible beyond the standard model general neutrino interactions in the neutrino-quark sector, for the proposed Indian Coherent Neutrino-nucleus Scattering Experiment (ICNSE) at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in India. Reactors of different core configuration and power are used as sources of electron antineutrinos. The study has been carried out considering a target mass of 10 kg and an exposure of one year. It has been found that the ICNSE detector has a significant capacity to limit the majority of the Non-standard Interaction(NSI) parameter space. It has also been observed that a combination of results from two different types of detectors such as sapphire and high-purity germanium can significantly improve sensitivity by reducing the degeneracies between some pairs of NSI parameters to a smaller region.</description>

      <title>Towards scalable bound-to-resonance extrapolations for few- and many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In open quantum many-body systems, the theoretical description of resonant states of many particles strongly coupled to the continuum can be challenging. Such states are commonplace in, for example, exotic nuclei and hadrons, and can reveal important information about the underlying forces at play in these systems. In this work, we demonstrate that the complex-augmented eigenvector continuation (CA-EC) method, originally formulated for the two-body problem with uniform complex scaling, can reliably perform bound-to-resonance extrapolations for genuine three-body resonances having no bound subsystems. We first establish that three-body bound-to-resonance extrapolations are possible by benchmarking different few-body approaches, and we provide arguments to explain how the extrapolation works in the many-body case. We furthermore pave the way towards scalable resonance extrapolations in many-body systems by showing that the CA-EC method also works in the Berggren basis, studying a realistic application using the Gamow shell model.</description>

      <title>First complete description of low-lying spectroscopy in $^{254}$No</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08210v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we report the first complete shell-model description of low-lying structures of $^{254}$No. Employing the Kuo-Herling effective interaction, the calculations are performed within the Discrete Non-Orthogonal Shell Model recently implemented with the angular-momentum Variation After Projection applied on non-axial wavefunctions. Our calculations show a striking agreement with the experimentally known spectroscopy: the \textit{Yrast} band, the $8^{-}$ ($K=8$), $3^{+}$ ($K=3$) and $10^+$ ($K=10$) isomers together with associated $K$ bands. We reproduce the recently measured Gallagher-Moszkowski splitting between the $3^+$ ($K=3$) and $4^+$ ($K=4$) band heads. We predict the appearance of a second $0^+$ state, in excellent agreement with recent new observation. In addition, we systematically examine the ground state spectra, dipole and spectroscopic quadrupole moments of even-even, odd-even, odd-odd nuclei from $A=251$ to $A=256$, which are favourably reproduced. The present description of $^{254}$No shows the ability of the Shell Model framework to describe the low-lying properties for such an exotic nucleus at the frontier of modern experimental nuclear physics research.</description>

      <title>Imprint of $\alpha$-clustering on nucleon-nucleon correlations in relativistic light ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of $\alpha$-cluster structures in relativistic light nuclear collisions. Using a cluster framework, the characteristics of the nucleonic configurations of $^{16}$ O and $^{20}$ Ne are extracted as predicted by various \textit{ab initio} models, including Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory (NLEFT), Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), and the Projected Generator Coordinate Method (PGCM). Additionally, I analyze configurations derived from a three-parameter Fermi (3pF) density function. The investigation focuses on the effects of cluster parameters on two-point correlators using a rotor model for symmetric collisions ($^{16}$O+$^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne+$^{20}$Ne) and asymmetric collisions ($^{208}$Pb+$^{16}$O and $^{208}$Pb+$^{20}$Ne). The cluster parameters are determined by minimizing the \textit{chi-square} statistic to align the nucleon distributions with those predicted by the mentioned theories. The results reveal that perturbative calculations effectively capture the structural features of these nuclei, while comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations validate these findings. Furthermore, The analysis reveals distinct cluster geometries: VMC suggests tetrahedral shapes, while NLEFT, PGCM, and 3pF indicate irregular triangular pyramids. Notably, NLEFT shows a bowling pin-like $\alpha$ cluster structure for $^{20}$Ne. The study also identifies constraints on cluster parameters in the ground and excited oxygen states, with a gradual increase in $\varepsilon_2\{2\}$ for excited states. Accurate modeling of asymmetric collisions requires a range of nucleons from heavy spherical nuclei, leading to weighted correlators in perturbative calculations. I demonstrate consistency between perturbative calculations and Monte Carlo models, with analytical calculations providing more insights into asymmetric than symmetric collisions.</description>

      <title>Toward hybrid quantum simulations with qubits and qumodes on trapped-ion platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of gate-based hybrid quantum computing using both discrete (qubit) and continuous (qumode) variables on trapped-ion platforms. Trapped-ion systems have demonstrated record one- and two-qubit gate fidelities and long qubit coherence times, while qumodes, which can be represented by the collective vibrational modes of the ion chain, have remained relatively unexplored for their use in computing. Using numerical simulations, we show that high-fidelity hybrid gates and measurement operations can be achieved for existing trapped-ion quantum platforms. As an exemplary application, we consider quantum simulations of the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model, which is given by a one-dimensional chain of interacting spin and boson degrees of freedom. Using classical simulations, we study its real-time evolution and develop a suitable variational quantum algorithm for ground state preparation. Our results motivate further studies of hybrid quantum computing in this context, which may lead to direct applications in condensed matter and fundamental particle and nuclear physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the large-$N_c$ structure of the baryon-baryon potential derived in the framework of SU(3) chiral perturbation theory up to next-to-leading order including contact interactions as well as one-meson and two-meson exchange diagrams. Moreover, we assess the impact of SU(3) symmetry breaking from a large-$N_c$ perspective and show that the leading order results can successfully be applied to the hyperon-nucleon potential. Our results include a reduction of the number of relevant low-energy constants of the leading order contact interaction from fifteen to three, and we show that consistency is preserved if the $F/D$ ratio is given by $2/3$ and the $C/D$ ratio for the baryon decuplet-to-octet coupling is given by 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the pole trajectory of the recently established subthreshold negative parity nucleon pole, namely the $N^*(920)$, with varying pion masses, in the scheme of linear $\sigma$ model with nucleons using the $N/D$ unitarization method. We find that as the pion mass increases, the pole moves toward the real axis. For larger pion masses, at tree level, the pole falls to a specific point on $u$-channel cut and crosses to the adjacent Riemann sheet defined by the logarithmic $u$ channel cut. At one-loop level, the pole does not meet the $u$-cut up to $m_\pi=0.36$GeV. We also re-examined the $\sigma$ pole trajectory and find it in good agreement with Roy equation analysis result.</description>

Abstract: We investigate spatial two-point correlation functions of mesonic operators in two-flavor lattice QCD at high temperatures. The simulated temperatures over the range $T \in [147, 330]$ MeV, where the critical temperature is estimated around 165 MeV. To ensure a good control of the chiral symmetry we employ the M\"obius domain-wall fermion action for two degenerate flavors of quarks. With a lattice cut off $a^{-1}\sim 2.6$ GeV, the residual mass is reduced to 0.14 MeV. With the energy spectrum obtained from the screening mass at incremental values of the temperature range, we examine the $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry, the anomalous axial $U(1)$ as well as an enhanced symmetry which exchanges the spin degrees of freedom. We also study how the data approaches the perturbative prediction given by twice the Matsubara frequency of free quarks.</description>
