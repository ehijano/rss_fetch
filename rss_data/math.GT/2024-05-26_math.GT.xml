      <title>Higher rank series and root puzzles for plumbed 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a triple consisting of a weakly negative definite plumbed 3-manifold, a root lattice, and a generalized $\mathrm{Spin}^c$-structure, we construct a family of invariants in the form of a Laurent series. Each series is an invariant of the triple up to orientation preserving homeomorphisms and the action of the Weyl group. We show that there are infinitely many such series for irreducible root lattices of rank at least 2, with each series depending on a solution to a combinatorial puzzle defined on the root lattice. Our series recover certain related series recently defined by Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa, Gukov-Manolescu, Park and Ri as special cases. Explicit computations are given for Brieskorn homology spheres, for which the series may be expressed as modified higher rank false theta functions.</description>

      <title>Signature, slicing foams, and crossing changes of Klein graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A totally oriented Klein graph is a trivalent spatial graph in the 3-sphere with a 3-coloring of its edges and an orientation on each bicolored link. A totally oriented Klein foam is a 3-colored 2-complex in the 4-ball whose boundary is a Klein foam and whose bicolored surfaces are oriented. We extend Gille-Robert's signature for 3-Hamiltonian Klein graphs to all totally oriented Klein graphs and develop an analogy of Murasugi's bounds relating the signature, slice genus and unknotting number of knots. In particular, we show that the signature of a totally oriented Klein graph produces a lower bound on the negative orbifold Euler characteristic of certain totally oriented Klein foams bounded by $\Gamma$. When $\Gamma$ is abstractly planar, these negative Euler characteristics, in turn, produce a lower bound on a certain natural unknotting number for $\Gamma$. Mutatis mutandi, we produce lower bounds on the corresponding Gordian distance between two totally oriented Klein graphs that can be related by a sequence of crossing changes. We also give examples of theta-curves for which our lower bounds on unknotting number improve on previously known bounds.</description>

      <title>Dominating surface-group representations via Fock-Goncharov coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a punctured surface of negative Euler characteristic. We show that given a generic representation $\rho:\pi_1(S) \rightarrow \mathrm{PSL}_n(\mathbb{C})$, there exists a positive representation $\rho_0:\pi_1(S) \rightarrow \mathrm{PSL}_n(\mathbb{R})$ that dominates $\rho$ in the Hilbert length spectrum as well as in the translation length spectrum, for the translation length in the symmetric space $\mathbb{X}_n= \mathrm{PSL}_n(\mathbb{C})/\mathrm{PSU}(n)$. Moreover, the $\rho_0$-lengths of peripheral curves remain unchanged. The dominating representation $\rho_0$ is explicitly described via Fock-Goncharov coordinates. Our methods are linear-algebraic, and involve weight matrices of weighted planar networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the mapping class group of a handlebody is a virtual duality group, in the sense of Bieri and Eckmann. In positive genus we give a description of the dualising module of any torsion-free, finite-index subgroup of the handlebody mapping class group as the homology of the complex of non-simple disc systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized Pseudo-Anosov Maps and Hubbard Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this project, we develop a new connection between the dynamics of quadratic polynomials on the complex plane and the dynamics of homeomorphisms of surfaces. In particular, given a quadratic polynomial, we investigate whether one can construct an extension of it which is a generalized pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism. Generalized pseudo-Anosov means it preserves a pair of foliations with infinitely many singularities that accumulate on finitely many points. We determine for which quadratic polynomials such an extension exists. The construction is related to the dynamics on the Hubbard tree, which is a forward invariant subset of the filled Julia set containing the critical orbit. We define a type of Hubbard trees, which we call crossing-free, and show that these are precisely the Hubbard trees for which one can construct a generalized pseudo-Anosov map.</description>

      <title>Taut foliations and contact pairs in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new construction of codimension-one foliations from pairs of contact structures in dimension three. This constitutes a converse result to a celebrated theorem of Eliashberg and Thurston on approximations of foliations by contact structures. Under suitable hypotheses on the initial contact pairs, the foliations we construct are taut, allowing us to characterize taut foliations entirely in terms of contact geometry. This viewpoint reveals some surprising flexible phenomena for taut foliations, and provides new insight into the $L$-space conjecture.
  The first part of the proof builds upon the work on Colin and Firmo on positive contact pairs. The second part involves a wide generalization of a technical result of Burago and Ivanov on the construction of branching foliations tangent to continuous plane fields, and might be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Y$ be a closed, orientable 3-manifold with Heegaard genus 2. We prove that if $H_1(Y;\mathbb{Z})$ has order $1$, $3$, or $5$, then there is a representation $\pi_1(Y) \to \mathrm{SU}(2)$ with non-abelian image. Similarly, if $H_1(Y;\mathbb{Z})$ has order $2$ then we find a non-abelian representation $\pi_1(Y) \to \mathrm{SO}(3)$. We also prove that a knot $K$ in $S^3$ is a trefoil if and only if there is a unique conjugacy class of irreducible representations $\pi_1(S^3\setminus K) \to \mathrm{SU}(2)$ sending a fixed meridian to $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}i&amp;0\\0&amp;-i\end{smallmatrix}\right)$.</description>

      <title>Multiarc and curve graphs are hierarchically hyperbolic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multiarc and curve graph is a simplicial graph whose vertices are arc and curve systems on a compact, connected, orientable surface S. We show that all connected, non-trivial multiarc and curve graphs preserved by the natural action of PMod(S) and whose adjacent vertices have bounded geometric intersection number are hierarchically hyperbolic spaces with respect to witness subsurface projection. This result extends work of Kate Vokes on twist-free multicurve graphs and confirms two conjectures of Saul Schleimer in a broad setting. In addition, we prove that the PMod(S)-equivariant quasi-isometry type of such a graph is uniquely classified by its set of connected witness subsurfaces.</description>

      <title>The equivariant genera of marked strongly invertible knots associated with $2$-bridge knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A marked strongly invertible knot is a triple $(K,h,\delta)$ of a knot $K$ in $S^3$, a strong inversion $h$ of $K$, and a subarc $\delta \subset \operatorname{Fix}(h)\cong S^1$ bounded by $\operatorname{Fix}(h)\cap K\cong S^0$. An invariant Seifert surface for $(K,h,\delta)$ is an $h$-invariant Seifert surface for $K$ that intersects $\operatorname{Fix}(h)$ in the arc $\delta$. In this paper, we completely determine the equivariant genus (the minimum of the genera of invariant Seifert surfaces for $(K,h,\delta)$) of every marked strongly invertible knot $(K,h,\delta)$ with $K$ a $2$-bridge knot.</description>

      <title>Non-Uniform Lattices of Large Systole Containing a Fixed 3-Manifold Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $d$ be a square free positive integer and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ a totally real quadratic field over $\mathbb{Q}$. We show there exists an arithmetic lattice L in $SL(8,\mathbb{R})$ with entries in the ring of integers of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ and a sequence of lattices $\Gamma_n $ commensurable to L such that the systole of the locally symmetric finite volume manifold $\Gamma_n \diagdown SL(8,\mathbb{R}) \diagup SO(8)$ goes to infinity as $n \rightarrow \infty$, yet every $\Gamma_n$ contains the same hyperbolic 3-manifold group $\Pi$, a finite index subgroup of the arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifold vol3. Notably, such an example does not exist in rank one, so this is a feature unique to higher rank lattices.</description>

      <title>Irrational rotations and 2-filling rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a skew product transformation associated to an irrational rotation of the circle [0,1]/~. This skew product keeps track of the number of times an orbit of the rotation lands in the two complementary intervals of {0,1/2} in the circle. We show that under certain conditions on the continued fraction expansion of the irrational number defining the rotation, the skew product transformation has certain dense orbits. This is in spite of the presence of numerous non-dense orbits. We use this to construct laminations on infinite type surfaces with exotic properties. In particular, we show that for every infinite type surface with an isolated planar end, there is an infinite clique of 2-filling rays based at that end. These 2-filling rays are relevant to Bavard--Walker's loop graphs.</description>
