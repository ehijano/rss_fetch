      <title>Universal non-thermal power-law distribution functions from the self-consistent evolution of collisionless electrostatic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distribution functions of collisionless systems are known to show non-thermal power law tails. Interestingly, collisionless plasmas in various physical scenarios, (e.g., the ion population of the solar wind) feature a $v^{-5}$ tail in the velocity ($v$) distribution, whose origin has been a long-standing mystery. We show this power law tail to be a natural outcome of the self-consistent collisionless relaxation of driven electrostatic plasmas. We perform a quasilinear analysis of the perturbed Vlasov-Poisson equations to show that the coarse-grained mean distribution function (DF), $f_0$, follows a quasilinear diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient $D(v)$ that depends on $v$ through the plasma dielectric constant. If the plasma is isotropically forced on scales much larger than the Debye length with a white noise-like electric field, then $D(v)\sim v^4$ for $\sigma&lt;v&lt;\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$, with $\sigma$ the thermal velocity, $\omega_{\mathrm{P}}$ the plasma frequency and $k$ the maximum wavenumber of the perturbation; the corresponding $f_0$, in the quasi-steady state, develops a $v^{-\left(d+2\right)}$ tail in $d$ dimensions ($v^{-5}$ tail in 3D), while the energy ($E$) distribution develops an $E^{-2}$ tail irrespective of the dimensionality of space. Any redness of the noise only alters the scaling in the high $v$ end. Non-resonant particles moving slower than the phase-velocity of the plasma waves ($\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$) experience a Debye-screened electric field, and significantly less (power law suppressed) acceleration than the near-resonant particles. Thus, a Maxwellian DF develops a power law tail. The Maxwellian core ($v&lt;\sigma$) eventually also heats up, but over a much longer timescale than that over which the tail forms. We definitively show that self-consistency (ignored in test-particle treatments) is crucial for the development of the universal $v^{-5}$ tail.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Solar Spicules and their Role in Solar Wind Production using Machine Learning and the Hough Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar winds originate from the Sun and can be classified as fast or slow. Fast solar winds come from coronal holes at the solar poles, while slow solar winds may originate from the equatorial region or streamers. Spicules are jet-like structures observed in the Sun's chromosphere and transition region. Some spicules exhibit rotating motion, potentially indicating vorticity and Alfven waves. Machine learning and the Hough algorithm were used to analyze over 3000 frames of the Sun, identifying spicules and their characteristics. The study found that rotating spicules, accounting for 21 percent at the poles and 4 percent at the equator, play a role in energy transfer to the upper solar atmosphere. The observations suggest connections between spicules, mini-loops, magnetic reconnection, and the acceleration of fast solar winds. Understanding these small-scale structures is crucial for comprehending the origin and heating of the fast solar wind.</description>

      <title>Solar Wind Structures from the Gaussianity of Magnetic Magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the primary science objectives of Parker Solar Probe (PSP) is to determine the structures and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind. However, establishing the connection between {\it in situ} measurements and structures and dynamics in the solar atmosphere is challenging: most of the magnetic footpoint mapping techniques have significant uncertainties in the source localization of a plasma parcel observed {\it in situ}, and the PSP plasma measurements suffer from a limited field of view. Therefore it is of interest to investigate whether {\it in situ} measurements can be used on their own to identify streams originating from the same structures in the corona more finely than the well known fast wind-coronal hole, slow wind-elsewhere distinction. Here we develop a novel time series visualization method \textcolor{red}{(time-frequency representation or TFR)} named Gaussianity Scalogram. Utilizing this method, by analyzing the magnetic magnitude data from both PSP and Ulysses, we successfully identify {\it in situ} structures that are possible remnants of solar atmospheric and magnetic structures spanning more than seven orders of magnitude, from years to seconds, including polar and mid-latitude coronal holes, as well as structures compatible with super-granulation , ``jetlets'' and ``picoflares''. \textcolor{red}{Furthermore, computer simulations of Alfv\'enic turbulence successfully reproduce the Gaussianization of the magnetic magnitude for locally homogeneous structures.} Building upon these discoveries, the Gaussianity Scalogram can help future studies to reveal the fractal-like fine structures in the solar wind time series from both PSP and decades-old data archive.</description>

      <title>Seeds and Sequences of Element Abundances in Solar Energetic Particle Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs) in the small "impulsive" events, primarily accelerated during magnetic reconnection in solar jets, have strong enhancements of the abundances of increasingly heavy elements. In contrast, the shock acceleration of ambient coronal plasma in most large "gradual" SEP events produces flat or decreasing abundances vs. element mass-to-charge ratios A/Q. However, heavy-ion enhancements in the largest gradual SEP events can occur in two ways: (1) strong streaming of protons away from the shock amplifies Alfven waves that preferentially scatter and retard protons near the shock while increasingly-heavy ions can leak out, and (2) strong shock waves re-accelerate SEPs fed from persistent impulsive SEP events streaming from some active regions, with their pre-enhanced heavy ions becoming dominant. Power-law fits of abundance enhancements vs. A/Q can distinguish the latter events by the presence of both impulsive and coronal-seed components, and the best-fit charges Q define characteristic source temperatures. Intense impulsively-seeded events can occur in sequences fed from a single persistent active-region as it rotates across the disk of the Sun. Three week-long event sequences, each producing two or three very large events, occur early in the strong solar-cycle 23. The weak solar-cycle 24, produces only one impulsively-seeded event sequence - perhaps a dearth of both impulsive seeds and sufficiently strong shocks. Solar cycle 25 has produced an unusual active period of short strong impulsive events In contrast, there are other active regions where large events alternate SEPs with and without impulsively-seeded sources. We also find that events with moderate Alfven-wave trapping near the shock can release ions slowly or rapidly as a function of A/Q. This A/Q-dependent trapping acts almost as a magnetic spectrometer that separates elements in space and time.</description>
