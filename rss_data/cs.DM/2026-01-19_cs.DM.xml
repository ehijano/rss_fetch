      <title>Vertex ordering characterizations of interval r-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An r-partite graph is an interval r-graph if corresponding to each vertex we can assign an interval of the real line such that two vertices u and v of different partite sets are adjacent if and only if their corresponding intervals intersect. In this paper, we provide two vertex-ordering characterizations of interval r-graphs and identify forbidden patterns for interval r-graphs in terms of specific orderings of their vertices.</description>

      <title>On the Virtual Network Embedding polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the polyhedral study of the Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) problem, which arises in modern telecommunication networks. We propose new valid inequalities for the so-called flow formulation. We then prove, through a dedicated flow decomposition algorithm, that these inequalities characterize the VNE polytope in the case of an embedding of a virtual edge on a substrate path. Preliminary experiments show that the new inequalities propose promising speedups for MIP solvers.</description>

      <title>Welfare Loss in Connected Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03467v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the allocation of indivisible items that form an undirected graph and investigate the worst-case welfare loss when requiring that each agent must receive a connected subgraph. Our focus is on both egalitarian and utilitarian welfare. Specifically, we introduce the concept of egalitarian (resp., utilitarian) price of connectivity, which captures the worst-case ratio between the optimal egalitarian (resp., utilitarian) welfare among all allocations and that among connected allocations. We provide tight or asymptotically tight bounds on the price of connectivity for several large classes of graphs in the case of two agents -- including graphs with vertex connectivity $1$ or $2$ and complete bipartite graphs -- as well as for paths, stars, and cycles in the general case where the number of agents can be arbitrary.</description>

      <title>Bond Polytope under Vertex- and Edge-sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cut in a graph $G$ is called a {\em bond} if both parts of the cut induce connected subgraphs in $G$, and the {\em bond polytope} is the convex hull of all bonds. Computing the maximum weight bond is an NP-hard problem even for planar graphs. However, the problem is solvable in linear time on $(K_5 \setminus e)$-minor-free graphs, and in more general, on graphs of bounded treewidth, essentially due to clique-sum decomposition into simpler graphs.
  We show how to obtain the bond polytope of graphs that are $1$- or $2$-sum of graphs $G_1$ and $ G_2$ from the bond polytopes of $G_1,G_2$. Using this we show that the extension complexity of the bond polytope of $(K_5 \setminus e)$-minor-free graphs is linear. Prior to this work, a linear size description of the bond polytope was known only for $3$-connected planar $(K_5 \setminus e)$-minor-free graphs, essentially only for wheel graphs.
  We also describe an elementary linear time algorithm for the \MaxBond problem on $(K_5\setminus e)$-minor-free graphs. Prior to this work, a linear time algorithm in this setting was known. However, the hidden constant in the big-Oh notation was large because the algorithm relies on the heavy machinery of linear time algorithms for graphs of bounded treewidth, used as a black box.</description>

      <title>Relation between broadcast domination and multipacking numbers on chordal and other hyperbolic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $ G = (V, E) $ with a vertex set $ V $ and an edge set $ E $, a function
  $ f : V \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2, . . . , diam(G)\} $ is called a \emph{broadcast} on $ G $. For each
  vertex $ u \in V $, if there exists a vertex $ v $ in $ G $ (possibly, $ u = v $) such that $ f (v) &gt; 0 $ and
  $ d(u, v) \leq f (v) $, then $ f $ is called a dominating broadcast on $ G $. The cost of the dominating broadcast $f$ is the quantity $ \sum_{v\in V}f(v) $. The minimum cost of a dominating broadcast is the broadcast domination number of $G$, denoted by $ \gamma_{b}(G) $.
  A multipacking is a set $ S \subseteq V $ in a
  graph $ G = (V, E) $ such that for every vertex $ v \in V $ and for every integer $ r \geq 1 $, the
  ball of radius $ r $ around $ v $ contains at most $ r $ vertices of $ S $, that is, there are at most
  $ r $ vertices in $ S $ at a distance at most $ r $ from $ v $ in $ G $. The
  multipacking number of $ G $ is the maximum cardinality of a multipacking of $ G $ and
  is denoted by $ mp(G) $.
  We show that, for any connected chordal graph $G$, $\gamma_{b}(G)\leq \big\lceil{\frac{3}{2} mp(G)\big\rceil}$. We also show that $\gamma_b(G)-mp(G)$ can be arbitrarily large for connected chordal graphs by constructing an infinite family of connected chordal graphs such that the ratio $\gamma_b(G)/mp(G)=10/9$, with $mp(G)$ arbitrarily large. Moreover, we show that $\gamma_{b}(G)\leq \big\lfloor{\frac{3}{2} mp(G)+2\delta\big\rfloor} $ holds for all $\delta$-hyperbolic graphs. In addition, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to construct a multipacking of a $\delta$-hyperbolic graph $G$ of size at least $ \big\lceil{\frac{2mp(G)-4\delta}{3} \big\rceil} $.</description>

      <title>Pattern Avoidance for Fibonacci Sequences using $k$-Regular Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16052v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two $k$-ary Fibonacci recurrences are $a_k(n) = a_k(n-1) + k \cdot a_k(n-2)$ and $b_k(n) = k \cdot b_k(n-1) + b_k(n-2)$. We provide a simple proof that $a_k(n)$ is the number of $k$-regular words over $[n] = \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ that avoid patterns $\{121, 123, 132, 213\}$ when using base cases $a_k(0) = a_k(1) = 1$ for any $k \geq 1$. This was previously proven by Kuba and Panholzer in the context of Wilf-equivalence for restricted Stirling permutations, and it creates Simion and Schmidt's classic result on the Fibonacci sequence when $k=1$, and the Jacobsthal sequence when $k=2$. We complement this theorem by proving that $b_k(n)$ is the number of $k$-regular words over $[n]$ that avoid $\{122, 213\}$ with $b_k(0) = b_k(1) = 1$ for any~$k \geq 2$. Finally, we conjecture that $|Av^{2}_{n}(\underline{121}, 123, 132, 213)| = a_1(n)^2$ for $n \geq 0$. That is, vincularizing the Stirling pattern in Kuba and Panholzer's Jacobsthal result gives the Fibonacci-squared numbers.</description>

      <title>$K_{2,3}$-induced minor-free graphs admit quasi-isometry with additive distortion to graphs of tree-width at most two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph $H$ is an \emph{induced minor} of a graph $G$ if $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of edge contractions and vertex deletions. Otherwise, $G$ is \emph{$H$-induced minor-free}. In this paper, we provide a different proof of the fact that $K_{2,3}$-induced minor-free graphs admit a quasi-isometry with additive distortion to graphs with tree-width at most two. Our proof yields a $O(nm)$-time algorithm which takes as input a $K_{2,3}$-induced minor-free graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, and outputs a tree-width two graph $H$ with the desired additive distortion. For \emph{universally signable} graphs, a subclass of $K_{2,3}$-induced minor-free graphs, the time complexity of our algorithm is linear. As a consequence, we obtain a truly sub-quadratic time additive constant factor approximation algorithm to compute the \emph{diameter} of a universally signable graph. In contrast, assuming the \emph{Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis} (\textsc{SETH}), the diameter of split graphs (a very restricted class of universally signable graphs), cannot be computed in truly sub-quadratic time [Borassi et al. (ENTCS, 2016)].</description>

      <title>Improved Streaming Algorithm for Fair $k$-Center Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world applications pose challenges in incorporating fairness constraints into the $k$-center clustering problem, where the dataset consists of $m$ demographic groups, each with a specified upper bound on the number of centers to ensure fairness. Focusing on big data scenarios, this paper addresses the problem in a streaming setting, where data points arrive one by one sequentially in a continuous stream. Leveraging a structure called the $\lambda$-independent center set, we propose a one-pass streaming algorithm that first computes a reserved set of points during the streaming process. Then, for the post-streaming process, we propose an approach for selecting centers from the reserved point set by analyzing all three possible cases, transforming the most complicated one into a specially constrained vertex cover problem in an auxiliary graph. Our algorithm achieves a tight approximation ratio of 5 while consuming $O(k\log n)$ memory. It can also be readily adapted to solve the offline fair $k$-center problem, achieving a 3-approximation ratio that matches the current state of the art. Furthermore, we extend our approach to a semi-structured data stream, where data points from each group arrive in batches. In this setting, we present a 3-approximation algorithm for $m = 2$ and a 4-approximation algorithm for general $m$. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our approaches, demonstrating that they outperform existing baselines in both clustering cost and runtime efficiency.</description>
