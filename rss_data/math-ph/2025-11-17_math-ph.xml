      <title>Convolutions and Gaussians in Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kadanoff-Wilson-Fisher approach to renormalization is based upon studying the renormalization transform, which may be described as an action of the monoid $\mathbb{R}^{\times}_{\geq 1}$ on a suitable space of interactions. It is typically computed by manipulating the path integral or the perturbation series. Here we will present an alternative algebraic description of the renormalization transform. We treat the space of interactions as a semigroup under convolution and act on it with a Lie group associated with the quantum harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Lenard-Balescu thermalization: rigorous derivation from a toy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time dynamics of a tagged particle coupled to a background of $N$ other particles, all interacting through long-range pairwise forces in the mean-field scaling, with the background initially at thermal equilibrium. Starting from the $N$-particle BBGKY hierarchy, we introduce a simplified (truncated) hierarchical model and show, in sufficiently large spatial dimension, that the tagged-particle density converges, on timescales $t\sim N$, to the solution of a linear Fokker-Planck equation, viewed as the linearization of the Landau equation. This provides, in a simplified setting, a rigorous derivation of the slow thermalization predicted by Lenard-Balescu theory. Our approach relies on a rigorous Dyson expansion in terms of Feynman diagrams and on a novel renormalization scheme that removes leading recollisions. The main technical challenge is to control the effect of phase-space filamentation within the diagrams, which we achieve by combining phase mixing and hypoelliptic regularity. Although restricted to a simplified model, our analysis offers new insight into Lenard-Balescu thermalization: notably, the renormalization appears to transform free propagators into hypoelliptic ones, providing a key mechanism that compensates for filamentation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the free fermions technique and non-abelian bosonization rules we introduce the multi-component Pfaff-Toda hierarchy. The tau-function is defined as vacuum expectation value of a Clifford group element of the algebra of Fermi-operators. A generating bilinear integral equation for the tau-function is obtained. A number of bilinear functional relations for the tau-function of the Hirota-Miwa type are derived as corollaries of the generating bilinear equation.</description>

      <title>Wightman axiomatics of the bootstrap construction of the 1+1 dimensional Sinh-Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integrable bootstrap program allows one to express the tempered distributions associated with the multipoint functions of the integrable 1+1 dimensional Sinh-Gordon quantum field theory by means of explicit series. The convergence of the latter is an open problem that was only solved for the two-point case. In this work, by taking for granted the convergence of these series, we show that these expressions satisfy all of the Wightman axioms. This thus shows that, upon a yet to be proven convergence property, the integrable bootstrap based construction of correlation functions does lead to a quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in the Ising model on random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study phase transitions in the Ising model on random graphs using graph limits. This framework extends mean-field theory to heterogeneous nonlocal interactions. We show that the critical temperatures are determined by the eigenvalues of the kernel operator associated with the graph limit. Bifurcation diagrams for Erdos-Renyi, small-world, and power-law graphs illustrate the theory. In the small-world case, we identify metastable behavior in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regimes.</description>

      <title>$\Gamma$-convergence of a diffeomorphism-natural MDL functional to Einstein-Hilbert with Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a \(\Gamma\)-convergence result for a diffeomorphism-natural discrete MDL-type functional to the Einstein-Hilbert action with the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. On boundary-fitted, shape-regular meshes we establish interior and boundary blow-ups, identify the Carath\'eodory densities \(f_{\mathrm{in}}=\alpha_0+\alpha_1 R\) and \(f_{\mathrm{bdry}}=\beta_1 K\), and obtain the \(\liminf/\limsup\) bounds via a recovery sequence based on reflected Fermi smoothing. A boundary first-layer asymptotics shows that boundary cells contribute at order \(h^{d-1}\), yielding a global \(O(h)\) boundary remainder, while the interior remainder is \(O(h^2)\). The paper is foundational; Appendix~E specifies a reproducible protocol for rate checks and calibration of \(\alpha_0,\alpha_1,\beta_1\).</description>

      <title>Enhancing Micromagnetics Simulations with a Third-Order Semi-Implicit Projection Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micromagnetics depends on high-fidelity numerical methods for magnetization dynamics. This work proposes a third-order temporal accuracy scheme for the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, addressing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs in existing methods. Validated via nanostrip simulations (representative of real devices), the scheme offers two key advantages: rigorous third-order accuracy (surpassing existing simulation methods) and higher computational efficiency, ensuring fast convergence without precision loss. It maintains stability for Gilbert damping \(\alpha\) from $0.1$ to $10$, avoiding non-physical states. The magnetic microstructures it captures are consistent with established methods, confirming reliability for physical analysis.</description>

      <title>Boundary Compactified Imaginary Liouville Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the construction of Compactified Imaginary Liouville Theory (CILT), a non-unitary logarithmic Conformal Field Theory (CFT) defined on closed surfaces, to surfaces with boundary. Starting from a compactified Gaussian Free Field (GFF) with Neumann boundary condition, we perturb it by adding in curvature terms and exponential potentials on both the bulk and the boundary. In physics, this theory is conjectured to describe the scaling limit of loop models such as the Potts and $O(n)$ models. To define it mathematically, the curvature terms require a detailed analysis of the topology, and the potential terms are defined using the imaginary Guassian Multiplicative Chaos (GMC). We prove that the resulting probabilistic path integral satisfies the axioms of CFT, including Segal's gluing axioms. This work provides the foundation for future studies of boundary CILT and will also help with the understanding of CILT.</description>

      <title>Solving a Nonlinear Eigenvalue Equation in Quantum Information Theory: A Hybrid Approach to Entanglement Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear eigenvalue equations arise naturally in quantum information theory, particularly in the variational quantification of entanglement. In this work, we present a hybrid analytical and numerical framework for evaluating the geometric measure of entanglement. The method combines a Gauss Seidel fixed point iteration with a controlled perturbative correction scheme. We make the coupled nonlinear eigenstructure explicit by proving the equal multiplier stationarity identity, which states that at the optimum all block Lagrange multipliers coincide with the squared fidelity between the target state and its closest separable approximation. A normalization-preserving linearization is then derived by projecting the dynamics onto the local tangent spaces, yielding a well-defined first order correction and an explicit scalar shift in the eigenvalue. Furthermore, we establish a monotonic block ascent property the squared overlap between the evolving product state and the target state increases at every iteration, remains bounded by unity, and converges to a stationary value. The resulting hybrid solver reproduces the exact optimum for standard three qubit benchmarks, obtaining squared-overlap values of one-half for the Greenberger Horne Zeilinger (GHZ\(_3\)) state and four-ninths for the W\(_3\) state, with smooth monotonic convergence.</description>

      <title>Coupled Proca theories: Green-hyperbolicity, quantization and applications to polarization measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Proca field describes a massive relativistic spin-$1$ particle and was originally formulated in Minkowski spacetime. Here we consider a variety of generalizations in globally hyperbolic spacetimes, including couplings between a number of Proca fields via a mass-matrix, the charged Proca field with arbitrary magnetic moment in an arbitrary external electromagnetic field, and a Proca-Klein-Gordon theory with a spacetime-dependent bilinear coupling. The equations are analysed using a general auxiliary field method, introduced here, which provides practical criteria for showing that a given operator is (semi)-Green-hyperbolic. The method goes beyond what is achieved in existing analyses of deformed equations, which for example place restrictions on the magnetic moment and electromagnetic potential that can be coupled to a Proca field. The theories considered can be quantized following a common pattern and all the examples treated in this work admit Hadamard states on any globally hyperbolic spacetime.
  As an application, the Proca-Klein-Gordon system is used to develop a measurement scheme sensitive to the Proca polarization, using a Klein-Gordon field as the probe. For a suitable family of $n$-particle Proca states, the leading-order probe response accords with Malus' law, confirming that this system acts as a polarization-sensitive detector.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic volumes of the quantum state space and mutually unbiased bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies on the geometrical properties of the state space of a finite-level quantum system have determined its volume and surface area. Building on this foundation, we derive explicit formulas for two additional intrinsic volume quantities.
  The question of whether a complete set of mutually unbiased bases exists in dimension $d$ can be equivalently framed as whether a specific convex polytope can be inscribed within the state space of a $d$-level quantum system. One motivation for our work was the hypothesis that a smaller intrinsic volume of the state space compared to the corresponding intrinsic volume of the mentioned polytope could rule out such an inscription. While our computations of these two intrinsic volumes do not lead to this conclusion, they nonetheless provide fundamental insights into the geometric structure of quantum state spaces. In particular, we show that these quantities can be used to rule out the existence of some unit-vector ``configurations'' (though not the one formed by the bases vectors of a complete set of mutually unbiased bases).</description>

      <title>Query complexities of quantum channel discrimination and estimation: A unified approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of quantum channel discrimination and estimation is to determine the identity of an unknown channel from a discrete or continuous set, respectively. The query complexity of these tasks is equal to the minimum number of times one must call an unknown channel to identify it within a desired threshold on the error probability. In this paper, we establish lower bounds on the query complexities of channel discrimination and estimation, in both the parallel and adaptive access models. We do so by establishing new or applying known upper bounds on the squared Bures distance and symmetric logarithmic derivative Fisher information of channels. Phrasing our statements and proofs in terms of isometric extensions of quantum channels allows us to give conceptually simple proofs for both novel and known bounds. We also provide alternative proofs for several established results in an effort to present a consistent and unified framework for quantum channel discrimination and estimation, which we believe will be helpful in addressing future questions in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using the heat kernel method, we construct diffeomorphism-covariant coherent states for the $SU(3)$ gauge group. We numerically demonstrate that these states exhibit the required semiclassical properties in the semiclassical limit: the peakedness property of the probability distribution and the peakedness property of the overlap function. We also provide the leading order term of the overlap amplitude in the combined limit where $t \rightarrow 0$ and $g\rightarrow g'$. This work provides the essential tool for deriving effective dynamics for $SU(3)$ gauge fields coupled to gravity via a coherent state path integral.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations in Interior Transmission Eigenvalues: Theory and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interior transmission eigenvalue problem (ITP) plays a central role in inverse scattering theory and in the spectral analysis of inhomogeneous media. Despite its smooth dependence on the refractive index at the PDE level, the corresponding spectral map from material parameters to eigenpairs may exhibit non-smooth or bifurcating behavior. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework identifying sufficient conditions for such non-smooth spectral behavior in the ITP on general domains. We further specialize our analysis to some radially symmetric geometries, enabling a more precise characterization of bifurcations in the spectrum. Computationally, we formulate the ITP as a parametric, discrete, nonlinear eigenproblem and use a match-based adaptive contour eigensolver to accurately and efficiently track eigenvalue trajectories under parameter variation. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical predictions and reveal novel non-smooth spectral effects.</description>

      <title>Generalizing quantum dimensions: Symmetry-based classification of local pseudo-Hermitian systems and the corresponding domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study conformal field theories (CFTs) and their classifications from a modern perspective based on the abstract algebraic formalism of symmetries or conserved charges, known as symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs). By studying the algebraic structure of the SymTFTs in detail, we found a natural generalization of the quantum dimensions associated with (pseudo-)Hermitian systems and (non)-unitary CFTs. These generalized data of SymTFTs provide classifications of massless and massive renormalization group flows, which will describe the quantum phase transitions of the corresponding pseudo-Hermitian systems. Moreover, our discussions straightforwardly enable one to relate a general class of coset constructions or level-rank dualities to domain wall problems between topological quantum field theories (or a series of corresponding quantum phase transitions related to the Higgs mechanism). Our work provides a systematic reduction and classification of algebraic data, symmetries, for pseudo-Hermitian systems based on ideas from established mathematical fields, linear algebra and ring theory.</description>

      <title>General multi-scale estimates for Lyapunov data of Perron-Frobenius matrices. The case of diluted autocatalytic chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autocatalytic chemical reaction networks are dynamical systems whose linearization around zero, dX/dt = AX, is represented by a Perron-Frobenius matrix A with positive Lyapunov exponent; this exponent gives the growth rate of the species concentration vector X in the diluted regime, i.e. in a vicinity of zero. We introduce here a new, general recursive procedure providing precise quantitative information about Lyapunov data, namely, the Lyapunov eigenvalue, and left and right eigenvectors. Our estimates are based on a multi-scale algorithm inspired from Wilson's renormalization group method in quantum field theory, and Markov chain arguments introduced in (Nghe &amp; Unterberger). They are compatible with the very scarce knowledge of kinetic rates (coefficients of A) generally available in chemistry, and take on the form of simple rational functions of the latter.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flux and its topological effects in Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm effect is a physical phenomenon in which the quantum state of a charged particle acquires a phase shift that is directly proportional to the magnetic flux, $\Phi$, due to a (classical) magnetic field, ${\mathbf B}$, which is confined in a spatial region from which the magnetic field cannot escape. Even though the charged particle is not allowed to interact with the magnetic field, it accumulates a phase shift that affects the interference pattern produced. Not surprisingly, this apparent nonlocality is puzzling and counter intuitive. In this work, we provide an explanation that explains the physics underlying this apparent nonlocality. We find that the role of the confined magnetic field is to impart a puncture in the configuration space, $\mathbb{R}^2$, of the charge. Therefore, the quantum state corresponding to the charged quantum particle acquires the phase shift due to its response to the modified topology of the configuration space, $\mathbb{R}^2-\{0\}$, corresponding to the charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fibonacci time quasicrystals can be approximated by temporal supercells to reveal a fractal collection of $k$ gaps, in which wave energy is amplified exponentially. These estimates are validated by the observation of "super" $k$ gaps that are independent of the duration of the temporal supercell. This approach predicts the regions of parametric amplification and provides accurate estimates of the energy growth rate.</description>

      <title>The Riemann Hypothesis Emerges in Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Riemann Hypothesis (RH), one of the most profound unsolved problems in mathematics, concerns the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Establishing connections between the RH and physical phenomena could offer new perspectives on its physical origin and verification. Here, we establish a direct correspondence between the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function and dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in two realizable quantum systems, characterized by the averaged accumulated phase factor and the Loschmidt amplitude, respectively. This precise correspondence reveals that the RH can be viewed as the emergence of DQPTs at a specific temperature. We experimentally demonstrate this correspondence on a five-qubit spin-based system and further propose an universal quantum simulation framework for efficiently realizing both systems with polynomial resources, offering a quantum advantage for numerical verification of the RH. These findings uncover an intrinsic link between nonequilibrium critical dynamics and the RH, positioning quantum computing as a powerful platform for exploring one of mathematics' most enduring conjectures and beyond.</description>

      <title>Relative entropy for locally squeezed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy serves as a fundamental measure of state distinguishability in both quantum information theory and relativistic quantum field theory. Despite its conceptual importance, however, explicit computations of relative entropy remain notoriously difficult. Thus far, results in closed form have only been obtained for ground states, coherent states, and, more recently, single-mode squeezed states. In this work, we extend the analysis to multi-mode squeezed states, imposing that the squeezing generators be local either in space or in spacetime, which results in a continuum of squeezed modes. We provide a detailed and self-contained analysis of such states for a free scalar quantum field on Minkowski spacetime, connecting also with older results on the essential self-adjointness of the Wick square, and showing that they lie in the folium of the Minkowski vacuum representation. Although the local squeezing is natural from a foundational standpoint, we uncover a severe incompatibility between locality and squeezing: the relative entropy between a locally squeezed state and the vacuum generally diverges, however small the squeezing is. This shows that while locally squeezed states are well-defined elements of the state space of a free quantum field, they are infinitely different from the vacuum, in contrast to coherent states whose relative entropy with respect to the vacuum is finite.</description>

Abstract: Actions in the Airy line ensemble represent distances from an infinitely far object. We characterize the Airy sheet by S(x,.)=T^x(.,1), where T^x is the unique action in the Airy line ensemble satisfying a growth condition depending on x.
  This provides a new simple framework for establishing convergence to the Airy sheet. We present simple conceptual proofs of such results in the case of Brownian last passage, the O'Connell-Yor semidiscrete polymer, the log-gamma polymer and the KPZ equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a microscopic, weak-coupling mechanism by which generic Chern bands relax toward ideal bands. We consider coupling interacting electrons to a Caldeira-Leggett like Ohmic bosonic bath. Using the Born-Markov approximation, Slater determinant states of a Chern band under Hartree-Fock approximation evolve toward Slater determinant states corresponding to an ideal Chern band. We validate our proposal by performing numerical simulation of a massive Dirac model, showing that the Berry curvature and quantum metric indeed co-evolve to saturate the trace condition. Our proposal provides a concrete dissipative route to realize ideal Chern bands, a fundamental building block for the stabilization of fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian simulation with explicit formulas for Digital-Analog Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital-analog is a quantum computational paradigm that employs the natural interaction Hamiltonian of a system as the entangling resource, combined with single qubit gates, to implement universal quantum operations. As in the case of its digital gate-based counterpart, designing digital-analog circuits that employ optimal quantum resources often requires an exceedingly large classical computational time. In this work we find a suboptimal solution to this exponentially large problem, showing that it can be solved within polynomial computational time. In particular, we provide an exact solution for the problem of expressing arbitrary two-body Hamiltonians as the sum of local unitary transformations of an arbitrary Ising Hamiltonian, with the total number of required terms being at most quadratic in system size. This allows us to design a digital-analog simulation protocol that avoids employing numerical optimization over a large parameter space at the preprocessing stage, minimizing computational resources and allowing for further scaling.</description>

      <title>Integrability for the spectrum of Jordanian AdS/CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jordanian deformations offer rare integrable realisations of non-AdS holography, whose solvability methods differ from conventional AdS/CFT examples. Here we study the $\mathfrak{sl}(2,R)$ sector of the Jordanian deformed $AdS_5\times S^5$ string and its weak-coupling spin chain counterpart: the $\mathrm{XXX}_{-1/2}$ model with a non abelian Jordanian Drinfel'd twist. While the twist breaks the usual highest-weight structure that underlies conventional Bethe ans\"atze, we show that the complete spectrum remains solvable within the Baxter framework. We argue that the functional form of the $TQ$-relation is unchanged, yet the structure of the $Q$-functions is nontrivially modified. This allows us to obtain analytic expressions at arbitrary spin chain length $J$, which match the deformed string spectrum at the one-loop level and to subleading order in the large-$J$ expansion, despite the severely reduced symmetry. Our results provide nontrivial tests of the Jordanian AdS/CFT correspondence and lay the groundwork for implementing the Separation of Variables program in non-abelian Drinfel'd-twisted models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: K\"ahler-Dirac (KD) spinors have generated excitement in the lattice gauge theory community, as a way to (i) deal with the ``fermion doubling" problems that plague ordinary (Dirac, Majorana, or Weyl) spinors when discretized on a lattice, and (ii) help explain the structure of the standard model. But if one naively quantizes this theory in Lorentzian signature, problems arise: half the KD fields have the ``wrong sign" Lagrangian, and give rise to negative norm states. Here we propose a new resolution/interpretation: the KD field actually lives on a two-sheeted spacetime, with the sheets related by $PT$ symmetry or, alternatively, by $i\leftrightarrow-i$. And, to avoid any unphysical interactions between the two sheets, the KD field obeys a reality condition (which we call the ``KD-Majorana condition"), which forces every particle on one sheet to be accompanied by a mirror (anti-)particle on the other sheet. We discuss how the standard model fits in this framework, how the fermion (kinetic and Yukawa) terms simplify, and how it may relate to the CPT-symmetric universe model.</description>

      <title>Discrete Contact Angles and Electric Field Singularity in Electrowetting: A Multi-Scale Complex Potential Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study constructed a multi-scale theoretical framework to resolve the electric field singularity at the Triple Contact Point in electrowetting. Utilizing conformal transformation and complex analysis, we established the structure for both the global potential and local field solutions, complementing the analysis with numerical methods. Our primary finding is that the contact angle $\theta$ is not continuously adjustable but is restricted to a discrete set of values, constrained by the characteristic exponent $\lambda$. Analysis of the complex potential established $\text{Re}[\lambda] \ge 1$ as the critical condition for a non-singular electric field; conversely, singular solutions ($\text{Re}[\lambda] &lt; 1$) are localized exclusively in the acute-angle regime ($\theta &lt; \pi/2$). The high-order solution region exhibits a degeneracy phenomenon at specific angles, implying the local field structure is geometrically stable and universally applicable for a wide range of permittivity ratios $k$. Furthermore, we determined that the onset of electric field oscillation requires the simultaneous satisfaction of two critical conditions: the geometry must approach a flat boundary ($\theta \to \pi$) and the dielectric ratio must approach homogeneity ($k \to 1$). These findings provide a solid theoretical basis for designing non-singular electric fields and mitigating the common contact angle saturation phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional quantum central limit theorem by quantum walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weak limit theorem (WLT), the quantum analogue of the central limit theorem, is foundational to quantum walk (QW) theory. Unlike the universal Gaussian limit of classical walks, deriving analytical forms of the limiting probability density function (PDF) in higher dimensions has remained a challenge since the 1D Konno distribution was established. Previous explicit PDFs for 2D models were limited to specific cases whose fundamental nature was unclear.
  This paper resolves this long-standing gap by introducing the notion of maximal speed $v_{\mathrm{max}}$ as a critical parameter. We demonstrate that all previous 2D solutions correspond to a degenerate regime where $v_{\mathrm{max}} = 1$. We then present the first exact analytical representation of the limiting PDF for the physically richer, unexplored regime $v_{\mathrm{max}} &lt; 1$ of a general class of 2D two-state QWs.
  Our result reveals 2D Konno functions that govern these dynamics. We establish these as the proper 2D generalization of the 1D Konno distribution by demonstrating their convergence to the 1D form in the appropriate limit. Furthermore, our derivation, based on spectral analysis of the group velocity map, analytically resolves the singular asymptotic structure: we explicitly determine the caustics loci where the PDF diverges and prove they define the boundaries of the distribution's support. By also providing a closed-form expression for the weight functions, this work offers a complete description of the 2D WLT.</description>

Abstract: The properties of the Wilson rational functions ${}_{10}\phi_9$ with three different normalizations are described. For one normalization, it satisfies an $R_{II}$ recurrence relation, whereas for the two other ones, they satisfy a generalized eigenvalue problem. The so-called Wilson rational algebra is introduced, which encodes algebraically the spectral properties of these special functions. Finally, different limits are considered, leading up to functions proportional to ${}_{4}\phi_3$. For one of these, the spectral algebra simplifies to yield the meta $q$-Racah algebra.</description>

Abstract: Gauge PDEs generalise the AKSZ construction when dealing with generic local gauge theories. Despite being very flexible and invariant, these geometrical objects are usually infinite-dimensional and are difficult to define explicitly, just like standard infinitely-prolonged PDEs. We propose a notion of a weak gauge PDE in which the nilpotency of the BRST differential is relaxed in a controllable way. In this approach a nontopological local gauge theory can be described in terms of a finite-dimensional geometrical object. Moreover, among the equivalent weak gauge PDEs describing a given system, a minimal one can usually be found and is unique in a certain sense. In the case of a Lagrangian system, the respective weak gauge PDE naturally arises from its weak presymplectic formulation. We prove that any weak gauge PDE determines the standard jet-bundle Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of the underlying gauge theory, giving an unambiguous physical interpretation of these objects. The formalism is illustrated by a few examples, including the non-Lagrangian self-dual Yang-Mills theory and a finite jet-bundle. We also discuss possible applications of the approach to the characterisation of those infinite-dimensional gauge PDEs that correspond to local theories.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the symmetry-resolved entanglement for non-invertible symmetries in $1{+}1$d conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a framework for computing the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy for non-invertible symmetries in $1{+}1$d conformal field theories has been proposed by Saura-Bastida, Das, Sierra and Molina-Vilaplana [Phys. Rev. D109, 105026]. We revisit their theoretical setup, paying particular attention to possible contributions from the conformal boundary conditions imposed at the entangling surface -- a potential subtlety that was not addressed in the original proposal. We find that the presence of boundaries modifies the construction of projectors onto irreducible sectors, compared to what can be expected from a pure bulk approach. This is a direct consequence of the fusion algebra of non-invertible symmetries being different in the presence or absence of boundaries on which defects can end. We apply our formalism to the case of the Fibonacci category symmetry in the three-state Potts and tricritical Ising model and the Rep($S_3$) fusion category symmetry in the $SU(2)_4$ Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory. We numerically corroborate our findings by simulating critical anyonic chains with these symmetries as a finite lattice substitute for the expected entanglement Hamiltonian. Our predictions for the symmetry-resolved entanglement for non-invertible symmetries seem to disagree with the recent work by Saura-Bastida et al.</description>

      <title>Context-Dependent Time-Energy Uncertainty Relations from Projective Quantum Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for defining context-dependent time distributions in quantum systems using projective measurements. The time-of-flow (TF) distribution, derived from population transfer rates into a measurement subspace, yields a time--energy uncertainty relation of the form $\Delta \mathcal{T} \cdot \Delta H \geq \hbar / (6\sqrt{3}) \cdot \delta\theta$, where $\delta\theta$ quantifies net population transfer. This bound applies to arbitrary projectors under unitary dynamics and reveals that time uncertainty is inherently measurement-dependent. We demonstrate the framework with two applications: a general time-of-arrival (TOA)-energy uncertainty relation and a driven three-level system under detuned coherent driving. The TF framework unifies timing observables across spin, atomic, and matter-wave systems, and offers an experimentally accessible route to probing quantum timing in controlled measurements.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic NISPT Phases, igNISPT Phases, and Mixed Anomalies of Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A bosonic non-invertible Symmetry Protected Topological (NISPT) phase in (1+1)-dim is referred to as $\textit{intrinsic}$ if it cannot be mapped, under discrete gauging, to a gapped phase with any invertible symmetry, that is, if it is protected by a non-group-theoretical fusion category symmetry. We construct the intrinsic NISPT phases by performing discrete gauging in a partial SSB phase with a fusion category symmetry that has a certain mixed anomaly. Sometimes, the anomaly of that symmetry category can be alternatively understood as a self-anomaly of a proper categorical sub-symmetry; when this is the case, the same gauging provides an anomaly resolution of this anomalous categorical sub-symmetry. This allows us to construct intrinsic gapless SPT (igSPT) phases, where the anomalous faithfully acting symmetry is non-invertible; and we refer to such igSPT phases as igNISPT phases. We provide two concrete lattice models realizing an intrinsic NISPT phase and an igNISPT phase, respectively. We also generalize the construction of intrinsic NISPT phases to (3+1)-dim.</description>

      <title>The Converse Madelung Question</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We pose the converse Madelung question: not whether Fisher information can reproduce quantum mechanics, but whether it is necessary. We work with minimal, physically motivated axioms on density and phase: locality, probability conservation, Euclidean invariance with a global phase symmetry, reversibility, and convex regularity. Within the resulting class of first order local Hamiltonian field theories, these axioms single out the canonical Poisson bracket on density and phase under the Dubrovin and Novikov assumptions for local hydrodynamic brackets. Using a pointwise, gauge covariant complex change of variables that maps density and phase to a single complex field, we show that the only convex, rotationally invariant, first derivative local functional of the density whose Euler Lagrange term yields a reversible completion that is exactly projectively linear is the Fisher functional. When its coefficient equals Planck constant squared divided by twice the mass, the dynamics reduce to the linear Schrodinger equation. For many body systems, a single local complex structure across sectors enforces the same relation species by species, fixing a single Planck constant. Galilean covariance appears through the Bargmann central extension, with the usual superselection consequences. Comparison with the Doebner and Goldin family identifies the reversible zero diffusion corner with linear Schrodinger dynamics. We provide operational falsifiers via residual diagnostics for the continuity and Hamilton Jacobi equations and report numerical minima at the Fisher scale that are invariant under Galilean boosts. In this setting, quantum mechanics emerges as a reversible fixed point of Fisher regularised information hydrodynamics. A code archive enables direct numerical checks, including a superposition stress test that preserves exact projective linearity within our axioms.</description>

      <title>Minimalistic Presentation and Coideal Structure of Twisted Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a minimalistic presentation for the twisted Yangian ${}^\imath\mathscr Y$ associated with split symmetric pairs (or Satake diagrams) introduced in arXiv:2406.05067 via a Drinfeld type presentation. As applications, we establish an injective algebra homomorphism from ${}^\imath\mathscr Y$ to the Yangian $\mathscr Y$, thereby identifying ${}^\imath\mathscr Y$ as a right coideal subalgebra of $\mathscr Y$ and proving its isomorphism with the twisted Yangian in the $J$ presentation. Furthermore, we provide estimates for the Drinfeld generators of ${}^\imath\mathscr Y$ and describe their coproduct images in terms of the Drinfeld generators of $\mathscr Y$ under this identification.</description>
