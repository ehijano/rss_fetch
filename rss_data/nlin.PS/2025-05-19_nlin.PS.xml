      <title>Self-trapping and skin solitons in two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of non-Hermitian photonics, we systematically investigate the spectral and dynamical aspects of two-dimensional nonlinear Hatano-Nelson lattices. In particular, we examine the interplay between self-trapping, due to nonlinearity, and propagation due to the non-Hermitian skin effect. These antagonistic effects give rise to amplitude thresholds - above which self-trapping in a single-channel dominates - that depend highly on the position of initial excitation and the degree of coupling asymmetry. Additionally, we identify two-dimensional skin soliton solutions and characterize their power thresholds and spatial profiles.</description>

      <title>Persistence of integrable wave dynamics in the Discrete Gross--Pitaevskii equation: the focusing case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expanding upon our prior findings on the proximity of dynamics between integrable and non-integrable systems within the framework of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, we examine this phenomenon for the focusing Discrete Gross-Pitaevskii equation in comparison to the Ablowitz-Ladik lattice. The presence of the harmonic trap necessitates the study of the Ablowitz-Ladik lattice in weighted spaces. We establish estimates for the distance between solutions in the suitable metric, providing a comprehensive description of the potential evolution of this distance for general initial data. These results apply to a broad class of nonlinear Schr\"odinger models, including both discrete and partial differential equations. For the Discrete Gross-Pitaevskii equation, they guarantee the long-term persistence of small-amplitude bright solitons, driven by the analytical solution of the AL lattice, especially in the presence of a weak harmonic trap. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical predictions about the proximity of dynamics between the systems over long times. They also reveal that the soliton exhibits remarkable robustness, even as the effects of the weak harmonic trap become increasingly significant, leading to the soliton's curved orbit.</description>

      <title>Evolution of perturbed long nonlinear plane, ring and hybrid surface waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolution of perturbed long nonlinear surface plane, ring and hybrid waves, consisting, to leading order, of a part of a ring and two tangent plane waves, is modelled numerically within the scope of the 2D Boussinesq-Peregrine parent system and reduced 2+1-dimensional cKdV-type equation derived from it. The latter leads to two different models, the KdV$\theta$ and cKdV equations, depending on whether we use the general or singular (i.e. the envelope of the general) solution of an associated nonlinear first-order differential equation. The KdV$\theta$ equation is used to analytically describe the intermediate 2D asymptotics of line solitons subject to sufficiently long transverse perturbations of arbitrary strength, while cKdV equation is used to describe outward and inward propagating ring waves with localised and periodic perturbations. Both models are used to describe the evolution of hybrid waves, where we show, in particular, that large lumps can appear as transient states in the evolution of such curved waves, contributing to the possible mechanisms of generation of rogue waves. Detailed comparisons are made between the modelling using the relevant reduced equations, including the KPII equation, and the parent system.</description>

      <title>Variational Principle for Optical Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: {The problem of laser beam concentration in a focal spot via wavefront variations is formulated as a maximization of the $beam$ $propagation$ $functional$ defined as the light power passing through aperture of an arbitrary shape located in the far field. Variational principle provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for at least the $local$ $maximum$ of the $beam$ $propagation$ $functional$. The wavefront shape is obtained as exact solution of nonlinear integral equation.}</description>

      <title>Oscillons in AdS space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study oscillons in a real scalar field theory in a (3+1)-dimensional AdS space with global coordinates. The initial configuration is given by a Gaussian shape with an appropriate core size as in Minkowski spacetime. The solution exhibits a long lifetime. In particular, since the AdS space can be seen as a box, the recurrence phenomenon can be observed under suitable conditions. In particular, as the AdS radius decreases, one can see a transition from a metastable oscillon to a stable oscillatory solution. Finally, we discuss some potential applications of the oscillon in the context of AdS/CFT duality.</description>

      <title>Elliptical stability of hopfions in bulk helimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are three-dimensional topological solitons with non-zero Hopf index ${\cal H}$ in the vector field of material's local magnetization. In this Letter elliptical stability of hopfions with ${\cal H}=1$ in a classical helimagnet is studied on the basis of a variational model. It is shown that, depending on their internal structure (vortex and antivortex tubes ordering), the hopfions can either be stable in a bulk magnet or unstable with respect to elongation along their central axis. It is found that the energy of stable hopfions is always below the energy of the $2\pi$-skyrmion lattice in the same material, suggesting the possibility to use $2\pi$-skyrmions as a precursor for hopfion nucleation. Stability diagram for hopfions on the magnetic anisotropy-field phase diagram is computed numerically. Explicit analytical expressions for some of its critical lines are derived.</description>
