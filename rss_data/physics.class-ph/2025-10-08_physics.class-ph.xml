      <title>The Feasibility of Acoustophoresis Multimodal Control</title>

Abstract: Actuating the acoustic resonance modes of a microfluidic device containing suspended particles (e.g., cells) allows for the manipulation of their individual positions. In this work, we investigate how the number of resonance modes $M$ chosen for actuation and the number of particles $P$ affect the probability of success $S$ of manipulation tasks, denoted Acoustophoretic Control Problems (ACPs). Using simulations, we show that the ratio of locally controllable volume to the state-space volume correlates strongly with $S$. This ratio can be efficiently computed from the pressure field geometry as it does not involve solving a control problem, thus opening possibilities for experimental and numerical device optimization routines. Further, we show numerically that in noise-free 1D systems $S \approx 1 - P/M$, and that in noisy 1D and 2D systems $S$ is accurately predicted by Wendel's Theorem. We also show that the relationship between $M$ and $P$ for a given $S$ is approximately linear, suggesting that as long as $P/M$ is constant, $S$ will remain unchanged. We validate this finding by successfully simulating the control of systems with up to $60$ particles with up to $600$ modes.</description>

      <title>General diffraction properties of aperiodic slit arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fraunhofer diffraction plays a vital role in experimental physics not only because it accurately describes the behaviour of light in the usual propagation limit, but also because it links the diffracted light with the scattering object through one of the most important mathematical transformations in physics: the Fourier transform. Acting as a probe in material characterisation as well as used as a tool for particle trapping or sensing, the pattern of interference maxima resulting from the Fraunhofer diffraction through periodic scattering is an ubiquitous routine. In this paper we analyse the Fraunhofer diffraction resulting from the much less studied aperiodic scatter of the light. We provide general conditions for the experimental observation of the peaks of interference maxima featured into patterns that display periodic structures on a number of distance scales. Our theoretical analysis is supported by thorough experimental demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear transmission line: shock waves and the simple wave approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transmission lines we consider are constructed from the nonlinear inductors and the nonlinear capacitors. In the first part of the paper we additionally include linear ohmic resistors. Thus, the dissipation being taken into account leads to the existence of \mbox{shocks -- the} travelling waves with different asymptotically constant values of the voltage (the capacitor charge) and the current before and after the front of the wave. For the particular values of ohmic resistances (corresponding to strong dissipation) we obtain the analytic solution for the profile of a shock wave. Both the charge on a capacitor and current through the inductor are obtained as the functions of the time and space coordinate. In the case of weak dissipation, we obtain the stationary dispersive shock waves. In the second part of the paper we consider the nonlinear lossless transmission line. We formulate a simple wave approximation for such transmission line, which decouples left/right-going waves. The approximation can also be used for the lossy transmission line, which is considered in the first part of the paper, to describe the formation of the shock wave (but, of course, not the shock wave itself).</description>

      <title>Causal Finite-Tick Dynamics as a Resolution of the Classical Radiation Reaction Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiation-reaction problem in classical electrodynamics has long resisted a consistent solution: the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac equation admits runaways and pre-acceleration, while the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation avoids these pathologies only as a reduction-of-order approximation. We introduce Tick-Tock (TT) dynamics, a causal finite-step formulation in which radiation recoil arises from discrete tick-by-tick updates. In the continuum limit, TT reproduces the LL equation, ensuring consistency with all experimental tests of radiation reaction. Unlike LL, however, TT does not rely on reduction of order: the recoil force is expressed directly through finite-difference changes of the Lorentz acceleration, making the Schott-like energy term explicit as a telescoping boundary contribution. This construction eliminates pre-acceleration and runaway solutions while providing a transparent stepwise energy balance. Moreover, the finite-tick structure introduces a natural high-frequency cutoff, suppressing unphysical growth in discontinuous fields. Taken together, TT offers a stable and causal reformulation of radiation reaction, consistent with LL in smooth regimes but extending its applicability to rapidly varying ones, and it suggests that characteristic timescales such as $\tau_{0}$ may play a special role.</description>

      <title>Electricity at the macroscale and its microscopic origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I define the fields that describe electrical macrostructure, and their rates of change, in terms of the microscopic charge density, electric field, electric potential, and their rates of change. To deduce these definitions, I lay some new foundations of a theory of how observable macroscopic fields are related to spatial averages of their microscopic counterparts.
  I find that the relationships between macroscopic fields are identical in form to the relationships between their microscopic counterparts, meaning that the $\vec{P}$ and ${\vec{D}}$ fields do not appear in them. Without invoking quantum mechanics, I derive the expressions for polarization current established by the Modern Theory of Polarization. I prove that the bulk-average electric potential, or mean inner potential, vanishes in a macroscopically-uniform charge-neutral material, and I show that when a crystal lattice lacks inversion symmetry, it does not imply the existence of macroscopic $\vec{E}$ or $\vec{P}$ fields in the crystal's bulk.
  I point out that symmetry is scale-dependent. Therefore, if anisotropy of the microstructure does not manifest as anisotropy of the macrostructure, it cannot be the origin of a macroscopic vector field. The macroscopic charge density vanishes in a material's bulk. Therefore, regardless of the microstructure, a macroscopic $\vec{E}$ field cannot emanate from the bulk. I find that all relationships between observable macroscopic fields can be expressed mathematically without introducing the polarization ($\vec{P}$) and electric displacement ($\vec{D}$) fields, neither of which is observable. I also show that most `quantum mechanical' aspects of the existing microscopic theory of electricity in materials are compatible with, or required features of, a statistical theory of classical particles whose charges and masses are comparable to those of electrons and nuclei.</description>

      <title>Real-time edge dynamics of non-Hermitian lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic forms of the Green's function at the open edges of general non-Hermitian band systems in all dimensions in the long-time limit, using a modified saddle-point approximation and the analytic continuation of the momentum. The edge dynamics is determined by the "dominant saddle point", a complex momentum, which, contrary to previous conjectures, may lie outside the generalized Brillouin zone. From this result, we obtain the effective edge Hamiltonians that evidently, as demonstrated by extensive numerical simulations, characterize the dynamics on the edges, and can be probed in real-time experiments or spectroscopies.</description>
