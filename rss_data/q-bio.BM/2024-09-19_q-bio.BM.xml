      <title>Assessing Reusability of Deep Learning-Based Monotherapy Drug Response Prediction Models Trained with Omics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer drug response prediction (DRP) models present a promising approach towards precision oncology, tailoring treatments to individual patient profiles. While deep learning (DL) methods have shown great potential in this area, models that can be successfully translated into clinical practice and shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying treatment response will likely emerge from collaborative research efforts. This highlights the need for reusable and adaptable models that can be improved and tested by the wider scientific community. In this study, we present a scoring system for assessing the reusability of prediction DRP models, and apply it to 17 peer-reviewed DL-based DRP models. As part of the IMPROVE (Innovative Methodologies and New Data for Predictive Oncology Model Evaluation) project, which aims to develop methods for systematic evaluation and comparison DL models across scientific domains, we analyzed these 17 DRP models focusing on three key categories: software environment, code modularity, and data availability and preprocessing. While not the primary focus, we also attempted to reproduce key performance metrics to verify model behavior and adaptability. Our assessment of 17 DRP models reveals both strengths and shortcomings in model reusability. To promote rigorous practices and open-source sharing, we offer recommendations for developing and sharing prediction models. Following these recommendations can address many of the issues identified in this study, improving model reusability without adding significant burdens on researchers. This work offers the first comprehensive assessment of reusability and reproducibility across diverse DRP models, providing insights into current model sharing practices and promoting standards within the DRP and broader AI-enabled scientific research community.</description>

      <title>Discrimination vs. Generation: The Machine Learning Dichotomy for Dopaminergic Hit Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual screening plays a pivotal role in early drug discovery, traditionally dominated by physics-based methods. While these approaches offer detailed insights, they are often hindered by high computational costs, limited sampling, and forcefield inaccuracies. Advances in Machine Learning (Ml)and Deep Learning (DL) present resource-efficient alternatives, with approaches like predictive geometric ML (EQUIBIND) and generative geometric ML (DIFFDOCK)showing promise in enhancing both efficiency and predictive capability. Here, we compare these two strategies, retrospectively and prospectively, for identifying novel agonists targeting the dopamine D2 receptor. To complement DIFFDOCK's dual functionality in protein-ligand conformer generation and confidence estimation, we adopted a complementary atom-type-based confidence model for EQUIBIND. This pipeline, termed the discriminative model, integrates a featurization step and an XGBoost classifier to differentiate between active and inactive ligands. The top-ranked compounds from both models were evaluated using an ultrafast dopaminergic biosensor assay, dLight. Our results demonstrate that the generative model achieved a higher hit rate, notably leading to the discovery of Compound 1, a nanomolar dopamine D2 receptor agonist with a novel scaffold.</description>

      <title>Self-Organizing Maps of Unbiased Ligand-Target Binding Pathways and Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interpretation of ligand-target interactions at atomistic resolution is central to most efforts in computational drug discovery and optimization. However, the highly dynamic nature of protein targets, as well as possible induced fit effects, makes difficult to sample many interactions effectively with docking studies or even with large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We propose a novel application of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) to address the sampling and dynamic mapping tasks, particularly in cases involving ligand flexibility and induced fit. The SOM approach offers a data-driven strategy to create a map of the interaction process and pathways based on unbiased MD. Furthermore, we show how the preliminary SOM mapping is complementary to kinetic analysis, both with the employment of network-based approaches and Markov State Models (MSM). We demonstrate the method by comprehensively mapping a large dataset of 640 {\mu}s of unbiased trajectories sampling the recognition process between the phosphorylated YEEI peptide and its high-specificity target Lck-SH2. The integration of SOM into unbiased simulation protocols significantly advances our understanding of the ligand binding mechanism. This approach serves as a potent tool for mapping intricate ligand-target interactions with unprecedented detail, thereby enhancing the characterization of kinetic properties crucial to drug design.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum cycle generative adversarial network for small molecule generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The drug design process currently requires considerable time and resources to develop each new compound that enters the market. This work develops an application of hybrid quantum generative models based on the integration of parametrized quantum circuits into known molecular generative adversarial networks, and proposes quantum cycle architectures that improve model performance and stability during training. Through extensive experimentation on benchmark drug design datasets, QM9 and PC9, the introduced models are shown to outperform the previously achieved scores. Most prominently, the new scores indicate an increase of up to 30% in the quantitative estimation of druglikeness. The new hybrid quantum machine learning algorithms, as well as the achieved scores of pharmacokinetic properties, contribute to the development of fast and accurate drug discovery processes.</description>
