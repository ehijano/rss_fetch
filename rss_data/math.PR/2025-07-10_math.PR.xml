      <title>Reversible Imprecise Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reversible Markov chains have identical forward and backward path distributions; this symmetry yields tractable stationary behaviour and powers algorithms from MCMC to network random-walk analysis. We extend reversibility to imprecise Markov chains, in which marginal and transition probabilities are specified by credal sets. Adopting the strong-independence interpretation of the Markov property, we reverse every precise chain compatible with a given credal specification and study the resulting ensemble. Because the reversed ensemble generally cannot be encoded by the usual forward model - a credal initial distribution pushed through a credal set of transition matrices - we introduce a symmetric representation based on credal sets of two-step joint distribution or edge-measure matrices. This framework is strictly more expressive, admits a natural reversal operation, and reduces reversibility to simple matrix symmetry. It also lets forward and reverse dynamics be described simultaneously within one closed, convex set, paving the way for efficient algorithms to evaluate expectations of path-dependent functionals. We illustrate the theory with random walks on graphs and outline procedures for computing lower expectations of path-based quantities.</description>

      <title>Elephant Random Walk with multiple extractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a generalized Elephant Random Walk in which the step is chosen by selecting $k$ previous steps with $k$ odd and then going in the majority direction with a probability $p$ and in the opposite direction otherwise. In the $k=1$ case the model is the original one and could be resolved exactly by analogy with Friedman's urn. However the analogy cannot be extended to the $k&gt;2$ case already. In this paper we show how to treat the model for each $k$ by analogy with the more general urn model of Hill, Lane and Sudderth. Interestingly for $k&gt;2$ we found a critical dependence from the initial conditions beyond a certain values of the memory parameter $p$, and regions of convergence with entropy that is sub-linear in the number of steps.</description>

      <title>Average Nikolskii factors for random diffusion polynomials on closed Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $1\le p,q\le \infty$, the Nikolskii factor for a diffusion polynomial $P_{\bf a}$ of degree at most $n$ is defined by $$N_{p,q}(P_{\bf a})=\frac{\|P_{\bf a}\|_{q}}{\|P_{\bf a}\|_{p}},\ \ P_{\bf a}({\bf x})=\sum_{k:\lambda_{k}\leq n}a_{k}\phi_{k}({\bf x}),$$ where ${\bf a}=\{a_k\}_{\lambda_k\le n}$, and $\{(\phi_k,-\lambda_k^2)\}_{k=0}^\infty$ are the eigenpairs of the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta_{\mathbb M}$ on a closed smooth Riemannian manifold $\mathbb M$ with normalized Riemannian measure. We study this average Nikolskii factor for random diffusion polynomials with independent $N(0,\sigma^{2})$ coefficients and obtain the exact orders. For $1\leq p&lt;q&lt;\infty$, the average Nikolskii factor is of order $n^{0}$ (i.e., constant), as compared to the worst case bound of order $n^{d(1/p-1/q)}$, and for $1\leq p&lt;q=\infty$, the average Nikolskii factor is of order $(\ln n)^{1/2}$ as compared to the worst case bound of order $n^{d/p}$.</description>

      <title>Balanced multi-species spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a special class of multi-species spin glass models: ones in which the species proportions serve to ``balance'' out the interaction strengths. For this class, we prove a free energy lower bound that does not require any convexity assumption, and applies to both Ising and spherical models. The lower bound is the free energy of a single-species model whose $p$-spin inverse-temperature parameter is exactly the variance of the $p$-spin component of the multi-species Hamiltonian. We further demonstrate that this lower bound is actually an equality in many cases, including: at high temperatures for all models, at all temperatures for convex models, and at zero temperature for pure bipartite spherical models. When translated to a statement about the injective norm of a nonsymmetric Gaussian tensor, our lower bound matches an upper bound recently established by Dartois and McKenna.</description>

      <title>Spectra of high-dimensional sparse random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the spectral properties of the high-dimensional random geometric graph $ G(n, d, p)$, formed by sampling $n$ i.i.d vectors $\{v_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$ uniformly on a $d$-dimensional unit sphere and connecting each pair $\{i,j\}$ whenever $\langle v_i, v_j \rangle \geq \tau$ so that $p=\mathbb P(\langle v_i,v_j\rangle \geq \tau)$. This model defines a nonlinear random matrix ensemble with dependent entries. We show that if $d =\omega( np\log^{2}(1/p))$ and $np\to\infty$, the limiting spectral distribution of the normalized adjacency matrix $\frac{A}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}$ is the semicircle law. To our knowledge, this is the first such result for $G(n, d, p)$ in the sparse regime. In the constant sparsity case $p=\alpha/n$, we further show that if $d=\omega(\log^2(n))$ the limiting spectral distribution of $A$ in $G(n,d, \alpha/n)$ coincides with that of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $ G(n,\alpha/n)$. Our approach combines the classical moment method in random matrix theory with a novel recursive decomposition of closed walk graphs, leveraging block cut trees and ear decompositions, to control $\mathbb E \mathrm{tr}(A^k)$. A refined high trace analysis further yields a near-optimal bound on the second eigenvalue when $np=\Omega(\log^4 (n))$, removing technical conditions previously imposed in (Liu et al. 2023).</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation in interacting particle systems on dynamic random networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a class of interacting particle systems on dynamic random networks, in which the joint dynamics of vertices and edges acts as one-way feedback, i.e., edges appear and disappear over time depending on the state of the two connected vertices, while the vertex dynamics does not depend on the edge process. Our goal is to estimate the underlying dynamics from partial information of the process, specifically from snapshots of the total number of edges present. We showcase the effectiveness of our inference method through various numerical results.</description>

      <title>Distributions based on Stable Mixtures and Gamma-Stable Convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores mixture distributions induced by a product of the positive stable random variable and a power of another positive random variable. The paper also considers the convolution of the stable density with a gamma density. These two constructs, mixing and convolution, suffice to generate a rich family of distributions. An example is the positive Linnik distribution, which is known to arise from a product involving stable and gamma random variables. We show that gamma-Linnik convolution gives the Mittag-Leffler distribution and the Mittag-Leffler Markov chain associated with the growth of random trees. Building on that, we construct a new family of distributions with explicit densities. A particular choice of parameters for this family yields the Lamperti-type laws associated with occupation times for Markov processes.</description>

      <title>Guided filtering and smoothing for infinite-dimensional diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the filtering and smoothing problems for an infinite-dimensional diffusion process X, observed through a finite-dimensional representation at discrete points in time. At the heart of our proposed methodology lies the construction of a path measure, termed the guided distribution of X, that is absolutely continuous with respect to the law of X, conditioned on the observations. We show that this distribution can be incorporated as a potent proposal measure for both sequential Monte Carlo as well as Markov Chain Monte Carlo schemes to tackle the filtering and smoothing problems respectively. In the offline setting, we extend our approach to incorporate parameter estimation of unknown model parameters. The proposed methodology is numerically illustrated in a case study for the stochastic Amari equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present sufficient conditions and criteria to establish general large and moderate deviation principles for multivalued McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs in short) by means of the weak convergence approach, under non-Lipschit assumptions on the coefficents of the equations. Furthermore, by applying the large deviation estimates we obtain the functional iterated logarithm law for the solutions of multivalued McKean-Vlasov SDEs.</description>

      <title>On the statistical nature of Betti numbers and Euler characteristic of smooth random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We represent excursion sets of smooth random fields as unions of a topological basis consisting of a sequence of simply and multiply connected compact subsets of the underlying manifold. The associated coefficients, which are non-negative discrete random variables, reflect the randomness of the field. Betti numbers of the excursion sets can be expressed as summations over the coefficients, and the Euler characteristic and the sum of Betti numbers can also be expressed as their (alternating) sum. This enables understanding their statistical properties as sums (or differences) of discrete random variables. We examine the conditions under which each topological statistic can be asymptotically Gaussian as the size of the manifold and the resolution increase. The coefficients of the basis elements are then modeled as Binomial variables, and the statistical natures of Betti numbers, Euler character and sum of Betti numbers follow from this fundamental property. We test the validity of the modeling using numerical calculations, and identify threshold regimes where the topological statistics can be approximated as Gaussian variables. The new representation of excursion sets thus maps the properties of topological statistics to combinatorial structures, thereby providing mathematical clarity on their use for physical inference, particularly in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Reaction-Diffusion Predator-Prey System under Random Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the long-term dynamics of a reaction-diffusion predator-prey system subject to random environmental fluctuations modeled by Markovian switching. The model is formulated as a hybrid system of partial differential equations (PDEs), where the switching between different ecological regimes captures the randomness in environmental conditions. We derive a critical threshold parameter that determines whether the predator species will eventually go extinct or persist. We further characterize the system's asymptotic behavior by providing a detailed pathwise description of the omega-limit set of solutions. This analysis reveals how the effects of random switching shape the distribution and long-term coexistence of the species. Numerical simulations are provided to validate and illustrate the theoretical findings, highlighting transitions between different dynamical regimes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that rigorously analyzes a spatially diffusive predator-prey model under Markovian switching, thereby bridging the gap between spatial ecology and stochastic hybrid PDE systems.</description>

      <title>Majority bootstrap percolation on the permutahedron and other high-dimensional graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Majority bootstrap percolation is a model of infection spreading in networks. Starting with a set of initially infected vertices, new vertices become infected once half of their neighbours are infected. Balogh, Bollob\'{a}s and Morris studied this process on the hypercube and showed that there is a phase transition as the density of the initially infected set increases. Generalising their results to a broad class of high-dimensional graphs, the authors of this work established similar bounds on the critical window, establishing a universal behaviour for these graphs. These methods necessitated an exponential bound on the order of the graphs in terms of their degrees. In this paper, we consider a slightly more restrictive class of high-dimensional graphs, which nevertheless covers most examples considered previously. Under these stronger assumptions, we are able to show that this universal behaviour holds in graphs of superexponential order. As a concrete and motivating example, we apply this result to the permutahedron, a symmetric high-dimensional graph of superexponential order which arises naturally in many areas of mathematics. Our methods also allow us to slightly improve the bounds on the critical window given in previous work, in particular in the case of the hypercube. Finally, the upper and lower bounds on the critical window depend on the maximum and minimum degree of the graph, respectively, leading to much worse bounds for irregular graphs. We also analyse an explicit example of a high-dimensional irregular graph, namely the Cartesian product of stars and determine the first two terms in the expansion of the critical probability, which in this case is determined by the minimum degree.</description>

      <title>Gr\"unbaum's inequality for probability measures with concavity properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06759v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A celebrated result in convex geometry is Gr\"unbaum's inequality, which quantifies how much volume of a convex body can be cut off by a hyperplane passing through its barycenter. In this work, we establish a series of sharp Gr\"unbaum-type inequalities - with equality characterizations - for probability measures under certain concavity assumptions. Of particular interest is the case of $s$-concave Radon measures. For such measures, we provide a simpler proof of known results and, more importantly, obtain the previously missing equality characterization. This is achieved by gaining new insight into the equality case of their Brunn-Minkowski-type inequality.
  Moreover, we show that these ``$s$-Gr\"unbaum'' inequalities can hold only when $s &gt; -1$. However, for convex measures on the real line, we prove Gr\"unbaum-type inequalities involving their cumulative distribution function. Finally, by applying the renowned Ehrhard inequality, we deduce an ``Ehrhard-Gr\"unbaum'' inequality for the Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$, which improves upon the bound derived from its log-concavity.</description>

      <title>Renormalised Models for Variable Coefficient Singular SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we prove convergence of renormalised models in the framework of regularity structures [Hai14] for a wide class of variable coefficient singular SPDEs in their full subcritical regimes. In particular, we provide for the first time an extension of the main results of [CH16, HS24, BH23] beyond the translation invariant setting. In the non-translation invariant setting, it is necessary to introduce renormalisation functions rather than renormalisation constants. We show that under a very general assumption, which we prove covers the case of second order parabolic operators, these renormalisation functions can be chosen to be local in the sense that their space-time dependence enters only through a finite order jet of the coefficient field of the differential operator at the given space-time point.

      <title>Nonparametric Bayesian Inference for Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Bayesian nonparametric estimation of a nonlinear reaction function in a reaction-diffusion stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). The likelihood is well-defined and tractable by the infinite-dimensional Girsanov theorem, and the posterior distribution is analysed in the growing domain asymptotic. Based on a Gaussian wavelet prior, the contraction of the posterior distribution around the truth at the minimax optimal rate is proved. The analysis of the posterior distribution is complemented by a semiparametric Bernstein--von Mises theorem. The proofs rely on the sub-Gaussian concentration of spatio-temporal averages of transformations of the SPDE, which is derived by combining the Clark-Ocone formula with bounds for the derivatives of the (marginal) densities of the SPDE.</description>

      <title>Analytic toolkit for the Anderson model with arbitrary disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Anderson model in one dimension is a quantum particle on a discrete chain of sites with nearest-neighbor hopping and random on-site potentials. It is a progenitor of many further models of disordered systems, and it has spurred numerous developments in diverse branches of physics. The literature is silent, however, on practical analytic tools for computing the density-of-states of this model when the distribution of the on-site potentials is arbitrary. Here, supersymmetry-based techniques are employed to give an explicit linear integral equation whose solutions control the density-of-states. The output of this analytic procedure is in perfect agreement with numerical sampling. By Thouless formula, these results immediately provide analytic control over the localization length.</description>

      <title>Liouville quantum gravity from random matrix dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03029v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the first connection between $2d$ Liouville quantum gravity and natural dynamics of random matrices. In particular, we show that if $(U_t)$ is a Brownian motion on the unitary group at equilibrium, then the measures $$ |\det(U_t - e^{i \theta})|^{\gamma} dt d\theta $$ converge in the limit of large dimension to the $2d$ LQG measure, a properly normalized exponential of the $2d$ Gaussian free field. Gaussian free field type fluctuations associated with these dynamics were first established by Spohn (1998) and convergence to the LQG measure in $2d$ settings was conjectured since the work of Webb (2014), who proved the convergence of related one dimensional measures by using inputs from Riemann-Hilbert theory.
  The convergence follows from the first multi-time extension of the result by Widom (1973) on Fisher-Hartwig asymptotics of Toeplitz determinants with real symbols. To prove these, we develop a general surgery argument and combine determinantal point processes estimates with stochastic analysis on Lie group, providing in passing a probabilistic proof of Webb's $1d$ result. We believe the techniques will be more broadly applicable to matrix dynamics out of equilibrium, joint moments of determinants for classes of correlated random matrices, and the characteristic polynomial of non-Hermitian random matrices.</description>

      <title>On the $\varepsilon$-Euler-Maruyama scheme for time inhomogeneous jump-driven SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of general SDEs with a jump integral term driven by a time-inhomogeneous Poisson random measure. We propose a two-parameters Euler-type scheme for this SDE class and prove an optimal rate for the strong convergence with respect to the $L^p(\Omega)$-norm and for the weak convergence, considering integration over $n$ uniform time-steps. One of the primary issues to address in this context is the approximation of the noise structure when it can no longer be expressed as the increment of random variables. We extend the Asmussen-Rosi\'nski approach to the case of a fully dependent jump coefficient and time-dependent Poisson compensation, handling contribution of jumps smaller than $\varepsilon$ with an appropriate Gaussian substitute and exact simulation for the large jumps contribution.
  For any $p \geq 2$, under hypotheses required to control the $L^p$-moments of the process, we obtain a strong convergence rate of order $1/p$. Under standard regularity hypotheses on the coefficients, we obtain a weak convergence rate of $1/n+\varepsilon^{3-\beta}$, where $\beta$ is the Blumenthal-Getoor index of the underlying L\'evy measure. We compare this scheme with the Rubenthaler's approach where the jumps smaller than $\varepsilon$ are neglected, providing strong and weak rates of convergence in that case too. The theoretical rates are confirmed by numerical experiments afterwards. We apply this model class for some anomalous diffusion model related to the dynamics of rigid fibres in turbulence.</description>

      <title>The link between hyperuniformity, Coulomb energy, and Wasserstein distance to Lebesgue for two-dimensional point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between three possible properties of stationary point processes: i) Finite Coulomb energy with short-scale regularization, ii) Finite $2$-Wasserstein transportation distance to the Lebesgue measure and iii) Hyperuniformity. In dimension $2$, we prove that i) implies ii), which is known to imply iii), and we provide simple counter-examples to both converse implications. However, we prove that ii) implies i) for processes with a uniformly bounded density of points, and that i) - finiteness of the regularized Coulomb energy - is equivalent to a certain property of quantitative hyperuniformity that is just slightly stronger than hyperuniformity itself.
  Our proof relies on the classical link between $H^{-1}$-norm and $2$-Wasserstein distance between measures, on the screening construction for Coulomb gases (of which we present an adaptation to $2$-Wasserstein space which might be of independent interest), and on recent necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of stationary "electric" fields compatible with a given stationary point process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We ask whether a stationary lattice in dimension $d$ whose points are shifted by identically distributed but possibly dependent perturbations remains hyperuniform. When $d = 1$ or $2$, we show that it is the case when the perturbations have a finite $d$-moment, and that this condition is sharp. When $d \geq 3$, we construct arbitrarily small perturbations such that the resulting point process is not hyperuniform. As a side remark of independent interest, we exhibit hyperuniform processes with arbitrarily slow decay of their number variance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to filtering, smoothing, and prediction of polynomial processes that are partially observed. These problems are known to allow for an explicit solution in the simpler case of linear Gaussian state space models. The key insight underlying the present piece of research is that in filtering applications polynomial processes and their discrete counterpart are indistinguishable from Gaussian processes sharing their first two moments. We describe the construction of these Gaussian equivalents of polynomial processes and explicitly compute optimal linear filters, predictors and smoothers for polynomial processes in discrete and continuous time. The consideration of Gaussian equivalents also opens the door to parameter estimation and linear-quadratic optimal control in the context of polynomial processes.</description>

Abstract: We derive explicit representations for the (Siegmund-) dual and the time-reversed flow of generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes whenever these exist. It turns out that the dual and the process corresponding to the reversed stochastic flow are again generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Further, we observe that the stationary distribution of the dual process provides information about the hitting time of zero of the original process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arbitrary matrices $M \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, randomly perturbed in an additive manner using a random matrix $R \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, are shown to asymptotically almost surely satisfy the so-called {\sl robust null space property}. Whilst insisting on an asymptotically optimal order of magnitude for $m$ required to attain {\sl unique reconstruction} via $\ell_1$-minimisation algorithms, our results track the level of arbitrariness allowed for the fixed seed matrix $M$ as well as the degree of distributional irregularity allowed for the entries of the perturbing matrix $R$. Starting with sub-gaussian entries for $R$, our results culminate with these allowed to have substantially heavier tails than sub-exponential ones. Throughout this trajectory, two measures control the arbitrariness allowed for $M$; the first is $\|M\|_\infty$ and the second is a localised notion of the Frobenius norm of $M$ (which depends on the sparsity of the signal being reconstructed). A key tool driving our proofs is {\sl Mendelson's small-ball method} ({\em Learning without concentration}, J. ACM, Vol. $62$, $2015$).</description>

      <title>SDEs with critical general distributional drifts: sharp solvability and blow ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish weak well-posedness for SDEs having discontinuous diffusion coefficients and general distributional drifts that may introduce blow up effects. Our drifts satisfy minimal assumptions, i.e.\,we assume only that the Cauchy problem for the Kolmogorov backward equation is well-posed in the standard Hilbert triple $W^{1,2} \hookrightarrow L^2 \hookrightarrow W^{-1,2}$. By a result of Mazya and Verbitsky, these assumptions are precisely those drifts that can be represented as the sum of a form-bounded component (encompassing, for example, Morrey or Chang-Wilson-Wolff drifts) and a divergence-free distributional component in the ${\rm BMO}^{-1}$ space of Koch and Tataru.
  We apply our results to finite particle systems with strong attracting interactions immersed in a turbulent flow. This includes particle systems of Keller-Segel type. Crucially, in dimensions $d \geq 3$, we cover almost the entire admissible range of attraction strengths, reaching nearly to the blow-up threshold.
  As a further application of our results for SDEs and of the theory of Bessel processes, we obtain an improved upper bound on the constant in the many-particle Hardy inequality. Consequently, the lower bound previously derived by Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Laptev, and Tidblom is shown to be close to optimal.</description>

Abstract: Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ random matrix, where each entry is an i.i.d.sub-exponential random variable with mean 0 and variance $\frac{1}{m^2}$. We demonstrate that, with high probability, the sub-exponential matrix $A$ can be used for the exact reconstruction of $s$-sparse vectors via $\ell_1$-minimization, provided that $m \ge C_1 s \log\left(\frac{C_2 n}{s}\right)$.

      <description>arXiv:2507.02518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive exponential ergodicity in relative entropy for general kinetic SDEs under a partially dissipative condition. It covers non-equilibrium situations where the forces are not of gradient type and the invariant measure does not have an explicit density, extending previous results set in the equilibrium case. The key argument is to establish the hypercontractivity of the associated semigroup, which follows from its hyperboundedness and its $L^2$-exponential ergodicity. Moreover, we obtain exponential ergodicity in the $L^2$-Wasserstein distance by combining Talagrand's inequality with a log-Harnack inequality. These results are further extended to the McKean-Vlasov setting and to the associated mean-field interacting particle systems, with convergence rates that are uniform in the number of particles in the latter case, under small nonlinear perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\phi$-Assouad dimensions are a family of dimensions which interpolate between the upper box and Assouad dimensions. They are a generalization of the well-studied Assouad spectrum with a more general form of scale sensitivity that is often closely related to "phase-transition" phenomena in sets.
  In this article we establish a number of key properties of the $\phi$-Assouad dimensions which help to clarify their behaviour. We prove for any bounded doubling metric space $F$ and $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $\overline{\operatorname{dim}}_{\mathrm{B}}F&lt;\alpha\leq\operatorname{dim}_{\mathrm{A}} F$ that there is a function $\phi$ so that the $\phi$-Assouad dimension of $F$ is equal to $\alpha$. We further show that the "upper" variant of the dimension is fully determined by the $\phi$-Assouad dimension, and that homogeneous Moran sets are in a certain sense generic for these dimensions.
  Further, we study explicit examples of sets where the Assouad spectrum does not reach the Assouad dimension. We prove a precise formula for the $\phi$-Assouad dimensions for Galton--Watson trees that correspond to a general class of stochastically self-similar sets, including Mandelbrot percolation. This result follows from two results which may be of general interest: a sharp large deviations theorem for Galton--Watson processes with bounded offspring distribution, and a Borel--Cantelli-type lemma for infinite structures in random trees. Finally, we obtain results on the $\phi$-Assouad dimensions of overlapping self-similar sets and decreasing sequences with decreasing gaps.</description>

Abstract: A nonnegative real function f is bell-shaped if it converges to zero at plus and minus infinity and the nth derivative of f changes sign n times for every n = 0, 1, 2, ... Similarly, a two-sided nonnegative sequence a(k) is bell-shaped if it converges to zero at plus and minus infinity and the nth iterated difference of a(k) changes sign n times for every n = 0, 1, 2, ... A characterisation of bell-shaped functions was given by Thomas Simon and the first named author, and recently a similar result for one-sided bell-shaped sequences was found by the authors. In the present article we give a complete description of two-sided bell-shaped sequences. Our main result proves that bell-shaped sequences are convolutions of P\'olya frequency sequences and what we call absolutely monotone-then-completely monotone sequences, and it provides an equivalent, and relatively easy to verify, condition in terms of holomorphic extensions of the generating function. We also prove that if f is a bell-shaped function, then f(k) is a bell-shaped sequence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a probability measure on cycle-rooted spanning forests (CRSFs) introduced by Kenyon. CRSFs are spanning subgraphs, each connected component of which has a unique cycle; they generalize spanning trees. A generalization of Wilson's celebrated CyclePopping algorithm for uniform spanning trees has been proposed for CRSFs, and several concise proofs have been given that the algorithm samples from Kenyon's distribution. In this survey, we flesh out all the details of such a proof of correctness, progressively generalizing a proof by Marchal for spanning trees. This detailed proof has several interests. First, it serves as a modern tutorial on Wilson's algorithm, suitable for applied probability and computer science audiences. Compared to uniform spanning trees, the more sophisticated motivating application to CRSFs brings forth connections to recent research topics such as loop measures, partial rejection sampling, and heaps of cycles. Second, the detailed proof \emph{\`a la} Marchal yields the law of the time complexity of the sampling algorithm, shedding light on practical situations where the algorithm is expected to run fast.</description>

      <title>On the Low-Temperature MCMC threshold: the cases of sparse tensor PCA, sparse regression, and a geometric rule</title>

Abstract: Over the last years, there has been a significant amount of work studying the power of specific classes of computationally efficient estimators for multiple statistical parametric estimation tasks, including the estimators classes of low-degree polynomials, spectral methods, and others. Despite that, our understanding of the important class of MCMC methods remains quite poorly understood. For instance, for many models of interest, the performance of even zero-temperature (greedy-like) MCMC methods that simply maximize the posterior remains elusive.
  In this work, we provide an easy to check condition under which the low-temperature Metropolis chain maximizes the posterior in polynomial-time with high probability. The result is generally applicable, and in this work, we use it to derive positive MCMC results for two classical sparse estimation tasks: the sparse tensor PCA model and sparse regression. Interestingly, in both cases, we also leverage the Overlap Gap Property framework for inference (Gamarnik, Zadik AoS '22) to prove that our results are tight: no low-temperature local MCMC method can achieve better performance. In particular, our work identifies the "low-temperature (local) MCMC threshold" for both sparse models. Interestingly, in the sparse tensor PCA model our results indicate that low-temperature local MCMC methods significantly underperform compared to other studied time-efficient methods, such as the class of low-degree polynomials.</description>

      <title>On noncentral Wishart mixtures of noncentral Wisharts and their use for testing random effects in factorial design models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that a noncentral Wishart mixture of noncentral Wishart distributions with the same degrees of freedom yields a noncentral Wishart distribution, thereby extending the main result of Jones and Marchand [Stat 10 (2021), Paper No. e398, 7 pp.] from the chi-square to the Wishart setting. To illustrate its use, this fact is then employed to derive the finite-sample distribution of test statistics for random effects in a two-factor factorial design model with $d$-dimensional normal data, thereby broadening the findings of Bilodeau [ArXiv (2022), 6 pp.], who treated the case $d = 1$. The same approach makes it possible to test random effects in more general factorial design models.</description>

      <title>Optimal low-rank approximations for linear Gaussian inverse problems on Hilbert spaces, Part II: posterior mean approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct optimal low-rank approximations for the Gaussian posterior distribution in linear Gaussian inverse problems with possibly infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert parameter spaces and finite-dimensional data spaces. We consider different approximation families for the posterior. We first consider approximate posteriors in which the means vary among a class of either structure-preserving or structure-ignoring low-rank transformations of the data, and in which the posterior covariance is kept fixed. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for these approximating posteriors to be equivalent to the exact posterior, for all possible realisations of the data simultaneously. For such approximations, we measure approximation error with the Kullback--Leibler, R\'enyi and Amari $\alpha$-divergences for $\alpha\in(0,1)$, and with the Hellinger distance, all averaged over the data distribution. With these losses, we find the optimal approximations and formulate an equivalent condition for their uniqueness, extending the work in finite dimensions of Spantini et al. (SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 2015). We then consider joint approximation of the mean and covariance, by also varying the posterior covariance over the low-rank updates considered in Part I of this work. For the reverse Kullback--Leibler divergence, we show that the separate optimal approximations of the mean and of the covariance can be combined to yield an optimal joint approximation of the mean and covariance. In addition, we interpret the joint approximation with the optimal structure-ignoring approximate mean in terms of an optimal projector in parameter space.</description>

      <title>Fractional Brownian Motion with Negative Hurst Exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is an important scale-invariant Gaussian non-Markovian process with stationary increments, which serves as a prototypical example of a system with long-range temporal correlations and anomalous diffusion. The fBm is traditionally defined for the Hurst exponent $H$ in the range $0&lt;H&lt;1$. Here we extend this definition to the strongly anti-persistent regime $-1/2&lt;H&lt;0$. The extended fBm is not a pointwise process, so we regularize it via a local temporal averaging with a narrow filter. The extended fBm turns out to be stationary, and we derive its autocorrelation function. The stationarity implies a complete arrest of diffusion in this region of $H$. We also determine the variance of a closely related Gaussian process: the stationary fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (fOU) process, extended to the range $-1/2&lt;H&lt;0$ and smoothed in the same way as the fBm. Remarkably, the smoothed fOU process turns out to be insensitive to the strength of the confining potential. Finally, we determine the optimal paths of the conditioned fBm and fOU processes for $-1/2&lt;H&lt;0$. In the marginal case $H=0$, our results match continuously with known results for the traditionally defined fBm and fOU processes.</description>
