      <title>Mesoscopic Bayesian Inference by Solvable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of data science and artificial intelligence has influenced physics in numerous ways, including the application of Bayesian inference. Our group has proposed Bayesian measurement, a framework that applies Bayesian inference to measurement science and is applicable across various natural sciences. This framework enables the determination of posterior probability distributions for system parameters, model selection, and the integration of multiple measurement datasets. However, a theoretical framework to address fluctuations in these results due to finite measurement data (N) is still needed. In this paper, we suggest a mesoscopic theoretical framework for the components of Bayesian measurement-parameter estimation, model selection, and Bayesian integration-within the mesoscopic region where (N) is finite. We develop a solvable theory for linear regression with Gaussian noise, which is practical for real-world measurements and as an approximation for nonlinear models with large (N). By utilizing mesoscopic Gaussian and chi-squared distributions, we aim to analytically evaluate the three components of Bayesian measurement. Our results offer a novel approach to understanding fluctuations in Bayesian measurement outcomes.</description>

      <title>Generative Diffusion Models for Fast Simulations of Particle Collisions at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In High Energy Physics simulations play a crucial role in unraveling the complexities of particle collision experiments within CERN's Large Hadron Collider. Machine learning simulation methods have garnered attention as promising alternatives to traditional approaches. While existing methods mainly employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), recent advancements highlight the efficacy of diffusion models as state-of-the-art generative machine learning methods. We present the first simulation for Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) at the ALICE experiment based on diffusion models, achieving the highest fidelity compared to existing baselines. We perform an analysis of trade-offs between generation times and the simulation quality. The results indicate a significant potential of latent diffusion model due to its rapid generation time.</description>
