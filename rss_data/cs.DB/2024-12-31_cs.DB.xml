      <title>Hades: Homomorphic Augmented Decryption for Efficient Symbol-comparison -- A Database's Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outsourced databases powered by fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) offer the promise of secure data processing on untrusted cloud servers. A crucial aspect of database functionality, and one that has remained challenging to integrate efficiently within FHE schemes, is the ability to perform comparisons on encrypted data. Such comparisons are fundamental for various database operations, including building indexes for efficient data retrieval and executing range queries to select data within specific intervals. While traditional approaches like Order-Preserving Encryption (OPE) could enable comparisons, they are fundamentally incompatible with FHE without significantly increasing ciphertext size, thereby exacerbating the inherent performance overhead of FHE and further hindering its practical deployment. This paper introduces HADES, a novel cryptographic framework that enables efficient and secure comparisons directly on FHE ciphertexts without any ciphertext expansion. Based on the Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE) problem, HADES provides CPA-security and incorporates perturbation-aware encryption to mitigate frequency-analysis attacks. Implemented using OpenFHE, HADES supports both integer and floating-point operations, demonstrating practical performance on real-world datasets and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Mind the Data Gap: Bridging LLMs to Enterprise Data Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leading large language models (LLMs) are trained on public data. However, most of the world's data is dark data that is not publicly accessible, mainly in the form of private organizational or enterprise data. We show that the performance of methods based on LLMs seriously degrades when tested on real-world enterprise datasets. Current benchmarks, based on public data, overestimate the performance of LLMs. We release a new benchmark dataset, the GOBY Benchmark, to advance discovery in enterprise data integration. Based on our experience with this enterprise benchmark, we propose techniques to uplift the performance of LLMs on enterprise data, including (1) hierarchical annotation, (2) runtime class-learning, and (3) ontology synthesis. We show that, once these techniques are deployed, the performance on enterprise data becomes on par with that of public data. The Goby benchmark can be obtained at https://goby-benchmark.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Explaining Black-Box Clustering Pipelines With Cluster-Explorer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explaining the results of clustering pipelines by unraveling the characteristics of each cluster is a challenging task, often addressed manually through visualizations and queries. Existing solutions from the domain of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) are largely ineffective for cluster explanations, and interpretable-by-design clustering algorithms may be unsuitable when the clustering algorithm does not fit the data properties.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce Cluster-Explorer, a novel explainability tool for black-box clustering pipelines. Our approach formulates the explanation of clusters as the identification of concise conjunctions of predicates that maximize the coverage of the cluster's data points while minimizing separation from other clusters. We achieve this by reducing the problem to generalized frequent-itemsets mining (gFIM), where items correspond to explanation predicates, and itemset frequency indicates coverage. To enhance efficiency, we leverage inherent problem properties and implement attribute selection to further reduce computational costs. Experimental evaluations on a benchmark collection of 98 clustering results, as well as a user study, demonstrate the superiority of Cluster-Explorer in both explanation quality and execution times compared to XAI baselines.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Time-Series Distance Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distance measures have been recognized as one of the fundamental building blocks in time-series analysis tasks, e.g., querying, indexing, classification, clustering, anomaly detection, and similarity search. The vast proliferation of time-series data across a wide range of fields has increased the relevance of evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of these distance measures. To provide a comprehensive view of this field, this work considers over 100 state-of-the-art distance measures, classified into 7 categories: lock-step measures, sliding measures, elastic measures, kernel measures, feature-based measures, model-based measures, and embedding measures. Beyond providing comprehensive mathematical frameworks, this work also delves into the distinctions and applications across these categories for both univariate and multivariate cases. By providing comprehensive collections and insights, this study paves the way for the future development of innovative time-series distance measures.</description>

      <title>Simplified integrity checking for an expressive class of denial constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data integrity is crucial for ensuring data correctness and quality, maintained through integrity constraints that must be continuously checked, especially in data-intensive systems like OLTP. While DBMSs handle common constraints well, complex constraints often require ad-hoc solutions. Research since the 1980s has focused on automatic and simplified integrity constraint checking, leveraging the assumption that databases are consistent before updates. This paper discusses using program transformation operators to generate simplified integrity constraints, focusing on complex constraints expressed in denial form. In particular, we target a class of integrity constraints, called extended denials, which are more general than tuple-generating dependencies and equality-generating dependencies. These techniques can be readily applied to standard database practices and can be directly translated into SQL.</description>

      <title>Data Poisoning Attacks to Local Differential Privacy Protocols for Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph analysis has become increasingly popular with the prevalence of big data and machine learning. Traditional graph data analysis methods often assume the existence of a trusted third party to collect and store the graph data, which does not align with real-world situations. To address this, some research has proposed utilizing Local Differential Privacy (LDP) to collect graph data or graph metrics (e.g., clustering coefficient). This line of research focuses on collecting two atomic graph metrics (the adjacency bit vectors and node degrees) from each node locally under LDP to synthesize an entire graph or generate graph metrics. However, they have not considered the security issues of LDP for graphs.
  In this paper, we bridge the gap by demonstrating that an attacker can inject fake users into LDP protocols for graphs and design data poisoning attacks to degrade the quality of graph metrics. In particular, we present three data poisoning attacks to LDP protocols for graphs. As a proof of concept, we focus on data poisoning attacks on two classical graph metrics: degree centrality and clustering coefficient. We further design two countermeasures for these data poisoning attacks. Experimental study on real-world datasets demonstrates that our attacks can largely degrade the quality of collected graph metrics, and the proposed countermeasures cannot effectively offset the effect, which calls for the development of new defenses.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce OneKE, a dockerized schema-guided knowledge extraction system, which can extract knowledge from the Web and raw PDF Books, and support various domains (science, news, etc.). Specifically, we design OneKE with multiple agents and a configure knowledge base. Different agents perform their respective roles, enabling support for various extraction scenarios. The configure knowledge base facilitates schema configuration, error case debugging and correction, further improving the performance. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate OneKE's efficacy, while case studies further elucidate its adaptability to diverse tasks across multiple domains, highlighting its potential for broad applications. We have open-sourced the Code at https://github.com/zjunlp/OneKE and released a Video at http://oneke.openkg.cn/demo.mp4.</description>

      <title>Mining Platoon Patterns from Traffic Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering co-movement patterns from urban-scale video data sources has emerged as an attractive topic. This task aims to identify groups of objects that travel together along a common route, which offers effective support for government agencies in enhancing smart city management. However, the previous work has made a strong assumption on the accuracy of recovered trajectories from videos and their co-movement pattern definition requires the group of objects to appear across consecutive cameras along the common route. In practice, this often leads to missing patterns if a vehicle is not correctly identified from a certain camera due to object occlusion or vehicle mis-matching. To address this challenge, we propose a relaxed definition of co-movement patterns from video data, which removes the consecutiveness requirement in the common route and accommodates a certain number of missing captured cameras for objects within the group. Moreover, a novel enumeration framework called MaxGrowth is developed to efficiently retrieve the relaxed patterns. Unlike previous filter-and-refine frameworks comprising both candidate enumeration and subsequent candidate verification procedures, MaxGrowth incurs no verification cost for the candidate patterns. It treats the co-movement pattern as an equivalent sequence of clusters, enumerating candidates with increasing sequence length while avoiding the generation of any false positives. Additionally, we also propose two effective pruning rules to efficiently filter the non-maximal patterns. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the efficiency of MaxGrowth and the quality of its generated co-movement patterns. Our MaxGrowth runs up to two orders of magnitude faster than the baseline algorithm. It also demonstrates high accuracy in real video dataset when the trajectory recovery algorithm is not perfect.</description>

      <title>Dive into Time-Series Anomaly Detection: A Decade Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in data collection technology, accompanied by the ever-rising volume and velocity of streaming data, underscore the vital need for time series analytics. In this regard, time-series anomaly detection has been an important activity, entailing various applications in fields such as cyber security, financial markets, law enforcement, and health care. While traditional literature on anomaly detection is centered on statistical measures, the increasing number of machine learning algorithms in recent years call for a structured, general characterization of the research methods for time-series anomaly detection. This survey groups and summarizes anomaly detection existing solutions under a process-centric taxonomy in the time series context. In addition to giving an original categorization of anomaly detection methods, we also perform a meta-analysis of the literature and outline general trends in time-series anomaly detection research.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: A Decade Review of Time-Series Clustering Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series, as one of the most fundamental representations of sequential data, has been extensively studied across diverse disciplines, including computer science, biology, geology, astronomy, and environmental sciences. The advent of advanced sensing, storage, and networking technologies has resulted in high-dimensional time-series data, however, posing significant challenges for analyzing latent structures over extended temporal scales. Time-series clustering, an established unsupervised learning strategy that groups similar time series together, helps unveil hidden patterns in these complex datasets. In this survey, we trace the evolution of time-series clustering methods from classical approaches to recent advances in neural networks. While previous surveys have focused on specific methodological categories, we bridge the gap between traditional clustering methods and emerging deep learning-based algorithms, presenting a comprehensive, unified taxonomy for this research area. This survey highlights key developments and provides insights to guide future research in time-series clustering.</description>

      <title>IRG: Generating Synthetic Relational Databases using Deep Learning with Insightful Relational Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic data has numerous applications, including but not limited to software testing at scale, privacy-preserving data sharing to enable smoother collaboration between stakeholders, and data augmentation for analytical and machine learning tasks. Relational databases, which are commonly used by corporations, governments, and financial institutions, present unique challenges for synthetic data generation due to their complex structures. Existing synthetic relational database generation approaches often assume idealized scenarios, such as every table having a perfect primary key column without composite and potentially overlapping primary or foreign key constraints, and fail to account for the sequential nature of certain tables. In this paper, we propose incremental relational generator (IRG), that successfully handles these ubiquitous real-life situations. IRG ensures the preservation of relational schema integrity, offers a deep contextual understanding of relationships beyond direct ancestors and descendants, leverages the power of newly designed deep neural networks, and scales efficiently to handle larger datasets--a combination never achieved in previous works. Experiments on three open-source real-life relational datasets in different fields at different scales demonstrate IRG's advantage in maintaining the synthetic data's relational schema validity and data fidelity and utility.</description>

      <title>The Design of an LLM-powered Unstructured Analytics System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLMs demonstrate an uncanny ability to process unstructured data, and as such, have the potential to go beyond search and run complex, semantic analyses at scale. We describe the design of an unstructured analytics system, Aryn, and the tenets and use cases that motivate its design. With Aryn, users specify queries in natural language and the system automatically determines a semantic plan and executes it to compute an answer from a large collection of unstructured documents. At the core of Aryn is Sycamore, a declarative document processing engine, that provides a reliable distributed abstraction called DocSets. Sycamore allows users to analyze, enrich, and transform complex documents at scale. Aryn includes Luna, a query planner that translates natural language queries to Sycamore scripts, and DocParse, which takes raw PDFs and document images, and converts them to DocSets for downstream processing. We show how these pieces come together to achieve better accuracy than RAG on analytics queries over real world reports from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Also, given current limitations of LLMs, we argue that an analytics system must provide explainability to be practical, and show how Aryn's user interface does this to help build trust.</description>
