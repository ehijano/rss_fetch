      <title>Initial-State Charge Density Predicts Final-State Net Charge Flow in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new class of charge-conjugation-odd flow observables and use them to investigate the dynamics of conserved currents in simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Inspired by the success of the initial energy and momentum distributions at predicting final-state anisotropic flow, we construct systematically-improvable initial-state estimators for final net-charge flow observables, which we validate with numerical simulations. This opens the possibility of a multitude of new charge-dependent probes of heavy-ion collisions of different systems and energies.</description>

      <title>The $\alpha+{}^2n+{}^2n$ 3-body cluster structures and dineutron breaking in ${}^8 \mathrm{He}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $0_2^+$ state of ${}^8\mathrm{He}$ has been discovered by a recent experiment, which suggested a developed cluster structure of spatially correlated neutron pairs, called "dineutrons" (${}^2n$). We aim to investigate the structure of ${}^8\mathrm{He}(0^+_1)$ and ${}^8\mathrm{He}(0^+_2)$ to clarify the monopole excitation mode in ${}^8\mathrm{He}$ system while focusing on the $\alpha+{}^2n+{}^2n$ cluster structures and the breaking of ${}^2n$ clusters. We apply a microscopic cluster model with the generator coordinate method for the $\alpha+{}^2n+{}^2n$ cluster and ${}^6\mathrm{He}+{}^2n$ cluster dynamics. The $p_{3/2}$-closure component, which is induced by the spin-orbit force, is also incorporated. The present calculation reasonably reproduces the experimental data of the properties of ${}^8\mathrm{He}$, such as $2n$ and $4n$ separation energies, energy spectra, and radii. The spatially developed cluster structure of the $0_2^+$ state is obtained. The $0_1^+$ and $0_2^+$ states have dominant components of $\alpha+{}^2n+{}^2n$ 3-body cluster, but contain significant ${}^2n$ breaking components which contribute to the energy gain and size shrinking of the ${}^8\mathrm{He}$ system. The monopole excitation in ${}^8\mathrm{He}$ is regarded as a radial excitation, which is similar to that in ${}^{12}\mathrm{C}$. The $\alpha+{}^2n+{}^2n$ cluster structures play a dominant role in ${}^8\mathrm{He}(0_{1,2}^+)$, and the mixing of the dineutron breaking contributes to significant structural effects.</description>

      <title>Seniority-two valence-shell building blocks of the octupole phonon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relative ordering of $J^-$ levels of multiplets resulting from two-body excitations, which include a $J^{\pi}=3^-$ state that can contribute to the octupole phonon, are investigated in a simplistic shell-model approach. To calculate the relative level ordering, harmonic oscillator wavefunctions and a residual $\delta$ interaction are used. The simplistic approach confirms for the particle-particle channel, the often stated preference of the $\Delta j=3, \Delta l =3$ subshell combination over the $\Delta j=3, \Delta l =1$ subshell combination through an enhanced energy gain. Furthermore, it is shown that, in the particle-hole channel, the gain is less pronounced for the $\Delta j=3, \Delta l =3$ subshell configuration. In combination with the overall structure of an oscillator shell, these results explain the comparatively low excitation energy for 3$^-_1$ excitations observed for the octupole-soft proton and neutron numbers predicted by various models.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star crust informed by nuclear structure data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a Bayesian analysis of the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) based on a wide set of Skyrme functionals, derived from previous nuclear physics inferences. The novelty of this approach lies in starting from the full multidimensional posterior distribution of nuclear matter parameters, consistent with a comprehensive set of static and dynamic nuclear structure observables. We construct unified EoSs for $npe\mu$ matter, where the inner crust of the NS is treated using an extended Thomas-Fermi method, providing for the first time a fully consistent Bayesian treatment of the correlation of bulk with surface as well as with spin-orbit and effective mass parameters. We then employ a standard Bayesian framework to identify those EoSs that satisfy astrophysical constraints from NS mass measurements, the tidal deformability from GW170817, and NICER mass-radius observations. We also examine NS observables, such as the crustal moment of inertia, which is crucial in understanding pulsar glitches. Compared to previous works, we observe an increase in both the NS surface thickness and the crustal moment of inertia.</description>

      <title>Bloch oscillation with a diatomic tight-binding model on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to explore a more efficient way to simulate few-body dynamics on quantum computers. Instead of mapping the second quantization of the system Hamiltonian to qubit Pauli gates representation via the Jordan-Wigner transform, we propose to use the few-body Hamiltonian matrix under the statevector basis representation which is more economical on the required number of quantum registers. For a single-particle excitation state on a one-dimensional chain, $\Gamma$ qubits can simulate $N=2^\Gamma$ number of sites, in comparison to $N$ qubits for $N$ sites via the Jordan-Wigner approach. A two-band diatomic tight-binding model is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the statevector basis representation. Both one-particle and two-particle quantum circuits are constructed and some numerical tests on IBM hardware are presented.</description>

      <title>Hidden-Charm Tetraquarks in a Mixture Model: Coupled-Channel Analysis with $c\bar{c}$ and Hadronic Molecular Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of the $X(3872)$ and other exotic hadrons has been a subject of extensive investigation since the first observation of the $X(3872)$ in 2003. While various theoretical models have been proposed, including hadronic molecular and compact tetraquark interpretations, some experimental evidence suggests that the $X(3872)$ may be a mixture state of a hadronic molecule and a $c\bar{c}$ core. In this work, we perform a systematic study of the hidden-charm tetraquark candidates $X(3860)$, $X(3872)$, and $Z(3930)$ using a coupled-channel model that incorporates both $c\bar{c}$ states and $D^{(*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ hadronic molecular components. The $c\bar{c}$ sector is described based on the constituent quark model predictions for the $\chi_{cJ}(2P)$ ($J = 0, 1, 2$) states, while the meson-meson interactions are modeled using pseudoscalar and vector meson exchange potentials. The model parameters are fixed to reproduce the masses of the $X(3872)$ and $Z(3930)$, and the resulting framework is used to predict the mass and structure of the $J^{PC} = 0^{++}$ state associated with the $X(3860)$. Our results support the mixture interpretation of these exotic hadrons, exhibiting strong attractions from the transition potential between $c\bar{c}$ and $D^{(*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ components. The molecular component is found to dominate in the $X(3872)$, while the $c\bar{c}$ component plays a more prominent role in the $X(3860)$ and $Z(3930)$.</description>

      <title>Lattice study of correlators of chromoelectric fields for heavy quarkonium dynamics in the quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a lattice calculation of the correlators of two chromoelectric fields in the adjoint representation connected by adjoint Wilson lines at non-zero temperature. These correlators arise in the study of quarkonium dynamics and of adjoint heavy quark diffusion in deconfined matter. We work in SU(3) gauge theory using either gradient flow or multi-level algorithms for noise reduction, and discuss the renormalization of the correlators on the lattice. We find that a Casimir factor rescaling relates the adjoint correlators corresponding to the diffusion of an adjoint heavy quark and the octet-octet quarkonium transitions to the chromoelectric correlator in the fundamental representation describing the diffusion of a heavy quark.</description>

      <title>The chromoelectric adjoint correlators in Euclidean space at next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of quarkonium created in heavy-ion collisions is intrinsically connected to the correlation functions of adjoint chromoelectric fields in quantum chromodynamics. We study such correlation functions in a weak-coupling expansion in a thermal medium. We identify three distinct gauge-invariant correlators, and evaluate them to next-to-leading order. Two of the resulting correlators turn out to be asymmetric. We pinpoint the source of this asymmetry to Matsubara zero modes associated with Wilson lines. The results are shown to agree well with recent lattice calculations at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inferences on covariant density functionals from multimessenger astrophysical data: Nucleonic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: [Background] Bayesian inference frameworks incorporating multi-messenger astrophysical constraints have recently been applied to covariant density functional (CDF) models to constrain their parameters. Among these, frameworks utilizing CDFs with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings furnishing the equation of state (EoS) of compact star (CS) matter have been explored. [Purpose] The aforementioned inference framework has not yet incorporated astrophysical objects with potentially extreme high masses or ultra-small radii among its constraints, leaving its flexibility and predictive power under such extreme parameters still unknown. [Method] We apply the Bayesian inference framework based on CDFs with density dependent couplings. The astrophysical data is expanded to include not only the latest multi-messenger constraints from NICER and gravitational wave events but also the highest measured mass to date for the ``black widow" pulsar PSR J0952-0607 and the mass-radius estimates for the ultra-compact, low-mass object HESS J1731-347. [Results] Our systematic Bayesian analysis indicates that our CDF models can support higher maximum masses for CSs, reaching up to $2.4$-$2.5\,M_{\odot}$. However, achieving sufficient softening of the EoS in the low-density regime to accommodate the HESS J1731-347 data remains challenging. Nonetheless, we are able to impose tighter constraints on the parameter space of CDF models, ensuring consistency with current nuclear experimental and astrophysical data. [Conclusions] CDF models with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings encompass a wide range of nuclear and astrophysical phenomena, providing a robust theoretical framework for interpreting compact objects. However, the predicted lower limit for the radii of low-mass stars is approximately 12 km, which stems from the restricted degrees of freedom in the isovector sector.</description>

      <title>On the mapping after and before truncation in the boson expansion theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the norm operator method, which extends and corrects the conventional boson expansion theories, we investigate two boson mappings of the boson expansion theory, the so-called mapping after truncation and the mapping before truncation. The difference between them stems from the treatment of the phonon excitation modes; those not adopted as boson excitation modes in the former mapping are first all adopted as boson excitation modes and then truncated later in the latter mapping. If and only if the commutation relations among the phonon operators are closed among the excitation modes adopted as the boson excitation modes in the mapping after truncation, the mapping after and the mapping before truncation coincide, not depending on the types, Hermitian and non-Hermitian. We also investigate the Park operator, which judges whether a boson state vector is physical, and reveal that the conventional claim, which claims that it is applicable only when the mapping is that of the whole fermion space, is incorrect.</description>

      <title>Pi in the Sky: Neutron Stars with Exceptionally Light QCD Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of axion condensed neutron stars that arise in models of an exceptionally light axion that couples to quantum chromodynamics (QCD). These axions solve the strong-charge-parity (CP) problem, but have a mass-squared lighter than that due to QCD by a factor of $\varepsilon&lt;1$. Inside dense matter, the axion potential is altered, and much of the matter in neutron stars resides in the axion condensed phase where the strong-CP parameter $\theta =\pi$ and CP remains a good symmetry. In these regions, masses and interactions of nuclei are modified, in turn changing the equation of state (EOS), structure and phenomenology of the neutron stars. We take first steps toward the study of the EOS of neutron star matter at $\theta =\pi$ within chiral effective field theory and use relativistic mean field theory to deduce the resulting changes to nuclear matter and the neutron star low-density EOS. We derive constraints on the exceptionally light axion parameter space based on observations of the thermal relaxation of accreting neutron stars, isolated neutron star cooling, and pulsar glitches, excluding the region up to $5 \times 10^{-7} \lesssim \varepsilon \lesssim 0.2$ for $ m_a \gtrsim 2\times 10^{-9}\,{\rm eV} $. We comment on potential changes to the neutron star mass-radius relationship, and discuss the possibility of novel, nuclear-density compact objects with $\theta =\pi$ that are stabilized not by gravity but by the axion potential.</description>

      <title>Can the speed of sound of quark-gluon plasma be measured from the multiplicity and mean $p_T$ of ultracentral heavy-ion collisions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mean transverse momentum $\langle p_T \rangle$ of hadrons has been observed experimentally and in numerical simulations to have a power-law dependence on the hadronic multiplicity $N$ in ultracentral relativistic heavy-ion collisions: $\langle p_{T} \rangle \propto N^{b_{\rm UC}}$. It has been put forward that this exponent $b_{\rm UC}$ is the speed of sound of quark-gluon plasma measured at a temperature determined from $\langle p_T \rangle$. We study step by step the connection between (i) the energy and entropy of hydrodynamic simulations and (ii) experimentally measurable observables. We show that an argument based on energy and entropy should yield an exponent equal to the pressure over energy density $P/\varepsilon$, rather than the speed of sound $c_s^2$. We discuss the importance of the ``effective volume'' needed for the thermodynamics arguments. Our results indicate that the agreement of $b_{\rm UC}$ with $c_s^2$ rather than $P/\varepsilon$ is accidental.</description>

      <title>Semisuper Efimov effect induced by resonant pair exchange in mixed dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new member to the class of semisuper Efimov effects, where an infinite number of bound states emerge with their binding energies obeying the universal scaling law $E_n\sim e^{-2(\pi n/\gamma)^2}$ for sufficiently high excitation $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Our system consists of a pair of two-component fermions in three dimensions at infinite scattering length, which furthermore interact with a boson confined in two dimensions so as to form a three-body bound state at zero energy. When another boson is added, the exchange of the resonant pair of fermions between two bosons leads to the semisuper Efimov effect of four such particles with the scaling exponent $\gamma$ determined by the mass ratio of bosons to fermions. If bosons exist in three dimensions, an infinite number of bound states do not emerge, but some of them may survive for a large mass ratio, making our findings potentially relevant to two-neutron halo nuclei as well as ultracold atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate comparisons between theoretical models and experimental data are critical for scientific progress. However, inferred physical model parameters can vary significantly with the chosen physics model, highlighting the importance of properly accounting for theoretical uncertainties. In this article, we explicitly incorporate these uncertainties using Gaussian processes that model the domain of validity of theoretical models, integrating prior knowledge about where a theory applies and where it does not. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using two systems: a simple ball drop experiment and multi-stage heavy-ion simulations. In both cases incorporating model discrepancy leads to improved parameter estimates, with systematic improvements observed as additional experimental observables are integrated.</description>
