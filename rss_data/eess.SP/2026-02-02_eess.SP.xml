      <title>Compressive Beam-Pattern-Aware Near-field Beam Training via Total Variation Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large antenna arrays envisioned for 6G incurs near-field effect, where steering vector depends on angles and range simultaneously. Polar-domain near-field codebooks can focus energy accurately but incur extra two-dimensional sweeping overhead; compressed-sensing (CS) approaches with Gaussian-masked DFT sensing offer a lower-overhead alternative. This letter revisits near-field beam training using conventional DFT codebooks. Unlike far-field responses that concentrate energy on a few isolated DFT beams, near-field responses produce contiguous, plateau-like energy segments with sharp transitions in the DFT beamspace. Pure LASSO denoising, therefore, tends to over-shrink magnitudes and fragment plateaus. We propose a beam-pattern-preserving beam training scheme for multiple-path scenarios that combines LASSO with a lightweight denoising pipeline: LASSO to suppress small-amplitude noise, followed by total variation (TV) to maintain plateau levels and edge sharpness. The two proximal steps require no near-field codebook design. Simulations with Gaussian pilots show consistent NMSE and cosine-similarity gains over least squares and LASSO at the same pilot budget.</description>

      <title>Dual-Diode Unified SWIPT for High Data Rates with Adaptive Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their low-complexity and energy-efficiency, unified simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (U-SWIPT) receivers are especially suitable for low-power Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Towards accurately modeling practical operating conditions, in this study, we provide a unified transient framework for a dual-diode U-SWIPT that jointly accounts for diode nonlinearity and capacitor-induced memory effects. The proposed model accurately describes the inherent time dependence of the rectifier, highlighting its fundamental impact on both energy harvesting (EH) and information decoding (ID) processes. Based on the provided memory-aware model, we design a low-complexity adaptive detector that learns the nonlinear state transition dynamics and performs decision-directed detection with linear complexity. The proposed detection scheme approaches maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) performance in memory-dominated regimes, while avoiding the exponential search required by classical sequence detection. Overall, these results demonstrate that properly exploiting rectifier memory provides a better tradeoff between data rate and reliability for U-SWIPT receivers.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality of Rate Balancing for Max-Min Fair Multicasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The max-min fair (MMF) multicasting problem is known to be NP-hard. In this work, we analytically derive the optimal solution to this NP-hard problem and establish the equivalence between rate balancing and the optimal MMF multicasting solution under certain conditions. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose a low-complexity algorithm for MMF multicasting that yields closed-form solutions. Simulation results validate our analysis and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods while being computationally more efficient.</description>

      <title>Superimposed-Pilot OTFS Under Fractional Doppler: Modular End-to-End Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a promising candidate to overcome the performance degradation of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), which are commonly encountered in high-mobility wireless communication scenarios. However, conventional OTFS transceivers rely on multiple separately designed signal-processing modules, whose isolated optimization often limits global optimal performance. To overcome limitations, this paper proposes a modular deep learning (DL) based end-to-end OTFS transceiver framework that consists of trainable and interchangeable neural network (NN) modules, including constellation mapping/demapping, superimposed pilot placement, inverse Zak (IZak)/Zak transforms, and a U-Net-enhanced NN tailored for joint channel estimation and detection (JCED), while explicitly accounting for the impact of the cyclic prefix. This physics-informed modular architecture provides flexibility for integration with conventional OTFS systems and adaptability to different communication configurations. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed design significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of both normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and detection reliability, maintaining robustness under integer and fractional Doppler conditions. The results highlight the potential of DL-based end-to-end optimization to enable practical and high-performance OTFS transceivers for next-generation high-mobility networks.</description>

      <title>SORIS: A Self-Organized Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Architecture for Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) hardware architecture, called self-organized RIS (SORIS), is proposed. The architecture incorporates a microcontroller connected to a single-antenna receiver operating at the same frequency as the RIS unit elements, operating either in transmission or reflection mode. The transmitting RIS elements enable the low latency estimation of both the incoming and outcoming channels at the microcontroller's side. In addition, a machine learning approach for estimating the incoming and outcoming channels involving the remaining RIS elements operating in reflection mode is devised. Specifically, by appropriately selecting a small number of elements in transmission mode, and based on the channel reciprocity principle, the respective channel coefficients are first estimated, which are then fed to a low-complexity neural network that, leveraging spatial channel correlation over RIS elements, returns predictions of the channel coefficients referring to the rest of elements. In this way, the SORIS microcontroller acquires channel state information, and accordingly reconfigures the panel's metamaterials to assist data communication between a transmitter and a receiver, without the need for separate connections with them. Moreover, the impact of channel estimation on the proposed solution, and a detailed complexity analysis for the used model, as well as a wiring density and control signaling analysis, is performed. The feasibility and efficacy of the proposed self-organized RIS design and operation are verified by Monte Carlo simulations, providing useful guidelines on the selection of the RIS elements for operating in transmission mode for initial channel estimation.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Matrix Completion Under Geometric Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The completion of a Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) from sparse and noisy observations is a fundamental challenge in signal processing, with applications in sensor network localization, acoustic room reconstruction, molecular conformation, and manifold learning. Traditional approaches, such as rank-constrained optimization and semidefinite programming, enforce geometric constraints but often struggle under sparse or noisy conditions. This paper introduces a hierarchical Bayesian framework that places structured priors directly on the latent point set generating the EDM, naturally embedding geometric constraints. By incorporating a hierarchical prior on latent point set, the model enables automatic regularization and robust noise handling. Posterior inference is performed using a Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs sampler to handle coupled latent point posterior. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate improved reconstruction accuracy compared to deterministic baselines in sparse regimes.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic MIMO Particle Communication Channel with Random Advection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, receiver diversity in advection-dominated diffusion-advection channels is investigated. Strong directed flow fundamentally alters the communication-theoretic properties of molecular communication systems (MC). Specifically, advection preserves the temporal ordering and shape of transmitted pulses, enabling pulse-based and higher-order modulation schemes that are typically infeasible in purely diffusive environments. Focusing on a single transmitter and a single type of information molecule, it is demonstrated that spatially distributed receivers can observe distinct realizations of the same transmitted signal, giving rise to diversity gain. Several receiver combining strategies are evaluated and shown to improve detection performance compared to single-receiver operation, particularly in low-to-moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. The results provide a structured framework for understanding receiver-side diversity in molecular communication, highlighting the role of advection as a key enabler for reliable pulse-based signaling. This perspective establishes a foundation for future studies on advanced modulation, joint equalization and detection, and multi-molecule MIMO extensions that can further enhance the performance and physical applicability of MC systems.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Systems under Channel Uncertainty and Hardware Impairments: Trends, Challenges, and Future Research Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving spatially reconfigurable, compact, and energy-efficient wireless communications in beyond fifth-generation (B5G) and sixth-generation (6G) networks. By dynamically repositioning a liquid-based radiating element within a confined physical structure, FAS can exploit spatial diversity without relying on multiple fixed antenna elements. This spatial mobility provides a new degree of freedom for mitigating channel fading and interference, while maintaining low hardware complexity and power consumption. However, the performance of FAS in realistic deployments is strongly affected by channel uncertainty, hardware nonidealities, and mechanical constraints, all of which can substantially deviate from idealized analytical assumptions. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the operation and design of FAS under such practical considerations. Key aspects include the characterization of spatio-temporal channel uncertainty, analysis of hardware and mechanical impairments such as RF nonlinearity, port coupling, and fluid response delay, as well as the exploration of robust design and learning-based control strategies to enhance system reliability. Finally, open research directions are identified, aiming to guide future developments toward robust, adaptive, and cross-domain FAS design for next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Signal Recovery in Nonlinear Systems with Spectrally Separated Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upper Mid-Band (FR3, 7-24 GHz) receivers for 6G must operate over wide bandwidths in dense spectral environments, making them particularly vulnerable to strong adjacent-band interference and front-end nonlinearities. While conventional linear receivers can suppress spectrally separated interferers under ideal hardware assumptions, receiver saturation and finite-resolution quantization cause nonlinear spectral leakage that severely degrades performance in practical wideband radios. We study the recovery of a desired signal from nonlinear receiver observations corrupted by a high-power out-of-band interferer. The receiver front-end is modeled as a smooth, memoryless nonlinearity followed by additive noise and optional quantization. To mitigate these nonlinear and quantization-induced distortions, we propose a learned multi-layer Vector Approximate Message Passing (LMLVAMP) algorithm that incorporates spectral priors with neural network based denoising. Simulation results demonstrate significant performance gains over conventional methods, particularly in high-interference regimes representative of FR3 coexistence scenarios.</description>

      <title>Interpolation Techniques for Fast Channel Estimation in Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ray tracing is increasingly utilized in wireless system simulations to estimate channel paths. In large-scale simulations with complex environments, ray tracing at high resolution can be computationally demanding. To reduce the computation, this paper presents a novel method for conducting ray tracing at a coarse set of reference points and interpolating the channels at other locations. The key insight is to interpolate the images of reflected points. In addition to the computational savings, the method directly captures the spherical nature of each wavefront enabling fast and accurate computation of channels using line-of-sight MIMO and other wide aperture techniques. Through empirical validation and comparison with exhaustive ray tracing, we demonstrate the efficacy and practicality of our approach in achieving high-fidelity channel predictions with reduced computational resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating clinical reports that summarize abnormal patterns, diagnostic findings, and clinical interpretations from long-term EEG recordings remains labor-intensive. We curate a large-scale clinical EEG dataset with $9{,}922$ reports paired with approximately $11{,}000$ hours of EEG recordings from $9{,}048$ patients. We therefore develop CELM, the first clinical EEG-to-Language foundation model capable of summarizing long-duration, variable-length EEG recordings and performing end-to-end clinical report generation at multiple scales, including recording description, background activity, epileptiform abnormalities, events/seizures, and impressions. Experimental results show that, with patient history supervision, our method achieves $70\%$--$95\%$ average relative improvements in standard generation metrics (e.g., ROUGE-1 and METEOR) from $0.2$--$0.3$ to $0.4$--$0.6$. In the zero-shot setting without patient history, CELM attains generation scores in the range of $0.43$--$0.52$, compared to baselines of $0.17$--$0.26$. CELM integrates pretrained EEG foundation models with language models to enable scalable multimodal learning. We release our model and benchmark construction pipeline at [URL].</description>

      <title>Brain-Informed Speech Separation for Cochlear Implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a brain-informed speech separation method for cochlear implants (CIs) that uses electroencephalography (EEG)-derived attention cues to guide enhancement toward the attended speaker. An attention-guided network fuses audio mixtures with EEG features through a lightweight fusion layer, producing attended-source electrodograms for CI stimulation while resolving the label-permutation ambiguity of audio-only separators. Robustness to degraded attention cues is improved with a mixed curriculum that varies cue quality during training, yielding stable gains even when EEG-speech correlation is moderate. In multi-talker conditions, the model achieves higher signal-to-interference ratio improvements than an audio-only electrodogram baseline while remaining slightly smaller (167k vs. 171k parameters). With 2 ms algorithmic latency and comparable cost, the approach highlights the promise of coupling auditory and neural cues for cognitively adaptive CI processing.</description>

      <title>Forecasting in the presence of scale-free noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extraction of signals from noise is a common problem in all areas of science and engineering. A particularly useful version is that of forecasting: determining a causal filter that estimates a future value of a hidden process from past observations. Current techniques for deriving the filter require that the noise be well described by rational power spectra. However, scale-free noises, whose spectra scale as a non-integer power of frequency, are ubiquitous in practice. We establish a method, together with performance guarantees, that solves the forecasting problem in the presence of scale-free noise. Via the duality between estimation and control, our technique can be used to design control for distributed systems. These results will have wide-ranging applications in neuroscience, finance, fluid dynamics, and quantum measurements.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Domain-Adaptive Self-Supervised Learning for Clinical Voice-Based Disease Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The human voice is a promising non-invasive digital biomarker, yet deep learning for voice-based health analysis is hindered by data scarcity and domain mismatch, where models pre-trained on general audio fail to capture the subtle pathological features characteristic of clinical voice data. To address these challenges, we investigate domain-adaptive self-supervised learning (SSL) with Masked Autoencoders (MAE) and demonstrate that standard configurations are suboptimal for health-related audio. Using the Bridge2AI-Voice dataset, a multi-institutional collection of pathological voices, we systematically examine three performance-critical factors: reconstruction loss (Mean Absolute Error vs. Mean Squared Error), normalization (patch-wise vs. global), and masking (random vs. content-aware). Our optimized design, which combines Mean Absolute Error (MA-Error) loss, patch-wise normalization, and content-aware masking, achieves a Macro F1 of $0.688 \pm 0.009$ (over 10 fine-tuning runs), outperforming a strong out-of-domain SSL baseline pre-trained on large-scale general audio, which has a Macro F1 of $0.663 \pm 0.011$. The results show that MA-Error loss improves robustness and content-aware masking boosts performance by emphasizing information-rich regions. These findings highlight the importance of component-level optimization in data-constrained medical applications that rely on audio data.</description>

Abstract: Indoor localization is a critical enabler for a wide range of location-based services in smart environments, including navigation, asset tracking, and safety-critical applications. Recent graph-based models leverage spatial relationships between Wire-less Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Access Points (APs) and devices, offering finer localization granularity, but fall short in quantifying prediction uncertainty, a key requirement for real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Graph Transformer (SAC-GT), a framework for accurate and reliable indoor localization. SAC-GT integrates a Graph Transformer (GT) model that captures network's spatial topology and signal strength dynamics, with a novel Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Prediction (SACP) method that provides region-specific uncertainty estimates. This allows SAC-GT to produce not only precise two-dimensional (2D) location predictions but also statistically valid confidence regions tailored to varying environmental conditions. Extensive evaluations on a large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed SAC-GT solution achieves state-of-the-art localization accuracy while delivering robust and spatially adaptive reliability guarantees.</description>

      <title>Capacity of Two-User Wireless Systems Aided by Movable Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable signals have emerged as a third approach to enable smart radio environments (SREs), complementing reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and flexible antennas. This paper investigates their potential to enhance multi-user wireless systems. Focusing on two-user systems, we characterize the capacity regions of the multiple access channel (MAC) and broadcast channel (BC). Interestingly, movable signals can dynamically adjust the operating frequency to orthogonalize the user channels, thereby significantly expanding the capacity regions. We also study frequency optimization, constraining it in a limited frequency range, and show that movable signals provide up to 45% sum rate gain over fixed signals.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Abundance Maps for Unsupervised Super-Resolution of Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (HS-SISR) aims to enhance the spatial resolution of hyperspectral images to fully exploit their spectral information. While considerable progress has been made in this field, most existing methods are supervised and require ground truth data for training-data that is often unavailable in practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel unsupervised training framework for HS-SISR, based on synthetic abundance data. The approach begins by unmixing the hyperspectral image into endmembers and abundances. A neural network is then trained to perform abundance super-resolution using synthetic abundances only. These synthetic abundance maps are generated from a dead leaves model whose characteristics are inherited from the low-resolution image to be super-resolved. This trained network is subsequently used to enhance the spatial resolution of the original image's abundances, and the final super-resolution hyperspectral image is reconstructed by combining them with the endmembers. Experimental results demonstrate both the training value of the synthetic data and the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Real-Time Privacy-Preserving Behavior Recognition System via Edge-Cloud Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As intelligent sensing expands into high-privacy environments such as restrooms and changing rooms, the field faces a critical privacy-security paradox. Traditional RGB surveillance raises significant concerns regarding visual recording and storage, while existing privacy-preserving methods-ranging from physical desensitization to traditional cryptographic or obfuscation techniques-often compromise semantic understanding capabilities or fail to guarantee mathematical irreversibility against reconstruction attacks. To address these challenges, this study presents a novel privacy-preserving perception technology based on the AI Flow theoretical framework and an edge-cloud collaborative architecture. The proposed methodology integrates source desensitization with irreversible feature mapping. Leveraging Information Bottleneck theory, the edge device performs millisecond-level processing to transform raw imagery into abstract feature vectors via non-linear mapping and stochastic noise injection. This process constructs a unidirectional information flow that strips identity-sensitive attributes, rendering the reconstruction of original images impossible. Subsequently, the cloud platform utilizes multimodal family models to perform joint inference solely on these abstract vectors to detect abnormal behaviors. This approach fundamentally severs the path to privacy leakage at the architectural level, achieving a breakthrough from video surveillance to de-identified behavior perception and offering a robust solution for risk management in high-sensitivity public spaces.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Convolutional Sparse Autoencoders for Robust Movement Classification from Low-Density sEMG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable control of myoelectric prostheses is often hindered by high inter-subject variability and the clinical impracticality of high-density sensor arrays. This study proposes a deep learning framework for accurate gesture recognition using only two surface electromyography (sEMG) channels. The method employs a Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE) to extract temporal feature representations directly from raw signals, eliminating the need for heuristic feature engineering. On a 6-class gesture set, our model achieved a multi-subject F1-score of 94.3% $\pm$ 0.3%. To address subject-specific differences, we present a few-shot transfer learning protocol that improved performance on unseen subjects from a baseline of 35.1% $\pm$ 3.1% to 92.3% $\pm$ 0.9% with minimal calibration data. Furthermore, the system supports functional extensibility through an incremental learning strategy, allowing for expansion to a 10-class set with a 90.0% $\pm$ 0.2% F1-score without full model retraining. By combining high precision with minimal computational and sensor overhead, this framework provides a scalable and efficient approach for the next generation of affordable and adaptive prosthetic systems.</description>

      <title>Iterative execution of discrete and inverse discrete Fourier transforms with applications for signal denoising via sparsification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09284v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a family of iterative algorithms that involve the repeated execution of discrete and inverse discrete Fourier transforms. One interesting member of this family is motivated by the discrete Fourier transform uncertainty principle and involves the application of a sparsification operation to both the real domain and frequency domain data with convergence obtained when real domain sparsity hits a stable pattern. This sparsification variant has practical utility for signal denoising, in particular the recovery of a periodic spike signal in the presence of Gaussian noise. General convergence properties and denoising performance relative to existing methods are demonstrated using simulation studies. An R package implementing this technique and related resources can be found at https://hrfrost.host.dartmouth.edu/IterativeFT.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Phenotype-Driven Disparities in Freezing of Gait Detection and Approaches to Bias Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) and a common cause of injurious falls. Recent advances in wearable-based human activity recognition (HAR) enable FOG detection, but bias and fairness in these models remain understudied. Bias refers to systematic errors leading to unequal outcomes, while fairness refers to consistent performance across subject groups. Biased models could systematically underserve patients with specific FOG phenotypes or demographics, potentially widening care disparities. We systematically evaluated bias and fairness of state-of-the-art HAR models for FOG detection across phenotypes and demographics using multi-site datasets. We assessed four mitigation approaches: conventional methods (threshold optimization and adversarial debiasing) and transfer learning approaches (multi-site transfer and fine-tuning large pretrained models). Fairness was quantified using demographic parity ratio (DPR) and equalized odds ratio (EOR). HAR models exhibited substantial bias (DPR &amp; EOR &lt; 0.8) across age, sex, disease duration, and critically, FOG phenotype. Phenotype-specific bias is particularly concerning as tremulous and akinetic FOG require different clinical management. Conventional bias mitigation methods failed: threshold optimization (DPR=-0.126, EOR=+0.063) and adversarial debiasing (DPR=-0.008, EOR=-0.001) showed minimal improvement. In contrast, transfer learning from multi-site datasets significantly improved fairness (DPR=+0.037, p&lt;0.01; EOR=+0.045, p&lt;0.01) and performance (F1-score=+0.020, p&lt;0.05). Transfer learning across diverse datasets is essential for developing equitable HAR models that reliably detect FOG across all patient phenotypes, ensuring wearable-based monitoring benefits all individuals with PD.</description>

      <title>Robust Transceiver Design for RIS Enhanced Dual-Functional Radar-Communication with Movable Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the performance of dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) systems. In this paper, we explore an MA-aided DFRC system that utilizes a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to enhance signal coverage for communications in dead zones. To enhance the radar sensing performance in practical DFRC environments, we propose a unified robust transceiver design framework aimed at maximizing the minimum radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in a cluttered environment. Our approach jointly optimizes transmit beamforming, receive filtering, antenna placement, and RIS reflecting coefficients under imperfect channel state information (CSI) for both sensing and communication channels. To deal with the channel uncertainty-constrained issue, we leverage the convex hull method to transform the primal problem into a more tractable form. We then introduce a two-layer block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, incorporating fractional programming (FP), successive convex approximation (SCA), S-Lemma, and penalty techniques to reformulate it into a series of semidefinite program (SDP) subproblems that can be efficiently solved. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the convergence and computational complexity for the proposed design framework. Simulation results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method, and show that the MA-based design framework can significantly enhance the radar SINR performance while achieving an effective balance between the radar and communication performance.</description>

      <title>Site-Specific Location Calibration and Validation of Ray-Tracing Simulator NYURay at Upper Mid-Band Frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ray-tracing (RT) simulators are essential for wireless digital twins, enabling accurate site-specific radio channel prediction for next-generation wireless systems. Yet, RT simulation accuracy is often limited by insufficient measurement data and a lack of systematic validation. This paper presents site-specific location calibration and validation of NYURay, NYU's in-house ray tracer, at upper mid-band frequencies (6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz). We propose a location calibration algorithm that corrects GPS-induced position errors by optimizing transmitter-receiver (T-R) locations to align simulated and measured power delay profiles, improving T-R location accuracy by 42.3% for line-of-sight (LOS) and 13.5% for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Validation across 18 T-R locations over distances from 40 to 880 m between transmitter and receiver shows excellent RT accuracy in path loss prediction, with path loss exponent (PLE) deviations under 0.14 when comparing measured versus RT predicted power at all T-R locations. While RT underestimates measured delay spread and angular spreads, their cumulative distributions remain statistically similar. The validated NYURay advances RT validation and provides reliable channel statistics for 6G deployment.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses the modeling of parasitics of the match standard in the symmetric-reciprocal-match (SRM) calibration method of vector network analyzers (VNAs). In the general SRM procedure, the match standard is assumed to be fully known. Here, we demonstrate that the match can be modeled with an arbitrary frequency-dependent model using a non-linear global optimization procedure. To highlight the validity of the suggested approach, numerical tests were conducted, demonstrating the ability to recover the match standard parasitic model down to software numerical precision. Additionally, we performed microstrip line measurements to compare the SRM calibration with match modeling to the multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration one, showing that automatic model extraction can achieve accuracy similar to using a match standard defined through multiline TRL calibration.</description>

      <title>Robust Radar Mounting Angle Estimation in Operational Driving Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The robust estimation of the mounting angle for millimeter-wave automotive radars installed on moving vehicles is investigated. We propose a novel signal processing pipeline that combines radar and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data to achieve accurate and reliable performance in realistic driving scenarios. Unlike previous studies, the method employs neural networks to process sparse and noisy radar measurements, reject detections from moving objects, and estimate radar motion. In addition, a measurement model is introduced to correct IMU bias and scale factor errors. Using vehicle kinematics, the radar mounting angle is then computed from the estimated radar motion and the vehicle's yaw rate. To benchmark performance, the proposed approach is comprehensively compared with two problem formulations and four estimation techniques reported in the literature. Validation is carried out on the challenging RadarScenes dataset, covering over 79 km of real-world driving. Results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness, with reliable estimates obtained within approximately 25 seconds of driving. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that automotive radar mounting angles can be accurately estimated in complex, real traffic conditions, without requiring controlled environments, dedicated targets, or specially designed driving routes.</description>

      <title>Environment-Aware MIMO Channel Estimation in Pilot-Constrained Upper Mid-Band Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation is critical for next-generation wireless systems, enabling enhanced communication and sensing performance. Traditional model-based channel estimation methods suffer, however, from performance degradation in complex environments with a limited number of pilots, while purely data-driven approaches lack physical interpretability, require extensive data collection, and are usually site-specific. This paper presents a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that combines model-based channel estimation with a deep network to exploit prior information about the propagation environment and achieve superior performance under pilot-constrained scenarios. The proposed approach employs an enhanced U-Net architecture with cross-attention mechanisms to fuse initial channel estimates with received signal strength (RSS) maps to provide refined channel estimates. Comprehensive evaluation using realistic ray-tracing data from urban environments demonstrates significant performance improvements, achieving over 5 dB gain in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to state-of-the-art methods, with particularly strong performance in pilot-limited scenarios and robustness across different frequencies and environments with only minimal fine-tuning. The proposed framework maintains practical computational complexity, making it viable for massive MIMO systems in upper mid-band frequencies.</description>

Abstract: Curved reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) represent a promising frontier for next-generation wireless communication, enabling adaptive wavefront control on nonplanar platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles and urban infrastructure. This work presents a systematic investigation of cylindrical RISs, progressing from idealized surface-impedance synthesis to practical implementations based on simple one-bit meta-atoms. Exact analytical and geometrical-optics-based models are first developed to explore fundamental design limits, followed by a semi-analytical formulation tailored to discrete, reconfigurable architectures. This model enables efficient beam synthesis using both evolutionary optimization and low-complexity strategies, including the minimum power distortionless response method, and is validated through full-wave simulations. Results confirm that one-bit RISs can achieve directive scattering with manageable sidelobe levels and minimal hardware complexity. These findings establish the viability of cylindrical RISs and open the door to their integration into dual-use wireless platforms for real-world communication scenarios.</description>

      <title>WiFo-M$^2$: Empower Wireless Communications With Plug-and-Play Environment Sensing via Foundation Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emerging convergence of next-generation wireless networks and agentic artificial intelligence (AI) is inspiring a new vision: embodied intelligent network entities utilize environmental sensing to refine their physical-layer (PHY) actions. Despite a growing body of preliminary work, prevailing small and task-specific AI models require extensive manual design of data pre-processing, network architecture, and fine-tuning, leaving them tightly coupled to particular PHY actions, system configurations, and deployment scenarios. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift with WiFo-M$^2$, a foundation model that enables environment sensing to be easily integrated into PHY actions, delivering universal performance gains. To extract generalizable out-of-band (OOB) channel-aware features from environment sensing, we introduce ContraSoM, a contrastive pre-training strategy. Once pre-trained, WiFo-M$^2$ infers future OOB channel-aware features from historical sensory data and strengthens feature robustness via modality-specific data augmentation. Experiments show that WiFo-M$^2$ improves the performance of diverse PHY actions and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen scenarios.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Empowered Covert Dual-Functional Radar-Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to flexibly reconfigure wireless channels by adjusting antenna placement. In this paper, we study a secured dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) system aided by movable antennas. To enhance the communication security, we aim to maximize the achievable sum rate by jointly optimizing the transmitter beamforming vectors, receiving filter, and antenna placement, subject to radar signal-to-noise ratio (SINR) and transmission covertness constraints. We consider multiple Willies operating in both non-colluding and colluding modes. For noncolluding Willies, we first employ a Lagrangian dual transformation procedure to reformulate the challenging optimization problem into a more tractable form. Subsequently, we develop an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm that integrates semidefinite relaxation (SDR), projected gradient descent (PGD), Dinkelbach transformation, and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to tackle the resulting problem. For colluding Willies, we first derive the minimum detection error probability (DEP) by characterizing the optimal detection statistic, which is proven to follow the generalized Erlang distribution. Then, we develop a minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based algorithm to address the colluding detection problem. We further provide a comprehensive complexity analysis on the unified design framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the covert sum rate, and achieve a superior balance between communication and radar performance compared with existing benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Precoding Design for Multi-User MIMO Joint Communications and Sensing</title>

Abstract: We investigate precoding for multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) joint communications and sensing (JCAS) systems, taking into account the potential interference between sensing and communication channels. We derive indicators for the sensing and communication performance, i.e., the detection probability and the communication signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) for general input signals. Our results show that the use of the communication signal for sensing can prevent a loss in communication performance if channel interference occurs, while the kurtosis of the transmit alphabet of the communication signal limits the sensing performance. We present simulation results of example setups.</description>

      <title>Towards a more realistic evaluation of machine learning models for bearing fault diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable detection of bearing faults is essential for maintaining the safety and operational efficiency of rotating machinery. While recent advances in machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, have shown strong performance in controlled settings, many studies fail to generalize to real-world applications due to methodological flaws, most notably data leakage. This paper investigates the issue of data leakage in vibration-based bearing fault diagnosis and its impact on model evaluation. We demonstrate that common dataset partitioning strategies, such as segment-wise and condition-wise splits, introduce spurious correlations that inflate performance metrics. To address this, we propose a rigorous, leakage-free evaluation methodology centered on bearing-wise data partitioning, ensuring no overlap between the physical components used for training and testing. Additionally, we reformulate the classification task as a multi-label problem, enabling the detection of co-occurring fault types and the use of prevalence-independent metrics such as Macro AUROC. Beyond preventing leakage, we also examine the effect of dataset diversity on generalization, showing that the number of unique training bearings is a decisive factor for achieving robust performance. We evaluate our methodology on three widely adopted datasets: CWRU, Paderborn University (PU), and University of Ottawa (UORED-VAFCLS). This study highlights the importance of leakage-aware evaluation protocols and provides practical guidelines for dataset partitioning, model selection, and validation, fostering the development of more trustworthy ML systems for industrial fault diagnosis applications.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral Image Data Reduction for Endmember Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Endmember extraction from hyperspectral images aims to identify the spectral signatures of materials present in a scene. Recent studies have shown that self-dictionary methods can achieve high extraction accuracy; however, their high computational cost limits their applicability to large-scale hyperspectral images. Although several approaches have been proposed to mitigate this issue, it remains a major challenge. Motivated by this situation, this paper pursues a data reduction approach. Assuming that the hyperspectral image follows the linear mixing model with the pure-pixel assumption, we develop a data reduction technique that removes pixels that do not contain endmembers. We analyze the theoretical properties of this reduction step and show that it preserves pixels that lie close to the endmembers. Building on this result, we propose a data-reduced self-dictionary method that integrates the data reduction with a self-dictionary method based on a linear programming formulation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially reduce the computational time of the original self-dictionary method without sacrificing endmember extraction accuracy.</description>

      <title>RefineBridge: Generative Bridge Models Improve Financial Forecasting by Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial time series forecasting is particularly challenging for transformer-based time series foundation models (TSFMs) due to non-stationarity, heavy-tailed distributions, and high-frequency noise present in data. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular parameter-efficient method for adapting pre-trained TSFMs to downstream data domains. However, it still underperforms in financial data, as it preserves the network architecture and training objective of TSFMs rather than complementing the foundation model. To further enhance TSFMs, we propose a novel refinement module, RefineBridge, built upon a tractable Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) generative framework. Given the forecasts of TSFM as generative prior and the observed ground truths as targets, RefineBridge learns context-conditioned stochastic transport maps to improve TSFM predictions, iteratively approaching the ground-truth target from even a low-quality prior. Simulations on multiple financial benchmarks demonstrate that RefineBridge consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art TSFMs across different prediction horizons.</description>

      <title>Robust and Secure Blockage-Aware Pinching Antenna-assisted Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a blockage-aware pinching antenna (PA) system designed for secure and robust wireless communication. The considered system comprises a base station equipped with multiple waveguides, each hosting multiple PAs, and serves multiple single-antenna legitimate users in the presence of multi-antenna eavesdroppers under imperfect channel state information (CSI). To safeguard confidential transmissions, artificial noise (AN) is deliberately injected to degrade the eavesdropping channels. Recognizing that conventional linear CSI-error bounds become overly conservative for spatially distributed PA architectures, we develop new geometry-aware uncertainty sets that jointly characterize eavesdroppers position and array-orientation errors. Building upon these sets, we formulate a robust joint optimization problem that determines per-waveguide beamforming and AN covariance, individual PA power-ratio allocation, and PA positions to maximize the system sum rate subject to secrecy constraints. The highly non-convex design problem is efficiently addressed via a low computational complexity iterative algorithm that capitalizes on block coordinate descent, penalty-based methods, majorization-minimization, the S-procedure, and Lipschitz-based surrogate functions. Simulation results demonstrate that sum rates for the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional fixed antenna systems by 4.7 dB, offering substantially improved rate and secrecy performance. In particular, (i) adaptive PA positioning preserves LoS to legitimate users while effectively exploiting waveguide geometry to disrupt eavesdropper channels, and (ii) neglecting blockage effects in the PA system significantly impacts the system design, leading to performance degradation and inadequate secrecy guarantees.</description>
