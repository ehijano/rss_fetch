      <title>High-efficiency broadband active metasurfaces via reversible metal electrodeposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing active metasurfaces with substantial tunability is important for many applications but remains challenging due to difficulties in dynamically tuning light-matter interactions at subwavelength scales. Here, we introduce reversible metal electrodeposition as a versatile approach for enabling active metasurfaces with exceptional tunability across a broad bandwidth. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate a dynamic beam-steering device by performing reversible copper (Cu) electrodeposition on a reflective gradient metasurface composed of metal-insulator-metal resonators. By applying different voltages, the Cu atoms can be uniformly and reversibly electrodeposited and stripped around the resonators, effectively controlling the gap-surface plasmon resonances and steering the reflected light. This process experimentally achieved &gt;90% diffraction efficiencies and &gt;60% reflection efficiencies in both specular and anomalous modes, even after thousands of cycles. Moreover, these high efficiencies can be extended from the visible to the near- and mid-infrared regimes, demonstrating the broad versatility of this approach in enabling various active optical and thermal devices with different working wavelengths and bandwidths.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal strain mapping of steel crack tips with micrometer spatial resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their superior fatigue strength, martensitic steels are the material of choice for high cyclic loading applications such as coil springs. However, crack propagation is influenced by residual stresses and their interaction is poorly understood. In fact, Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics predicts un-physical singularities in the strain around the crack tip. In this study, we have combined synchrotron-based x-ray diffraction, x-ray fluorescence, and optical microscopy to map the factual strain fields around crack tips with micrometer spatial resolution. X-ray fluorescence and optical images were co-registered to locate the crack in the x-ray diffraction maps. Observed crystal recovery close to cracks confirmed that the diffraction signal originates at least in parts from the cracks. The retrieved local strain field around the crack was further improved by averaging information over carefully selected diffraction peaks. This procedure provided strain maps around crack tips with a spatial resolution of about 1 micro meter and enabled a prediction of further crack growth.</description>

      <title>Exchange-Biased multi-ring Planar Hall Magnetoresistive Sensors with nT resolution in Non-Shielded Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planar Hall magnetoresistive sensors (PHMR) are promising candidates for various magnetic sensing applications due to their high sensitivity, low power consumption, and compatibility with integrated circuit technology. However, their performance is often limited by inherent noise sources, impacting their resolution and overall sensitivity. Here the effect of three bilayer structures NiFe(10 nm)/IrMn(10 nm), NiFe(30 nm)/IrMn(10 nm), and NiFe(30 nm)/IrMn(20 nm) on noise levels is investigated at low-frequency (DC - 25 Hz). This study includes a detailed investigation on the optimization process and noise characteristics of multiring PHMR sensors, focusing on identifying and quantifying the dominant noise sources. The experimental measurements are complemented by a theoretical analysis of noise sources including thermal noise, 1/f noise, intermixing and environmental noise. The best magnetic resolution is observed for the NiFe(30 nm)/IrMn(10 nm) structure, which achieves a detectivity below 1.5 nT/sqrt(Hz) at 10 Hz in a non-shielded environment at room temperature. In addition, a substantial improvement in sensitivity is observed by annealing the sensors at 250 deg C for 1 hour. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of noise behavior in PHMR sensors, paving the way for developing strategies to improve their performance for demanding sensing applications at low frequencies.</description>

      <title>Low-loss far-infrared surface phonon polaritons in suspended SrTiO3 nanomembranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon polaritons (PhPs), excitations arising from the coupling of light with lattice vibrations, enable light confinement and local field enhancement, which is essential for various photonic and thermal applications. To date, PhPs with high confinement and low loss have been mainly observed in the mid-infrared regime and mostly in manually exfoliated flakes of van der Waals (vdW) materials. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of low-loss, thickness-tunable phonon polaritons in the far-infrared regime within transferable free-standing SrTiO3 membranes synthesized through a scalable approach, achieving high figures of merit, which are comparable to the previous record values from the vdW materials. Leveraging atomic precision in thickness control, large dimensions, and compatibility with mature oxide electronics, functional oxide membranes present a promising large-scale two-dimensional (2D) platform alternative to vdW materials for on-chip polaritonic technologies in the far-infrared regime.</description>

      <title>Operating conditions and thermodynamic bounds of dual radiative heat engines</title>

Abstract: We propose a unified description of dual radiative heat engines (RHEs), consisting of two facing optoelectronic components (diodes) and capable of generating electrical power from heat. They can operate in three regimes depending on the applied biases, namely in thermoradiative-negative electroluminescent (TRNEL), thermoradiative-photovoltaic (TRPV) or thermophotonic regimes (TPX, consisting of a light-emitting diode and a PV cell). They have access to operating conditions that are unachievable by single RHEs such as thermophotovoltaic systems: at the radiative limit, TRNEL devices can reach the Carnot efficiency for any bandgap, while TPX devices achieve large power outputs by means of electroluminescent enhancement. Expressions of the maximum power output and related efficiency achieved by dual engines are derived analytically, and reveal that the power output of TPX engines is not bounded. A comparison to usual efficiency bounds also highlights the impact of thermalisation losses, and the subsequent interest of spectral filtering to extend the operating region. The influence of nonradiative recombinations is also investigated. This work provides common framework and guidelines for the study of RHEs, which represent a promising solution for reliable and scalable energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Tunable membrane-less dielectrophoretic microfiltration by crossing interdigitated electrodes</title>

Abstract: Separation is a crucial step in the analysis of living microparticles. In particular, the selective microseparation of phytoplankton by size and shape remains an open problem, even though these criteria are essential for their gender and/or species identification. However, microseparation devices necessitate physical membranes which complicate their fabrication, reduce the sample flow rate and can cause unwanted particle clogging. Recent advances in microfabrication such as High Precision Capillary Printing allow to rapidly build electrode patterns over wide areas. In this study, we introduce a new concept of membrane-less dielectrophoretic (DEP) microseparation suitable for large scale microfabrication processes. The proposed design involves two pairs of interdigitated electrodes at the top and the bottom of a microfluidic channel. We use finite-element calculations to analyse how the DEP force field throughout the channel, as well as the resulting trajectories of particles depend on the geometry of the system, on the physical properties of the particles and suspending medium and on the imposed voltage and flow rates. We numerically show that in the negative DEP regime, particles are focused in the channel mid-planes and that virtual pillars array leads either to their trapping at specific stagnation points, or to their focusing along specific lines, depending on their dielectrophoretic mobility. Simulations allow to understand how particles can be captured and to quantify the particle separation conditions by introducing a critical dielectrophoretic mobility. We further illustrate the principle of membrane-less dielectrophoretic microseparation using the proposed setup, by considering the separation of a binary mixture of polystyrene particles with different diameters, and validate it experimentally.</description>

      <title>Impact of helium ion irradiation on the thermal properties of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors</title>

Abstract: SNSPDs are indispensable for applications ranging from quantum information processing to deep-space optical communications, owing to their high detection efficiency, low dark counts, and excellent timing resolution. However, further improving the intrinsic detection efficiency (IDE) remains crucial for optimizing SNSPD performance. Ion irradiation has recently emerged as a powerful post-fabrication method to enhance SNSPD characteristics. Here, we studied the effects of He-ion irradiation on the thermal properties of NbN SNSPDs. We systematically examine the evolution of thermal boundary conductance as a function of ion fluence (0-1.1E17 ions/cm2), observing a 57% decrease from 127 to 54 W/m^2K^4 with increasing fluence, followed by saturation at approximately 9E16 ions/cm2. At this fluence, the minimum hotspot relaxation time measurements indicate a 41% increase, rising from 17 to 24 ps, while the electron-phonon interaction time extends by 14%, from 11.2 to 12.8 ps at 10 K. TEM reveals defect formation at the NbN/SiO2 interface (6-8 nm) and He-bubble formation within the SiO2 layer (30-260 nm), contributing to the extended thermal relaxation time. These irradiation-induced modifications play a key role in enhancing the IDE of the treated devices. We further demonstrate a post-irradiation SNSPD showing a saturated IDE plateau at 2000 nm from 2.7 K to 28 mK, enabled by thermal modifications and a weakly wavelength-dependent avalanche-assisted mechanism. Our findings highlight ion irradiation as a valuable tool for thermal tailoring in SNSPDs and advance the understanding of detection physics and defect engineering in superconducting optoelectronics.</description>
