      <title>SpecpolFlow: a new software package for spectropolarimetry using Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectropolarimetry, the observation of polarization and intensity as a function of wavelength, is a powerful tool in stellar astrophysics. It is particularly useful for characterizing stars and circumstellar material, and for tracing the influence of magnetic fields on a host star and its environment. Maintaining modern, flexible, and accessible computational tools that enable spectropolarimetric studies is thus essential. The SpecpolFlow package is a new, completely Pythonic workflow for analyzing stellar spectropolarimetric observations. Its suite of tools provides a user-friendly interface for working with data from an assortment of instruments and telescopes. SpecpolFlow contains tools for spectral normalization and visualization, the extraction of Least-Squares Deconvolution (LSD) profiles, the generation and optimization of line masks for LSD analyses, and the calculation of longitudinal magnetic field measurements from the LSD profiles. It also provides Python classes for the manipulation of spectropolarimetric products. The SpecpolFlow website includes an array of tutorials that guide users through common analysis cases using the software. SpecpolFlow is distributed as a free, open-source package, with fully documented tools (via an API and command line interface) which are actively maintained by a team of contributors.</description>

      <title>Anomaly detection in radio galaxy data with trainable COSFIRE filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting anomalies in radio astronomy is challenging due to the vast amounts of data and the rarity of labeled anomalous examples. Addressing this challenge requires efficient methods capable of identifying unusual radio galaxy morphologies without relying on extensive supervision. This work introduces an innovative approach to anomaly detection based on morphological characteristics of the radio sources using trainable COSFIRE (Combination of Shifted Filter Responses) filters as an efficient alternative to complex deep learning methods. The framework integrates COSFIRE descriptors with an unsupervised Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm to identify unusual radio galaxy morphologies. Evaluations on a radio galaxy benchmark data set demonstrate strong performance, with the COSFIRE-based approach achieving a geometric mean (G-Mean) score of 79%, surpassing the 77% achieved by a computationally intensive deep learning autoencoder. By characterizing normal patterns and detecting deviations, this semi-supervised methodology overcomes the need for anomalous examples in the training set, a major limitation of traditional supervised methods. This approach shows promise for next-generation radio telescopes, where fast processing and the ability to discover unknown phenomena are crucial.</description>

      <title>Ground Calibration Result of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) onboard the Einstein Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on results of the on-ground X-ray calibration of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) built from novel lobster-eye micro-pore optics, onboard the Einstein Probe (EP) satellite. To fully characterize the instrumental performance and properties, a series of tests and calibrations have been carried out at different levels of devices, assemblies and the complete module before the launch of EP. In this paper, we present the calibration results of three flight model modules (FM1, FM5 and FM11) obtained during their end-to-end module calibration experiments carried out at the 100-m X-ray Test Facility (100XF) of IHEP, CAS. Measurements of the Point Spread Function (PSF), effective area, and energy response were performed for multiple incident directions and several characteristic X-ray emission line energies. Specifically, the distributions of the PSF and effective areas are found to be roughly uniform across the FoV, in large agreement with the prediction of lobster-eye optics. Their energy dependence behavior aligns well with theoretical predictions and Monte Carlo simulations. At 1.25 keV, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the focal spot is in range of 3-7 arcmin (a median of 4.2) and the effective area in range of 2-3 $cm^2$. Noticeably, the flight model instruments demonstrate a $\sim1.5$ arcmin spatial resolution improvement over the previously launched Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy. The properties of the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors were also calibrated. The gain coefficients are in range of 6.4-6.9 eV/DN. The energy resolutions are in range of 120-140 eV at 1.25 keV, meeting design requirements. These calibration results have been ingested into the first version of calibration database (CALDB) and applied to the analysis of the scientific data acquired by WXT after the launch of EP.</description>

      <title>XMM-Newton Publications from 2000-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel studies are presented demonstrating that the data of ESA's XMM-Newton mission are efficiently used by an engaged and productive community. 87% of the available time budget during the reference period 2000-2024 of 556Ms was used in at least one of 8486 publications (84% of 16894 observations) with a re-use of a factor up to 15 in dedicated publications. The duration between observations and first publication peaks around 2 years with a second peak at 3 years. The publication rate remains stable at ~400 refereed articles per year. Since 2010, the annual number of first-time as well as last-time authors has remained constant at ~100 authors per year yielding ~4300 scientists engaged in research utilising XMM-Newton data including 570 lead (first) authors. We find 51% of first authors to have published for one year, 24% were active for up to six years, and 25% are permanently active yielding a core community of ~120 scientists. The considerable number of time-limited activities may indicate a high level of utilisation within the context of university education. All studied trends indicate a vital community with positive perspectives to continue their active interest in XMM-Newton for the future.</description>

      <title>Temporal variability in low-frequency radio interference: Insight from high-cadence monitoring at a candidate radio notification zone in Malaysia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive radio frequency interference (RFI) monitoring is essential in the site selection process before constructing radio astronomy observatories, followed by mitigation strategies to minimize its adverse effects. Malaysia has an enormous prospect for radio astronomy due to its prominent location in the centre of Southeast Asia, but is challenged by its relatively high population density. In this research article, we perform high-cadence, low-frequency RFI monitoring at two sites, each representing an urban and a rural environment. Using modified generalized spectral kurtosis (GSK) as an RFI detection method, we ascertain the suitability of Glami Lemi, a rural area in the centre of Peninsular Malaysia previously assigned as a candidate radio notification zone (RNZ), as a potential site for radio astronomy observations due to its lower RFI contamination in our high-cadence monitoring, especially when compared with urban areas. We identified a number of persistent and transient RFI in our dataset, associate each of them with their potential origins and, if present, characterize their temporal evolution. A few types of RFI mitigation strategies were also tested and discussed. This study lays the groundwork for Malaysia's endeavours in establishing its first research-grade radio telescope, emphasizing the importance of robust RFI detection and mitigation strategies in optimizing observational outcomes.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Fiber Cross Contamination on Radial Velocity Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution spectrographs with precise radial velocity (PRV) capabilities require careful considerations in instrumental design and data processing in order to reach the 10 cm/s-level precision, which is needed for detecting Earth-like planets. In this work, we investigate the impact of fiber cross contamination on the RV precision via simulations, as modern PRV spectrographs often have multiple fiber traces on their spectral images. We simulated extracted 1-D spectra under the preliminary design of CHORUS, short for the Canary Hybrid Optical high-Resolution Ultra-stable Spectrograph, a dual-arm PRV spectrograph under construction for the Gran Telescopio de Canarias. We considered two types of fiber cross contaminations: contamination from calibration traces to neighboring science traces (or cal-sci contamination) and between science traces (or sci-sci contamination). We present results in four different scenarios: photon noise only, cal-sci contamination only, sci-sci contamination only, and all effects combined. For the preliminary design of CHORUS, we estimated that the cal-sci contamination fraction is smaller than 0.0001% in flux across the whole CCD for either arm, resulting in a negligible impact on the RV precision. Assuming worst-case scenarios, we estimated the sci-sci contamination to be up to 0.1% in some traces, corresponding to an additional RV error of up to 10 cm/s. We demonstrate the importance of considering fiber-trace spacing and cross contamination in PRV spectrographs, and we recommend careful design, operation, and spectral extraction algorithms to minimize and mitigate cross contamination to achieve the best possible instrumental RV precision.</description>

      <title>X-Ray spectroscopy and timing (XSPECT) experiment on XPoSat -- instrument configuration and science prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray Polarimeter Satellite (XPoSat) with POLarimeter Instrument in X-rays (POLIX), is India's first spacecraft dedicated to study medium energy X-ray polarisation from celestial objects. X-Ray Spectroscopy and Timing (XSPECT) instrument on XPoSat is configured to study long term spectral behaviour of select sources in Soft X-ray regime. The instrument uses Swept Charge Devices (SCD)s to provide large area and spectral performance with passive cooling arrangement. The instrument consists of set of collimators with two different FOVs, optical light blocking filters, and signal processing electronics. The instrument was designed, tested and calibrated on ground. The unique opportunity is provided by ISRO's XPoSat mission, where a source is observed for longer duration. The device used also enables spectroscopy study of brighter sources compared to the CCD based spectrometers. The first results demonstrate instrument capability for spectral studies in the 0.8 keV-15 keV energy band.</description>

      <title>DRAGyS -- A comprehensive tool to extract scattering phase functions in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early stages of planet formation, involving dust grain growth and planetesimals formation, remain shrouded in mystery. The analysis of the Scattering Phase Function (SPF) measured in disks surrounding young stars holds great potential for revealing crucial information about dust grain properties. Given the increasing number of high-quality datasets available, an efficient method to extract the SPF is required. DRAGyS is a tool designed for the quick and comprehensive analysis of ring-shaped protoplanetary disks. It directly estimates the disk geometry and extracts the total and polarized SPF from scattered light images, without requiring any radiative transfer modeling, a limitation of previous efforts. Key disk parameters (inclination, position angle, aspect ratio) are obtained by fitting ellipses to the disk intensity peaks from the ring surface, assuming the disks are circular. We validated the method using simulated disk images and then applied it to archival polarized-intensity images of nine images for six protoplanetary disks. DRAGyS provides a method to correct for the effect of limb brightening on the SPF. DRAGyS recovers well the injected geometry and the SPF from synthetic images where the parameters are known. When compared to previously published results extracted from images without considering limb brightening, DRAGyS yields similar results for the inclination, position angle, and SPF. We show that the effect of limb brightening on the SPF is significant, with consequences for the inference of dust properties. DRAGyS takes advantage of a fast and purely geometrical approach to estimate ringed-disk geometries. It allows the efficient extraction of SPF either globally or by sectors, allowing it to deal with disk asymmetries. By bypassing the need for a full modeling of the disk geometry before SPF extraction, DRAGyS is well suited to study large samples of disk images.</description>

      <title>On the orientation of historic Christian churches of Fuerteventura: conciliating tradition, winds and topography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of an analysis of the precise spatial orientation of colonial Christian churches located in the Canary Island of Fuerteventura (Spain). Our sample consists of 48 churches, most built during the period between the Castilian conquest led by the Norman Jean de B\'ethencourt in the 15th century and the end of the 19th century. We examine whether the standard tradition was followed regarding the orientation of the apses of historic churches eastwards. While most of the religious constructions in the sample have their main axes oriented within the solar range, the statistical analysis also reveals the presence of two different groups of churches with different possible interpretations. For the first group, mainly composed of churches located in the central part of the island, an anomalous tendency to orientate them towards a declination of c. -14 degrees is detected. We provide some possible explanations for this, which include the date of a traditional Canarian celebration, an eventual imprint of topography, and the possibility of sunset orientations. Also, this particular value of declination is close to -16.3 degrees, the declination of Sirius during the 17th century. Therefore, we provide ethnographic data that might support an eventually controversial 'bright star' orientation. For the second group, meanwhile, we find a pattern of orientation where the apse of the churches points slightly to the north of due east. We propose this might signal constructions that were oriented to the rising Sun on dates close to Easter, one of the most important festivities of Christianity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper reassesses the largely neglected contribution of Avicenna (Ibn Sina, 980-1037) to medieval Tajik-Persian astronomy. Drawing on published primary and secondary sources, it reconstructs the main directions of his scientific activity - the construction of an observatory at Isfahan, the design of a high-precision angular instrument that anticipates the modern vernier principle, the formulation of an original method for determining terrestrial longitude from lunar culmination, a systematic refutation of predictive astrology, an optical explanation for the daytime invisibility of the fixed stars, and the earliest extant descriptions of both the transit of Venus on 24 May 1032 and the supernova SN 1006. These achievements not only anticipated comparable European advances by several centuries but also shaped subsequent developments within the Islamic and Latin astronomical traditions. The paper further notes Avicenna's modern scientific commemoration in the naming of asteroid (2755) Avicenna and the lunar crater Avicenna.</description>

      <title>Astrophysics with Compact Objects: An Indian Perspective, Present Status and Future Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical compact objects, viz., white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes, are the remnants of stellar deaths at the end of their life cycles. They are ideal testbeds for various fundamental physical processes under extreme conditions that are unique in nature. Observational radio astronomy with uGMRT and OORT facilities has led to several important breakthroughs in studies of different kinds of pulsars and their emission mechanisms. On the other hand, accretion processes around compact objects are at the core of Indian astronomy research. In this context, AstroSat mission revolutionized spectro-temporal observations and measurements of accretion phenomena, quasi-periodic oscillations, and jet behaviour in binary systems hosting compact objects. Moreover, recently launched XPoSat mission is set to provide an impetus to these high-energy phenomena around compact objects by enabling us to conduct polarization measurements in the X-ray band. Further, during the past decade, numerous gravitational wave signals have been observed from coalescing black holes and neutron stars in binary systems. Recent simultaneous observation of the GW170817 event in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic channels has ushered in the era of multi-messenger astronomy. In the future, synergistic efforts among several world-class observational facilities, e.g., LIGO-India, SKA, TMT, etc., within the Indian astrophysics community will provide a significant boost to achieve several key science goals that have been delineated here. In general, this article plans to highlight scientific projects being pursued across Indian institutions in this field, the scientific challenges that this community would be focusing on, and the opportunities in the coming decade. Finally, we have also mentioned the required resources, both in the form of infrastructural and human resources.</description>

      <title>A neural network for estimating compact binary coalescence parameters of gravitational-wave events in real time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-latency pipelines analyzing gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence events rely on matched filter techniques. Limitations in template banks and waveform modeling, as well as nonstationary detector noise cause errors in signal parameter recovery, especially for events with high chirp masses. We present a quantile regression neural network model that provides dynamic bounds on key parameters such as chirp mass, mass ratio, and total mass. We test the model on various synthetic datasets and real events from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave transient catalogs. We find that the model accuracy is consistently over 90% across all the datasets. We explore the possibility of employing the neural network bounds as priors in online parameter estimation. We find that they reduce by 9% the number of likelihood evaluations. This approach may shorten parameter estimation run times without affecting sky localizations.</description>

      <title>Radio Observations as a Probe of Cosmic Web Magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Universe's magnetogenesis can be investigated with radio observations of cosmic filaments, where the information on the initial magnetic field seeds is expected to be preserved in time. In this work, we update the comparison between recent observational results in filaments with the predictions from recent cosmological simulations to check whether one of them is favoured. The radio probes we use are the rotation measure (RM) of filaments as a function of the redshift ($z$), stacking of synchrotron emission from filaments, and the RM radial profile away from galaxy groups. The first two probes favour the presence of a dominant primordial magnetic field component and disfavour a sole astrophysical scenario, the third probe does not yet give an unambiguous outcome. We also estimate the average field strength in filaments. Independently of the scenario and the shape of the astrophysical component RM, it is in the range 10--60 nG at $z=0$, while, when restricted to the model that gives the best match to the simulations, it gives $43\pm 7$ nG, with an astrophysical component RM rapidly decreasing with the redshift.</description>

      <title>Cloud and Haze Parameterization in Atmospheric Retrievals: Insights from Titan's Cassini Data and JWST Observations of Hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Before JWST, telescope observations were not sensitive enough to constrain the nature of clouds in exo-atmospheres. Recent observations, however, have inferred cloud signatures as well as haze-enhanced scattering slopes motivating the need for modern inversion techniques and a deeper understanding of the JWST information content.
  Aims: We aim to investigate the information content of JWST exoplanet spectra. We particularly focus on designing an inversion technique able to handle a wide range of cloud and hazes.
  Methods: We build a flexible aerosol parameterization within the TauREx framework, enabling us to conduct atmospheric retrievals of planetary atmospheres. The method is evaluated on available Cassini occultations of Titan. We then use the model to interpret the recent JWST data for the prototypical hot Jupiters HAT-P-18 b, WASP-39 b, WASP-96 b, and WASP-107 b. In parallel, we perform complementary simulations on controlled scenarios to further understand the information content of JWST data and provide parameterization guidelines.
  Results: Our results use free and kinetic chemistry retrievals to extract the main atmospheric properties of key JWST exoplanets, including their molecular abundances, thermal structures, and aerosol properties. In our investigations, we show the need for a wide wavelength coverage to robustly characterize clouds and hazes-which is necessary to mitigate biases arising from our lack of priors on their composition-and break degeneracies with atmospheric chemical composition. With JWST, the characterization of clouds and hazes might be difficult due to the lack of simultaneous wavelength coverage from visible to mid-infrared by a single instruments and the likely presence of temporal variability between visits (from e.g., observing conditions, instrument systematics, stellar host variability, or planetary weather).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fourth observing run (O4) of Advanced LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA has started in May 2023 and is planned to continue until October 2025. On behalf of the LVK Collaboration, I will cover two topics: Status of the O4 run and latest non-CBC results. Status of the O4 run. The focus will be on detectors' performance and online searches/alerts, drawing on publicly available sources provided by the collaboration. Additionally, I will give an overview of removing noise techniques, including AI approaches that help gain sensitivity at a small cost. Latest non-CBC results. Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) is just one of the potential GW sources: Continuous Waves, Bursts, and Stochastic are still being hunted down. Here, O4 public results of searches will be presented, or the latest O3 will be discussed when the former are not yet available. So far, no GW detections have been associated with these non-CBC sources in any of the searches conducted.</description>

      <title>Extending the micro-Hertz detection horizons via hidden orbital resonance effect for geocentric gravitational wave antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microhertz gravitational wave (GW) band (0.1 $\mu$Hz-0.1 mHz) holds critical insights into coalescing supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) and the stochastic GW background, yet remains observationally inaccessible due to technical barriers. This work presents a strategy to unlock this band by exploiting orbital resonance effects in the proposed geocentric GW antennas, circumventing the need for impractical ultralong baselines or advanced technologies. We demonstrate that when GW frequencies resonate with integer multiples of a satellite's orbital frequency (e.g., 1$\times$, 3$\times$), sustained orbital deviations amplify signals through time-cumulative effects. Benifit from orbital modulation and resonance phenomena, detector sensitivity can be enhanced by 1-2 orders of magnitude in the microhertz regime. For proposed missions like TianQin, gLISA, and GADFLI, this resonance-driven mechanism extends detectable GW frequencies and expands the observable parameter space of SMBHBs to lower masses and higher redshifts, exceeding conventional sensitivity assessments. This approach may leverage geocentric missions as cost-effective platforms to bridge the microhertz observational gap.</description>

      <title>A pipeline for searching and fitting instrumental glitches in LISA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instrumental artefacts, such as glitches, can significantly compromise the scientific output of LISA. Our methodology employs advanced Bayesian techniques, including Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo and parallel tempering to find and characterize glitches and astrophysical signals. The robustness of the pipeline is demonstrated through its ability to simultaneously handle diverse glitch morphologies and it is validated with a 'Spritz'-type data set from the LISA Data Challenge. Our approach enables accurate inference on Massive Black Hole Binaries, while simultaneously characterizing both instrumental artefacts and noise. These results present a significant development in strategies for differentiating between instrumental noise and astrophysical signals, which will ultimately improve the accuracy and reliability of source population analyses with LISA.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Autonomous Spacecraft Operators in Kerbal Space Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent trends are emerging in the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents that take actions based on the content of the user text prompts. We intend to apply these concepts to the field of Control in space, enabling LLMs to play a significant role in the decision-making process for autonomous satellite operations. As a first step towards this goal, we have developed a pure LLM-based solution for the Kerbal Space Program Differential Games (KSPDG) challenge, a public software design competition where participants create autonomous agents for maneuvering satellites involved in non-cooperative space operations, running on the KSP game engine. Our approach leverages prompt engineering, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning techniques to create an effective LLM-based agent that ranked 2nd in the competition. To the best of our knowledge, this work pioneers the integration of LLM agents into space research. The project comprises several open repositories to facilitate replication and further research. The codebase is accessible on \href{https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/kspdg}{GitHub}, while the trained models and datasets are available on \href{https://huggingface.co/OhhTuRnz}{Hugging Face}. Additionally, experiment tracking and detailed results can be reviewed on \href{https://wandb.ai/carrusk/huggingface}{Weights \&amp; Biases</description>

      <title>Comparing Grid Model Fitting Methodologies for Low-Temperature Atmospheres: Markov Chain Monte Carlo versus Random Forest Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The atmospheres of low-temperature stars, brown dwarfs, and exoplanets are challenging to model due to strong molecular features and complex gas and condensate chemistry. Self-consistent atmosphere models are commonly used for spectral fitting, but computational limits restrict the production of finely-sampled multi-dimensional parameter grids, necessitating interpolation methods to infer precise parameters and uncertainties. Here, we compare two grid-model fitting approaches: a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm interpolating across spectral fluxes, and a Random Forest Retrieval (RFR) algorithm trained on a grid model set. We test these with three low-temperature model grids -- Sonora Diamondback, Sonora Elf Owl, and Spectral ANalog of Dwarfs (SAND) -- and a sample of eleven L and T dwarf companions to FGKM stars with known distances, compositions, and ages. Diamondback models are optimal for early- and mid-type L dwarfs, Elf Owl for mid- and late T dwarfs, and SAND for young L dwarfs and L/T transition objects. The MCMC approach yields higher fit quality and more precise parameters, though best-fit parameters are generally consistent between approaches. RFR analysis is orders of magnitude faster after training. Both approaches yield mixed results when comparing fit parameters to expected values based on primary (metallicity and surface gravity) or evolutionary models (temperature and radius). We propose modeling low-temperature spectra efficiently by first fitting multiple model sets using RFR, followed by a more accurate MCMC assessment, to accelerate improved grid development.</description>

Abstract: The testing and quality assurance of cryogenic superconducting detectors is a time- and labor-intensive process. As experiments deploy increasingly larger arrays of detectors, new methods are needed for performing this testing quickly. Here, we propose a process for flagging under-performing detector wafers before they are ever tested cryogenically. Detectors are imaged under an optical microscope, and computer vision techniques are used to analyze the images, searching for visual defects and other predictors of poor performance. Pipeline performance is verified via a suite of images with simulated defects, yielding a detection accuracy of 98.6%. Lastly, results from running the pipeline on prototype microwave kinetic inductance detectors from the planned SPT-3G+ experiment are presented.</description>

      <title>On the full non-Gaussian Surprise statistic and the cosmological concordance between DESI, SDSS and Pantheon+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing precision of recent cosmological surveys and the discovery of important tensions within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, it is becoming more and more important to develop tools to quantify accurately the discordance between different probes. One such tool is the Surprise statistic, a measure based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The Surprise, however, has been up to now applied only under its Gaussian approximation, which can fail to properly capture discordance in cases that deviate significantly from Gaussianity. In this paper we developed the \texttt{klsurprise} code which computes the full numerical non-Gaussian Surprise, and analyse the Surprise for BAO + BBN and supernova data. We test different cosmological models, some of which the parameters deviate significantly from Gaussianity. We find that the non-Gaussianities, mainly present in the Supernova dataset, change the Surprise values significantly from its Gaussian approximation, and reveal a borderline $2.0\sigma$ tension in the curved $w$CDM model (o$w$CDM) between the combined Pantheon+ and SH0ES (Pantheon+ &amp; SH0ES) data and the dataset which combines SDSS, BOSS and eBOSS BAO. This modest tension is hidden in the Gaussian Surprise approximation. For DESI, the discrepancy with Pantheon+ &amp; SH0ES is at the $1.5\sigma$ level for o$w$CDM, but a large $3.4\sigma$ for $\Lambda$CDM. Removing SH0ES data drops the $\Lambda$CDM significance to $2.6\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Extension of the particle x-ray coincidence technique: The lifetimes and branching ratios apparatus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The particle x-ray coincidence technique (PXCT) was originally developed to measure average lifetimes in the $10^{-17}-10^{-15}$~s range for proton-unbound states populated by electron capture (EC). We have designed and built the Lifetimes and Branching Ratios Apparatus (LIBRA) to be used in the stopped-beam area at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams that extends PXCT to measure lifetimes and decay branching ratios of resonances populated by EC/$\beta^+$ decay. The first application of LIBRA aims to obtain essential nuclear data from $^{60}$Ga EC/$\beta^+$ decay to constrain the thermonuclear rates of the $^{59}$Cu$(p,\gamma)^{60}$Zn and $^{59}$Cu$(p,\alpha)^{56}$Ni reactions, and in turn, the strength of the NiCu nucleosynthesis cycle, which is predicted to significantly impact the modeling of type I x-ray burst light curves and the composition of the burst ashes. Detailed theoretical calculations, Monte Carlo simulations, and performance tests with radioactive sources have been conducted to validate the feasibility of employing LIBRA for the $^{60}$Ga experiment. LIBRA can be utilized to measure most essential ingredients needed for charged-particle reaction rate calculations in a single experiment, in the absence of direct measurements, which are often impractical for radioactive reactants.</description>

      <title>First Axion-Like Particle Results from a Broadband Search for Wave-Like Dark Matter in the 44 to 52 $\mu$eV Range with a Coaxial Dish Antenna</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results from the first axion-like particle search conducted using a dish antenna. The experiment was conducted at room temperature and sensitive to axion-like particles in the $44-52\,\mu\mathrm{eV}$ range ($10.7 - 12.5\,\mathrm{GHz}$). The novel dish antenna geometry was proposed by the BREAD collaboration and previously used to conduct a dark photon search in the same mass range. To allow for axion-like particle sensitivity, the BREAD dish antenna was placed in a $3.9\,\mathrm{T}$ solenoid magnet at Argonne National Laboratory. In the presence of a magnetic field, axion-like dark matter converts to photons at the conductive surface of the reflector. The signal is focused onto a custom coaxial horn antenna and read out with a low-noise radio-frequency receiver. No evidence of axion-like dark matter was observed in this mass range and we place the most stringent laboratory constraints on the axion-photon coupling strength, $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$, in this mass range at 90\% confidence.</description>

      <title>Inferring Fireball Velocity Profiles and Characteristic Parameters of Meteoroids from Incomplete Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting additional information from old or incomplete fireball datasets remains a challenge. To address missing point-by-point observations, we introduce a method for estimating atmospheric flight parameters of meteoroids using metaheuristic optimization techniques. Using a fireball catalog from the European Fireball Network (EN), we reconstruct velocity profiles, meteoroid bulk densities, mass loss rates, and ablation and ballistic coefficients, based on the initial and terminal points' height, velocity, and mass with the purely dynamical $\alpha$-$\beta$ model. Additionally, the method's performance is compared to the Meteorite Observation and Recovery Project (MORP) derived fits, confirming the robustness of the computed parameters for objects with asteroidal compositions. Our findings show that $\alpha$-$\beta$ model yields parameters consistent with the photometric and dynamic mass estimates in the EN catalog for $P_E$ type I events. However, in the implementation proposed here, $\alpha$-$\beta$ model encounters limitations in accurately representing the final deceleration of more fragile high-velocity meteoroids. This is likely due to challenges in representing complex fragmentation processes by fitting only two points, even when initial and terminal residuals are minimal. The retrieved $\alpha$-$\beta$ distribution differs from the one derived from MORP data, likely due to the imposed mass constraints, which strongly influence the results, especially the bulk density. The results suggest that $P_E$ constraints reduce fitting accuracy (from 90% to 44%), while flexibility and freedom from assumptions improve $\alpha$-$\beta$ performance. The method yields 26% of the events compatible with the catalog $P_E$ classification. Our approach is well-suited for interpreting historical or sparse datasets.</description>
