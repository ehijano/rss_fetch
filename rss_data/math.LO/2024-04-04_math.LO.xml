      <title>Order structure of P-point ultrafilters and their relatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey some recent results about the order structure of various kinds of ultrafilters. More precisely, we study Rudin-Keisler and Tukey reducibility in classes of selective, stable ordered-union, and P-point ultrafilters. Although these reductions are fundamentally different, there are connections between them. On the other hand, even though the classes of ultrafilters we consider are similar, there are significant differences in their order structure, as will be seen in the survey.</description>

      <title>The complexity of non-stationary ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview of results on the question of whether the non-stationary ideal of an uncountable regular cardinal $\kappa$ can be defined by a $\Pi_1$-formula using parameters of hereditary cardinality at most $\kappa$. These results show that this question is deeply connected to several central topics of current research in set theory.</description>

      <title>A topological reading of inductive and coinductive definitions in Dependent Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of dependent type theory, we show that coinductive predicates have an equivalent topological counterpart in terms of coinductively generated positivity relations, introduced by G. Sambin to represent closed subsets in point-free topology. Our work is complementary to a previous one with M.E. Maietti, where we showed that, in dependent type theory, the well-known concept of wellfounded trees has a topological equivalent counterpart in terms of proof-relevant inductively generated formal covers used to provide a predicative and constructive representation of complete suplattices. All proofs in Martin-L\"of's type theory are formalised in the Agda proof assistant.</description>

      <title>Chain union closures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spherical completeness of ball spaces and its stability under expansions. We give some criteria for ball spaces that guarantee that spherical completeness is preserved when the ball space is closed under unions of chains. This applies in particular to the spaces of closed ultrametric balls in ultrametric spaces with linearly ordered value sets, or more generally, with countable narrow value sets. We show that in general, chain union closures of ultrametric spaces with partially ordered value sets do not preserve spherical completeness. Further, we introduce and study the notions of chain union stability and of chain union rank, which measure how often the process of closing a ball space under all unions of chains has to be iterated until a ball space is obtained that is closed under unions of chains.</description>

      <title>Relative model completeness of henselian valued fields with finite ramification and various value groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the model completeness of the theory of a mixed characteristic henselian valued field with finite ramification relative to the residue field and value group. We address the case in which the valued field has a value group with finite spines, and the case in which the value group is elementarily equivalent to the infinite lexicographic sum of $\mathbb{Z}$ with a minimal positive element. In both cases, we find a one-sorted language in which the theory of the valued field is model complete, if the theory of the residue field is model complete in the language of rings.</description>

      <title>Three surprising instances of dividing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give three counterexamples to the folklore claim that in an arbitrary theory, if a complete type $p$ over a set $B$ does not divide over $C\subseteq B$, then no extension of $p$ to a complete type over $\text{acl}(B)$ divides over $C$. Two of our examples are also the first known theories where all sets are extension bases for nonforking, but forking and dividing differ for complete types (answering a question of Adler). One example is an NSOP$_1$ theory with a complete type that forks, but does not divide, over a model (answering a question of d'Elb\'{e}e). Moreover, dividing independence fails to imply M-independence in this example (which refutes another folklore claim). In addition to these counterexamples, we summarize various related properties of dividing that are still true. We also address consequences for previous literature, including an earlier unpublished result about forking and dividing in free amalgamation theories, and some claims about dividing in the theory of generic $K_{m,n}$-free incidence structures.</description>
