      <title>Implant-to-Wearable Communication through the Human Body: Exploring the Effects of Encapsulated Capacitive and Galvanic Transmitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data transfer using human-body communication (HBC) represents an actively explored alternative solution to address the challenges related to energy-efficiency, tissue absorption, and security of conventional wireless. Although the use of HBC for wearable-to-wearable communication has been well-explored, different configurations for the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) for implant-to-wearable HBC needs further studies. This paper substantiates the hypothesis that a fully implanted galvanic Tx is more efficient than a capacitive Tx for interaction with a wearable Rx. Given the practical limitations of implanting an ideal capacitive device, we choose a galvanic device with one electrode encapsulated to model the capacitive scenario. We analyze the lumped circuit model for in-body to out-of-body communication, and perform Circuit-based as well as Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations to explore how the encapsulation thickness affects the received signal levels. We demonstrate in-vivo experimental results on live Sprague Dawley rats to validate the hypothesis, and show that compared to the galvanic Tx, the channel loss will be $\approx$ 20 dB higher with each additional mm thickness of capacitive encapsulation, eventually going below the noise floor for ideal capacitive Tx.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks in Histopathology: Emerging Trends and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Histopathological analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has seen a surge in the utilization of deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, CNNs often fall short in capturing the intricate spatial dependencies inherent in WSIs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a promising alternative, adept at directly modeling pairwise interactions and effectively discerning the topological tissue and cellular structures within WSIs. Recognizing the pressing need for deep learning techniques that harness the topological structure of WSIs, the application of GNNs in histopathology has experienced rapid growth. In this comprehensive review, we survey GNNs in histopathology, discuss their applications, and explore emerging trends that pave the way for future advancements in the field. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of GNNs and their potential applications in histopathology. Leveraging quantitative literature analysis, we identify four emerging trends: Hierarchical GNNs, Adaptive Graph Structure Learning, Multimodal GNNs, and Higher-order GNNs. Through an in-depth exploration of these trends, we offer insights into the evolving landscape of GNNs in histopathological analysis. Based on our findings, we propose future directions to propel the field forward. Our analysis serves to guide researchers and practitioners towards innovative approaches and methodologies, fostering advancements in histopathological analysis through the lens of graph neural networks.</description>
