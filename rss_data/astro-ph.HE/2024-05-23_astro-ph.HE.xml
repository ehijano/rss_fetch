      <title>Dilaton generation in propagation of magnetic dipole waves of pulsar in a galactic magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study is devoted to dilaton generation in propagation of magnetic dipole waves of pulsar in a galactic magnetic field. It is shown that in this process it's necessary to take into account the presence of a reflective index of matter distributed in the galaxy. According to obtained estimates influence of the gravitational field of pulsars and magnetars on radiation of magnetic dipole waves is negligible and tends to a small change of their amplitude, near about 1 per cent. That's why in this study one can neglect the impact of gravitational field on process of dilaton generation.
  Exact solution of the dilaton equation is found and angular distribution of dilaton radiation is obtained in propagation of magnetic dipole waves of pulsar in galactic magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Possible Supercritical Accretion on the ULX in the Metal-poor Galaxy IZw18</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of X-ray observations of the Ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in IZw18 based on archival data taken with Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku. This ULX is considered to be an intermediate-mass black hole candidate simply because it is in the lowest metallicity environment among ULXs, where formation of heavy black holes is facilitated. However, actual study of the ULX based on observations spanning for a long period has been too limited to determine its nature. In this study, we investigate the spectral evolution of the ULX up to 2014, combining the previously-unpublished Suzaku data with those from the other two satellites. We derive a positive correlation of $L\propto T_{\rm in}^{2.1\pm0.4}$ between the bolometric luminosity $L$ and inner-disk temperature $T_{\rm in}$ on the basis of the multi-color disk-blackbody model, where we exclude the Chandra data, which has the lowest luminosity and systematic residuals in the fitting. The nominal relation $L\propto T_{\rm in}^{4}$ for the standard disk is rejected at a significance level of 1.5 %. These results suggest that the ULX was in the slim-disk state during these observations except at the time of the Chandra observation, in which the ULX was likely to be in a different state. The apparent inner-disk radius appears negatively correlated with the inner-disk temperature. Moreover, we find a radial dependence of the disk temperature of $T (r)\propto r^{-p}$ with $p&lt;0.75$, which also supports the hypothesis that the ULX has a slim disk. In consequence, the IZw18 ULX is most likely to be powered by a stellar-mass compact object in supercritical accretion.</description>

      <title>X-rays from the Nearby Compact Emission Line Galaxy NGC 2366</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminous, compact emission-line galaxies (LCGs) are the most abundant class of confirmed Lyman continuum (LyC) emitters. An optical integral field study of the nearby LCG NGC 2366 reveals an outflow originating at the star cluster 'knot B' thought to clear a channel via mechanical feedback that enables LyC escape. We observed NGC 2366 with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and detect X-ray emission from a point source coincident with the apex of the outflow at knot B. The point-like nature and variability of the X-ray emission suggests accretion onto a compact object. The accretion could produce sufficient kinetic energy to power the outflow.</description>

      <title>Detecting the Neutrino Gravitational Wave Memory from Core-Collapse Supernovae using the Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the milestone of detecting gravitational waves (GWs) from merging compact binaries, the next significant watershed moment in GW astronomy lies in detecting GWs from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). In this Letter, I describe the possibility of detecting the GW linear memory -- a phenomenon resulting from a combination of aspherical matter ejection and anisotropic neutrino emission during stellar collapse using GW detectors on the Moon. This would grant unprecedented access to the sub-Hz/Hz GW frequency range, which is inaccessible to current and future terrestrial GW detectors. I demonstrate that three-dimensional CCSNe model matter and neutrino GW waveforms may be detectable by both seismometer and interferometeric lunar GW detectors, with the latter design proposal extending 10 kpc to megaparsec detection distances.</description>

      <title>Simulation Study on Constraining GW Propagation Speed by GW and GRB Joint Observation on Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theories of modified gravity suggest that the propagation speed of gravitational wave (GW) $v_g$ may deviate from the speed of light $c$. A constraint can be placed on the difference between $c$ and $v_g$ with a simple method that uses the arrival time delay between GW and electromagnetic (EM) wave simultaneously emitted from a burst event. We simulated the joint observation of GW and short Gamma-Ray burst (sGRB) signals from Binary Neutron Star (BNS) merger events in different observation campaigns, involving advanced LIGO (aLIGO) in design sensitivity and Einstein Telescope (ET) joint-detected with \textit{Fermi}/GBM. As a result, the relative precision of constraint on $v_g$ can reach $\sim 10^{-17}$ (aLIGO) and $\sim 10^{-18}$ (ET), which are one and two orders of magnitude better than that from GW170817, respectively. We continue to obtain the bound of graviton mass $m_g \leq 7.1(3.2)\times 10^{-20}\,$eV with aLIGO (ET). Applying the Standard-Model Extension (SME) test framework, the constraint on $v_g$ allows us to study the Lorentz violation in the nondispersive, nonbirefringent limit of the gravitational sector. We obtain the constraints of the dimensionless isotropic coefficients $\bar{s}_{00}^{(4)}$ at mass dimension $d = 4$, which are $-1\times 10^{-15}&lt; \bar{s}_{00}^{(4)}&lt;9\times 10^{-17}$ for aLIGO and $-4\times 10^{-16}&lt; \bar{s}_{00}^{(4)}&lt;8\times 10^{-18}$ for ET.</description>

      <title>The origin of the soft excess in the luminous quasar HE 1029-1401</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enigmatic and intriguing phenomenon of the "soft excess" observed in the X-ray spectra of luminous quasars continues to be a subject of considerable interest and debate in the field of high-energy astrophysics. This study focuses on the quasar HE 1029-1401 ($z=0.086$, $\log(L_{\rm{bol}}/[\rm{erg\,s^{-1}}])= 46.0 \pm 0.2$), with a particular emphasis on investigating the properties of the hot corona and the physical origin of the soft excess. In this study, we present the results of a joint \textit{XMM-Newton}/\textit{NuSTAR} monitoring campaign of this quasar conducted in May 2022. The source exhibits a cold and narrow Fe $\rm{K}\alpha$ emission line at 6.4 keV, in addition to the detection of a broad component. Our findings suggest that the soft excess observed in HE 1029-1401 can be adequately explained by Comptonized emission originating from a warm corona. Specifically, fitting the spectra with two \nthcomp\, component we found that the warm corona is characterized by a photon index ($\Gamma^{w}$) of $2.75\pm0.05$ and by an electron temperature ($kT_{e}^{w}$) of $0.39^{+0.06}_{-0.04}$ keV, while the optical depth ($\tau^{w}$) is found to be $23\pm3$. We also test more physical models for the warm corona, corresponding to two scenarios: pure Comptonization and Comptonization plus reflection. Both models provide a good fit to the data, and are in agreement with a radially extended warm corona having a size of a few tens of gravitational radii.</description>

      <title>Covariant approach to relativistic large-eddy simulations: Lagrangian filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a proof-of-principle implementation of the first fully covariant filtering scheme applied to relativistic fluid turbulence. The filtering is performed with respect to special observers, identified dynamically as moving with the "bulk of the flow". This means that filtering does not depend on foliations of spacetime but rather on the intrinsic fibration traced out by the observers. The covariance of the approach means that the results may be lifted into an arbitrary, curved spacetime. This practical step follows theoretical work showing that the residuals introduced by filtering a fine-scale ideal fluid can be represented by a non-ideal fluid prescription at the coarse scale. We interpret such non-ideal terms using a simple first-order gradient model, which allows us to extract effective turbulent viscosities and conductivity. A statistical regression on these terms shows that the majority of their variation may be explained by the thermodynamic properties of the filtered fluid and invariants of its flow, such as the shear and vorticity. This serves as a validation of the method and enables us to fit a functional, power-law form for the non-ideal coefficients -- an approach that may be used practically to give a sub-grid closure model in large-eddy simulations.</description>

      <title>SN 2023zaw: the low-energy explosion of an ultra-stripped star, with non-radioactive heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most stripped envelope supernova progenitors are formed through binary interaction, losing hydrogen and/or helium from their outer layers. An emerging class of supernovae with the highest degree of envelope-stripping are thought to be the product of stripping by a NS companion. However, relatively few examples are known and the outcomes of such systems can be diverse and are poorly understood at present. Here, we present spectroscopic observations and high cadence multi-band photometry of SN 2023zaw, a low ejecta mass and rapidly evolving supernova. SN 2023zaw was discovered in a nearby spiral galaxy at D = 39.7 Mpc, with significant Milky Way extinction, $E(B-V) = 0.21$, and significant (but uncertain) host extinction. Bayesian evidence comparison reveals that nickel is not the only power source and an additional energy source is required to explain our observations. Our models suggest an ejecta mass of $M_{\rm ej} \sim 0.07\,\rm M_\odot$ and a synthesised nickel mass of $M_{\rm ej} \sim 0.007\,\rm M_\odot$ is required to explain the explosion. However an additional heating from a magnetar or interaction with circumstellar material is required to power the early light curve.</description>

      <title>STONKS: Quasi-real time XMM-Newton transient detection system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over recent decades, astronomy has entered the era of massive data and real-time surveys. This is improving the study of transient objects - although they still contain some of the most poorly understood phenomena in astrophysics, as it is inherently more difficult to obtain data on them. In order to help detect these objects in their brightest state, we have built a quasi-real time transient detection system for the XMM-Newton pipeline: the Search for Transient Objects in New detections using Known Sources (STONKS) pipeline. STONKS detects long-term X-ray transients by automatically comparing new XMM-Newton detections to any available archival X-ray data at this position, sending out an alert if the amplitude of variability between observations is over 5. This required an initial careful cross-correlation and flux calibration of various X-ray catalogs from different observatories (XMM-Newton, Chandra, Swift, ROSAT, and eROSITA). We also systematically computed the XMM-Newton upper limits at the position of any X-ray source covered by the XMM-Newton observational footprint, even without any XMM-Newton counterpart. The behavior of STONKS was then tested on all 483 observations performed with imaging mode in 2021. Over the 2021 testing run, STONKS provided $0.7^{+0.7}_{-0.5}$ alerts per day, about 80% of them being serendipitous. STONKS also detected targeted tidal disruption events, ensuring its ability to detect other serendipitous events. As a byproduct of our method, the archival multi-instrument catalog contains about one million X-ray sources, with 15% of them involving several catalogs and 60% of them having XMM-Newton upper limits. STONKS demonstrates a great potential for revealing future serendipitous transient X-ray sources, providing the community with the ability to follow-up on these objects a few days after their detection.</description>

      <title>Effect of spin in binary neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of spin on equal and unequal mass binary neutron star mergers using finite-temperature, composition-dependent Hempel-Schaffner-Bielich (SFHo) equation of state, via 3+1 general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations which take into account neutrino emission and absorption. Equal mass cases that have a mass of $M_{1,2}$ =$1.27$, $1.52$ and $2.05M_{\odot}$, result in a supramassive neutron star, a delayed, and a prompt collapse to a black hole, respectively. For all cases, we analyse the effect of initial spin on dynamics, on the structure of the final remnant, its spin evolution, the amount and composition of the ejected matter, gravitational waves, neutrino energy and luminosities. We show that in equal mass binary neutron star mergers, the ejected mass could reach $\sim0.085M_{\odot}$ for highly aligned-spins ($\chi=0.67$). The black hole which results from such highly spinning, high-mass binary neutron star merger reaches a dimensionless spin of $0.92$; this is the highest spin reached in binary neutron star mergers, to date.</description>

      <title>Absence of nebular He{\sc ii} $\lambda$4686 constrains the UV emission from the Ultraluminous X-ray pulsar NGC~1313~X--2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While much has been learned in recent decades about the X-ray emission of the extragalactic Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), their radiative output in the UV band remains poorly constrained. Understanding of the full ULX spectral energy distribution (SED) is imperative to constrain the accretion flow geometry powering them, as well as their radiative power. Here we present constraints on the UV emission of the pulsating ULX (PULX) NGC~1313~X--2 based on the absence of nebular {He{\sc ii} $\lambda$4686} emission in its immediate environment. To this end, we first perform multi-band spectroscopy of the ULX to derive three realistic extrapolations of the SED into the unaccessible UV, each predicting varying levels of UV luminosity. We then perform photo-ionization modelling of the bubble nebula and predict the {He{\sc ii} $\lambda$4686} fluxes that should have been observed based on each of the derived SEDs. We then compare these predictions with the derived upper limit on {\heii} from MUSE data, which allows us to infer a UV luminosity $L_\mathrm{UV} \lesssim 1 \times 10^{39}$ erg/s in the PULX NGC~1313~X--2. Comparing the UV luminosity inferred with other ULXs, our work suggests there may be an intrinsic difference between hard and soft ULXs, either related to different mass-transfer rates and/or the nature of the accretor. However, a statistical sample of ULXs with inferred UV luminosities is needed to fully determine the distinguishing features between hard and soft ULXs. Finally, we discuss ULXs ionising role in the context of the nebular {He{\sc ii} $\lambda$4686} line observed in star-forming, metal-poor galaxies.</description>

      <title>Irregularity in spectrum of the primary cosmic rays mass composition at an energy of ~ 10 PeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Irregularity in spectrum of the primary cosmic rays (PCR) mass composition at an energy of ~ 10 PeV is considered. To assess changes of the PCR mass composition, the X-ray emulsion chamber (XREC) method and the halo-method based on the XEC were used. The study of changes in the PCR mass composition was carried out based on the experimentally obtained characteristics of the extensive air showers (EAS) trunks, where fluctuations of these characteristics are minimal and information about the primary interaction of PCR nuclei with atmospheric atoms is maximally preserved. It is shown that at an energy of ~ 10 PeV there is a local maximum in the heavy nuclei fraction. This maximum is correlated with the PCR sources, - variable stars SR (red giants and super-giants) and WR (Wolf-Rayet).</description>

      <title>Multi-Zone Modeling of Black Hole Accretion and Feedback in 3D GRMHD: Bridging Vast Spatial and Temporal Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating accretion and feedback from the horizon scale of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) out to galactic scales is challenging because of the vast range of scales involved. We describe and test a "multi-zone" technique which is designed to tackle this difficult problem in 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. We simulate accretion on a non-spinning SMBH ($a_*=0$) using initial conditions from a large scale galaxy simulation, and achieve steady state over 8 decades in radius. The density scales with radius as $\rho \propto r^{-1}$ inside the Bondi radius $R_B$, which is located at $R_B=2\times 10^5 \,r_g$ ($\approx 60\,{\rm pc}$ for M87) where $r_g$ is the gravitational radius of the SMBH; the plasma-$\beta\sim$ unity, indicating an extended magnetically arrested state; the mass accretion rate $\dot{M}$ is $\approx 1\%$ of the analytical Bondi accretion rate $\dot{M}_B$; and there is continuous energy feedback out to $\approx 100R_B$ (or beyond $&gt;\,{\rm kpc}$) at a rate $\approx 0.02 \dot{M}c^2$. Surprisingly, any ordered rotation in the external medium does not survive as the magnetized gas flows to smaller radii, and the final steady solution is very similar to when the exterior has no rotation. Using the multi-zone method, we simulate GRMHD accretion for a wide range of Bondi radii, $R_{\rm B} \sim 10^2 - 10^7\,r_{\rm g}$, and find that $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_B\approx (R_B/6\, r_g)^{-0.5}$.</description>

      <title>A Joint X-ray and Optical Study of the Massive Redback Pulsar J2215+5135</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR J2215+5135 (J2215) is a `redback' spider pulsar, where the intrabinary shock (IBS) wraps around the pulsar rather than the stellar-mass companion. Spider orbital light curves are modulated, dominated by their binary companion thermal emission in the optical band and by IBS synchrotron emission in the X-rays. We report on new XMM-Newton X-ray and U-band observations of J2215. We produce orbital light curves and use them to model the system properties. From our optical light curve modeling, we find a neutron star mass $M_{NS}=2.15\pm0.10 M_\odot$, somewhat lower than previously reported. From the X-ray analysis, we find that the IBS still wraps around the pulsar, but with a wind/companion wind momenta ratio unusually close to unity, implying a flatter IBS geometry {than seen in other spiders. Estimating the companion wind momentum and speed from the X-ray light curve, we find a companion mass-loss rate of ${\dot M}_c\gtrsim10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, so that J2215 may become an isolated millisecond pulsar in $\sim 1$ Gyr. Our X-ray analyses support models of magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the highly magnetized relativistic IBS.</description>

      <title>A Heavily Scattered Fast Radio Burst Is Viewed Through Multiple Galaxy Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength study of the apparently non-repeating, heavily scattered fast radio burst, FRB 20221219A, detected by the Deep Synoptic Array 110 (DSA-110). The burst exhibits a moderate dispersion measure (DM) of $706.7^{+0.6}_{-0.6}$ $\mathrm{pc}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and an unusually high scattering timescale of $\tau_{\mathrm{obs}} = 19.2_{-2.7}^{+2.7}$ ms at 1.4 GHz. We associate the FRB with a Milky Way-like host galaxy at $z_{\mathrm{host}} = 0.554$ of stellar mass $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_{\star, \mathrm{host}}) = 10.20^{+0.04}_{-0.03} ~M_\odot$. We identify two intervening galaxy halos at redshifts $z_{\mathrm{igh1}} = 0.492$ and $z_{\mathrm{igh2}} = 0.438$, with low impact parameters, $b_{\mathrm{igh1}} = 43.0_{-11.3}^{+11.3}$ kpc and $b_{\mathrm{igh2}} = 36.1_{-11.3}^{+11.3}$ kpc, and intermediate stellar masses, $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_{\star, \mathrm{igh1}}) = 10.01^{+0.02}_{-0.02} ~M_\odot$ and $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_{\star, \mathrm{igh2}}) = 10.60^{+0.02}_{-0.02} ~M_\odot$. The presence of two such galaxies suggests that the sightline is significantly overcrowded compared to the median sightline to this redshift, as inferred from the halo mass function. We perform a detailed analysis of the sightline toward FRB 20221219A, constructing both DM and scattering budgets. Our results suggest that, unlike most well-localized sources, the host galaxy does not dominate the observed scattering. Instead, we posit that an intersection with a single partially ionized cloudlet in the circumgalactic medium of an intervening galaxy could account for the substantial scattering in FRB 20221219A and remain in agreement with typical electron densities inferred for extra-planar dense cloud-like structures in the Galactic and extragalactic halos (e.g., high-velocity clouds).</description>

      <title>The ORT and the uGMRT Pulsar Monitoring Program : Pulsar Timing Irregularities &amp; the Gaussian Process Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-down law of pulsars is generally perturbed by two types of timing irregularities: glitches and timing noise. Glitches are sudden changes in the rotational frequency of pulsars, while timing noise is a discernible stochastic wandering in the phase, period, or spin-down rate of a pulsar. We present the timing results of a sample of glitching pulsars observed using the Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT) and the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). Our findings include timing noise analysis for 17 pulsars, with seven being reported for the first time. We detected five glitches in four pulsars and a glitch-like event in J1825-0935. The frequency evolution of glitch in pulsars, J0742-2822 and J1740-3015, is presented for the first time. Additionally, we report timing noise results for three glitching pulsars. The timing noise was analyzed separately in the pre-glitch region and post-glitch regions. We observed an increase in the red noise parameters in the post-glitch regions, where exponential recovery was considered in the noise analysis. Timing noise can introduce ambiguities in the correct evaluation of glitch observations. Hence, it is important to consider timing noise in glitch analysis. We propose an innovative glitch verification approach designed to discern between a glitch and strong timing noise. The novel glitch analysis technique is also demonstrated using the observed data.</description>

      <title>Quasi-isotropic UV Emission in the ULX NGC~1313~X--1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major prediction of most super-Eddington accretion theories is the presence of anisotropic emission from supercritical disks, but the degree of anisotropy and its dependency with energy remain poorly constrained observationally. A key breakthrough allowing to test such predictions was the discovery of high-excitation photoionized nebulae around Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). We present efforts to tackle the degree of anisotropy of the UV/EUV emission in super-Eddington accretion flows by studying the emission-line nebula around the archetypical ULX NGC~1313~X--1. We first take advantage of the extensive wealth of optical/near-UV and X-ray data from \textit{Hubble Space Telescope}, \textit{XMM-Newton}, \textit{Swift}-XRT and \textit{NuSTAR} observatories to perform multi-band, state-resolved spectroscopy of the source to constrain the spectral energy distribution (SED) along the line of sight. We then compare spatially-resolved \texttt{Cloudy} predictions using the observed line-of-sight SED with the nebular line ratios to assess whether the nebula `sees' the same SED as observed along the line of sight. We show that to reproduce the line ratios in the surrounding nebula, the photo-ionizing SED must be a factor $\approx 4$ dimmer in ultraviolet emission than along the line-of-sight. Such nearly-iosotropic UV emission may be attributed to the quasi-spherical emission from the wind photosphere. We also discuss the apparent dichotomy in the observational properties of emission-line nebulae around soft and hard ULXs, and suggest only differences in mass-transfer rates can account for the EUV/X-ray spectral differences, as opposed to inclination effects. Finally, our multi-band spectroscopy suggest the optical/near-UV emission is not dominated by the companion star.</description>

      <title>Synchrotron polarization with a partially random magnetic field: general approach, and application to X-ray polarization from SNRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnostics based on the polarization properties of the synchrotron emission can provide precious information on both the ordered structure and the random level of the magnetic field. While this issue has been already analysed in the radio, the polarization data recently obtained by the mission IXPE have shown the need to extend this analysis to the X-rays. While our immediate target are young SNRs, the scope of this analysis is wider. We aim at extending the analysis to particle energy distributions more complex than a power law, as well as to investigate a wider range of cases involving a composition of ordered and random magnetic fields. Since only in a limited number of cases an analytical approach is possible, we have devised to this purpose an optimised numerical scheme, and we have directly used it to investigate particle energy distributions in the form of a power law with an exponential, or super-exponential cutoff. We have also considered a general combination of a ordered field plus an anisotropic random component. We have shown that the previously derived analytic formulae, valid for power-law distributions, may be good approximations of the polarization degree also in the more general case with a cutoff, as typically seen in X-rays. We have explicitly analysed the young SNRs SN 1006, Tycho and Cas A. In particular, for SN 1006, we have proved the consistency between the radio and X-ray polarization degrees, favouring the case of predominantly random field, with an anisotropic distribution. In addition, for the power-law case, we have investigated the effect of a compression on both ordered and random magnetic field components, aimed at describing the mid-age radio SNRs. This work allows a more efficient exploitation of radio and X-ray measurements of the synchrotron polarization, and is addressed to present observations with IXPE as well as to future projects.</description>

      <title>A Study of the Spectral properties of Gamma-Ray Bursts with the Precursors and Main bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is no consensus yet on whether the precursor and the main burst of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have the same origin, and their jet composition is still unclear. In order to further investigate this issue, we systematically search 21 Fermi GRBs with both precursor and main burst for spectral analysis. We first perform Bayesian time-resolved spectral analysis and find that almost all the precursors and the main bursts (94.4$\%$) exhibit thermal components, and the vast majority of them have low-energy spectral index ($\alpha$) (72.2$\%$) that exceed the limit of synchrotron radiation. We then analyse the evolution and correlation of the spectral parameters and find that approximately half of the $\alpha$ (50$\%$) of the precursors and the main bursts evolve in a similar pattern, while peak energy ($E_{p}$) (55.6$\%$) behave similarly, and their evolution is mainly characterized by flux tracking; for the $\alpha-F$ (the flux) relation, more than half of the precursors and the main bursts (61.1$\%$) exhibit roughly similar patterns; the $E_{p}-F$ relation in both the precursor and main burst (100$\%$) exhibits a positive correlation of at least moderate strength. Next, we constrain the outflow properties of the precursors and the main bursts and find that most of them exhibit typical properties of photosphere radiation. Finally, we compare the time-integrated spectra of the precursors and the main bursts and find that nearly all of them are located in similar regions of the Amati relation and follow the Yonetoku relation. Therefore, we conclude that main bursts are continuations of precursors and they may share a common physical origin.</description>

      <title>WTP19aalnxx: Discovery of a bright mid-infrared transient in the emerging class of low luminosity supernovae revealed by delayed circumstellar interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While core-collapse supernovae (SNe) often show early and consistent signs of circumstellar (CSM) interaction, some exhibit delayed signatures due to interaction with distant material around the progenitor star. Here we present the discovery in NEOWISE data of WTP19aalnxx, a luminous mid-infrared (IR) transient in the outskirts of the galaxy KUG 0022-007 at $\approx 190$ Mpc. First detected in 2018, WTP19aalnxx reaches a peak absolute (Vega) magnitude of $\approx-22$ at $4.6 \, \mu$m in $\approx3$ yr, comparable to the most luminous interacting SNe. Archival data reveal a $\gtrsim 5\times$ fainter optical counterpart detected since 2015, while follow-up near-IR observations in 2022 reveal an extremely red ($Ks-W2 \approx 3.7$ mag) active transient. Deep optical spectroscopy confirm strong CSM interaction signatures via intermediate-width Balmer emission lines and coronal metal lines. Modeling the broadband spectral energy distribution, we estimate the presence of $\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ M$_\odot$ of warm dust, likely formed in the shock interaction region. Together with the lack of nebular Fe emission, we suggest that WTP19aalnxx is a missed, low (optical) luminosity SN in an emerging family of core-collapse SNe distinguished by their CSM-interaction-powered mid-IR emission that outshines the optical bands. Investigating the Zwicky Transient Facility sample of SNe in NEOWISE data, we find $17$ core-collapse SNe ($\gtrsim 3$% in a volume-limited sample) without early signs of CSM interaction that exhibit delayed IR brightening, suggestive of dense CSM shells at $\lesssim 10^{17}$cm. We suggest that synoptic IR surveys offer a new route to revealing late-time CSM interaction and the prevalence of intense terminal mass loss in massive stars.</description>

      <title>Multi-Messenger Emission Characteristics of Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Messenger observations and theory of astrophysical objects is fast becoming a critical research area in the astrophysics scientific community. In particular, point-like objects like that of BL Lac, flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ), and blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCU) are of distinct interest among those who look at the synchrotron, Compton, neutrino, and cosmic ray emissions sourced from compact objects. Notably, there is also much interest in the correlation between multi-frequency observations of blazars and neutrino surveys on source demographics. In this review we look at such multi-frequency and multi-physics correlations of the radio, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray fluxes of different classes of blazars from a collection of survey catalogues. This multi-physics survey of blazars shows that there are characteristic cross-correlations in the spectra of blazars when considering their multi-frequency and multi-messenger emission. Accompanying this will be a review of cosmic ray and neutrino emissions from blazars and their characteristics.</description>

      <title>New limits on neutrino decay from high-energy astrophysical neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since neutrinos have mass differences, they could decay into one another. But their lifetimes are likely long, even when shortened by new physics, so decay likely impacts neutrinos only during long trips. This makes high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, traveling for up to billions of light-years, sensitive probes of decay. However, their sensitivity must be tempered by reality. We derive from them thorough bounds on the neutrino lifetimes accounting for critical astrophysical unknowns and the nuances of neutrino detection. Using the diffuse neutrino flux, we disfavor lifetimes $\tau \lesssim 20$-450 s $(m/{\rm eV})$, based on present IceCube data, and forecast factor-of-10 improvements by upcoming detectors. Using, for the first time, neutrinos from the active galaxy NGC 1068, extant unknowns preclude placing lifetime bounds today, but upcoming detectors could disfavor $\tau \sim 100$-5000 s $(m/{\rm eV})$.</description>

Abstract: In this chapter, we give an overview of our current understanding of the physics of accreting massive black hole binaries (MBHBs), with a special focus on the latest developments in numerical simulations and General-Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations in particular. We give a self-contained global picture of how to model accretion onto MBHBs, analyzing different aspects of the system such as the dynamics of the circumbinary disk, mini-disks, outflows, the role of magnetic fields, and electromagnetic signatures. We discuss important questions and open problems related to these systems, what are the advantages and disadvantages of the different numerical approaches, and what robust knowledge we have built from simulations.</description>

Abstract: A Planck scale inflationary era -- in a quantum gravity theory predicting discreteness of quantum geometry at the fundamental scale -- produces the scale invariant spectrum of inhomogeneities with very small tensor-to-scalar ratio of perturbations and a hot big bang leading to a natural dark matter genesis scenario. Here we evoke the possibility that some of the major puzzles in cosmology would have an explanation rooted in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Can the second time-derivative of the orbital frequency of binary pulsars be used for testing general relativity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With precision pulsar timing, measured values of a large set of pulsar parameters are obtainable. For some of those parameters, such as the time-derivatives of spin or orbital periods (in the case of binary pulsars), the measured values are not the intrinsic values of the parameters as they contain contributions from the dynamical effects. In the case of orbital period derivatives, the intrinsic values are essentially the general relativistic results. Pulsar timing solution also provides measurement of higher time-derivatives of orbital frequency for some pulsars. We specifically focus on the second time-derivative of the orbital frequency to explore its application in testing general relativity. In this work, we have provided a formalism to estimate the general relativistic contribution to the second derivative of the orbital frequency. We have calculated the dynamical effect contributions as well as the general relativistic contributions to the second time-derivative of the orbital period for real as well as synthetic pulsars. We find that the general relativistic contribution to the second time-derivative of the orbital period is negligibly small compared to the observed values of the real pulsars.</description>

      <title>CTA and SWGO can Discover Higgsino Dark Matter Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal higgsino dark matter (DM), with a mass near 1.1 TeV, is one of the most well-motivated and untested DM candidates. Leveraging recent hydrodynamic cosmological simulations that give DM density profiles in Milky Way analogue galaxies we show that the line-like gamma-ray signal predicted from higgsino annihilation in the Galactic Center could be detected at high significance with the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) and Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) for all but the most pessimistic DM profiles. We perform the most sensitive search to-date for the line-like signal using 15 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope, coming within an order one factor of the necessary sensitivity to detect the higgsino for some Milky Way analogue DM density profiles. We show that H.E.S.S. has sub-leading sensitivity relative to Fermi for the higgsino at present. In contrast, we analyze H.E.S.S. inner Galaxy data for the thermal wino model with a mass near 2.8 TeV; we find no evidence for a DM signal and exclude the wino by over a factor of two in cross-section for all DM profiles considered. In the process, we identify and attempt to correct what appears to be an inconsistency in previous H.E.S.S. inner Galaxy analyses for DM annihilation related to the analysis effective area, which may weaken the DM cross-section sensitivity claimed in those works by around an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Spectrum and polarization of the Galactic center radio transient ASKAP J173608.2-321635 from THOR-GC and VLITE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radio transient ASKAP J173608.2-321735, at the position (l,b)= (356.0872,-0.0390), was serendipitously observed by The HI/OH/Recombination Line Survey of the Galactic Center (THOR-GC) at three epochs in March 2020, April 2020 and February 2021. The source was detected only on 2020 April 11 with flux density 20.6 +/- 1.1 mJy at 1.23 GHz and in-band spectral index alpha = -3.1 +/- 0.2. The commensal VLA Low-band Ionsophere and Transient Experiment (VLITE) simultaneously detected the source at 339 MHz with a flux density 122.6 +/- 20.4 mJy, indicating a spectral break below 1 GHz. The rotation measure in April 2020 was 63.9 +/- 0.3rad/m2, which almost triples the range of the variable rotation measure observed by Wang et al. (2021) to ~130 rad/m2. The polarization angle, corrected for Faraday rotation, was 97 +/- 6 degrees. The 1.23 GHz linear polarization was 76.7% +/- 3.9% with wavelength-dependent depolarization indicating Faraday depth dispersion sigma_phi = 4.8^{+0.5}_{-0.7} rad/m2. We find an upper limit to circular polarization |V|/I &lt; 10.1%. Interpretation of the data in terms of diffractive scattering of radio waves by a plasma near the source indicates electron density and line-of-sight magnetic field strength within a factor 3 of n_e ~2 cm^{-3} and B_par ~2 x 10^5 microgauss. Combined with causality limits to the size of the source, these parameters are consistent with the low-frequency spectral break resulting from synchrotron self-absorption, not free-free absorption. A possible interpretation of the source is a highly supersonic neutron star interacting with a changing environment.</description>

Abstract: We examine the shadow cast by a Kerr black hole, focusing on constraints on photons corresponding to different shadow boundaries. The photons are related to different orbital ranges and impact parameter values, creating a map of the shadow boundaries. Our analysis fixes also the conditions under which it is possible to observe an "imprint" of the black hole (outer) ergosurface and (outer) ergoregion on the Kerr black hole shadow boundary. The counter-rotating case resulted strongly constrained with respect to the co-rotating case, constituting a remarkable and significant difference where the counter-rotating component associated with the shadow boundary is strongly distinct from the co-rotating one. However, in this framework, even the co-rotating photons imply restrictions on conditions on the spins and planes, which are bounded by limiting values. We believe the results found here, being a tracer for the central black hole, can constitute new templates for the ongoing observations.</description>

      <title>Resonant Conversion of Wave Dark Matter in the Ionosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider resonant wave-like dark matter conversion into low-frequency radio waves in the Earth's ionosphere. Resonant conversion occurs when the dark matter mass and the plasma frequency coincide, defining a range $m_{ \text{DM} } \sim 10^{-9} - 10^{-8}$ eV where this approach is best suited. Owing to the non-relativistic nature of dark matter and the typical variational scale of the Earth's ionosphere, the standard linearized approach to computing dark matter conversion is not suitable. We therefore solve a second-order boundary-value problem, effectively framing the ionosphere as a driven cavity filled with a positionally-varying plasma. An electrically-small dipole antenna targeting the generated radio waves can be orders of magnitude more sensitive to dark photon and axion-like particle dark matter in the relevant mass range. The present study opens up a promising way of testing hitherto unexplored parameter space which could be further improved with a dedicated instrument.</description>

      <title>The time-variable ultraviolet sky: Active Galactic Nuclei, Stars and White Dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we present the 1UVA catalog of time variable ultraviolet (UV) sources. We describe a new analysis pipeline, the VAriable Source Clustering Analysis (VASCA). We apply the pipeline to 10 years of data from the GALaxy Evolution eXplorer (GALEX) satellite. We analyse a sky area of 302 deg$^2$ , resulting in the detection of 4202 time-variable UV sources. We cross correlate these sources with multi-frequency data from the Gaia satellite and the SIMBAD database, finding an association for 3655 sources. The source sample is dominated by Active Galactic Nuclei ($\approx$73 %) and stars ($\approx$24 %). We look at UV and multi-frequency properties of these sources, focusing on the stellar population. We find UV variability for four White Dwarfs. One of them, WD J004917.14-252556.81, has recently been found to be the most massive pulsating White Dwarf. Its Spectral Energy Distribution shows no sign of a stellar companion. The observed flux variability is unexpected and difficult to explain.</description>

      <title>X-ray and UV radiation in the planet-forming T-Tauri system PDS 70. Signs of accretion and coronal activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planet formation takes place in protoplanetary discs around young T-Tauri stars. PDS 70 is one of the first confirmed examples of a system where the planets are currently forming in gaps in the disc, and can be directly imaged. One of the main early influences on planet formation is the lifetime of the protoplanetary disk, which is limited by the intense stellar X-ray and UV radiation. Stellar coronal activity and accretion of material onto the star are both potential sources of XUV radiation. Previous \textit{Swift} observations detected UV emission, which were consistent with a low rate of accretion. We present follow up observations with the XMM-Newton observatory, which observed PDS 70 simultaneously in X-ray and UV in order to determine intensity of XUV radiation in the system, and identify if the source is coronal, accretion, or both. We detect a strong source in both X-ray and UV, with an average X-ray 0.2-12 keV luminosity of $1.37\times10^{30}\ \mathrm{erg\ s}^{-1}$, and a possible flare which increased the luminosity to $2.8\times10^{30}\ \mathrm{erg\ s}^{-1}$. The UV flux density is in excess of what would be expected from chromospheric emission, and supports the interpretation that PDS 70 has continuing weak accretion less than $\sim10^{-10}\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}}$. The implications of the detected X-ray and UV radiation are that the disc is likely to be in the final stages of dispersal, and will be completely evaporated in the next million years, bringing an end to the primary planet formation process.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave dark siren cosmology systematics from galaxy weighting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of GW170817 provided the first direct gravitational-wave measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, demonstrating the potential power of standard-siren cosmology. The dark siren approach can be utilized for gravitational-wave sources in the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart: one considers all galaxies contained within the localization volume as potential hosts. When statistically averaging over the potential host galaxies, one can weight them by their luminosities to account for physically-motivated prescriptions (e.g., tracing star formation or stellar mass). Using mock galaxy catalogs, we explore the impact of these weightings on the measurement of $H_0$, focusing on the bias in $H_0$ inference that results from incorrectly-weighted prescriptions. We find that assuming an incorrect galaxy host probability can lead to significant biases in $H_0$, up to about five times off from typical values inferred by current experiments. These biases are due to inconsistent galaxy weighted redshift distributions as well as preferentially selecting the incorrect host during inference. The magnitudes of these biases are influenced by the galaxy number density along each line of sight, the uncertainty in the measurement of the gravitational-wave luminosity distance, and correlations in the parameter space of galaxies. These biases may be overcome with future GW detectors that contain better GW localization, using a strategic choice of weighting prescription, or with increasing the SNR cut. We propose using hierarchical inference as a diagnosis of incorrectly-weighted prescriptions, which can further be used to simultaneously infer the correct weighting scheme and cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>A Black-Hole Excision Scheme for General Relativistic Core-Collapse Supernova Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fallback supernovae and the collapsar scenario for long-gamma ray burst and hypernovae have received considerable interest as pathways to black-hole formation and extreme transient events. Consistent simulations of these scenarios require a general relativistic treatment and need to deal appropriately with the formation of a singularity. Free evolution schemes for the Einstein equations can handle the formation of black holes by means of excision or puncture schemes. However, in constrained schemes, which offer distinct advantages in long-term numerical stability in stellar collapse simulations over well above $10^{4}$ light-crossing time scales, the dynamical treatment of black-hole spacetimes is more challenging. Building on previous work on excision in conformally flat spacetimes, we here present the implementation of a black-hole excision scheme for supernova simulations with the CoCoNuT-FMT neutrino transport code. We describe in detail a choice of boundary conditions that ensures long-time numerical stability, and also address upgrades to the hydrodynamics solver that are required to stably evolve the relativistic accretion flow onto the black hole. The scheme is currently limited to a spherically symmetric metric, but the hydrodynamics can be treated multi-dimensionally. For demonstration, we present a spherically symmetric simulation of black-hole formation in an $85 M_\odot$ star, as well as a two-dimensional simulation of the fallback explosion of the same progenitor. These extend past 9s and 0.3s after black-hole formation, respectively.</description>

      <title>Viscous hydrodynamic evolution of neutron star merger accretion disks: a code comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accretion disk formed after a neutron star merger is an important contributor to the total ejecta from the merger, and hence to the kilonova and the $r$-process yields of each event. Axisymmetric viscous hydrodynamic simulations of these disks can capture thermal mass ejection due to neutrino absorption and in the advective phase -- after neutrino cooling has subsided -- and are thus likely to provide a lower-limit to the total disk ejecta relative to MHD evolution. Here we present a comparison between two viscous hydrodynamic codes that have been used extensively on this problem over the past decade: ALCAR and FLASH. We choose a representative setup with a black hole at the center, and vary the treatment of viscosity and neutrino transport. We find good overall agreement ($\sim 10\%$ level) in most quantities. The average outflow velocity is sensitive to the treatment of the nuclear binding energy of heavy nuclei, showing a larger variation than other quantities. We post-process trajectories from both codes with the same nuclear network, and explore the effects of code differences on nucleosynthesis yields, heating rates, and kilonova light curves. For the latter, we also assess the effect of varying the number of tracer particles in reconstructing the spatial abundance distribution for kilonova light curve production.</description>

      <title>Ground-based and JWST Observations of SN 2022pul: II. Evidence from Nebular Spectroscopy for a Violent Merger in a Peculiar Type-Ia Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of ground-based and JWST observations of SN~2022pul, a peculiar "03fg-like" (or "super-Chandrasekhar") Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), in the nebular phase at 338d post explosion. Our combined spectrum continuously covers 0.4--14 $\mu$m and includes the first mid-infrared spectrum of an 03fg-like SN Ia. Compared to normal SN Ia 2021aefx, SN 2022pul exhibits a lower mean ionization state, asymmetric emission-line profiles, stronger emission from the intermediate-mass elements (IMEs) argon and calcium, weaker emission from iron-group elements (IGEs), and the first unambiguous detection of neon in a SN Ia. Strong, broad, centrally peaked [Ne II] line at 12.81 $\mu$m was previously predicted as a hallmark of "violent merger'' SN Ia models, where dynamical interaction between two sub-$M_{ch}$ white dwarfs (WDs) causes disruption of the lower mass WD and detonation of the other. The violent merger scenario was already a leading hypothesis for 03fg-like SNe Ia; in SN 2022pul it can explain the large-scale ejecta asymmetries seen between the IMEs and IGEs and the central location of narrow oxygen and broad neon. We modify extant models to add clumping of the ejecta to better reproduce the optical iron emission, and add mass in the innermost region ($&lt; 2000$ km s$^{-1}$) to account for the observed narrow [O I]~$\lambda\lambda6300$, 6364 emission. A violent WD-WD merger explains many of the observations of SN 2022pul, and our results favor this model interpretation for the subclass of 03fg-like SN Ia.</description>

      <title>Tidal Disruption Events from three-body scatterings and eccentricity pumping in the disks of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) are routinely observed in quiescent galaxies, as stars from the nuclear star cluster are scattered into the loss cone of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). TDEs are also expected to occur in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), due to scattering or orbital eccentricity pumping of stars embedded in the innermost regions of the AGN accretion disk. Encounters with embedded stellar-mass black holes (BH) can result in AGN $\mu$TDEs. AGN TDEs and $\mu$TDEs could therefore account for a fraction of observed AGN variability. Here, by performing scattering experiments with the few-body code {\tt SpaceHub}, we compute the probability of AGN TDEs and $\mu$TDEs as a result of 3-body interactions between stars and binary BHs. We find that AGN TDEs are more probable during the early life of the AGNs, when rates are $\sim (6\times 10^{-5}-5 \times 10^{-2}) (f_\bullet/0.01)$ $~\rm{AGN}^{-1}$~yr$^{-1}$ (where $f_\bullet$ is the ratio between the number density of BHs and stars), generally higher than in quiescent galactic nuclei. By contrast, $\mu$TDEs should occur throughout the AGN lifetime at a rate of $\sim (1\times 10^{-4} - 4\times 10^{-2} (f_\bullet/0.01)$ $~\rm{AGN}^{-1}$~yr$^{-1}$. Detection and characterization of AGN TDEs and $\mu$ AGN TDEs with future surveys using {\em Rubin} and {\em Roman} will help constrain the populations of stars and compact objects embedded in AGN disks, a key input for the LVK AGN channel.</description>

      <title>Updating the first CHIME/FRB catalog of fast radio bursts with baseband data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2021, a catalog of 536 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) radio telescope was released by the CHIME/FRB Collaboration. This large collection of bursts, observed with a single instrument and uniform selection effects, has advanced our understanding of the FRB population. Here we update the results for 140 of these FRBs for which channelized raw voltage ('baseband') data are available. With the voltages measured by the telescope's antennas, it is possible to maximize the telescope sensitivity in any direction within the primary beam, an operation called 'beamforming'. This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the bursts and to localize them to sub-arcminute precision. The improved localization is also used to correct the beam response of the instrument and to measure fluxes and fluences with a ~10% uncertainty. Additionally, the time resolution is increased by three orders of magnitude relative to that in the first CHIME/FRB catalog, and, applying coherent dedispersion, burst morphologies can be studied in detail. Polarization information is also available for the full sample of 140 FRBs, providing an unprecedented dataset to study the polarization properties of the population. We release the baseband data beamformed to the most probable position of each FRB. These data are analyzed in detail in a series of accompanying papers.</description>

      <title>Circumstellar interaction signatures in the low luminosity type II SN 2021gmj</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present comprehensive optical observations of SN~2021gmj, a Type II supernova (SN~II) discovered within a day of explosion by the Distance Less Than 40~Mpc (DLT40) survey. Follow-up observations show that SN~2021gmj is a low-luminosity SN~II (LL~SN~II), with a peak magnitude $M_V = -15.45$ and Fe~II velocity of $\sim 1800 \ \mathrm{km} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at 50 days past explosion. Using the expanding photosphere method, we derive a distance of $17.8^{+0.6}_{-0.4}$~Mpc. From the tail of the light curve we obtain a radioactive nickel mass of $0.014 \pm 0.001$ M$_{\odot}$. The presence of circumstellar material (CSM) is suggested by the early-time light curve, early spectra, and high-velocity H$\alpha$ in absorption. Analytical shock-cooling models of the light curve cannot reproduce the fast rise, supporting the idea that the early-time emission is partially powered by the interaction of the SN ejecta and CSM. The inferred low CSM mass of 0.025 M$_{\odot}$ in our hydrodynamic-modeling light curve analysis is also consistent with our spectroscopy. We observe a broad feature near 4600 \AA, which may be high-ionization lines of C, N, or/and He~II. This feature is reproduced by radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of red supergiants with extended atmospheres. Several LL~SNe~II show similar spectral features, implying that high-density material around the progenitor may be common among them.</description>

      <title>Probing orbits of stellar mass objects deep in galactic nuclei with quasi-periodic eruptions</title>

Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few to ten hours from nearby galactic nuclei. The origin of QPEs is still unclear. In this work, we investigated the extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) + accretion disk model, where the disk is formed from a previous tidal disruption event (TDE). In this EMRI+TDE disk model, the QPEs are the result of collisions between a TDE disk and a stellar mass object (a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) orbiting around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. If this interpretation is correct, QPEs will be invaluable in probing the orbits of stellar mass objects in the vicinity of SMBHs, and further inferring the formation of EMRIs which are one of the primary targets of spaceborne gravitational wave missions. Taking GSN 069 as an example, we find the EMRI wherein is of low eccentricity ($e&lt;0.1$ at 3-$\sigma$ confidence level) and semi-major axis about $O(10^2)$ gravitational radii of the central SMBH, which is consistent with the prediction of the wet EMRI formation channel, while incompatible with alternatives.</description>

      <title>Formation of GW230529 from Isolated Binary Evolution and Its Electromagnetic Counterparts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this {\em{Letter}}, we explore the formation of the mass-gap black hole-neutron star (mgBHNS) merger detected in gravitational wave (GW) event, i.e., GW230529, from the isolated binary evolution channel, and study potential signatures of its electromagnetic counterparts. By adopting the `delayed' supernova prescription and reasonable model realizations, our population synthesis simulation results can simultaneously match the rate densities of mgBHNS and total BHNS mergers inferred from the population analyses, along with the population distribution of the BH mass in BHNS mergers reported by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Because GW230529 contributes significantly to the inferred mgBHNS rate densities, we suggest that GW230529 can be explained through the isolated binary evolution channel. Considering the AP4 (DD2) equation of state, the probability that GW230529 can make tidal disruption is $12.8\%$ ($63.2\%$). If GW230529 is a disrupted event, its kilonova peak apparent magnitude is predicted $\sim23-24\,{\rm{mag}}$, and hence, can be detected by the present survey projects and LSST. Since GW230529 could be an off-axis event inferred from the GW observation, its associated gamma-ray burst (GRB) might be too dim to be observed by $\gamma$-ray detectors, interpreting the lack of GRB observations. Our study suggests the existence of mgBHNS mergers formed through the isolated binary evolution channel due to the discovery of GW230529, indicating that BHNS mergers are still likely to be multimessenger sources that emit GWs, GRBs, and kilonovae. Although mgBHNS mergers account for $\sim50\%$ cosmological BHNS population, we find that $\gtrsim90\%$ disrupted BHNS mergers are expected to originate from mgBHNS mergers.</description>

      <title>Finding the Particularity of the Active Episode of SGR J1935+2154 during Which FRB 20200428 Occurred: Implication from Statistics of Fermi/GBM X-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data of the X-ray bursts (XRBs) of SGR J1935+2154, we investigate the temporal clustering of the bursts and the cumulative distribution of the waiting time and fluence/flux. It is found that the bursts occurring in the episode hosting FRB 20200428 have obviously shorter waiting times than those in the other episodes. The general statistical properties of the XRBs further indicate they could belong to a self-organized critical (SOC) system (e.g., starquakes), making them very similar to the earthquake phenomena. Then, according to a unified scaling law between the waiting time and energy of the earthquakes as well as their aftershocks, we implement an analogy analysis on the XRBs and find that the FRB episode owns more dependent burst events than the other episodes. It is indicated that the fast radio burst (FRB) emission could be produced by the interaction between different burst events, which could correspond to a collision between different seismic/Alfven waves or different explosion outflows. Such a situation could appear when the magnetar enters into a global intensive activity period.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Averaging of Radiative Transfer Coefficients for Relativistic Electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchrotron emissivities, absorptivities, and Faraday rotation and conversion coefficients are needed in modeling a variety of astrophysical sources, including Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) sources. We develop a method for estimating transfer coefficients that exploits their linear dependence on the electron distribution function, decomposing the distribution function into a sum of parts each of whose emissivity can be calculated easily. We refer to this procedure as stochastic averaging and apply it in two contexts. First, we use it to estimate the emissivity of an isotropic $\kappa$ distribution function with a high energy cutoff. The resulting coefficients can be evaluated efficiently enough to be used directly in ray-tracing calculations, and we provide an example calculation. Second, we use stochastic averaging to assess the effect of subgrid turbulence on the volume-averaged emissivity and along the way provide a prescription for a turbulent emissivity. We find that for parameters appropriate to EHT sources turbulence reduces the emissivity slightly. In the infrared turbulence can dramatically increase the emissivity.</description>

      <title>Supernova Explosions of the Lowest-Mass Massive Star Progenitors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We here focus on the behavior of supernovae that technically explode in 1D (spherical symmetry). When simulated in 3D, however, the outcomes of representative progenitors of this class are quite different in almost all relevant quantities. In 3D, the explosion energies can be two to ten times higher, and there are correspondingly large differences in the $^{56}$Ni yields. These differences between the 3D and 1D simulations reflect in part the relative delay to explosion of the latter and in the former the presence of proto-neutron star convection that boosts the driving neutrino luminosities by as much as $\sim$50\% at later times. In addition, we find that the ejecta in 3D models are more neutron-rich, resulting in significant weak r-process and $^{48}$Ca yields. Furthermore, we find that in 3D the core is an interesting, though subdominant, source of acoustic power. In summary, we find that though a model might be found theoretically to explode in 1D, one must perform supernova simulations in 3D to capture most of the associated observables. The differences between 1D and 3D models are just too large to ignore.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detection of the pair-echo emission from TeV gamma-ray bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) present in the voids of large-scale structures is considered to be the weakest magnetic field in the Universe. Gamma-ray observations of blazars in the GeV-TeV domain have led to lower limits on the IGMF strength based on the search for delayed or extended emission. Nevertheless, these results have been obtained with strong assumptions placed on the unknown source properties. The recent discovery of TeV radiation from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has paved the way for IGMF studies with these bright transients. Among the current TeV-detected GRBs, GRB 190114C, located at a redshift of $z = 0.42$, is the best sampled. Therefore, it can be considered to be representative of the properties of GRBs in the VHE domain. In addition, GRB 221009A ($z = 0.151$) is the brightest event ever detected. We present a phenomenological model based on the intrinsic properties of GRB 190114C and GRB 221009A to predict the delayed emission component (pair-echo) in the GeV-TeV band. We investigate the detectability of this component from low-redshift ($z \leq 1$) GRBs for three values of IGMF strength ($10^{-19}$ G, $10^{-18}$ G and $10^{-17}$ G), different observational times ($3$ hrs, $6$ hrs, and $9$ hrs) and source intrinsic properties. We find that for current and future generation $\gamma$-ray instruments, extending the observation for at least 3 hours after the GRB detection is a viable strategy for probing the IGMF. We also confirm that GeV-TeV observations of GRBs can probe IGMF strengths on the order of $10^{-17} -10^{-19}$ G, representing a competitive alternative to the current studies performed with active galactic nuclei (AGNs).</description>

      <title>SN 2019tua : A Type IIb Supernova with Multiple Bumps in the Light Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations and analysis of the type IIb supernova (SN) SN 2019tua, which exhibits multiple bumps in its declining light curves between 40 and 65 days after discovery. SN 2019tua shows a time to peak of about 25 days similar to other type IIb SNe. Our observations indicate a decrease in its brightness of about 1 magnitude in the 60 days after the peak. At about days 50, and 60, its multiband light curves exhibit bumpy behavior. The complex luminosity evolution of SN 2019tua could not be well modeled with a single currently popular energy source model, e.g., radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni, magnetar, interaction between the ejecta and a circumstellar shell. Even though the magnetar model has a smaller $\chi^2 / \text{dof}$ value, the complex changes in SN 2019tua's brightness suggest that more than one physical process might be involved. We propose a hybrid CSM interaction plus $^{56}$Ni model to explain the bolometric light curve (LC) of SN 2019tua. The fitting results show that the ejecta mass $M_{\rm ej} \approx 2.4~M_\odot$, the total CSM mass $M_{\rm CSM} \approx 1.0~M_\odot$, and the $^{56}$Ni mass $M_{\rm Ni} \approx 0.4~M_\odot$. The total kinetic energy of the ejecta is $E_k\approx 0.5 \times 10^{51}\rm~erg$. Pre-existing multiple shells suggest that the progenitor of SN 2019tua experienced mass ejections within approximately $\sim6 - 44$ years prior to the explosion.</description>

      <title>I-Love-Q anisotropically: Universal relations for compact stars with scalar pressure anisotropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:1503.02726v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Certain physical quantities that characterize neutron stars and quark stars (e.g. their mass, spin angular momentum and quadrupole moment) are interrelated in a way that is approximately insensitive to their internal structure. Such approximately universal relations are useful to break degeneracies in data analysis for future radio, X-ray and gravitational wave observations. Although the pressure inside compact stars is most likely nearly isotropic, certain scenarios have been put forth that suggest otherwise, for example due to phase transitions. We here investigate whether pressure anisotropy affects the approximate universal relations and whether it prevents their use in future observations. We achieve this by numerically constructing slowly-rotating and tidally-deformed, anisotropic, compact stars in General Relativity to third order in spin. We find that anisotropy affects the universal relations only weakly; the relations become less universal by a factor of 1.5-3 relative to the isotropic case, but remain approximately universal to 10%. We succeed in explaining this increase in variability as an increase in the eccentricity variation of isodensity contours, which provides further support for the emergent approximate symmetry explanation of universality. Anisotropy does not affect the universal relations to a sufficient level to prevent their use in gravitational wave astrophysics or in experimental relativity. We provide an explicit example of the latter in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. The increase in variability of the universal relations due to pressure anisotropy could affect their use in future X-ray observations. Given expected observational uncertainties, however, the relations remain sufficiently universal for use in such observations if the anisotropic modifications to the moment of inertia and the quadrupole moment are less than 10% of their isotropic values.</description>

      <title>Spin Tetrad Formalism Of Circular Polarization States In Relativistic Jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.11650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been of peak interest in the high-energy astrophysics community for their uniquely dynamic nature and incredible radiative power; emanating from supermassive black holes and similarly accreting compact dense objects. An overall consensus on relativistic jet formation states that accelerated outflow at high Lorentz factors are generated by a complex relationship between the accretion disk of the system and the frame-dragging effects of the rotating massive central object. This paper will provide a basis for which circular polarization states, defined using a spin tetrad formalism, contribute to a description for the angular momentum flux in the jet emanating from the central engine. A representation of the Kerr spacetime with positive cosmological constant background is used in formulating the spin tetrad forms. A discussion on unresolved problems in jet formation and how we can use multi-method observations with polarimetry of AGN to direct future theoretical descriptions will also be given.</description>

      <title>Periastron precession effect of $f$-mode dynamical tides on gravitational waves from eccentric double white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamical tide can play an important role in the orbital motion of close eccentric double white dwarf binaries. As the launching of the space-based gravitational-wave detector, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), is just around the corner, detection of gravitational wave signals from such systems is anticipated. In this paper, we discuss the influence of the dynamical tide on eccentric orbits, focusing on the effect on orbital precession. We show that in orbits with a high eccentricity, resonance can cause a large precession when a harmonic of the orbital frequency matches the natural frequencies of the normal modes of the star. In contrast to the case with circular orbits, each mode can encounter multiple resonances with different harmonics and these resonant regions can cover about 10% of the frequency space for orbits with close separations. In this case, the tidal precession effect is distinct from the other contributions and can be identified with LISA if the signal-to-noise ratio is high enough. However, within the highly eccentric-small separation region, the dynamical tide causes chaotic motion and the gravitational wave signal becomes unpredictable. Even not at resonance, the dynamical tide can contribute up to 20% of the precession for orbits close to Roche-lobe filling separation with low eccentricities and LISA can resolve these off-resonant dynamical tide effects within the low eccentricity-small orbital separation region of the parameter space. For lower mass systems, the dynamical tide effect can degenerate with the uncertainties of the eccentricity, making it unmeasurable from the precession rate alone. For higher mass systems, the radiation reaction effect becomes significant enough to constrain the eccentricity, allowing the measurement of the dynamical tide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been discussed whether viscous processes in neutron star matter during a binary inspiral can damp out the tidal energy induced by the companion and heat up the star. Earlier investigations concluded that this tidal heating is negligible for normal neutron star matter. In this work, we suggest a novel effect of tidal heating involving strange matter in the neutron star interior, that can significantly heat up the star, and is potentially observable by current and future gravitational wave detectors. We propose that this could serve as a direct probe of strangeness in neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of post-adiabatic (1PA) terms on parameter estimation for extreme and intermediate mass-ratio inspirals using state-of-the-art waveform models. Our analysis is the first to employ Bayesian inference to assess systematic errors for 1PA waveforms. We find that neglecting 1PA terms introduces significant biases for the (small) mass ratio $\epsilon \gtrsim 10^{-5}$ for quasi circular orbits in Schwarzschild spacetime, which can be mitigated with resummed 3PN expressions at 1PA order. Moreover, we show that the secondary spin is strongly correlated with the other intrinsic parameters, and it can not be constrained for $\epsilon \lesssim 10^{-5}$. Finally, we highlight the need for addressing eccentric waveform systematics in the small-mass-ratio regime, as they yield stronger biases than the circular limit in both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.</description>

      <title>Astronomical Image Blurring from Transversely Correlated Quantum Gravity Fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations in spacetime can, in some cases, lead to distortion in astronomical images of faraway objects. In particular, a stochastic model of quantum gravity predicts an accumulated fluctuation in the path length $\Delta L$ with variance $\langle \Delta L^2\rangle\sim l_pL$ over a distance $L$, similar to a random walk, and assuming no spatial correlation above length $l_p$; it has been argued that such an effect is ruled out by observation of sharp images from distant stars. However, in other theories, such as the pixellon (modeled on the Verlinde-Zurek (VZ) effect), quantum fluctuations can still accumulate as in the random walk model while simultaneously having large distance correlations in the fluctuations. Using renormalization by analytic continuation, we derive the correlation transverse to the light propagation, and show that image distortion effects in the pixellon model are strongly suppressed in comparison to the random walk model, thus evading all existing and future constraints. We also find that the diffraction of light rays does not lead to qualitative changes in the blurring effect.</description>

      <title>From Cavitation to Astrophysics: Explicit Solution of the Spherical Collapse Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05445v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential equations of the form $\ddot R=-kR^\gamma$, with a positive constant $k$ and real parameter $\gamma$, are fundamental in describing phenomena such as the spherical gravitational collapse ($\gamma=-2$), the implosion of cavitation bubbles ($\gamma=-4$) and the orbital decay in binary black holes ($\gamma=-7$). While explicit elemental solutions exist for select integer values of $\gamma$, more comprehensive solutions encompassing larger subsets of $\gamma$ have been independently developed in hydrostatics (see Lane-Emden equation) and hydrodynamics (see Rayleigh-Plesset equation). I here present a universal explicit solution for all real $\gamma$, invoking the beta distribution. Although standard numerical ODE solvers can readily evaluate more general second order differential equations, this explicit solution reveals a hidden connection between collapse motions and probability theory that enables further analytical manipulations, it conceptually unifies distinct fields, and it offers insights into symmetry properties, thereby enhancing our understanding of these pervasive differential equations.</description>

      <title>Detecting Boosted Dark Photons with Gaseous Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for indirect signals of $\mathscr{O}$(keV) dark matter annihilating or decaying into $\mathscr{O}$(eV) dark photons. These dark photons will be highly boosted and have decay lengths larger than the Milky Way, and can be absorbed by neutrino or dark matter experiments at a rate dependent on the photon-dark photon kinetic mixing parameter and the optical properties of the experiment. We show that current experiments can not probe new parameter space, but future large-scale gaseous detectors with low backgrounds (i.e. CYGNUS, NEXT, PANDAX-III) may be sensitive to this signal when the annihilation cross section is especially large.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Dissipative Magnetohydrodynamics from the Boltzmann equation for a two-component gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the equations of motion of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, as well as microscopic expressions for all of its transport coefficients, from the Boltzmann equation using the method of moments. In contrast to reference Phys. Rev. D 98(7) 2018, where a single component gas was considered, we perform our derivation for a locally neutral fluid composed of two massless particle species with opposite charges. We demonstrate that the magnetohydrodynamical equations of motion become dramatically different for this more realistic system. The shear-stress tensor no longer obeys a single differential equation; it breaks into three non-degenerate components with respect to the magnetic field, each evolving according to different dynamical equations. For large magnetic fields, we further show that the solution of this theory displays oscillatory behaviour that can no longer be described by an Israel-Stewart-like theory. Finally, we investigate the derived equations in a Bjorken flow scenario.</description>

      <title>Dynamical tidal response of non-rotating relativistic stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the tidal response of neutron stars is crucial to connecting gravitational wave observations of binaries to ultra-dense nuclear physics. Most current models of the tidal response of relativistic stars either assume a static response model, or use phenomenological models inspired by Newtonian gravity. In this work, we present a general formalism for computing the linear dynamical tidal response function of relativistic, spherically symmetric stars. Our formalism incorporates stratification due to thermal and chemical imbalances, allowing one to study the effects of g modes on the tidal response function. We also describe how to incorporate sources of dissipation due to shear and bulk viscosity. To showcase the utility of our approach, we present several applications for polytropic stars in general relativity. We show how our formalism can capture the dynamical tidal resonance due to the f and g modes of inviscid stars and explore the sensitivity of the dynamical tidal response to the compactness of the star. We also compute the dissipative tidal deformability due to bulk and shear viscous dissipation assuming a simple viscous profile for the bulk and shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of circular polarization in giant pulses and fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some giant pulses and fast radio bursts exhibit notable circular polarization, which remains inexplicable and carries significant implications for their emission mechanisms. In this study, we unveil the presence of multiple nanoshot pairs uniformly spaced by approximately 21 $\mu$s within a giant pulse emitted by the Crab pulsar. Among these pairs, a subset displays left-hand and right-hand circular polarization in two distinct nanoshots. We propose that the occurrence of such nanoshot pairs with dual circular polarizations arises from the fragmentation of a linearly-polarized nanoshot under the extreme Faraday effect, leveraging highly-asymmetrical pair plasma and the ultra-intense field of nanoshots. The asymmetry in pair plasmas is likely linked to discharge activities in pulsars. Moreover, the intense field of nanoshots induces cyclotron resonance within the magnetosphere, effectively slowing down the propagation velocity of the circularly polarized mode. Our findings suggest that giant pulses originate within the inner magnetosphere and lend support to a magnetospheric origin for fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Stellar Spin Down in Post-Mass Transfer Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by measurements of the rotation speed of accretor stars in post-mass-transfer (post-MT) systems, we investigate how magnetic braking affects the spin-down of individual stars during binary evolution with the MESAbinary module. Unlike the conventional assumption of tidal synchronization coupled with magnetic braking in binaries, we first calculate whether tides are strong enough to synchronize the orbit. Subsequently, this influences the spin-down of stars and the orbital separation. In this study, we apply four magnetic braking prescriptions to reduce the spin angular momentum of the two stars throughout the entire binary evolution simulation. Our findings reveal that despite magnetic braking causing continuous spin-down of the accretor, when the donor begins to transfer material onto the accretor, the accretor can rapidly spin up to its critical rotation rate. After MT, magnetic braking becomes more important in affecting the angular momentum evolution of the stars. Post-MT accretor stars thus serve as a valuable testbed for observing how the magnetic braking prescriptions operate in spinning down stars from their critical rotation, including the saturation regimes of the magnetic braking. The rotation rate of the accretor star, combined with its mass, could provide age information since the cessation of MT. By comparing the models against observation, the magnetic braking prescription by Garraffo et al. (2018b) is found to better align with the rotation data of post-MT accretors.</description>

      <title>Particle-theory input for neutron-star physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the properties and physical phase of the dense strongly interacting matter present in the cores of neutron stars or created in their binary mergers remains one of the most prominent open problems in nuclear astrophysics. While most microscopic analyses have historically relied on solvable phenomenological models of nuclear and quark matter, in recent years a model-independent approach utilizing only controlled ab-initio calculations and astrophysical observations has emerged as a viable alternative.
  In these lecture notes, I review recent progress in first-principles weak-coupling calculations within high-density quark matter, shedding light on its thermodynamic and transport properties. I cover the most important technical tools used in such calculations, introduce selected highlight results, and explain how this information can be used in phenomenological studies of neutron-star physics. The notes do not offer a self-consistent treatment of the topics covered, but rather aim at filling gaps in existing textbooks on thermal field theory and at connecting the dots in a story developed in several recent research articles, to which the interested reader is directed for further technical details.</description>

      <title>Chemo-dynamical Evolution of Simulated Satellites for a Milky Way-like Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chemical abundances of Milky Way's satellites reflect their star formation histories (SFHs), yet, due to the difficulty of determining the ages of old stars, the SFHs of most satellites are poorly measured. Ongoing and upcoming surveys will obtain around ten times more medium-resolution spectra for stars in satellites than are currently available. To correctly extract SFHs from large samples of chemical abundances, the relationship between chemical abundances and SFHs needs to be clarified. Here, we perform a high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy with detailed models of star formation, supernova feedback, and metal diffusion. We quantify SFHs, metallicity distribution functions, and the $\alpha$-element (Mg, Ca, and Si) abundances in satellites of the host galaxy. We find that star formation in most simulated satellites is quenched before infalling to their host. Star formation episodes in simulated satellites are separated by a few hundred Myr owing to supernova feedback; each star formation event produces groups of stars with similar [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe/H]. We then perform a mock observation of the upcoming Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) observations. We find that Subaru PFS will be able to detect distinct groups of stars in [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] space, produced by episodic star formation. This result means that episodic SFHs can be estimated from the chemical abundances of $\gtrsim$ 1,000 stars determined with medium-resolution spectroscopy.</description>
