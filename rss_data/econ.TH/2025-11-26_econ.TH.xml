      <title>Dynamic Mechanism Collapse: A Boundary Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19781v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When are dynamics valuable? In Bayesian environments with public signals and no intertemporal commitment, we study a seller who allocates an economically single-shot resource over time. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which the optimal dynamic mechanism collapses to a simple terminal design: a single public experiment at date 0 followed by a posterior-dependent static mechanism executed at a deterministic date, with no further disclosure. The key condition is the existence of a global affine shadow value that supports the posterior-based revenue frontier and uniformly bounds all history-dependent revenues. When this condition fails, a collapse statistic pinpoints the dates and public state variables that generate genuine dynamic value. The characterization combines martingale concavification on the belief space with an affine-support duality for concave envelopes.</description>

      <title>Expectation-enforcing strategies for repeated games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Originating in evolutionary game theory, the class of "zero-determinant" strategies enables a player to unilaterally enforce linear payoff relationships in simple repeated games. An upshot of this kind of payoff constraint is that it can shape the incentives for the opponent in a predetermined way. An example is when a player ensures that the agents get equal payoffs. While extensively studied in infinite-horizon games, extensions to discounted games, nonlinear payoff relationships, richer strategic environments, and behaviors with long memory remain incompletely understood. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a player to enforce arbitrary payoff relationships (linear or nonlinear), in expectation, in discounted games. These conditions characterize precisely which payoff relationships are enforceable using strategies of arbitrary complexity. Our main result establishes that any such enforceable relationship can actually be implemented using a simple two-point reactive learning strategy, which conditions on the opponent's most recent action and the player's own previous mixed action, using information from only one round into the past. For additive payoff constraints, we show that enforcement is possible using even simpler (reactive) strategies that depend solely on the opponent's last move. In other words, this tractable class is universal within expectation-enforcing strategies. As examples, we apply these results to characterize extortionate, generous, equalizer, and fair strategies in the iterated prisoner's dilemma, asymmetric donation game, nonlinear donation game, and the hawk-dove game, identifying precisely when each class of strategy is enforceable and with what minimum discount factor.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Reward Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a dynamic screening model in which a principal hires an agent with limited liability. The agent's private cost of working is an i.i.d. draw from a continuous distribution. His working status is publicly observable. The limited liability constraint requires that payments remain nonnegative at all times. In this setting, despite costs being i.i.d. and the payoffs being additively separable across periods, the optimal mechanism does not treat each period independently. Instead, it features backloading payments and requires the agent to work in consecutive periods. Specifically, I characterize conditions under which the optimal mechanism either grants the agent flexibility to start working in any period or restricts the starting period to the first. In either case, once the agent begins working, he is incentivized to work consecutively until the end.</description>

      <title>Reserve System with Beneficiary-Share Guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study allocation problems with reserve systems under minimum beneficiary-share guarantees, requirements that targeted matches constitute at least a specified percentage of total matches. While such mandates promote targeted matches, they inherently conflict with maximizing total matches. We characterize the complete non-domination frontier using minimal cycles, where each point represents an allocation that cannot increase targeted matches without sacrificing total matches. Our main results: (i) the frontier exhibits concave structure with monotonically decreasing slope, (ii) traversing from maximum targeted matches to maximum total matches reduces matches by at most half, (iii) the Repeated Hungarian Algorithm computes all frontier points in polynomial time, and (iv) mechanisms with beneficiary-share guarantees can respect category-dependent priority orderings but necessarily violate path-independence. These results enable rigorous evaluation of beneficiary-share policies across diverse allocation contexts.</description>

      <title>Recursive contracts in non-convex environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we examine non-convex dynamic optimization problems with forward looking constraints. We prove that the recursive multiplier formulation in \cite{marcet2019recursive} gives the optimal value if one assumes that the planner has access to a public randomization device and forward looking constraints only have to hold in expectations. Whether one formulates the functional equation as a sup-inf problem or as an inf-sup problem is essential for the timing of the optimal lottery and for determining which constraints have to hold in expectations. We discuss for which economic problems the use of lotteries can be considered a reasonable assumption. We provide a general method to recover the optimal policy from a solution of the functional equation. As an application of our results, we consider the Ramsey problem of optimal government policy and give examples where lotteries are essential for the optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Evolutionarily stable strategy in asymmetric games: Dynamical and information-theoretical perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19320v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is the defining concept of evolutionary game theory. It has a fairly unanimously accepted definition for the case of symmetric games which are played in a homogeneous population where all individuals are in same role. However, in asymmetric games, which are played in a population with multiple subpopulations (each of which has individuals in one particular role), situation is not as clear. Various generalizations of ESS defined for such cases differ in how they correspond to fixed points of replicator equation which models evolutionary dynamics of frequencies of strategies in the population. Moreover, some of the definitions may even be equivalent, and hence, redundant in the scheme of things. Along with reporting some new results, this paper is partly indented as a contextual mini-review of some of the most important definitions of ESS in asymmetric games. We present the definitions coherently and scrutinize them closely while establishing equivalences -- some of them hitherto unreported -- between them wherever possible. Since it is desirable that a definition of ESS should correspond to asymptotically stable fixed points of replicator dynamics, we bring forward the connections between various definitions and their dynamical stabilities. Furthermore, we find the use of principle of relative entropy to gain information-theoretic insights into the concept of ESS in asymmetric games, thereby establishing a three-fold connection between game theory, dynamical system theory, and information theory in this context. We discuss our conclusions also in the backdrop of asymmetric hypermatrix games where more than two individuals interact simultaneously in the course of getting payoffs.</description>

      <title>Realistic gossip in Trust Game on networks: the GODS model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gossip has been shown to be a relatively efficient solution to problems of cooperation in reputation-based systems of exchange, but many studies don't conceptualize gossiping in a realistic way, often assuming near-perfect information or broadcast-like dynamics of its spread. To solve this problem, we developed an agent-based model that pairs realistic gossip processes with different variants of Trust Game. The results show that cooperators suffer when local interactions govern spread of gossip, because they cannot discriminate against defectors. Realistic gossiping increases the overall amount of resources, but is more likely to promote defection. Moreover, even partner selection through dynamic networks can lead to high payoff inequalities among agent types. Cooperators face a choice between outcompeting defectors and overall growth. By blending direct and indirect reciprocity with reputations we show that gossiping increases the efficiency of cooperation by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Persuasion and Optimal Stopping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12278v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how a principal can jointly shape an agent's timing and action through information. We develop a revelation principle: with intertemporal commitment, the problem simplifies to choosing a joint distribution over stopping times and beliefs, delivering a tractable first-order approach, and an anti-revelation principle: without commitment, informative interim recommendations are necessary and sufficient to implement the optimal commitment outcome. We apply the method to analyze (i) moving the goalposts, where inching rather than teleporting the goalposts can be achieved without commitment; (ii) dynamic binary persuasion, where optimal policies combine suspense generation with action-targeted Poisson news; and (iii) dynamic linear persuasion with a continuum of states, where a tail-censorship policy with expanding disclosure intervals is optimal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study dynamic network formation from a centralized perspective. In each period, the social planner builds a single link to connect previously unlinked pairs. The social planner is forward-looking, with instantaneous utility monotonic in the aggregate number of walks of various lengths. We show that, forming a nested split graph at each period is optimal, regardless of the discount function. When the social planner is sufficiently myopic, it is optimal to form a quasi-complete graph at each period, which is unique up to permutation. This finding provides a micro-foundation for the quasi-complete graph, as it is formed under a greedy policy. We also investigate the robustness of these findings under non-linear best response functions and weighted networks.</description>

      <title>Selection Procedures in Competitive Admission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two identical firms compete to attract and hire from a pool of candidates of unknown productivity. Firms simultaneously post a selection procedure which consists of a test and an acceptance probability for each test outcome. After observing the firms' selection procedures, each candidate can apply to one of them. Firms can vary both the accuracy (Lehmann, 1988) and difficulty (Hancart, 2024) of their test. The firms face two key considerations when choosing their selection procedure: the statistical properties of their test and the selection into the procedure by the candidates. I show that there is a unique symmetric equilibrium where the test is maximally accurate but minimally difficult. Intuitively, competition leads to maximal but misguided learning: firms end up having precise knowledge that is not payoff relevant. I also consider the cases where firms face capacity constraints, have the possibility of making a wage offer and the existence of asymmetric equilibria where one firm is more selective than another.</description>
