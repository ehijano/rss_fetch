      <title>Domain Randomization is Sample Efficient for Linear Quadratic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sample efficiency of domain randomization and robust control for the benchmark problem of learning the linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Domain randomization, which synthesizes controllers by minimizing average performance over a distribution of model parameters, has achieved empirical success in robotics, but its theoretical properties remain poorly understood. We establish that with an appropriately chosen sampling distribution, domain randomization achieves the optimal asymptotic rate of decay in the excess cost, matching certainty equivalence. We further demonstrate that robust control, while potentially overly conservative, exhibits superior performance in the low-data regime due to its ability to stabilize uncertain systems with coarse parameter estimates. We propose a gradient-based algorithm for domain randomization that performs well in numerical experiments, which enables us to validate the trends predicted by our analysis. These results provide insights into the use of domain randomization in learning-enabled control, and highlight several open questions about its application to broader classes of systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Real-Time Deception in Nash Equilibrium Seeking for Games with Quadratic Payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multi-agent autonomous systems, deception is a fundamental concept which characterizes the exploitation of unbalanced information to mislead victims into choosing oblivious actions. This effectively alters the system's long term behavior, leading to outcomes that may be beneficial to the deceiver but detrimental to victim. We study this phenomenon for a class of model-free Nash equilibrium seeking (NES) where players implement independent stochastic exploration signals to learn the pseudogradient flow. In particular, we show that deceptive players who obtain real-time measurements of other players' stochastic perturbation can incorporate this information into their own NES action update, consequentially steering the overall dynamics to a new operating point that could potentially improve the payoffs of the deceptive players. We consider games with quadratic payoff functions, as this restriction allows us to derive a more explicit formulation of the capabilities of the deceptive players. By leveraging results on multi-input stochastic averaging for dynamical systems, we establish local exponential (in probability) convergence for the proposed deceptive NES dynamics. To illustrate our results, we apply them to a two player quadratic game.</description>

      <title>From Maneuver to Mishap: A Systematic Literature Review on U-Turn Safety Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12556v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the impacts of U-turn configurations on intersection safety and traffic operations is essential for developing effective strategies to enhance road safety and efficiency. Extensive research has been conducted to investigate the role of geometric designs, driver behavior, and advanced technologies in mitigating crash risks and improving traffic flow at U-turn facilities. By synthesizing this collective body of work through the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), this paper provides a valuable resource for transportation professionals, policymakers, and researchers seeking evidence-based solutions. This systematic review draws on studies from diverse traffic environments and regional contexts, focusing on innovative design interventions, such as restricted crossing U-turns (RCUTs) and median U-turn intersections (MUTs), as well as integrated strategies leveraging technological advancements. By presenting a comprehensive analysis of U-turn-related challenges and opportunities, this review contributes to advancing transportation safety research and guiding the development of adaptive strategies tailored to varied traffic conditions and evolving technologies.</description>

      <title>A Novel Gain Modeling Technique for LLC Resonant Converters based on The Hybrid Deep-Learning/GMDH Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach for modeling the voltage gain of LLC resonant converters by combining deep-learning neural networks with the polynomial based Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH). While deep learning offers high accuracy in predicting nonlinear converter behavior, it produces complex network models. GMDH neural networks, in contrast, yield simpler algebraic equations that can be more convenient in converter design. By training a deep network on data from an FPGA based real time simulator and then using the network s predictions to train a GMDH model, the proposed hybrid method achieves both high accuracy and design friendly simplicity. Experimental results show significant improvements over traditional methods such as First Harmonic Approximation (FHA) and frequency domain corrections, particularly for wide operating ranges.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-layer control architecture is proposed, which promotes scalable implementations for model predictive controllers. The top layer acts as both reference governor for the bottom layer, and as a feedback controller for the regulated network. By employing set-based methods, global theoretical guarantees are obtained by enforcing local constraints upon the variables of the network and of the first layer's implementation. The proposed technique offers recursive feasibility guarantees as one of its central features, and the expressions of the resulting predictive strategies bear a striking resemblance to classical formulations from model predictive control literature, allowing for flexible and easily customizable implementations.</description>

      <title>Pricing is All You Need to Improve Traffic Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the design of pricing policies that enhance driver adherence to route guidance, ensuring effective routing control. The major novelty lies in that we adopt a Markov chain to model drivers' compliance rates conditioned on both traffic states and tolls. By formulating the managed traffic network as a nonlinear stochastic dynamical system, we can quantify in a more realistic way the impacts of driver route choices and thus determine appropriate tolls. Specially, we focus on a network comprised of one corridor and one local street. We assume that a reasonable routing policy is specified in advance. However, drivers could be reluctant to be detoured. Thus a fixed toll is set on the corridor to give drivers incentives to choose the local street. We evaluate the effectiveness of the given routing and pricing policies via stability analysis. We suggest using the stability and instability conditions to establish lower and upper bounds on throughput. This allows us to select suitable tolls that maximize these bounds.</description>

      <title>Automated Linear Parameter-Varying Modeling of Nonlinear Systems: A Global Embedding Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an automated Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) model conversion approach is proposed for nonlinear dynamical systems. The proposed method achieves global embedding of the original nonlinear behavior of the system by leveraging the second fundamental theorem of calculus to factorize matrix function expressions without any approximation. The implementation of the proposed method in the LPVcore toolbox for Matlab is discussed, and its performance is showcased on a comprehensive example of automated LPV model conversion of an unbalanced disk system, which is then used to design an LPV controller that is deployed on the original nonlinear system. In addition, the conversion capabilities are further demonstrated by obtaining an LPV embedding of a three-degree-of-freedom control moment gyroscope. All software implementations are available at www.lpvcore.net.</description>

      <title>Semantica: Decentralized Search using a LLM-Guided Semantic Tree Overlay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Centralized search engines are key for the Internet, but lead to undesirable concentration of power. Decentralized alternatives fail to offer equal document retrieval accuracy and speed. Nevertheless, Semantic Overlay Networks can come close to the performance of centralized solutions when the semantics of documents are properly captured. This work uses embeddings from Large Language Models to capture semantics and fulfill the promise of Semantic Overlay Networks. Our proposed algorithm, called Semantica, constructs a prefix tree (trie) utilizing document embeddings calculated by a language model. Users connect to each other based on the embeddings of their documents, ensuring that semantically similar users are directly linked. Thereby, this construction makes it more likely for user searches to be answered by the users that they are directly connected to, or by the users they are close to in the network connection graph. The implementation of our algorithm also accommodates the semantic diversity of individual users by spawning "clone" user identifiers in the tree. Our experiments use emulation with a real-world workload to show Semantica's ability to identify and connect to similar users quickly. Semantica finds up to ten times more semantically similar users than current state-of-the-art approaches. At the same time, Semantica can retrieve more than two times the number of relevant documents given the same network load. We also make our code publicly available to facilitate further research in the area.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Robust Physics-Informed Graph Neural Networks for Water Distribution Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water distribution systems (WDSs) are an important part of critical infrastructure becoming increasingly significant in the face of climate change and urban population growth. We propose a robust and scalable surrogate deep learning (DL) model to enable efficient planning, expansion, and rehabilitation of WDSs. Our approach incorporates an improved graph neural network architecture, an adapted physics-informed algorithm, an innovative training scheme, and a physics-preserving data normalization method. Evaluation results on a number of WDSs demonstrate that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art DL model. Moreover, our method allows us to scale the model to bigger and more realistic WDSs. Furthermore, our approach makes the model more robust to out-of-distribution input features (demands, pipe diameters). Hence, our proposed method constitutes a significant step towards bridging the simulation-to-real gap in the use of artificial intelligence for WDSs.</description>

      <title>Learning Plasma Dynamics and Robust Rampdown Trajectories with Predict-First Experiments at TCV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rampdown in tokamak operations is a difficult to simulate phase during which the plasma is often pushed towards multiple instability limits. To address this challenge, and reduce the risk of disrupting operations, we leverage recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) to develop a neural state-space model (NSSM) that predicts plasma dynamics during Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) rampdowns. By integrating simple physics structure and data-driven models, the NSSM efficiently learns plasma dynamics during the rampdown from a modest dataset of 311 pulses with only five pulses in the reactor relevant high performance regime. The NSSM is parallelized across uncertainties, and reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to design trajectories that avoid multiple instability limits with high probability. Experiments at TCV ramping down high performance plasmas show statistically significant improvements in current and energy at plasma termination, with improvements in speed through continuous re-training. A predict-first experiment, increasing plasma current by 20\% from baseline, demonstrates the NSSM's ability to make small extrapolations with sufficient accuracy to design trajectories that successfully terminate the pulse. The developed approach paves the way for designing tokamak controls with robustness to considerable uncertainty, and demonstrates the relevance of the SciML approach to learning plasma dynamics for rapidly developing robust trajectories and controls during the incremental campaigns of upcoming burning plasma tokamaks.</description>

      <title>Hovering Flight of Soft-Actuated Insect-Scale Micro Aerial Vehicles using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft-actuated insect-scale micro aerial vehicles (IMAVs) pose unique challenges for designing robust and computationally efficient controllers. At the millimeter scale, fast robot dynamics ($\sim$ms), together with system delay, model uncertainty, and external disturbances significantly affect flight performances. Here, we design a deep reinforcement learning (RL) controller that addresses system delay and uncertainties. To initialize this neural network (NN) controller, we propose a modified behavior cloning (BC) approach with state-action re-matching to account for delay and domain-randomized expert demonstration to tackle uncertainty. Then we apply proximal policy optimization (PPO) to fine-tune the policy during RL, enhancing performance and smoothing commands. In simulations, our modified BC substantially increases the mean reward compared to baseline BC; and RL with PPO improves flight quality and reduces command fluctuations. We deploy this controller on two different insect-scale aerial robots that weigh 720 mg and 850 mg, respectively. The robots demonstrate multiple successful zero-shot hovering flights, with the longest lasting 50 seconds and root-mean-square errors of 1.34 cm in lateral direction and 0.05 cm in altitude, marking the first end-to-end deep RL-based flight on soft-driven IMAVs.</description>

      <title>Sensing-based Robustness Challenges in Agricultural Robotic Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the challenges agricultural robotic harvesters face in detecting and localising fruits under various environmental disturbances. In controlled laboratory settings, both the traditional HSV (Hue Saturation Value) transformation and the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) deep learning model were employed. However, only YOLOv8 was utilised in outdoor experiments, as the HSV transformation was not capable of accurately drawing fruit contours. Experiments include ten distinct fruit patterns with six apples and six oranges. A grid structure for homography (perspective) transformation was employed to convert detected midpoints into 3D world coordinates. The experiments evaluated detection and localisation under varying lighting and background disturbances, revealing accurate performance indoors, but significant challenges outdoors. Our results show that indoor experiments using YOLOv8 achieved 100% detection accuracy, while outdoor conditions decreased performance, with an average accuracy of 69.15% for YOLOv8 under direct sunlight. The study demonstrates that real-world applications reveal significant limitations due to changing lighting, background disturbances, and colour and shape variability. These findings underscore the need for further refinement of algorithms and sensors to enhance the robustness of robotic harvesters for agricultural use.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of a Dual Uncrewed Surface Vessel Platform for Bathymetry Research under High-flow Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bathymetry, the study of underwater topography, relies on sonar mapping of submerged structures. These measurements, critical for infrastructure health monitoring, often require expensive instrumentation. The high financial risk associated with sensor damage or vessel loss creates a reluctance to deploy uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) for bathymetry. However, the crewed-boat bathymetry operations, are costly, pose hazards to personnel, and frequently fail to achieve the stable conditions necessary for bathymetry data collection, especially under high currents. Further research is essential to advance autonomous control, navigation, and data processing technologies, with a particular focus on bathymetry. There is a notable lack of accessible hardware platforms that allow for integrated research in both bathymetry-focused autonomous control and navigation, as well as data evaluation and processing. This paper addresses this gap through the design and implementation of two complementary USV systems tailored for uncrewed bathymetry research. This includes a low-cost USV for Navigation And Control research (NAC-USV) and a second, high-end USV equipped with a high-resolution multi-beam sonar and the associated hardware for Bathymetry data quality Evaluation and Post-processing research (BEP-USV). The NAC-USV facilitates the investigation of autonomous, fail-safe navigation and control, emphasizing the stability requirements for high-quality bathymetry data collection while minimizing the risk to equipment. The BEP-USV, which mirrors the NAC-USV hardware, is then used for additional control validation and in-depth exploration of bathymetry data evaluation and post-processing methodologies. We detail the design and implementation of both systems, and open source the design. Furthermore, we demonstrate the system's effectiveness in a range of operational scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Enhanced Deep-Reinforcement Learning Framework for the Aircraft Landing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Aircraft Landing Problem (ALP) is one of the challenging problems in aircraft transportation and management. The challenge is to schedule the arriving aircraft in a sequence so that the cost and delays are optimized. There are various solution approaches to solving this problem, most of which are based on operations research algorithms and meta-heuristics. Although traditional methods perform better on one or the other factors, there remains a problem of solving real-time rescheduling and computational scalability altogether. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines graph neural networks with actor-critic architectures to address the ALP. This paper introduces three key contributions: A graph-based state representation that efficiently captures temporal and spatial relationships between aircraft, a specialized actor-critic architecture designed to handle multiple competing objectives in landing scheduling, and a runway balance strategy that ensures efficient resource utilization while maintaining safety constraints. The results show that the trained algorithm can be tested on different problem sets and the results are competitive to operation research algorithms. The experimental results on standard benchmark data sets demonstrate a 99.95 reduction in computational time compared to Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) and 38 higher runway throughput over First Come First Serve (FCFS) approaches. Therefore, the proposed solution is competitive to traditional approaches and achieves substantial advancements. Notably, it does not require retraining, making it particularly suitable for industrial deployment. The frameworks capability to generate solutions within 1 second enables real-time rescheduling, addressing critical requirements of air traffic management.</description>

      <title>Radar Network for Gait Monitoring: Technology and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, radar-based devices have emerged as an alternative approach for gait monitoring. However, the radar configuration and the algorithms used to extract the gait parameters often differ between contributions, lacking a systematic evaluation of the most appropriate setup. Additionally, radar-based studies often exclude motorically impaired subjects, leaving it unclear whether the existing algorithms are applicable to such populations.
  In this paper, a radar network is developed and validated by monitoring the gait of five healthy individuals and three patients with Parkinson's disease. Six configurations and four algorithms were compared using Vicon as ground-truth to determine the most appropriate solution for gait monitoring.
  The best results were obtained using only three nodes: two oriented towards the feet and one towards the torso. The most accurate stride velocity and distance in the state of the art were obtained with this configuration. Moreover, we show that analyzing the feet velocity increases the reliability of the temporal parameters, especially with aged or motorically impaired subjects.
  The contribution is significant for the implementation of radar networks in clinical and domestic environments, as it addresses critical aspects concerning the radar network configuration and algorithms.</description>

      <title>Soft Arm-Motor Thrust Characterization for a Pneumatically Actuated Soft Morphing Quadrotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, an experimental characterization of the configuration space of a soft, pneumatically actuated morphing quadrotor is presented, with a focus on precise thrust characterization of its flexible arms, considering the effect of downwash. Unlike traditional quadrotors, the soft drone has pneumatically actuated arms, introducing complex, nonlinear interactions between motor thrust and arm deformation, which make precise control challenging. The silicone arms are actuated using differential pressure to achieve flexibility and thus have a variable workspace compared to their fixed counter-parts. The deflection of the soft arms during compression and expansion is controlled throughout the flight. However, in real time, the downwash from the motor attached at the tip of the soft arm generates a significant and random disturbance on the arm. This disturbance affects both the desired deflection of the arm and the overall stability of the system. To address this factor, an experimental characterization of the effect of downwash on the deflection angle of the arm is conducted.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Resource Allocation in Optical Networks: Hype or Hope?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamic resource allocation in optical networks has been the focus of intense research activity in recent years, with almost 100 peer-reviewed papers. We present a review of progress in the field, and identify significant gaps in benchmarking practices and reproducibility. To determine the strongest benchmark algorithms, we systematically evaluate several heuristics across diverse network topologies. We find that path count and sort criteria for path selection significantly affect the benchmark performance. We meticulously recreate the problems from five landmark papers and apply the improved benchmarks. Our comparisons demonstrate that simple heuristics consistently match or outperform the published RL solutions, often with an order of magnitude lower blocking probability. Furthermore, we present empirical lower bounds on network blocking using a novel defragmentation-based method, revealing that potential improvements over the benchmark heuristics are limited to 19--36\% increased traffic load for the same blocking performance in our examples. We make our simulation framework and results publicly available to promote reproducible research and standardized evaluation https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12594495.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces RobotIQ, a framework that empowers mobile robots with human-level planning capabilities, enabling seamless communication via natural language instructions through any Large Language Model. The proposed framework is designed in the ROS architecture and aims to bridge the gap between humans and robots, enabling robots to comprehend and execute user-expressed text or voice commands. Our research encompasses a wide spectrum of robotic tasks, ranging from fundamental logical, mathematical, and learning reasoning for transferring knowledge in domains like navigation, manipulation, and object localization, enabling the application of learned behaviors from simulated environments to real-world operations. All encapsulated within a modular crafted robot library suite of API-wise control functions, RobotIQ offers a fully functional AI-ROS-based toolset that allows researchers to design and develop their own robotic actions tailored to specific applications and robot configurations. The effectiveness of the proposed system was tested and validated both in simulated and real-world experiments focusing on a home service scenario that included an assistive application designed for elderly people.

      <title>Optimizing Social Network Interventions via Hypergradient-Based Recommender System Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although social networks have expanded the range of ideas and information accessible to users, they are also criticized for amplifying the polarization of user opinions. Given the inherent complexity of these phenomena, existing approaches to counteract these effects typically rely on handcrafted algorithms and heuristics. We propose an elegant solution: we act on the network weights that model user interactions on social networks (e.g., frequency of communication), to optimize a performance metric (e.g., polarization reduction), while users' opinions follow the classical Friedkin-Johnsen model. Our formulation gives rise to a challenging large-scale optimization problem with non-convex constraints, for which we develop a gradient-based algorithm. Our scheme is simple, scalable, and versatile, as it can readily integrate different, potentially non-convex, objectives. We demonstrate its merit by: (i) rapidly solving complex social network intervention problems with 3 million variables based on the Reddit and DBLP datasets; (ii) significantly outperforming competing approaches in terms of both computation time and disagreement reduction.</description>

      <title>On Erlang mixture approximations for differential equations with distributed time delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general approach for approximate simulation and analysis of delay differential equations (DDEs) with distributed time delays based on methods for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The key innovation is that we 1) approximate the kernel by the probability density function of an Erlang mixture and 2) use the linear chain trick to transform the approximate DDEs to ODEs. Furthermore, we prove that an approximation with infinitely many terms converges for continuous and bounded kernels and for specific choices of the coefficients. We compare the steady states of the original DDEs and their stability criteria to those of the approximate system of ODEs, and we propose an approach based on bisection and least-squares estimation for determining optimal parameter values in the approximation. Finally, we present numerical examples that demonstrate the accuracy and convergence rate obtained with the optimal parameters and the efficacy of the proposed approach for bifurcation analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. The numerical examples involve a modified logistic equation and a point reactor kinetics model of a molten salt nuclear fission reactor.</description>

      <title>FAMAC: A Federated Assisted Modified Actor-Critic Framework for Secured Energy Saving in 5G and Beyond Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The constant surge in the traffic demand on cellular networks has led to continuous expansion in network capacity in order to accommodate existing and new service demands. This has given rise to ultra-dense base station deployment in 5G and beyond networks which leads to increased energy consumption in the network. Hence, these ultra-dense base station deployments must be operated in a way that the energy consumption of the network can be adapted to the spatio-temporal traffic demands on the network in order to minimize the overall energy consumption of the network. To achieve this goal, we leverage two artificial intelligence algorithms, federated learning and actor-critic algorithm, to develop a proactive and intelligent base station switching framework that can learn the operating policy of the small base station in an ultra-dense heterogeneous network (UDHN) that would result in maximum energy saving in the network while respecting the quality of service (QoS) constraints. The performance evaluation reveals that the proposed framework can achieve an energy saving that is about 77% more than that of the state-of-the-art solutions while respecting the QoS constraints of the network.</description>

      <title>Automated Lane Merging via Game Theory and Branch Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14916v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an integrated behavior and motion planning framework for the lane-merging problem. The behavior planner combines search-based planning with game theory to model vehicle interactions and plan multi-vehicle trajectories. Inspired by human drivers, we model the lane-merging problem as a gap selection process and determine the appropriate gap by solving a matrix game. Moreover, we introduce a branch model predictive control (BMPC) framework to account for the uncertain equilibrium strategies adopted by the surrounding vehicles, including Nash and Stackelberg strategies. A tailored numerical solver is developed to enhance computational efficiency by exploiting the tree structure inherent in BMPC. Finally, we validate our proposed integrated planner using real traffic data and demonstrate its effectiveness in handling interactions in dense traffic scenarios. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/SailorBrandon/GT-BMPC.</description>

      <title>Stability-Certified On-Policy Data-Driven LQR via Recursive Learning and Policy Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a data-driven framework to solve Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problems when the dynamics is unknown, with the additional challenge of providing stability certificates for the overall learning and control scheme. Specifically, in the proposed on-policy learning framework, the control input is applied to the actual (unknown) linear system while iteratively optimized. We propose a learning and control procedure, termed Relearn LQR, that combines a recursive least squares method with a direct policy search based on the gradient method. The resulting scheme is analyzed by modeling it as a feedback-interconnected nonlinear dynamical system. A Lyapunov-based approach, exploiting averaging and timescale separation theories for nonlinear systems, allows us to provide formal stability guarantees for the whole interconnected scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is corroborated by numerical simulations, where Relearn LQR is deployed on an aircraft control problem, with both static and drifting parameters.</description>

      <title>Learning the Frequency Dynamics of the Power System Using Higher-order Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources, characterised by low inertia and intermittent disturbances, presents substantial challenges to power system stability. As critical indicators of system stability, frequency dynamics and associated oscillatory phenomena have attracted significant research attention. While existing studies predominantly employ linearized models, our findings demonstrate that linear approximations exhibit considerable errors when predicting frequency oscillation dynamics across multiple time scales, thus necessitating the incorporation of nonlinear characteristics. This paper proposes a data-driven approach based on higher-order dynamical mode decomposition (HODMD) for learning frequency dynamics. The proposed method offers distinct advantages over alternative nonlinear methods, including no prior knowledge required, adaptability to high-dimensional systems, and robust performance. Furthermore, HODMD demonstrates superior capability in capturing system-wide spatio-temporal modes, successfully identifying modal behaviour that remains undetectable through standard Dynamic Mode Decomposition techniques. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is validated through comprehensive case studies on both IEEE 14-bus and WECC systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Compressive Tactile Subsampling: Enabling High Spatiotemporal Resolution in Scalable Robotic Skin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robots, like humans, require full-body, high-resolution tactile sensing to operate safely and effectively in unstructured environments, enabling reflexive responses and closed-loop control. However, the high pixel counts necessary for dense, large-area coverage limit readout rates of most tactile arrays to below 100 Hz, hindering their use in high-speed tasks. We introduce Adaptive Compressive Tactile Subsampling (ACTS), a scalable and data-driven method that dramatically enhances the performance of traditional tactile matrices by leveraging sparse recovery and a learned tactile dictionary. Tested on a 1024-pixel tactile sensor array (32X32), ACTS achieved frame rates up to 1,000 Hz, an 18X improvement over conventional raster scanning, with minimal reconstruction error. For the first time, ACTS enables wearable, large-area, high-density tactile sensing systems that can deliver high-speed results. We demonstrate rapid object classification within 20 ms of contact, high-speed projectile detection, ricochet angle estimation, and soft deformation tracking, in tactile and robotics applications, all using flexible, high-density tactile arrays. These include high-resolution tactile gloves, pressure insoles, and full-body configurations covering robotic arms and human-sized mannequins. ACTS transforms standard, low-cost, and robust tactile sensors into high-speed systems, supporting applications from object manipulation to human-robot interaction. By enabling comprehensive, scalable, and efficient tactile coverage for robots and wearables, ACTS advances robotics toward lifelike, responsive, and adaptable operation in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Incentive-based Platoon Formation: Optimizing the Personal Benefit for Drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Platooning or cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) has been investigated for decades, but debate about its lasting impact is still ongoing. Even though platooning benefits and platoon formation are rather well understood for trucks, this is less clear for passenger cars, which have a higher heterogeneity in trips and drivers' preferences. Most importantly, it remains unclear how to form platoons of passenger cars in order to optimize the personal benefit for the individual driver. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel platoon formation algorithm that optimizes the personal benefit for drivers of individual passenger cars. For computing vehicle-to-platoon assignments, the algorithm utilizes a new metric that we propose to evaluate the personal benefits of various driving systems, including platooning. By combining fuel and travel time costs into a single monetary value, drivers can estimate overall trip costs according to a personal monetary value for time spent. This provides an intuitive way for drivers to understand and compare the benefits of driving systems like human driving, adaptive cruise control (ACC), and, of course, platooning. Unlike previous similarity-based methods, our proposed algorithm forms platoons only when beneficial for the driver, rather than for the sake of platooning only. Results of a large-scale simulation study demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms normal ACC as well as previous similarity-based platooning approaches by balancing fuel savings and travel time, independent of traffic and drivers' time cost.</description>

      <title>A New Paradigm in Tuning Learned Indexes: A Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learned Index Structures (LIS) have significantly advanced data management by leveraging machine learning models to optimize data indexing. However, designing these structures often involves critical trade-offs, making it challenging for both designers and end-users to find an optimal balance tailored to specific workloads and scenarios. While some indexes offer adjustable parameters that demand intensive manual tuning, others rely on fixed configurations based on heuristic auto-tuners or expert knowledge, which may not consistently deliver optimal performance. This paper introduces LITune, a novel framework for end-to-end automatic tuning of Learned Index Structures. LITune employs an adaptive training pipeline equipped with a tailor-made Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to ensure stable and efficient tuning. To accommodate long-term dynamics arising from online tuning, we further enhance LITune with an on-the-fly updating mechanism termed the O2 system. These innovations allow LITune to effectively capture state transitions in online tuning scenarios and dynamically adjust to changing data distributions and workloads, marking a significant improvement over other tuning methods. Our experimental results demonstrate that LITune achieves up to a 98% reduction in runtime and a 17-fold increase in throughput compared to default parameter settings given a selected Learned Index instance. These findings highlight LITune's effectiveness and its potential to facilitate broader adoption of LIS in real-world applications.</description>
