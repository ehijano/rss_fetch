      <title>Two facilitating mechanisms for SF6 streamer breakdown induced by a floating linear metal particle: equivalent pulsed streamer (EPS) and side streamer (SS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical breakdown of SF6 in the presence of floating metal particles is facilitated by two key factors: the role of floating metal particles and the nonlinear breakdown behavior of high-pressure SF6. However, the microscopic transient processes remain unclear, motivating this paper. Using 2D fluid models, we investigate SF6 streamer breakdown induced by a floating linear metal particle under negative applied voltage. First, We identify a characteristic double-end streamer inception in the combined gap. Then, we propose the equivalent pulse streamer (EPS) mechanism to explain the metal particle's role. Two equivalent pulse streamers, EPS1 and EPS2, arise from the interaction between space charge and metal particle. EPS1 facilitates breakdown via the negative space charge field generated by its head. EPS2 facilitates breakdown by merging with EPS1, accelerating its propagation and enhancing the electric field at the primary streamer head. Finally, we propose the side streamer (SS) mechanism to explain the nonlinear breakdown behavior of high-pressure SF6. The SS is identified as a new forward ionization wave that develops along the sides of the primary streamer, due to photoionization-driven negative ion accumulation. SS facilitates breakdown by merging with the primary streamer, increasing negative space charge and leading to three distinct propagation modes. Higher pressure increases the production rate of negative ions along the streamer sides, making SS more likely to form. Under overvoltage, the facilitating effect of SS diminishes as the background field (E/N)b strengthens, disappearing when (E/N)b exceeds 245 Td. This study provides new insights into the SF6 streamer breakdown mechanisms induced by floating metal particles and offers theoretical references for further investigation on the quantitative characterization.</description>

      <title>Data-driven methods to discover stable linear models of the helicity injectors on HIT-SIU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient circuit models are necessary to control the power electronic circuits found on plasma physics experiments. Tuning and controlling the behavior of these circuits is inextricably linked to plasma performance. Linear models are greatly preferred for control applications due to their well-established performance guarantees, but they typically fail to capture nonlinear dynamics and changes in experimental parameters. Data-driven system identification can help mitigate these shortcomings by learning interpretable and accurate reduced-order models of a complex system, in this case the injector circuits of the Helicity Injected Torus - Steady Inductive Upgrade (HIT-SIU) experiment. Specifically, the Bagging Optimized Dynamic Mode Decomposition (BOP-DMD), is leveraged to learn stable, reduced order models of the interaction between the spheromak plasma formed in the confinement volume, and the injector circuits of the device. BOP-DMD is trained and evaluated on an analytic model of the vacuum dynamics of the injector circuits of HIT-SIU, as well as an analytic linear reduced-order model for the injector dynamics when a plasma is present. BOP-DMD is then fit on experimental data, both on shots with and without a plasma in the confinement volume. In doing so, we demonstrate the capability of data-driven methods to produce stable, linear models for control and uncertainty quantification in plasma experiments.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and particle acceleration in astrophysical jets with velocity and magnetic shear: Interaction of Kelvin-Helmholtz and Drift-Kink Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present 2D particle-in-cell simulations of a magnetized, collisionless, relativistic pair plasma subjected to combined velocity and magnetic-field shear, a scenario typical for astrophysical black-hole jet-wind boundaries. We create conditions where only the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) and Drift-Kink (DK) instabilities can develop, while tearing modes are forbidden. We find that DKI can effectively disrupt the cats-eye vortices generated by KHI, creating a turbulent shear layer on the DK timescale. This interplay leads to a significant enhancement of dissipation over cases with only velocity shear or only magnetic shear. Moreover, we observe efficient nonthermal particle acceleration caused by the alignment of the instability-driven electric fields with Speiser-like motion of particles close to the shear interface. This study highlights the sensitivity of dissipation to multiple simultaneous instabilities, thus providing a strong motivation for further studies of their nonlinear interaction at the kinetic level.</description>

      <title>Sapphire++: A particle transport code combining a spherical harmonic expansion and the discontinuous Galerkin method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Sapphire++, an open-source code designed to numerically solve the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation for astrophysical applications. Sapphire++ employs a numerical algorithm based on a spherical harmonic expansion of the distribution function, expressing the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation as a system of partial differential equations governing the evolution of the expansion coefficients. The code utilises the discontinuous Galerkin method in conjunction with implicit and explicit time stepping methods to compute these coefficients, providing significant flexibility in its choice of spatial and temporal accuracy. We showcase the code's validity using examples. In particular, we simulate the acceleration of test particles at a parallel shock and compare the results to analytical predictions. The Sapphire++ code (https://github.com/sapphirepp/sapphirepp) is available as a free and open-source tool for the community.</description>

      <title>Solar wind entry into Mercury's magnetosphere: Simulation results for the second swingby of BepiColombo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. We use a global 3D hybrid plasma model to investigate the interaction between Mercury's magnetosphere and the solar wind for the second BepiColombo swingby, evaluate magnetospheric regions, and study the typical energy profile of protons. Aims. The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of solar wind entry and analyze simulated plasma data along a trajectory using BepiColombo swingby 2 conditions, with the goal of enhancing our comprehension of measurement data and potentially providing forecasts for future swingbys. Methods. To model Mercury's plasma environment, we used the hybrid code AIKEF and developed a method to extract the particle (ion) data in order to compute the proton energy spectrum along the trajectory of BepiColombo during its second Mercury swingby on June 23, 2022. We evaluate magnetopause and bow shock stand-off distances under average upstream solar wind conditions with the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) condition derived from the BepiColombo magnetic field measurements during the second Mercury swingby. Results. We found that the magnetosheath on the quasi-perpendicular (dusk) side of the bow shock is thicker than that on the quasi-parallel (dawn) side, where a foreshock is formed. Multiple plasma populations can be extracted from our modeled energy spectra that assist in identifying magnetospheric regions. We observed protons of solar wind origin entering Mercury's magnetosphere. Their energies range from a few electron volts in the magnetosphere up to 10 keV in the magnetosheath.</description>

      <title>Ball Lightning as a Hot, Highly Charged, Sphere of Air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12309</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.12309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An exceptionally simple model of ball lightning is proposed that describes it as a highly charged sphere of hot, conductive, air surrounded by colder air. This conductive sphere possesses a net excess of charge. This charge will create a corona discharge that will heat the surrounding air thus maintaining the temperature of the ball itself. Numerical simulations are presented which give results that would appear to agree with what many witnesses have reported. It is argued that such spheres are likely positively charged.</description>

      <title>Divertor shaping with neutral baffling as a solution to the tokamak power exhaust challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08586v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exhausting power from the hot fusion core to the plasma-facing components is one of the biggest challenges in fusion energy. The MAST Upgrade tokamak uniquely integrates strong containment of neutrals within the exhaust area (divertor) with extreme divertor shaping capability. By systematically altering the divertor shape, this study shows the strongest evidence to date that long-legged divertors with a high magnetic field gradient (total flux expansion) deliver key power exhaust benefits without adversely impacting the hot fusion core. These benefits are already achieved with relatively modest geometry adjustments that are more feasible to integrate in reactor designs. Benefits include reduced target heat loads and improved access to, and stability of, a neutral gas buffer that 'shields' the target and enhances power exhaust (detachment). Analysis and model comparisons shows these benefits are obtained by combining multiple shaping aspects: long-legged divertors have expanded plasma-neutral interaction volume that drive reductions in particle and power loads, while total flux expansion enhances detachment access and stability. Containing the neutrals in the exhaust area with physical structures further augments these shaping benefits. These results demonstrate strategic variation in the divertor geometry and magnetic topology is a potential solution to one of fusion's biggest challenges: power exhaust.</description>

      <title>Suppression of temperature-gradient-driven turbulence by sheared flows in fusion plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from the assumption that saturation of plasma turbulence driven by temperature-gradient instabilities in fusion plasmas is achieved by a local energy cascade between a long-wavelength outer scale, where energy is injected into the fluctuations, and a small-wavelength dissipation scale, where fluctuation energy is thermalised by particle collisions, we formulate a detailed phenomenological theory for the influence of perpendicular flow shear on magnetised-plasma turbulence. Our theory introduces two distinct regimes, called the weak-shear and strong-shear regimes, each with its own set of scaling laws for the scale and amplitude of the fluctuations and for the level of turbulent heat transport. We discover that the ratio of the typical radial and poloidal wavenumbers of the fluctuations (i.e., their aspect ratio) at the outer scale plays a central role in determining the dependence of the turbulent transport on the imposed flow shear. Our theoretical predictions are found to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations of two paradigmatic models of fusion-relevant plasma turbulence: (i) an electrostatic fluid model of slab electron-scale turbulence, and (ii) Cyclone-base-case gyrokinetic ion-scale turbulence. Additionally, our theory envisions a potential mechanism for the suppression of electron-scale turbulence by perpendicular ion-scale flows based on the role of the aforementioned aspect ratio of the electron-scale fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Gyrokinetic simulations of the effects of magnetic islands on microturbulence in KSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gyrokinetic simulations are utilized to study effects of magnetic islands on the ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence in the KSTAR tokamak with resonant magnetic perturbations. Simulations show that the transport is controlled by the nonlinear interactions between the ITG turbulence and self-generated vortex flows and zonal flows, leading to an anisotropic structure of fluctuation and transport on the poloidal plane and in the toroidal direction. Magnetic islands greatly enhance turbulent transport of both particle and heat. The turbulent transport exhibits variations in the toroidal direction, with transport through the resonant layer near the island X-point being enhanced when the X-point is located at the outer mid-plane. A quantitative agreement is shown between simulations and KSTAR experiments in terms of time frequency and perpendicular wavevector spectrum.</description>

      <title>Radiative hydrodynamic equations with nonequilibrium radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01827v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a kinetic model for the coupled evolution of radiation, electrons, and ions in a radiation plasma system. The model is solved using two methods. The gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) for electron and ion hydrodynamics and the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) for non-equilibrium radiative transfer. The UGKS accurately captures multiscale photon transport from free streaming to diffusion across varying fluid opacities. This approach enables the scheme to model equilibrium plasma with non-equilibrium radiation transport. The model is validated through several test cases, including radiative transfer in kinetic and diffusion regimes, Marshak wave, Radiative shock, 3T(three-temperature) double lax shock tube problem, two-dimensional Sedov blast wave, and two-dimensional tophat based problem. These tests demonstrate the current scheme's capability to handle diverse radiation plasma scenarios.</description>
