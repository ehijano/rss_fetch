      <title>Collective Rabi-driven vibrational activation in molecular polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid light-matter states, known as molecular polaritons, arise from electronic or vibrational strong coupling (ESC and VSC) with confined electromagnetic fields. While these have been widely studied, the influence of electron-nuclear dynamics in driven cavities remains largely unknown. Here, we report a previously unrecognized mechanism of vibrational activation that emerges under collective ESC in driven optical cavities. Using semiclassical simulations that self-consistently combine Maxwell's equations with quantum molecular dynamics, we show that collective electronic Rabi oscillations coherently drive nuclear motion. This effect is captured using both vibrational wave-packet dynamics in a minimal two-level model and atomistic simulations based on time-dependent density-functional tight-binding with Ehrenfest dynamics. Vibrational activation depends non-monotonically on the Rabi frequency and is maximized when the collective polaritonic splitting resonates with a molecular vibrational mode. The mechanism exhibits features consistent with a stimulated Raman-like relaxation mechanism. Our results establish a self-consistent framework for realistic cavity-electron-nuclear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Differentiable Solvers for Learning Parametric Solution Manifolds in Heterogeneous Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning the full family of solutions to parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs) is a central challenge to our ability to model the behavior of heterogeneous systems, with a variety of fundamental and application-oriented implications in fields such as hydrogeology where system properties exhibit significant (and often uncertain) spatial heterogeneity. We address this by reformulating a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) as a differentiable solver that learns the continuous solution manifold for steady-state Darcy flow. Our framework requires only a single training run, circumventing the need for costly re-training for each new parameter instance. Its versatility is demonstrated through two representations of spatially heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields: a direct analytical form and a novel data-driven formulation resting on an autoencoder to create a low-dimensional latent encoding. A key innovation is the integration of the differentiable decoder into the physics-informed loss function, enabling on-the-fly reconstruction of complex conductivity fields via automatic differentiation. The approach yields accurate, mass-conserving flow solutions and supports efficient uncertainty quantification, providing a general methodology for physics-constrained data-driven modeling of heterogeneous systems.</description>

      <title>A Study of Improved Limiter Formulations for Second-Order Finite Volume Schemes Applied to Unstructured Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A general, compact way of achieving second-order in finite-volume numerical methods is to perform a MUSCL-like, piecewise linear reconstruction of flow properties at each cell interface. To avoid the surge of spurious oscillations in the discrete solution, a limiter function is commonly employed. This strategy, however, can add a series of drawbacks to the overall numerical scheme. The present paper investigates this behavior by considering three different limiter formulations in the context of a second-order, finite volume scheme for the simulation of steady, turbulent flows on unstructured meshes. Three limiter formulations are considered: the original Venkatakrishnan limiter, Wang's modification to the Venkatakrishnan limiter and Nishikawa's recently introduced R3 limiter. Three different configurations of the fully-developed, two-dimensional, transonic NACA 0012 airfoil are analyzed, configured with different angles of attack and similar freestream properties. The gas dynamics are modeled using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, where the negative Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model is used to solve the closure problem. All limiters are shown to yield similar results for all configurations of this case, although with different dissipative characteristics, provided their control constants are used within appropriate intervals. The presented numerical results are in good agreement with experimental data available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Fractals in rate-induced tipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When parameters of a dynamical system change sufficiently fast, critical transitions can take place even in the absence of bifurcations. This phenomenon is known as rate-induced tipping and has been reported in a variety of systems, from simple ordinary differential equations and maps to mathematical models in climate sciences and ecology. In most examples, the transition happens at a critical rate of parameter change, a rate-induced tipping point, and is associated with a simple unstable orbit (edge state). In this work, we show how this simple picture changes when non-attracting fractal sets exist in the autonomous system, a ubiquitous situation in non-linear dynamics. We show that these fractals in phase space induce fractals in parameter space, which control the rates and parameter changes that result in tipping. We explain how such rate-induced fractals appear and how the fractal dimensions of the different sets are related to each other. We illustrate our general theory in three paradigmatic systems: a piecewise linear one-dimensional map, the two-dimensional H\'enon map, and a forced pendulum.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure, phase stability, and transport properties of the AlTiVCr lightweight high-entropy alloy: A computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and phase stability of the AlTiVCr lightweight high-entropy alloy using a combination of ab initio electronic structure calculations, a concentration wave analysis, and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations. In alignment both with experimental data and with results obtained using other computational approaches, we predict a $\textrm{B2}$ (CsCl) chemical ordering emerging in this alloy at comparatively high temperatures, which is driven by Al and Ti moving to separate sublattices, while V and Cr express weaker site preferences. The impact of this $\textrm{B2}$ chemical ordering on the electronic transport properties of the alloy is investigated within a Kubo-Greenwood linear response framework and it is found that, counter-intuitively, the alloy's residual resistivity increases as the material transitions from the $\textrm{A2}$ (disordered bcc) phase to our predicted $\textrm{B2}$ (partially) ordered structure. This is understood to result primarily from a reduction in the density of electronic states at the Fermi level induced by the chemical ordering. At low temperatures, our atomistic Monte Carlo simulations then reveal subsequent sublattice orderings, with the ground-state configuration predicted to be a fully-ordered, single-phase structure with vanishing associated residual resistivity. These results give fresh, insight into the atomic-scale structure and consequent physical properties of this well-studied, technologically relevant material.</description>

      <title>Simulations of multi-phase gas in and around galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiphase gas -- ranging from cold molecular clouds ($\lesssim 100\,$K) to hot, diffuse plasma ($\gtrsim 10^6\,$K) is a defining feature of the interstellar, circumgalactic, intracluster, and intergalactic media. Accurately simulating its dynamics is critical to improving our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, however, due to their multi-scale and multi-physics nature, multiphase systems are highly challenging to model. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of numerical simulations of multiphase gas in and around galaxies. We begin by outlining the environments where multiphase gas arises and the physical and computational challenges associated with its modeling. Key quantities that characterize multiphase gas dynamics are discussed, followed by an in-depth look at idealized setups such as turbulent mixing layers, cloud-wind interactions, thermal instability, and turbulent boxes. The review then transitions to less idealized and/or larger-scale simulations, covering radiative supernovae bubbles, tall box simulations, isolated galaxy models including dwarf and Milky Way-mass systems, and cosmological zoom-in simulations, with a particular focus on simulations that enhance resolution in the halo. Throughout, we emphasize the importance of connecting scales, extracting robust diagnostics, and comparing simulations to observations. We conclude by outlining persistent challenges and promising directions for future work in simulating the multiphase Universe.</description>

      <title>A robust and stable hybrid neural network/finite element method for 2D flows that generalizes to different geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deep neural network multigrid solver (DNN-MG) combines a coarse-grid finite element simulation with a deep neural network that corrects the solution on finer grid levels, thereby improving the computational efficiency. In this work, we discuss various design choices for the DNN-MG method and demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and generalizability when applied to the solution of the instationary Navier-Stokes equations. We investigate the stability of the hybrid simulation and show how the neural networks can be made more robust with the help of replay buffers. By retraining on data derived from the hybrid simulation, the error caused by the neural network over multiple time-steps can be minimized without the need for a differentiable numerical solver. Furthermore, we compare multiple neural network architectures, including recurrent neural networks and Transformers, and study their ability to utilize more information from an increased temporal and spatial receptive field. Transformers allow us to make use of information from cells outside the predicted patch even with unstructured meshes while maintaining the locality of our approach. This can further improve the accuracy of DNN-MG without a significant impact on performance.</description>

      <title>Mercury-Ar$\chi$es: a high-performance n-body code for planet formation studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forming planetary systems are populated by large numbers of gravitationally interacting planetary bodies, spanning from massive giant planets to small planetesimals akin to present-day asteroids and comets. All these planetary bodies are embedded in the gaseous embrace of their native protoplanetary disks, and their interactions with the disk gas play a central role in shaping their dynamical evolution and the outcomes of planet formation. These factors make realistic planet formation simulations extremely computationally demanding, which in turn means that accurately modeling the formation of planetary systems requires the use of high-performance methods. The planet formation code Mercury-Ar$\chi$es was developed to address these challenges and, since its first implementation, has been used in multiple exoplanetary and Solar System studies. Mercury-Ar$\chi$es is a parallel n-body code that builds on the widely used Mercury code and is capable of modeling the growth and migration of forming planets, the interactions between planetary bodies and the disk gas, as well as the evolving impact flux of planetesimals on forming planets across the different stages of their formation process. In this work we provide the up-to-date overview of its physical modeling capabilities and the first detailed description of its high-performance implementation based on the OpenMP directive-based parallelism for shared memory environments, to harness the multi-thread and vectorization features of modern processor architectures.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Dipolar Electrostatic Modeling of Plasmonic Nanoparticles with Arbitrary Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and fast calculations of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) in metallic nanoparticles is essential for applications in sensing, nano-optics, and energy harvesting. Although full-wave numerical techniques such as the boundary element method (BEM) or the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) provide high accuracy, their computational cost often hinders rapid parametric studies. Here it is presented an ultrafast method that avoids solving large eigenproblems. Instead, only the dipolar component of the induced surface charge density \((\sigma_{dipolar})\) is retained through a expansion into Cartesion dipole basis, yielding a compact $3\times3$ geometric formulation that avoids full boundary-integral solves. The spectral response is obtained in a similar way, by projecting the Neumann--Poincar\'e surface operator onto the dipole subspace and evaluating a Rayleigh quotient, giving geometry-only eigenvalues again without an $N\times N$ eigenproblem. A major advantage of this method is that all geometry-dependent quantities are computed once per nanoparticle, while material dispersion and environmental changes enter only through simple algebraic expressions for the polarizability, enabling rapid evaluation across wavelengths. Retardation effects are incorporated through the modified long-wavelength approximation (MLWA), extending accuracy into the weakly retarded regime. The resulting framework provides a valuable tool for fast modelling and optimization of plasmonic nanoparticles at a significant lesser computational cost than BEM, DDA, and other standard tools.</description>

      <title>The Origins of Planets for ArieL (OPAL) Key Science Project: the end-to-end planet formation campaign for the ESA space mission Ariel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing body of atmospheric observations of exoplanets from space and ground-based facilities showcases how the great diversity of the planetary population is not limited to their physical properties but extends to their compositions. The ESA space mission Ariel will observe and characterise hundreds of exoplanetary atmospheres to explore and understand the roots of this compositional diversity. To lay the foundations for the Ariel mission, the OPAL Key Science Project is tasked with creating an unprecedented library of realistic synthetic atmospheres spanning tens of elements and hundreds of molecules on which the Ariel consortium will test and validate its codes and pipelines ahead of launch. In this work we describe the aims and the pipeline of codes of the OPAL project, as well as the process through which we trace the genetic link connecting planets to their native protoplanetary disks and host stars. We present the early results of this complex and unprecedented endeavour and discuss how they highlight the great diversity of outcomes that emerge from the large degeneracy in the parameter space of possible initial conditions to the planet formation process. This, in turn, illustrates the growing importance of interdisciplinary modelling studies supported by high-performance computing methods and infrastructures to properly investigate this class of high-dimensionality problems.</description>

      <title>A Graph Neural Network for the Era of Large Atomistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models, or large atomistic models (LAMs), aim to universally represent the ground-state potential energy surface (PES) of atomistic systems as defined by density functional theory (DFT). The scaling law is pivotal in the development of large models, suggesting that their generalizability in downstream tasks consistently improves with increased model size, expanded training datasets, and larger computational budgets. In this study, we present DPA3, a multi-layer graph neural network founded on line graph series (LiGS), designed explicitly for the era of LAMs. We demonstrate that the generalization error of the DPA3 model adheres to the scaling law. The scalability in the number of model parameters is attained by stacking additional layers within DPA3. Additionally, the model employs a dataset encoding mechanism that decouples the scaling of training data size from the model size within its multi-task training framework. When trained as problem-oriented potential energy models, the DPA3 model exhibits superior accuracy in the majority of benchmark cases, encompassing systems with diverse features, including molecules, bulk materials, surface and cluster catalysts, two-dimensional materials, and battery materials. When trained as a LAM on the OpenLAM-v1 dataset, the DPA-3.1-3M model exhibits lowest overall zero-shot generalization error across 12 downstream tasks spanning a diverse array of research domains. This performance suggests superior accuracy as an out-of-the-box potential model, requiring minimal fine-tuning data for downstream scientific applications.</description>

Abstract: Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) and probabilistic bit (p-bit)-based computing platforms have emerged as promising paradigms for tackling complex combinatorial optimization problems. Although traditionally viewed as distinct approaches, this work presents a theoretically grounded framework for configuring OIMs as p-bit engines. We demonstrate that this functionality can be enabled through a novel interplay between first- and second harmonic injection to the oscillators. Our work identifies new synergies between the two methods and broadens the scope of applications for OIMs. We further show that the proposed approach can be applied to other analog dynamical systems, such as the Dynamical Ising Machine.</description>

Abstract: VN precipitates used to strengthen ARAFM steels for fusion applications dissolve under high Fe ion irradiation (100 dpa at 10^-3 dpa s^-1, 600 C). This study examined point defects and solute substitutions using atom probe tomography, machine learning interatomic potentials, and density functional theory. Combined with transmission electron microscopy, results show N-vacancies and substitutional Cr exist in VN precipitates before irradiation. Monte Carlo simulations and collision cascade simulations confirm ordered vacancies at operating temperatures help mitigate irradiation damage. However, solute additions disrupt vacancy ordering and enhance irradiation-induced damage, potentially accelerating dissolution.</description>

Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) describe the inner, non-perturbative structure of hadrons. Their computation involves matrix elements with a Wilson line along a direction on the light cone, posing significant challenges in Euclidean lattice calculations, where the time direction is not directly accessible. We propose implementing the light-front Wilson line within the Hamiltonian formalism using tensor network techniques. The approach is demonstrated in the massive Schwinger model (quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions), a toy model that shares key features with quantum chromodynamics. We present accurate continuum results for the fermion PDF of the vector meson at varying fermion masses, obtained from first-principle calculations directly in Minkowski space. Our strategy also provides a useful path for quantum simulations and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05420v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information processing abilities of active matter are studied in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. We uncover an exceptional regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked previously. It appears robustly optimal for performance under many conditions, thus providing valuable insights into computation with physical systems more generally. The key to forming effective mechanisms for information processing appears in the system's intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are probed without actually enforcing a specific inference goal. The dynamical regime that achieves optimal computation is located just below a critical damping threshold, involving a relaxation with multiple stages, and is readable at the single-particle level. At the many-body level, it yields substrates robustly optimal for RC across varying physical parameters and inference tasks. A system in this regime exhibits a strong diversity of dynamic mechanisms under highly fluctuating driving forces. Correlations of agent dynamics can express a tight relationship between the responding system and the fluctuating forces driving it. As this model is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic effect in high order harmonic generation revealed by a fully analytical method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a fully analytical method for describing high-order harmonic generation (HHG). This method is based on the strong-field approximation (SFA) and electron-trajectory theory, but utilizes the perturbation expansion on the Keldysh parameter $\gamma$. This expansion allows us to clearly differentiate the nonadiabatic and adiabatic effects on HHG. We show that the nonadiabatic effect relating to high-order expansion depends on the laser wavelength and remarkably enhances the HHG yields for cases of short wavelengths, providing deeper insights into wavelength-dependent HHG yields which are important in producing attosecond pulses. Especially, our method provides the analytical and accurate descriptions of nonadiabatic exit velocity and position of the tunneling electron at the tunnel exit. These descriptions are meaningful for constructing a fully analytical and quantitative Coulomb-included HHG model, which is crucial in HHG-based attosecond measurement.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang-zero ratio method in three-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By performing Monte Carlo simulations of the three-dimensional Ising model, we apply the recently proposed Lee-Yang-zero ratio (LYZR) method to determine the location of the critical point in this model. We demonstrate that the LYZR method is as powerful as the conventional Binder-cumulant method in studying the critical point, while the LYZR method has the advantage of suppressing the violation of the finite-size scaling and non-linearity near the critical point. We also achieve a precise determination of the values of the LYZRs at the critical point, which are universal numbers. In addition, we propose an alternative method that uses only a single Lee-Yang zero and show that it is also useful for the search for the critical point.</description>

      <title>Towards Reasoning for PDE Foundation Models: A Reward-Model-Driven Inference-Time-Scaling Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking" strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational workflows in physics and engineering.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Flow Matching for Symmetry-Breaking Bifurcation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking. Deterministic machine learning models are unable to capture this multiplicity, averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In this work, we formalize the use of generative AI, specifically flow matching, as a principled way to model the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our approach builds on existing techniques by combining flow matching with equivariant architectures and an optimal-transport-based coupling mechanism. We generalize equivariant flow matching to a symmetric coupling strategy that aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of systems, from simple conceptual systems to physical problems such as buckling beams and the Allen--Cahn equation. The results demonstrate that the approach accurately captures multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations. Moreover, our results demonstrate that flow matching significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods. This offers a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Multimode Jahn-Teller Effect in Negatively Charged Nitrogen-Vacancy Center in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a first-principles study of the multimode Jahn-Teller (JT) effect in the exctied $^{3}E$ state of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Using density functional theory combined with an intrinsic distortion path (IDP) analysis, we resolve the full activation pathways of the JT distortion and quantitatively decompose the distortion into contributions from individual vibrational modes. We find that multiple vibrational modes participate cooperatively in the JT dynamics, giving rise to a shallow adiabatic potential energy surface with low barriers, consistent with thermally activated pseudorotation. The dominant JT-active modes are found to closely correspond to vibrational features observed in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES), in agreement with recent ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our results establish a microscopic, mode-resolved picture of vibronic coupling in the excited-state NV center and provide new insight into dephasing, relaxation, and optically driven dynamics relevant to solid-state quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>GlueNN: gluing patchwise analytic solutions with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the analysis of complex physical systems, the objective often extends beyond merely computing a numerical solution to capturing the precise crossover between different regimes and extracting parameters containing meaningful information. However, standard numerical solvers and conventional deep learning approaches, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), typically operate as black boxes that output solution fields without disentangling the solution into its interpretable constituent parts. In this work, we propose GlueNN, a physics-informed learning framework that decomposes the global solution into interpretable, patchwise analytic components. Rather than approximating the solution directly, GlueNN promotes the integration constants of local asymptotic expansions to learnable, scale-dependent coefficient functions. By constraining these coefficients with the differential equation, the network effectively performs regime transition, smoothly interpolating between asymptotic limits without requiring ad hoc boundary matching. We demonstrate that this coefficient-centric approach reproduces accurate global solutions in various examples and thus directly extracts physical information that is not explicitly available through standard numerical integration.</description>
