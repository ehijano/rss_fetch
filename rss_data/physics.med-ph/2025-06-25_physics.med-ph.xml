      <title>Do cell culturing influence the radiosensitizing effect of gold nanoparticles part 1: scrutinizing recent evidence for data consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In radiobiological experiments, the cells can either float in suspension or adhere to the walls of the sample holder. When irradiation is performed in the presence of dose modifying agents such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), the different shapes of the floating or adherent cells may imply a different dose to the nucleus, with biological consequences such as cell survival. Recently, it has been reported that the survival rate varies by up to a factor of 1.5 for the two cell geometries and by up to a factor of 2 for different orientation of the cells with respect to the incident beam. These results are examined in this paper and possible methodological issues are analyzed. This analysis shows that the simulation setup corresponds to the case of cells in the dose build-up region near the surface of a water phantom, where different depths result in different dose and survival probabilities. The validation of the simulations by comparison with experimental data is misleading, as the apparent agreement is due to a neglect of the quadratic term of the linear-quadratic survival model. The analysis further shows that the reported step-like changes between the survival predicted from the mean dose and the LEM could be explained by the fact that in the entire simulation only in one event an ionizing interaction of a photon took place in an AuNP. It is shown that the probability of this is in the permille range and that the total number of electrons leaving an AuNP, estimated from the reported electron spectrum, is three orders of magnitude higher than the value estimated from the expectation of photon interactions in the AuNPs. This contradiction would be resolved if the AuNP diameter in the simulations were a factor of 10 larger than intended. Another possible explanation for the discrepancies is a hidden bias in the simulation geometry, for example, if the distribution of AuNPs was non-uniform.</description>

      <title>An analytical model of depth-dose distributions for carbon-ion beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving effective treatment plans in carbon ion therapy, especially for targeting radioresistant tumors located in deep seated regions while sparing normal tissues, depends on a precise and computationally efficient dose calculation model. Although dose calculations are mostly performed using Monte Carlo simulations, the large amount of computational effort required for these simulations hinders their use in clinical practice. To address this gap, we propose, for the first time in the literature, an analytical model for the depth dose distribution of carbon ion beams by adapting and extending Bortfeld proton dose model. The Bortfeld model was modified and expanded by introducing additional terms and parameters to account for the energy deposition and fragmentation effects characteristic of carbon ions. Our model was implemented in MATLAB software to calculate depth-dose distributions of carbon ion beams across the clinical energy range of 100-430 MeV/u. The calculated results for carbon ion energies of 280 MeV/u and 430 MeV/u were compared with Monte Carlo simulation results from TOPAS to assess the precision of our model. It is observed that the results of the proposed model are in good agreement with those of several analytical and experimental studies for clinical carbon ion beams within the therapeutic energy range of 100-400 MeV/u. At 280 MeV/u, the analytical model result exhibited strong consistency with the depth dose curve produced by TOPAS Monte Carlo simulations. However, noticeable discrepancies appeared at higher energies, such as 430 MeV/u, particularly in the Bragg peak height and the dose falloff. In the clinically useful energy range, our model could potentially be an effective tool in carbon ion therapy as an alternative to complex Monte Carlo simulations. It will enable fast dose assessment with accuracy and in real time, thus improving workflow efficiency.</description>

      <title>Filling of incomplete sinograms from sparse PET detector configurations using a residual U-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long axial field-of-view PET scanners offer increased field-of-view and sensitivity compared to traditional PET scanners. However, a significant cost is associated with the densely packed photodetectors required for the extended-coverage systems, limiting clinical utilisation. To mitigate the cost limitations, alternative sparse system configurations have been proposed, allowing an extended field-of-view PET design with detector costs similar to a standard PET system, albeit at the expense of image quality. In this work, we propose a deep sinogram restoration network to fill in the missing sinogram data. Our method utilises a modified Residual U-Net, trained on clinical PET scans from a GE Signa PET/MR, simulating the removal of 50% of the detectors in a chessboard pattern (retaining only 25% of all lines of response). The model successfully recovers missing counts, with a mean absolute error below two events per pixel, outperforming 2D interpolation in both sinogram and reconstructed image domain. Notably, the predicted sinograms exhibit a smoothing effect, leading to reconstructed images lacking sharpness in finer details. Despite these limitations, the model demonstrates a substantial capacity for compensating for the undersampling caused by the sparse detector configuration. This proof-of-concept study suggests that sparse detector configurations, combined with deep learning techniques, offer a viable alternative to conventional PET scanner designs. This approach supports the development of cost-effective, total body PET scanners, allowing a significant step forward in medical imaging technology.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic cesium iodide as a potential PET material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13598v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Total Body PET (TBPET) scanners have recently demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce both acquisition time and the administered radioactive dose, thanks to their increased sensitivity. However, their widespread adoption is limited by the high costs associated with the current available systems. Cesium iodide (CsI), though historically less favored for PET due to its lower stopping power and light yield compared to crystals like LYSO, shows remarkable improvement when operated at cryogenic temperatures ($\sim$100 K). Under these conditions, CsI light yield rises dramatically to about 100 photons/keV, providing excellent energy resolution and good coincidence time resolution at a lower cost - typically 3 to 5 times cheaper than other crystals at parity of radiation length. In our study, we measured the light yield, the energy resolution and the coincidence time resolution as a function of temperature for two pure CsI crystals read out by a pair of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). An energy resolution of 6.3% FWHM and a coincidence time resolution of 1.84 ns at 511 keV were achieved at a temperature of 104 K. These results point towards the potential of cryogenic CsI as a cost-effective, high-performance material for TBPET scanners.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of microscopy methods to assess fish intestinal microvilli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary function of intestinal microvilli is to increase the surface area of the intestinal lining to maximize nutrient absorption. This is especially important as fish, like other animals, need to efficiently absorb proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, and minerals from their digested food to support their growth and energy needs. Despite its importance to the fish health, the small size and dense footprint of microvilli hinders its investigation and necessitates the need of advanced microscopy methods for its visualization. Characterization of the microvilli using super-resolution microscopy provides insights into their structural organization, spatial distribution, and surface properties. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of different optical, electron and force microscopy methods for analysis of fish microvilli. The super-resolution optical microscopy methods used are 3D structured illumination microscopy (SIM), stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED), and fluorescence fluctuation based super-resolution microscopy (FF-SRM). We also visualized the intestinal microvilli in fish using diffraction-limited optical microscopy methods including confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Additionally, label-free microscopy methods, such as quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) and bright-field imaging, were also employed. To obtain ultra-high resolution, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We demonstrate a systematic comparison of these microscopy techniques in resolving and quantifying microvilli features, ranging from 1-2 um structural morphology to 10-100 nm surface details.</description>
