      <title>Quantum synchronization blockade induced by nonreciprocal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the synchronization of coupled quantum oscillators has attracted a great deal of interest. Synchronization requires driven constituents, and in such systems, the coupling can be designed to be nonreciprocal. Nonreciprocally-coupled oscillators exhibit a rich variety of behavior including active traveling-wave type states. In this work, we study the interplay of three competing synchronization mechanisms in a setup of two nonreciprocally-coupled quantum van der Pol oscillators. One of the oscillators is driven externally which induces phase locking. A dissipative interaction leads to anti-phase locking, whereas a coherent interaction nurtures bistable phase locking and active states. We approximate the phase diagram of the quantum case by evaluating the synchronization measure of a perturbation expansion of the steady state. Furthermore, we study the phase diagrams of two and three oscillators in the mean-field limit and find highly nontrivial active states.</description>

      <title>Navigating with Stability: Local Minima, Patterns, and Evolution in a Gradient Damage Fracture Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In phase-field theories of brittle fracture, crack initiation, growth and path selection are investigated using non-convex energy functionals and a stability criterion. The lack of convexity with respect to the state poses difficulties to monolithic solvers that aim to solve for kinematic and internal variables simultaneously. In this paper, we inquire into the effectiveness of quasi-Newton algorithms as an alternative to conventional Newton-Raphson solvers. These algorithms improve convergence by constructing a positive definite approximation of the Hessian, bargaining improved convergence with the risk of missing bifurcation points and stability thresholds. Our study focuses on one-dimensional phase-field fracture models of brittle thin films on elastic foundations. Within this framework, in the absence of irreversibility constraint, we construct an equilibrium map that represents all stable and unstable equilibrium states as a function of the external load, using well-known branch-following bifurcation techniques. Our main finding is that quasi-Newton algorithms fail to select stable evolution paths without exact second variation information. To solve this issue, we perform a spectral analysis of the full Hessian, providing optimal perturbations that enable quasi-Newton methods to follow a stable and potentially unique path for crack evolution. We discuss the stability issues and optimal perturbations in the case when the damage irreversibility is present, changing the topological structure of the set of admissible perturbations which requires a dedicated nonlinear constrained eigenvalue solver.</description>
