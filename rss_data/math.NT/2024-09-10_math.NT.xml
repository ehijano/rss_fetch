      <title>Cyclotomic fields are generated by cyclotomic Hecke {\it L}-values of totally real fields, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jun-Lee-Sun posed the question of whether the cyclotomic Hecke field can be generated by a single critical $L$-value of a cyclotomic Hecke character over a totally real field. They provided an answer to this question in the case where the tame Hecke character is trivial. In this paper, we extend their work to address the case of non-trivial Hecke characters over solvable totally real number fields. Our approach builds upon the primary estimation obtained by Jun-Lee-Sun, supplemented with new inputs, including global class field theory, duality principles, the analytic behavior of partial Hecke $L$-functions, and the non-vanishing of twisted Gauss sums and Hyper Kloosterman sums.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the work of Castillo-Hall-Oliver-Pollack-Thompson who extended Maynard-Tao theorem on admissible tuples to number fields and function fields for tuples with monic linear forms, here we obtain the Maynard-Tao theorem for admissible tuples of linear forms with arbitrary leading coefficients in number fields and function fields. Also, we provide some applications of our results.</description>

      <title>Lattice point counting statistics for 3-dimensional shrinking Cygan-Kor\'anyi spherical shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E(x;\omega)$ be the error term for the number of integer lattice points lying inside a $3$-dimensional Cygan-Kor\'anyi spherical shell of inner radius $x$ and gap width $\omega(x)&gt;0$. Assuming that $\omega(x)\to0$ as $x\to\infty$, and that $\omega$ satisfies suitable regularity conditions, we prove that $E(x;\omega)$, properly normalized, has a limiting distribution. Moreover, we show that the corresponding distribution is moment-determinate, and we give a closed form expression for its moments. As a corollary, we deduce that the limiting distribution is the standard Gaussian measure whenever $\omega$ is slowly varying. We also construct gap width functions $\omega$, whose corresponding error term has a limiting distribution that is absolutely continuous with a non-Gaussian density.</description>

      <title>Constructions of well-rounded algebraic lattices over odd prime degree cyclic number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algebraic lattices are those obtained from modules in the ring of integers of algebraic number fields through the canonical or twisted embeddings. In turn, well-rounded lattices are those with maximal cardinality of linearly independent vectors in its set of minimal vectors. Both classes of lattices have been applied for signal transmission in some channels, such as wiretap channels. Recently, some advances have been made in the search for well-rounded lattices that can be realized as algebraic lattices. Moreover, some works have been published studying algebraic lattices obtained from modules in cyclic number fields of odd prime degree $p$. In this work, we generalize some results of a recent work of Tran et al. and we provide new constructions of well-rounded algebraic lattices from a certain family of modules in the ring of integers of each of these fields when $p$ is ramified in its extension over the field of rational numbers.</description>

      <title>Low Discrepancy Digital Kronecker-Van der Corput Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrepancy of a sequence measures how quickly it approaches a uniform distribution. Given a natural number $d$, any collection of one-dimensional so-called low discrepancy sequences $\left\{S_i:1\le i \le d\right\}$ can be concatenated to create a $d$-dimensional $\textit{hybrid sequence}$ $(S_1,\dots,S_d)$. Since their introduction by Spanier in 1995, many connections between the discrepancy of a hybrid sequence and the discrepancy of its component sequences have been discovered. However, a proof that a hybrid sequence is capable of being low discrepancy has remained elusive. This paper remedies this by providing an explicit connection between Diophantine approximation over function fields and two dimensional low discrepancy hybrid sequences.
  Specifically, let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be the finite field of cardinality $q$. It is shown that some real numbered hybrid sequence $\mathbf{H}(\Theta(t),P(t)):=\textbf{H}(\Theta,P)$ built from the digital Kronecker sequence associated to a Laurent series $\Theta(t)\in\mathbb{F}_q((t^{-1}))$ and the digital Van der Corput sequence associated to an irreducible polynomial $P(t)\in\mathbb{F}_q[t]$ meets the above property. More precisely, if $\Theta(t)$ is a counterexample to the so called $t$$\textit{-adic Littlewood Conjecture}$ ($t$-$LC$), then another Laurent series $\Phi(t)\in\mathbb{F}_q((t^{-1}))$ induced from $\Theta(t)$ and $P(t)$ can be constructed so that $\mathbf{H}(\Phi,P)$ is low discrepancy. Such counterexamples to $t$-$LC$ are known over a number of finite fields by, on the one hand, Adiceam, Nesharim and Lunnon, and on the other, by Garrett and the author.</description>

      <title>Zeta functions enumerating subforms of quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the Dirichlet series enumerating (proper) equivalence classes of full rank subforms/sublattices of a given quadratic form/lattice, focusing on the positive definite binary case. We obtain formulas linking this Dirichlet series with Dirichlet series counting ideal classes of the imaginary quadratic field associated with the quadratic form. Utilizing the result, we provide explicit formulas of the Dirichlet series for several lattices, including square lattice and hexagonal lattice. Moreover, we investigate some analytic properties of this Dirichlet series.</description>

      <title>Weak almost monomial groups and Artin's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of finite groups, called weak almost monomial, which generalize two different notions of "almost monomial" groups, and we prove it is closed under taking factor groups and direct products.
  Let $K/\mathbb Q$ be a finite Galois extension with a weak almost monomial Galois group $G$ and $s_0\in \mathbb C\setminus \{1\}$. We prove that Artin conjecture's is true at $s_0$ if and only if the monoid of holomorphic Artin $L$-functions at $s_0$ is factorial. Also, we show that if $s_0$ is a simple zero for some Artin $L$-function associated to an irreducible character of $G$ and it is not a zero for any other $L$-function associated to an irreducible character, then Artin conjecture's is true at $s_0$.</description>

      <title>Iwasawa Theory for GU(2,1) at inert primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many problems of arithmetic nature rely on the computation or analysis of values of $L$-functions attached to objects from geometry. Whilst basic analytic properties of the $L$-functions can be difficult to understand, recent research programs have shown that automorphic $L$-values are susceptible to study via algebraic methods linking them to Selmer groups. Iwasawa theory, pioneered first by Iwasawa in the 1960s and later Mazur and Wiles provides an algebraic recipe to obtain a $p$-adic analogue of the $L$-function. In this work we aim to adapt Iwasawa theory to a new context of representations of the unitary group GU(2,1) at primes inert in the respective imaginary quadratic field. This requires a novel approach using the Schneider--Venjakob regulator map, working over locally analytic distribution algebras. Subsequently, we show vanishing of some Bloch--Kato Selmer groups when a certain $p$-adic distribution is non-vanishing. These results verify cases of the Bloch--Kato conjecture for GU(2,1) at inert primes in rank 0.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for smooth numbers in short intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number is said to be $y$-smooth if all of its prime factors are less than or equal to $y.$ For all $17/30&lt;\theta\leq 1,$ we show that the density of $y$-smooth numbers in the short interval $[x,x+x^{\theta}]$ is asymptotically equal to the density of $y$-smooth numbers in the long interval $[1,x],$ for all $y \geq \exp((\log x)^{2/3+\varepsilon}).$ Assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, we also prove that for all $1/2&lt;\theta\leq 1$ there exists a large constant $K$ such that the expected asymptotic result holds for $y\geq (\log x)^{K}.$
  Our approach is to count smooth numbers using a Perron integral, shift this to a particular contour left of the saddle point, and employ a zero-density estimate of the Riemann zeta function.</description>

      <title>Large degree primitive points on curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number field $K$ is called primitive if $\mathbb Q$ and $K$ are the only subfields of $K$. Let $X$ be a nice curve over $\mathbb Q$ of genus $g$. A point $P$ of degree $d$ on $X$ is called primitive if the field of definition $\mathbb Q(P)$ of the point is primitive. In this short note we prove that if $X$ has a divisor of degree $d&gt; 2g$, then $X$ has infinitely many primitive points of degree $d$. This complements the results of Khawaja and Siksek that show that points of low degree are not primitive under certain conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the n-th positive square number is easy, as it is simply $n^2$. But how do we find the complementary sequence, i.e. the n-th positive nonsquare number? For this case there is an explicit formula. However, for general constraints on a number, this is harder to find. In this brief note, we study how to compute the n-th integer that does (or does not) satisfy a certain condition. In particular, we consider it as a fixed point problem, relate it to the iterative method of Lambek and Moser, study a bisection approach to this problem and provide a new formula for the n-th non-k-th power.</description>

      <title>Explicit desingularisation of Kummer surfaces in characteristic two via specialisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the birational geometry of the Kummer surfaces associated to the Jacobian varieties of genus two curves, with a particular focus on fields of characteristic two. In order to do so, we explicitly compute a projective embedding of the Jacobian of a general genus two curve and, from this, we construct its associated Kummer surface. This explicit construction produces a model for desingularised Kummer surfaces over any field of characteristic not two, and specialising these equations to characteristic two provides a model of a partial desingularisation. Adapting the classic description of the Picard lattice in terms of tropes, we also describe how to explicitly find completely desingularised models of Kummer surfaces whenever the $p$-rank is not zero. In the final section of this paper, we compute an example of a Kummer surface with everywhere good reduction over a quadratic number field, and draw connections between the models we computed and a criterion that determines when a Kummer surface has good reduction at two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a duality in the relative Langlands program. This duality pairs a Hamiltonian space for a group $G$ with a Hamiltonian space under its dual group $\check{G}$, and recovers at a numerical level the relationship between a period on $G$ and an $L$-function attached to $\check{G}$; it is an arithmetic analog of the electric-magnetic duality of boundary conditions in four-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Bessenrodt--Ono inequalities for $\ell$-tuples of pairwise commuting permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S_n$ denote the symmetric group. We consider \begin{equation*} N_{\ell}(n) := \frac{\left\vert Hom\left( \mathbb{Z}^{\ell},S_n\right) \right\vert}{n!} \end{equation*} which also counts the number of $\ell$-tuples $\pi=\left( \pi_1, \ldots, \pi_{\ell}\right) \in S_n^{\ell}$ with $\pi_i \pi_j = \pi_j \pi_i$ for $1 \leq i,j \leq \ell$ scaled by $n!$. A recursion formula, generating function, and Euler product have been discovered by Dey, Wohlfahrt, Bryman and Fulman, and White. Let $a,b, \ell \geq 2$. It is known by Bringman, Franke, and Heim, that the Bessenrodt--Ono inequality \begin{equation*} \Delta_{a,b}^{\ell}:= N_{\ell}(a) \, N_{\ell}(b) - N_{\ell}(a+b) &gt;0 \end{equation*} is valid for $a,b \gg 1$ and by Bessenrodt and Ono that it is valid for $\ell =2$ and $a+b &gt;9$. In this paper we prove that for each pair $(a,b)$ the sign of $\{\Delta_{a,b}^{\ell} \}_{\ell}$ is getting stable. In each case we provide an explicit bound. The numbers $N_{\ell}\left( n\right) $ had been identified by Bryan and Fulman as the $n$-th orbifold characteristics, generalizing work by Macdonald and Hirzebruch--H\"{o}fer concerning the ordinary and string-theoretic Euler characteristics of symmetric products, where $N_2(n)=p(n) $ represents the partition function.</description>

      <title>Resolutions for Locally Analytic Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study resolutions of locally analytic representations of a $p$-adic reductive group $G$. Given a locally analytic representation $V$ of $G$, we modify the Schneider-Stuhler complex (originally defined for smooth representations) so as to give an `analytic' variant ${\mathcal S}^A_\bullet(V)$. The representations in this complex are built out of spaces of analytic vectors $A_\sigma(V)$ for compact open subgroups $U_\sigma$, indexed by facets $\sigma$ of the Bruhat-Tits building of $G$. These analytic representations (of compact open subgroups of $G$) are then resolved using the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex from the theory of Lie algebras. This gives rise to a resolution ${\mathcal S}^{\rm CE}_{q,\bullet}(V) \rightarrow {\mathcal S}^A_q(V)$ for each representation ${\mathcal S}^A_q(V)$ in the analytic Schneider-Stuhler complex. In a last step we show that the family of representations ${\mathcal S}^{\rm CE}_{q,j}(V)$ can be given the structure of a Wall complex. The associated total complex ${\mathcal S}^{\rm CE}_\bullet(V)$ has then the same homology as that of ${\mathcal S}^A_\bullet(V)$. If the latter is a resolution of $V$, then one can use ${\mathcal S}^{\rm CE}_\bullet(V)$ to find a complex which computes the extension group $\underline{Ext}^n_G(V,W)$, provided $V$ and $W$ satisfy certain conditions which are satisfied when both are admissible locally analytic representations.</description>

      <title>Bounded distance equivalence of cut-and-project sets and equidecomposability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that given a lattice $\Gamma \subset \mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{R}^n$, and projections $p_1$ and $p_2$ onto $\mathbb{R}^m$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$ respectively, cut-and-project sets obtained using Jordan measurable windows $W$ and $W'$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ of equal measure are bounded distance equivalent only if $W$ and $W'$ are equidecomposable by translations in $p_2(\Gamma)$. As a consequence, we obtain an explicit description of the bounded distance equivalence classes in the hulls of simple quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>On integer partitions and the Wilcoxon rank-sum statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the literature, derivations of exact null distributions of rank-sum statistics is often avoided in cases where one or more ties exist in the data. By deriving the null distribution in the no-ties case with the aid of classical $q$-series results of Euler and Rothe, we demonstrate how a natural generalization of the method may be employed to derive exact null distributions even when one or more ties are present in the data. It is suggested that this method could be implemented in a computer algebra system, or even a more primitive computer language, so that the normal approximation need not be employed in the case of small sample sizes, when it is less likely to be very accurate. Several algorithms for determining exact distributions of the rank-sum statistic (possibly with ties) have been given in the literature (see Streitberg and R\"ohmel (1986) and Marx et al. (2016)), but none seem as simple as the procedure discussed here which amounts to multiplying out a certain polynomial, extracting coefficients, and finally dividing by a binomal coefficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our goal is to show that both the fast and slow versions of the triangle map (a type of multi-dimensional continued fraction algorithm) in dimension $n$ are ergodic, resolving a conjecture of Messaoudi, Noguiera and Schweiger. This particular type of higher dimensional multi-dimensional continued fraction algorithm has recently been linked to the study of partition numbers, with the result that the underlying dynamics has combinatorial implications.</description>

Abstract: We determine all algebraic relations among all hyperderivatives of the periods, quasi-periods, logarithms, and quasi-logarithms of Drinfeld modules defined over a separable closure of the rational function field. In particular, for periods and logarithms that are linearly independent over the endomorphism ring of the Drinfeld module, we prove the algebraic independence of their hyperderivatives and the hyperderivatives of the corresponding quasi-periods and quasi-logarithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the distributions of the splitting primes in certain families of number fields. The first and main example is the family Pn,N of integer polynomials monic of degree n with height less or equal then N, and then let N go to infinity. We prove an average version of the Chebotarev Density Theorem for this family. In particular, this gives Central Limit Theorem for the number of primes with given splitting type in some ranges. As an application, we deduce some estimates for the torsion in the class groups and for the average of ramified primes.</description>

Abstract: Let $K / \mathbb{Q}_p$ be a finite unramified extension, and let $\mathcal{X}_n$ denote the Emerton-Gee stack parametrizing \'etale $(\varphi,\Gamma_K)$-modules of rank $n$. It is known since the work of Emerton-Gee that the irreducible components of the reduced special fiber of $\mathcal{X}$ are labeled by Serre weights $\sigma$ of $\operatorname{GL}_n(k)$. If such a component is denoted $\mathcal{X}(\sigma)$, we prove that $\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{X}(\sigma)) \cong \mathbb{F}[x_1,x_2,\dots,x_{n-1},x_n^{\pm 1}]$ when $\sigma$ is sufficiently generic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Bailey lattice can be extended to a bilateral version in just a few lines from the bilateral Bailey lemma, using a very simple lemma transforming bilateral Bailey pairs related to $a$ into bilateral Bailey pairs related to $a/q$. Using this lemma and similar ones, we give bilateral versions and simple proofs of other (new and known) Bailey lattices, among which a Bailey lattice of Warnaar and the inverses of Bailey lattices of Lovejoy. As consequences of our bilateral point of view, we derive new $m$-versions of the Andrews-Gordon identities, Bressoud's identities, a new companion to Bressoud's identities, and the Bressoud-G\"ollnitz-Gordon identities. Finally, we give a new elementary proof of another very general identity of Bressoud using one of our Bailey lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We speculate on the distribution of primes in exponentially growing, linear recurrence sequences $(u_n)_{n\geq 0}$ in the integers. By tweaking a heuristic which is successfully used to predict the number of prime values of polynomials, we guess that either there are only finitely many primes $u_n$, or else there exists a constant $c_u&gt;0$ (which we can give good approximations to) such that there are $\sim c_u \log N$ primes $u_n$ with $n\leq N$, as $N\to \infty$. We compare our conjecture to the limited amount of data that we can compile.</description>

      <title>On towers of Isogeny graphs with full level structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p,q,l$ be three distinct prime numbers and let $N$ be a positive integer coprime to $pql$. For an integer $n\ge 0$, we define the directed graph $X_l^q(p^nN)$ whose vertices are given by isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over a finite field of characteristic $q$ equipped with a level $p^nN$ structure. The edges of $X_l^q(p^nN)$ are given by $l$-isogenies. We are interested in when the connected components of $X_l^q(p^nN)$ give rise to a tower of Galois covers as $n$ varies. We show that only in the supersingular case we do get a tower of Galois covers. We also study similar towers of isogeny graphs given by oriented supersingular curves, as introduced by Col\`o-Kohel, enhanced with a level structure.</description>

      <title>Torsion Vanishing for Some Shimura Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the torsion vanishing results of Caraiani-Scholze and Koshikawa. Our results apply to the cohomology of general Shimura varieties $(\mathbf{G},X)$ of PEL type $A$ or $C$, localized at a suitable maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ in the spherical Hecke algebra at primes $p$ such that $\mathbf{G}_{\mathbb{Q}_{p}}$ is a group for which we know the Fargues-Scholze local Langlands correspondence is the semi-simplification of a suitably nice local Langlands correspondence. This is accomplished by combining Koshikawa's technique, the theory of geometric Eisenstein series over the Fargues-Fontaine curve, the work of Santos describing the structure of the fibers of the minimally and toroidally compactified Hodge-Tate period morphism for general PEL type Shimura varieties of type $A$ or $C$, and ideas developed by Zhang on comparing Hecke correspondences on the moduli stack of $G$-bundles with the cohomology of Shimura varieties. In the process, we also establish a description of the generic part of the cohomology that bears resemblance to the work of Xiao-Zhu. Moreover, we also construct a filtration on the compactly supported cohomology that differs from Manotovan's filtration in the case that the Shimura variety is non-compact, allowing us to circumvent some of the circumlocutions taken by Cariani-Scholze. Our method showcases a very general strategy for proving such torsion vanishing results, and should bear even more fruit once the inputs are generalized. Motivated by this, we formulate an even more general torsion vanishing conjecture.</description>

      <title>An analogue of Ramanujan's identity for Bernoulli-Carlitz numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his second notebook, Ramanujan discovered the following identity for the special values of $\zeta(s)$ at the odd positive integers \begin{equation*}\begin{aligned}\alpha^{-m}\,\left\{\dfrac{1}{2}\,\zeta(2m + 1) + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\dfrac{n^{-2m - 1}}{e^{2\alpha n} - 1}\right\} &amp;-(- \beta)^{-m}\,\left\{\dfrac{1}{2}\,\zeta(2m + 1) + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\dfrac{n^{-2m - 1}}{e^{2\beta n} - 1}\right\}\nonumber &amp;=2^{2m}\sum_{k = 0}^{m + 1}\dfrac{\left(-1\right)^{k-1}B_{2k}\,B_{2m - 2k+2}}{\left(2k\right)!\left(2m -2k+2\right)!}\,\alpha^{m - k + 1}\beta^k \label{(1.2)},\end{aligned} \end{equation*} where $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ are positive numbers such that $ \alpha\beta = \pi^2 $ and $ m $ is a positive integer. As shown by Berndt in the viewpoint of general transformation of analytic Eisenstein series, it is a natural companion of Euler's famous formula for even zeta values. In this note, we prove an analogue of the above Ramanujan's identity in the functions fields setting, which involves the Bernoulli-Carlitz numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a standard definition of fractional powers on the universal cover $\exp:S\to \mathbb{C}^*$ seen as an infinite helicoid embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$, we study the statistics of pairs from the countable family $\{n^\alpha \, : \, n \in \exp^{-1}(\Lambda) \}$ for every complex grid $\Lambda$ and every real parameter $\alpha \in \, ]0,1[\,$. We prove the convergence of the empirical pair correlations measures towards a rotation invariant measure with explicit density. In particular, with the scaling factor $N\mapsto N^{1-\alpha}$, we prove that there exists an exotic pair correlation function which exhibits a level repulsion phenomenon. For other scaling factors, we prove that either the pair correlations are Poissonian or there is a total loss of mass. In addition, we give an error term for this convergence, with explicit dependence on parameters of the grid $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Oriented Supersingular Elliptic Curves and Eichler Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p&gt;3$ be a prime and $E$ be a supersingular elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$. Let $c$ be a prime with $c &lt; 3p/16$ and $G$ be a subgroup of $E[c]$ of order $c$. The pair $(E,G)$ is called a supersingular elliptic curve with level-$c$ structure, and the endomorphism ring $\text{End}(E,G)$ is isomorphic to an Eichler order with level $c$. We construct two kinds of Eichler orders $\mathcal{O}_c(q,r)$ and $\mathcal{O}'_c(q,r')$ with level $c$. Interestingly, we prove that each $\mathcal{O}_c(q,r)$ or $\mathcal{O}'_c(q,r')$ can represent a primitive reduced binary quadratic form with discriminant $-16cp$ or $-cp$ respectively. If a curve $E$ is $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-cp}]$-oriented or $\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1+\sqrt{-cp}}{2}]$-oriented, then we prove that $\text{End}(E,G)$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{O}_c(q,r)$ or $\mathcal{O}'_c(q,r')$ respectively. Due to the fact that $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-cp}]$-oriented isogenies between $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-cp}]$-oriented elliptic curves could be represented by quadratic forms, we show that these isogenies are reflected in the corresponding Eichler orders via the composition law for their corresponding quadratic forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11049v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over a number field $L$ and for a finite set $S$ of primes, let $\rho_{E,S} : {\rm Gal}(\overline{L}/L) \to {\rm GL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z}_{S})$ be the $S$-adic Galois representation. If $L \cap \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{n}) = \mathbb{Q}$ for all positive integers $n$ whose prime factors are in $S$, then $\det \rho_{E,S} : {\rm Gal}(\overline{L}/L) \to \mathbb{Z}_{S}^{\times}$ is surjective. We say that a finite index subgroup $H \subseteq {\rm GL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z}_{S})$ is minimal if $\det : H \to \mathbb{Z}_{S}^{\times}$ is surjective, but $\det : K \to \mathbb{Z}_{S}^{\times}$ is not surjective for any proper closed subgroup $K$ of $H$. We show that there are no minimal subgroups of ${\rm GL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z}_{S})$ unless $S = \{ 2 \}$, while minimal subgroups of ${\rm GL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z}_{2})$ are plentiful. We give models for all the genus $0$ modular curves associated to minimal subgroups of ${\rm GL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z}_{2})$, and construct an infinite family of elliptic curves over imaginary quadratic fields with bad reduction only at $2$ and with minimal $2$-adic image.</description>

Abstract: We prove, under certain assumptions, algebraicity of the ratio $L(m, \Pi \times \chi)/L(m, \Pi \times \chi')$, where $\Pi$ is a cuspidal automorphic cohomological unitary representation of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q})$, and $\chi$, $\chi'$ are finite order Hecke characters such that $\chi_{\infty} = \chi'_{\infty} = \mathrm{sgn}^{r}$, and $m, r$ are specific positive integers which depends only on $\Pi_{\infty}$. The methods in this article are a generalization of those in the work of Mahnkopf [Cohomology of arithmetic groups, parabolic subgroups and the special values of $L$-functions of GL(n), J. Inst. Math. Jussieu, 4 (2005)].</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number, $K$ a finite unramified extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $\mathbb{F}$ a finite extension of $\mathbb{F}_p$. For $\pi$ an admissible smooth representation of $\operatorname{GL}_2(K)$ over $\mathbb{F}$ satisfying certain multiplicity-one properties, we compute the rank of the associated \'etale $(\varphi,\mathcal{O}_K^{\times})$-module $D_A(\pi)$ defined by Breuil-Herzig-Hu-Morra-Schraen, extending their results.</description>

      <title>The Rational Torsion Subgroup of $J_0(\mathfrak{p}^r)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{n} = \mathfrak{p}^r$ be a prime power ideal of $\mathbb{F}_q[T]$ with $r \geq 2$. We study the rational torsion subgroup $\mathcal{T}(\mathfrak{p}^r)$ of the Drinfeld modular Jacobian $J_0(\mathfrak{p}^r)$. We prove that the prime-to-$q(q-1)$ part of $\mathcal{T}(\mathfrak{p}^r)$ is equal to that of the rational cuspidal divisor class group $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{p}^r)$ of the Drinfeld modular curve $X_0(\mathfrak{p}^r)$. As we completely computed the structure of $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{p}^r)$, it also determines the structure of the prime-to-$q(q-1)$ part of $\mathcal{T}(\mathfrak{p}^r)$.</description>

      <title>Additive number theory and the Dyson transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12253v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1942 Mann solved a famous problem, the $\alpha+\beta$ conjecture, about the lower bound of the Shnirel'man density of sums of sets of positive integers. In 1945, Dyson generalized Mann's theorem and obtained a lower bound for the Shnirel'man density of rank $r$ sumsets. His proof introduced the Dyson transform, an important tool in additive number theory. This paper explains the background of Dyson's work, gives Dyson's proof of his theorem, and includes several applications of the Dyson transform, such as Kneser's inequality for sums of finite subsets of an arbitrary additive abelian group.</description>

      <title>New bounds and progress towards a conjecture on the summatory function of $(-2)^{\Omega(n)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the summatory function \begin{equation*}
  W(x)=\sum_{n\leq x}(-2)^{\Omega(n)}, \end{equation*} where $\Omega(n)$ counts the number of prime factors of $n$, with multiplicity. We prove $W(x)=O(x)$, and in particular, that $|W(x)|&lt;2260x$ for all $x\geq 1$. This result provides new progress towards a conjecture of Sun, which asks whether $|W(x)|&lt;x$ for all $x\geq 3078$. To obtain our results, we computed new explicit bounds on the Mertens function $M(x)$. These may be of independent interest.
  Moreover, we obtain similar results and make further conjectures that pertain to the more general function \begin{equation*}
  W_a(x)=\sum_{n\leq x}(-a)^{\Omega(n)} \end{equation*} for any real $a&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>The $m$-th Element of a Sidon Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if $A=\{a_1,\dots ,a_{|A|}\}\subset \{1,2,\dots ,n\}$ is a Sidon set so that $|A|=n^{1/2}-L^\prime$, then $$a_m = m\cdot n^{1/2} + \mathcal O\left( n^{7/8}\right) + \mathcal O\left(L^{1/2}\cdot n^{3/4}\right)$$ where $L=\max\{0,L^\prime\}$. As an application of this, we give easy proofs of some previously derived results. We proceed on to proving that for any $\varepsilon &gt;0$, we have $$\sum_{a\in S} a = \frac 12 n^{3/2} + \mathcal O \left (n^{11/8} \right )$$ for all $n\le N$ but at most $\mathcal O_{\varepsilon} \left (N^{\frac 35 + \varepsilon} \right )$ exceptions.</description>

      <title>On a family of arithmetic series related to the M\"obius function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $P^-(n)$ denote the smallest prime factor of a natural integer $n&gt;1$. Furthermore let $\mu$ and $\omega$ denote respectively the M\"obius function and the number of distinct prime factors function. We show that, given any set ${{\scr P}}$ of prime numbers with a natural density, we have $\sum_{P^-(n)\in \scr P}\mu(n)\omega(n)/n=0$ and provide a effective estimate for the rate of convergence. This extends a recent result of Alladi and Johnson, who considered the case when ${\scr P}$ is an arithmetic progression.</description>

      <title>$\delta$-Forms on Lubin--Tate Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.10018v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Gubler--K\"unnemann's theory of $\delta$-forms from algebraic varieties to good Berkovich spaces. This is based on the observation that skeletons in such spaces satisfy a tropical balance condition. Our main result is that complete intersection formal models of cycles give rise to Green $\delta$-forms for their generic fibers. We moreover show that, in certain situations, intersection numbers on formal models are given by the $\star$-product of their Green currents. In this way, we generalize some results for divisor intersection to higher codimension situations. We illustrate the mentioned results in the context of an intersection problem for Lubin--Tate spaces.</description>

      <title>Schwartz $\kappa$-densities for the moduli stack of rank $2$ bundles on a curve over a local field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\rm{Bun}$ be the moduli stack of rank $2$ bundles with fixed determinant on a smooth proper curve $C$ over a local field $F$. We show how to associate with a Schwartz $\kappa$-density, for $\rm{Re}(\kappa)\ge 1/2$, a smooth function on the corresponding coarse moduli space of very stable bundles. In the non-archimedean case we also prove that the stack $\rm{Bun}$ is $\kappa$-bounded in the sense of Definition 2.10 of [arXiv:2112.08139] for any $\kappa\in\mathbb{C}$.</description>

      <title>Randomisation in the Josephus Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18110v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Josephus problem is a well--studied elimination problem consisting in determining the position of the survivor after repeated applications of a deterministic rule removing one person at a time from a given group.
  A natural probabilistic variant of this process is introduced in this paper. More precisely, in this variant, the survivor is determined after performing a succession of Bernouilli trials with parameter $p$ designating each time the person to remove. When the number of participants tends to infinity, the main result characterises the limit distribution of the position of the survivor with an increasing degree of precision as the parameter approaches the unbiaised case $p=1/2$. Then, the convergence rate to the position of the survivor is obtained in the form of a Central-Limit Theorem.
  A number of other variants of the suggested probabilistic elimination process are also considered. They each admit a specific limit behavior which, in most cases, is stated in the form of an open problem.</description>

      <title>Abelian surfaces over finite fields containing no curves of genus $3$ or less</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise abelian surfaces defined over finite fields containing no curves of genus less than or equal to $3$. Firstly, we complete and expand the characterisation of isogeny classes of abelian surfaces with no curves of genus up to $2$ initiated by the first author et al. in previous work. Secondly, we show that, for simple abelian surfaces, containing a curve of genus $3$ is equivalent to admitting a polarisation of degree $4$. Thanks to this result, we can use existing algorithms to check which isomorphism classes in the isogeny classes containing no genus $2$ curves have a polarisation of degree $4$. Thirdly, we characterise isogeny classes of abelian surfaces with no curves of genus $\leq 2$, containing no abelian surface with a polarisation of degree $4$. Finally, we describe absolutely irreducible genus $3$ curves lying on abelian surfaces containing no curves of genus less than or equal to $2$, and show that their number of rational points is far from the Serre-Weil bound.</description>
