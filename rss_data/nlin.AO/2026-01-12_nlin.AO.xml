      <title>Adaptive behaviors neutralize bistable explosive transitions in higher-order contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During contagion phenomena, individuals perceiving a risk of infection commonly adapt their behavior and reduce their exposure. The effects of such adaptive mechanisms have been studied for processes in which pairwise interactions drive contagion. However, contagion and the perception of infection risk can also involve ("higher-order") group interactions, leading potentially to new phenomenology. How adaptive behavior resulting from risk perception affects higher-order processes remains an open question. Here, we consider the impact of several risk-based adaptive behaviors on pairwise and higher-order contagion processes, using numerical simulations and an analytical mean-field approach. For pairwise contagion, adaptive mechanisms based on local (pairwise or group-based) risk perception impact only the endemic state, without affecting the epidemic phase transition. For higher-order contagion processes, instead, the adaptivity defuses the impact of non-linear group interactions: this reduces or even completely suppresses the parameter range in which bistability is possible, effectively transforming a higher-order contagion process into a pairwise one.</description>

      <title>Solving Inverse Problems in Stochastic Self-Organizing Systems through Invariant Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11796</link>

Abstract: Self-organizing systems demonstrate how simple local rules can generate complex stochastic patterns. Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making self-organization central to understanding natural complexity. A fundamental challenge in modeling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the unknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component, yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modeling method specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space, leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics. We evaluate the method on three self-organizing systems: a physical, a biological, and a social one; namely, a reaction-diffusion system, a model of embryonic development, and an agent-based model of social segregation. We show that the method reliably recovers parameters despite stochasticity in the pattern outcomes. We further apply the method to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex stochastic pattern formation.</description>

      <title>Hodge Decomposition Guides the Optimization of Synchronization over Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in synchronization dynamics over "higher-order" network models, optimization theory for such systems is limited. Here, we study a family of Kuramoto models inspired by algebraic topology in which oscillators are coupled over simplicial complexes (SCs) using their associated Hodge Laplacian matrices. We optimize such systems by extending the synchrony alignment function -- an optimization framework for synchronizing graph-coupled heterogeneous oscillators. Computational experiments are given to illustrate how this approach can effectively solve a variety of combinatorial problems including the joint optimization of projected synchronization dynamics onto lower- and upper-dimensional simplices within SCs. We also investigate the role of SC homology and develop bifurcation theory to characterize the extent to which optimal solutions are contained within (or spread across) the three Hodge subspaces. Our work extends optimization theory to the setting of higher-order networks, provides practical algorithms for Hodge-Laplacian-related dynamics including (but not limited to) Kuramoto oscillators, and paves the way for an emerging field that interfaces algebraic topology, combinatorial optimization, and dynamical systems.</description>
