      <title>Future You: Designing and Evaluating Multimodal AI-generated Digital Twins for Strengthening Future Self-Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What if users could meet their future selves today? AI-generated future selves simulate meaningful encounters with a digital twin decades in the future. As AI systems advance, combining cloned voices, age-progressed facial rendering, and autobiographical narratives, a central question emerges: Does the modality of these future selves alter their psychological and affective impact? How might a text-based chatbot, a voice-only system, or a photorealistic avatar shape present-day decisions and our feeling of connection to the future? We report a randomized controlled study (N=92) evaluating three modalities of AI-generated future selves (text, voice, avatar) against a neutral control condition. We also report a systematic model evaluation between Claude 4 and three other Large Language Models (LLMs), assessing Claude 4 across psychological and interaction dimensions and establishing conversational AI quality as a critical determinant of intervention effectiveness. All personalized modalities strengthened Future Self-Continuity (FSC), emotional well-being, and motivation compared to control, with avatar producing the largest vividness gains, yet with no significant differences between formats. Interaction quality metrics, particularly persuasiveness, realism, and user engagement, emerged as robust predictors of psychological and affective outcomes, indicating that how compelling the interaction feels matters more than the form it takes. Content analysis found thematic patterns: text emphasized career planning, while voice and avatar facilitated personal reflection. Claude 4 outperformed ChatGPT 3.5, Llama 4, and Qwen 3 in enhancing psychological, affective, and FSC outcomes.</description>

      <title>CommentScope: A Comment-Embedded Assisted Reading System for a Long Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long texts are ubiquitous on social platforms, yet readers often face information overload and struggle to locate key content. Comments provide valuable external perspectives for understanding, questioning, and complementing the text, but their potential is hindered by disorganized and unstructured presentation. Few studies have explored embedding comments directly into reading. As an exploratory step, we propose CommentScope, a system with two core modules: a pipeline that classifies comments into five types and aligns them with relevant sentences, and a presentation module that integrates comments inline or as side notes, supported by visual cues such as colors, charts, and highlights. Technical evaluation shows that the hybrid "Rule+LLM" pipeline achieved solid performance in semantic classification (accuracy=0.90) and position alignment (accuracy=0.88). A user study (N=12) further demonstrated that the sentence-end embedding significantly improved comment discovery accuracy and reading fluency while reducing mental demand and perceived effort.</description>

      <title>Cenergy3: An API for City Energy 3D Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient management and planning of urban energy systems require integrated three-dimensional (3D) models that accurately represent both consumption nodes and distribution networks. This paper introduces our developed geospatial Application Programming Interface (API) that automates the generation of 3D urban digital model from open data. The API synthesizes data from OpenTopography, OpenStreetMap, and Overture Maps in generating 3D models. The rendered model visualizes and contextualizes power grid infrastructure alongside the built environment and transportation networks. The API provides interactive figures for the 3D models, which are essential for analyzing infrastructure alignment and spatially linking energy demand nodes (buildings) with energy supply (utility grids). Our API leverages standard Web Mercator coordinates (EPSG:3857) and JSON serialization to ensure interoperability within smart city and energy simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>"Having Confidence in My Confidence Intervals": How Data Users Engage with Privacy-Protected Wikipedia Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to calls for open data and growing privacy threats, organizations are increasingly adopting privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy (DP) that inject statistical noise when generating published datasets. These techniques are designed to protect privacy of data subjects while enabling useful analyses, but their reception by data users is under-explored. We developed documentation that presents the noise characteristics of two Wikipedia pageview datasets: one using rounding (heuristic privacy) and another using DP (formal privacy). After incorporating expert feedback (n=5), we used these documents to conduct a task-based contextual inquiry (n=15) exploring how data users--largely unfamiliar with these methods--perceive, interact with, and interpret privacy-preserving noise during data analysis.
  Participants readily used simple uncertainty metrics from the documentation, but struggled when asked to compute confidence intervals across multiple noisy estimates. They were better able to devise simulation-based approaches for computing uncertainty with DP data compared to rounded data. Surprisingly, several participants incorrectly believed DP's stronger utility implied weaker privacy protections. Based on our findings, we offer design recommendations for documentation and tools to better support data users working with privacy-noised data.</description>

      <title>Beyond Satisfaction: From Placebic to Actionable Explanations For Enhanced Understandability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) presents useful tools to facilitate transparency and trustworthiness in machine learning systems. However, current evaluations of system explainability often rely heavily on subjective user surveys, which may not adequately capture the effectiveness of explanations. This paper critiques the overreliance on user satisfaction metrics and explores whether these can differentiate between meaningful (actionable) and vacuous (placebic) explanations. In experiments involving optimal Social Security filing age selection tasks, participants used one of three protocols: no explanations, placebic explanations, and actionable explanations. Participants who received actionable explanations significantly outperformed the other groups in objective measures of their mental model, but users rated placebic and actionable explanations as equally satisfying. This suggests that subjective surveys alone fail to capture whether explanations truly support users in building useful domain understanding. We propose that future evaluations of agent explanation capabilities should integrate objective task performance metrics alongside subjective assessments to more accurately measure explanation quality.

      <title>Memory Power Asymmetry in Human-AI Relationships: Preserving Mutual Forgetting in the Digital Age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes embedded in personal and professional relationships, a new kind of power imbalance emerges from asymmetric memory capabilities. Human relationships have historically relied on mutual forgetting, the natural tendency for both parties to forget details over time, as a foundation for psychological safety, forgiveness, and identity change. By contrast, AI systems can record, store, and recombine interaction histories at scale, often indefinitely. We introduce Memory Power Asymmetry (MPA): a structural power imbalance that arises when one relationship partner (typically an AI-enabled firm) possesses a substantially superior capacity to record, retain, retrieve, and integrate the shared history of the relationship, and can selectively deploy that history in ways the other partner (the human) cannot. Drawing on research in human memory, power-dependence theory, AI architecture, and consumer vulnerability, we develop a conceptual framework with four dimensions of MPA (persistence, accuracy, accessibility, integration) and four mechanisms by which memory asymmetry is translated into power (strategic memory deployment, narrative control, dependence asymmetry, vulnerability accumulation). We theorize downstream consequences at individual, relational/firm, and societal levels, formulate boundary-conditioned propositions, and articulate six design principles for restoring a healthier balance of memory in human-AI relationships (e.g., forgetting by design, contextual containment, symmetric access to records). Our analysis positions MPA as a distinct construct relative to information asymmetry, privacy, surveillance, and customer relationship management, and argues that protecting mutual forgetting, or at least mutual control over memory, should become a central design and policy goal in the AI age.</description>

      <title>Exploring Teenagers' Trust in Al Chatbots: An Empirical Study of Chinese Middle-School Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chatbots have become increasingly prevalent. A growing body of research focused on the issue of human trust in AI. However, most existing user studies are conducted primarily with adult groups, overlooking teenagers who are also engaging more frequently with AI technologies. Based on previous theories about teenage education and psychology, this study investigates the correlation between teenagers' psychological characteristics and their trust in AI chatbots, examining four key variables: AI literacy, ego identity, social anxiety, and psychological resilience. We adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining an online survey with semi-structured interviews. Our findings reveal that psychological resilience is a significant positive predictor of trust in AI, and that age significantly moderates the relationship between social anxiety and trust. The interviews further suggest that teenagers generally report relatively high levels of trust in AI, tend to overestimate their AI literacy, and are influenced by external factors such as social media.</description>

      <title>COIVis: Eye tracking-based Visual Exploration of Concept Learning in MOOC Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) make high-quality instruction accessible. However, the lack of face-to-face interaction makes it difficult for instructors to obtain feedback on learners' performance and provide more effective instructional guidance. Traditional analytical approaches, such as clickstream logs or quiz scores, capture only coarse-grained learning outcomes and offer limited insight into learners' moment-to-moment cognitive states. In this study, we propose COIVis, an eye tracking-based visual analytics system that supports concept-level exploration of learning processes in MOOC videos. COIVis first extracts course concepts from multimodal video content and aligns them with the temporal structure and screen space of the lecture, defining Concepts of Interest (COIs), which anchor abstract concepts to specific spatiotemporal regions. Learners' gaze trajectories are transformed into COI sequences, and five interpretable learner-state features -- Attention, Cognitive Load, Interest, Preference, and Synchronicity -- are computed at the COI level based on eye tracking metrics. Building on these representations, COIVis provides a narrative, multi-view visualization enabling instructors to move from cohort-level overviews to individual learning paths, quickly locate problematic concepts, and compare diverse learning strategies. We evaluate COIVis through two case studies and in-depth user-feedback interviews. The results demonstrate that COIVis effectively provides instructors with valuable insights into the consistency and anomalies of learners' learning patterns, thereby supporting timely and personalized interventions for learners and optimizing instructional design.</description>

      <title>Robots with Attitudes: Influence of LLM-Driven Robot Personalities on Motivation and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models enable unscripted conversations while maintaining a consistent personality. One desirable personality trait in cooperative partners, known to improve task performance, is agreeableness. To explore the impact of large language models on personality modeling for robots, as well as the effect of agreeable and non-agreeable personalities in cooperative tasks, we conduct a two-part study. This includes an online pre-study for personality validation and a lab-based main study to evaluate the effects on likability, motivation, and task performance. The results demonstrate that the robot's agreeableness significantly enhances its likability. No significant difference in intrinsic motivation was observed between the two personality types. However, the findings suggest that a robot exhibiting agreeableness and openness to new experiences can enhance task performance. This study highlights the advantages of employing large language models for customized modeling of robot personalities and provides evidence that a carefully chosen agreeable robot personality can positively influence human perceptions and lead to greater success in cooperative scenarios.</description>

      <title>Human Agency and Creativity in AI-Assisted Learning Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter explores human creativity in AI-assisted learning environments through the lens of student agency. We begin by examining four theoretical perspectives on agency, including instrumental, effortful, dynamically emergent, and authorial agency, and analyze how each frames the relationship between agency and creativity. Under each theoretical perspective, we discuss how the integration of generative AI (GenAI) tools reshapes these dynamics by altering students' roles in cognitive, social, and creative processes. In the second part, we introduce a theoretical framework for AI agentic engagement, contextualizing agency within specific cognitive, relational, and ethical dynamics introduced by GenAI tools. This framework is linked to the concept of Mini-c creativity, emphasizing personal relevance and self-directed learning. Together, these perspectives support a shift from viewing creativity as product-oriented to understanding it as a process of agentive participation and meaning-making. We conclude with two directions for future research focused on the creative process and performance in AI-assisted learning.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework of Student Agency in AI- Assisted Learning: A Grounded Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI(GenAI) is a kind of AI model capable of producing human-like content in various modalities, including text, image, audio, video, and computer programming. Although GenAI offers great potential for education, its value often depends on students' ability to engage with it actively, responsibly, and critically - qualities central to student agency. Nevertheless, student agency has long been a complex and ambiguous concept in educational discourses, with few empirical studies clarifying its distinct nature and process in AI-assisted learning environments. To address this gap, the qualitative study presented in this article examines how higher education students exercise agency in AI-assisted learning and proposes a theoretical framework using a grounded theory approach. Guided by agentic engagement theory, this article analyzes the authentic experiences of 26 students using data from their GenAI conversation records and cognitive interviews that capture their thought processes and decision-making. The findings identify four key aspects of student agency: initiating and (re)directing, mindful adoption, external help-seeking, and reflective learning. Together, these aspects form an empirically developed framework that characterizes student agency in AI-assisted learning as a proactive, intentional, adaptive, reflective, and iterative process. Based on the empirical findings, theoretical and practical implications are discussed for researchers, educators, and policymakers.</description>

      <title>Size Matters: The Impact of Avatar Size on User Experience in Healthcare Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The usage of virtual avatars in healthcare applications has become widely popular; however, certain critical aspects, such as social distancing and avatar size, remain insufficiently explored. This research investigates user experience and preferences when interacting with a healthcare application utilizing virtual avatars displayed in different sizes. For our study, we had 23 participants interacting with five different avatars (a human-size avatar followed by four smaller avatars in a randomized order) varying in size, projected on a wall in front of them. The avatars were fully integrated with an artificial intelligence chatbot to make them conversational. Users were asked to rate the usability of the system after interacting with each avatar and complete a survey regarding trust and an additional questionnaire on social presence. The results of this study show that avatar size significantly influences the perceived attractiveness and perspicuity, with the medium-sized avatars receiving the highest ratings. Social presence correlated strongly with stimulation and attractiveness, suggesting that an avatar's visual appeal and interactivity influenced user engagement more than its physical size. Additionally, we observed a tendency for gender-specific differences on some of the UEQ+ scales, with male participants tending to prefer human-sized representations, while female participants slightly favored smaller avatars. These findings highlight the importance of avatar design and representation in optimizing user experience and trust in virtual healthcare environments.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Spatial Misalignment and Time Delay on Collaborative Presence in Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise temporal and spatial alignment is critical in collaborative Augmented Reality (AR) where users rely on shared visual information to coordinate actions. System latency and object misalignment can disrupt communication, reduce task efficiency, and negatively impact the overall user experience. While previous research has primarily focused on individual AR interactions, the impact of these inconsistencies on collaboration remains underexplored. This article investigates how user experience and task load are affected by object misalignment and time delay in a shared AR space. To examine these factors, we conducted an experiment with 32 participants, organized into 16 pairs, who collaboratively completed a spatial placement task. Within each condition, both participants alternated roles, taking turns as the leader-providing verbal placement instructions-and the builder-executing the placement. Six conditions were tested, manipulating object alignment (perfectly aligned vs. randomly misaligned) and time delay (0s, 0.1s, 0.4s). The misalignment was applied randomly to each virtual object with a shift of +-20 cm on every axis to create a clear distinction in spatial perception. User experience and task load were assessed to evaluate how these factors influence collaboration and interaction in AR environments. Results showed that spatial misalignment significantly increased perceived workload (NASA-TLX) and lowered user ratings in Pragmatic quality and Attractiveness (UEQ), while time delay had a more limited effect. These findings highlight the critical role of spatial accuracy in maintaining collaboration quality in AR.</description>

      <title>Breaking Players' expectations: the Role of Non-player Characters' coherence and Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In video games, non-player characters (NPCs) play a pivotal role in shaping players' experiences. The design of these characters, encompassing their appearance and behaviors, can be manipulated in terms of coherence and consistency to maintain players' expectations or, on the contrary, to surprise them. The extent to which NPCs' coherence and consistency influence players' evaluation of them remains to be unveiled. To address this knowledge gap, two experiments were conducted in the context of a military shooter game. Players' evaluations of NPCs' perceived intelligence and believability were measured, as these two dimensions are fundamental to players' adoption of NPCs and subsequent commitment to them. The first experiment investigated the impact of disrupting players' initial expectations on their evaluations of NPCs. The second experiment focused on the influence of NPCs' coherence and consistency on both players' expectations and evaluation of NPCs, using a combination of questionnaires and behavioral and physiological measures. The results of our study show that disrupting players' initial expectations influences their assessment of NPCs, with coherent and consistent design reinforcing expectations and incoherent design challenging them.</description>

      <title>Living the Novel: A System for Generating Self-Training Timeline-Aware Conversational Agents from Novels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Living Novel, an end-to-end system that transforms any literary work into an immersive, multi-character conversational experience. This system is designed to solve two fundamental challenges for LLM-driven characters. Firstly, generic LLMs suffer from persona drift, often failing to stay in character. Secondly, agents often exhibit abilities that extend beyond the constraints of the story's world and logic, leading to both narrative incoherence (spoiler leakage) and robustness failures (frame-breaking). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel two-stage training pipeline. Our Deep Persona Alignment (DPA) stage uses data-free reinforcement finetuning to instill deep character fidelity. Our Coherence and Robustness Enhancing (CRE) stage then employs a story-time-aware knowledge graph and a second retrieval-grounded training pass to architecturally enforce these narrative constraints. We validate our system through a multi-phase evaluation using Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. A lab study with a detailed ablation of system components is followed by a 5-day in-the-wild diary study. Our DPA pipeline helps our specialized model outperform GPT-4o on persona-specific metrics, and our CRE stage achieves near-perfect performance in coherence and robustness measures. Our study surfaces practical design guidelines for AI-driven narrative systems: we find that character-first self-training is foundational for believability, while explicit story-time constraints are crucial for sustaining coherent, interruption-resilient mobile-web experiences.</description>

      <title>SemanticTours: A Conceptual Framework for Non-Linear, Knowledge Graph-Driven Data Tours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive tours help users explore datasets and provide onboarding. They rely on a linear sequence of views, showing a curated set of relevant data selections and introduce user interfaces. Existing frameworks of tours, however, often do not allow for branching and refining hypotheses outside of a rigid sequence, which is important in knowledge-centric domains such as law. For example, lawyers performing analytical case analysis need to iteratively weigh up different legal norms and construct strings of arguments. To address this gap, we propose SemanticTours, a semantic, graph-based model of tours that shifts from a sequence-based towards a graph-based navigation. Our model constructs a domain-specific knowledge graph that connects data elements based on user-definable semantic relationships. These relationships enable non-linear graph navigation that defines tours. We apply SemanticTours to the domain of law and conceptualize a visual analytics design and interaction concept for analytical reasoning in legal case analysis. Our concept accounts for the inherent complexity of graph-based tours using aggregated graph nodes and supporting navigation with a semantic lens. During an evaluation with six domain experts from law, they suggest that graph-based tours better support their analytical reasoning than sequences. Our work opens research opportunities for such tours to support analytical reasoning in law and other knowledge-centric domains.</description>

      <title>A Retrospective on Ultrasound Mid-Air Haptics in HCI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2013, the UltraHaptics system demonstrated that focused ultrasound could generate perceivable mid-air tactile sensations, building on earlier explorations of airborne ultrasound as a haptic medium. These contributions established ultrasound mid-air haptics (UMH) as a viable interaction modality and laid the technical and perceptual foundations for subsequent advances in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In this extended abstract, we revisit this formative work, trace the research and design trajectories it enabled, and reflect on how UMH has supported multisensory interaction, immersion, and inclusion. We also highlight how this line of research exemplifies the value of interdisciplinary collaboration to advance novel interactive technologies.</description>

      <title>Context-Adaptive Color Optimization for Web Accessibility: Balancing Perceptual Fidelity and Functional Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our OKLCH-based accessibility optimization with context-adaptive constraint strategies that achieve near-universal success rates across diverse use cases. Our original strict algorithm reached 66-77% success by prioritizing minimal perceptual change ($\Delta E \leq 5.0$), optimizing for enterprise contexts where brand fidelity is paramount. However, this one-size-fits-all approach fails to serve the broader ecosystem of web developers who need accessible solutions even when strict perceptual constraints cannot be satisfied. We introduce recursive optimization (Mode~1) that compounds small adjustments across iterations, achieving 93.68% success on all color pairs and 100% success on reasonable pairs (contrast ratio $\rho &gt; 2.0$), representing a +27.23 percentage point improvement. A relaxed fallback mode (Mode~2) handles pathological edge cases, reaching 98.73% overall success. Evaluation on 10,000 realistic web color pairs demonstrates that context-aware constraint relaxation, combined with absolute hue preservation, enables practical accessibility compliance while maintaining brand color identity. The median perceptual change remains zero across all modes (most pairs already comply), while the 90th percentile reaches $\Delta E_{2000} = 15.55$ in Mode~1 -- perceptually acceptable when hue invariance preserves the essential character of the original color. The approach is deployed in CM-Colors v0.5.0 (800+ monthly downloads), providing developers with explicit control over the accessibility-fidelity trade-off appropriate to their context.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Learning of Spectro-Topographical EEG Representations with Gradient Alignment for Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel graph-based learning of EEG representations with gradient alignment (GEEGA) that leverages multi-domain information to learn EEG representations for brain-computer interfaces. Our model leverages graph convolutional networks to fuse embeddings from frequency-based topographical maps and time-frequency spectrograms, capturing inter-domain relationships. GEEGA addresses the challenge of achieving high inter-class separability, which arises from the temporally dynamic and subject-sensitive nature of EEG signals by incorporating the center loss and pairwise difference loss. Additionally, GEEGA incorporates a gradient alignment strategy to resolve conflicts between gradients from different domains and the fused embeddings, ensuring that discrepancies, where gradients point in conflicting directions, are aligned toward a unified optimization direction. We validate the efficacy of our method through extensive experiments on three publicly available EEG datasets: BCI-2a, CL-Drive and CLARE. Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the impact of various components of our model.</description>

      <title>Protocol Futuring: Speculating Second-Order Dynamics of Protocols in Sociotechnical Infrastructural Futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing on infrastructure studies in HCI and CSCW, this paper introduces Protocol Futuring, a methodological framework that extends design futuring by foregrounding protocols-rules, standards, and coordination mechanisms-as the primary material of speculative inquiry. Rather than imagining discrete future artifacts, Protocol Futuring examines how protocol rules accumulate drift, jam, and other second-order effects over long temporal horizons. We demonstrate the method through a case study of Knowledge Futurama, a multi-team participatory workshop exploring millennial-scale knowledge preservation. Using a relay format in which teams inherited and reinterpreted partially formed designs, the workshop revealed how ambiguous handovers, adversarial reinterpretations, shifting cultural norms, and crisis dynamics transform protocols as they move across communities and epochs. The case shows how Protocol Futuring makes infrastructural politics and long-run consequences analytically visible. We discuss the method's strengths, limitations, and implications for researchers seeking to investigate emergent sociotechnical systems whose impacts unfold over extended timescales.</description>

      <title>GuideNav: User-Informed Development of a Vision-Only Robotic Navigation Assistant For Blind Travelers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While commendable progress has been made in user-centric research on mobile assistive systems for blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals, references that directly inform robot navigation design remain rare. To bridge this gap, we conducted a comprehensive human study involving interviews with 26 guide dog handlers, four white cane users, nine guide dog trainers, and one O\&amp;M trainer, along with 15+ hours of observing guide dog-assisted walking. After de-identification, we open-sourced the dataset to promote human-centered development and informed decision-making for assistive systems for BLV people. Building on insights from this formative study, we developed GuideNav, a vision-only, teach-and-repeat navigation system. Inspired by how guide dogs are trained and assist their handlers, GuideNav autonomously repeats a path demonstrated by a sighted person using a robot. Specifically, the system constructs a topological representation of the taught route, integrates visual place recognition with temporal filtering, and employs a relative pose estimator to compute navigation actions - all without relying on costly, heavy, power-hungry sensors such as LiDAR. In field tests, GuideNav consistently achieved kilometer-scale route following across five outdoor environments, maintaining reliability despite noticeable scene variations between teach and repeat runs. A user study with 3 guide dog handlers and 1 guide dog trainer further confirmed the system's feasibility, marking (to our knowledge) the first demonstration of a quadruped mobile system retrieving a path in a manner comparable to guide dogs.</description>

      <title>The Missing Variable: Socio-Technical Alignment in Risk Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a critical gap in the risk assessment of AI-enabled safety-critical systems. While these systems, where AI systems assists human operators, function as complex socio-technical systems, existing risk evaluation methods fail to account for the associated complex interaction between human, technical, and organizational elements. Through a comparative analysis of system attributes from both socio-technical and AI-enabled systems and a review of current risk evaluation methods, we confirm the absence of socio-technical considerations in standard risk expressions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel socio-technical alignment $STA$ variable designed to be integrated into the foundational risk equation. This variable estimates the degree of harmonious interaction between the AI systems, human operators, and organizational processes. A case study on an AI-enabled liquid hydrogen bunkering system demonstrates the variable's relevance. By comparing a naive and a safeguarded system design, we illustrate how the $STA$-augmented expression captures socio-technical safety implications that traditional risk evaluation overlooks, providing a more holistic basis for risk evaluation.</description>

      <title>JEEVHITAA -- An End-to-End HCAI System to Support Collective Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current mobile health platforms are predominantly individual-centric and lack the necessary primitives for coordinated, auditable, multi-actor workflows. However, in many settings worldwide, health decisions are enacted by multi-actor care networks rather than single users. We present JEEVHITAA, an Android/Flutter system that provides context-sensitive, role-aware sharing and verifiable information flows for care circles. JEEVHITAA ingests platform and device data (via Google Health Connect and BLE connectors), constructs multi-layer user profiles from sensor streams and tiered onboarding, and enforces fine-grained, time-bounded access control across permissioned care graphs. Data are end-to-end encrypted in local stores and during peer sync (Firebase), and provisions are made for document capture by camera or upload as PDF. An integrated retrieval-augmented LLM pipeline (i) produces structured, role-targeted summaries and action plans, (ii) enables users to gather advanced insights on health reports, and (iii) performs evidence-grounded user-relevant verification of arbitrary health content, returning provenance, confidence scores, and source citations. We describe the system architecture, connector abstractions, and security primitives, and evaluate robustness and compatibility using synthetic, ontology-driven simulations and vendor compatibility tests. Finally, we outline plans for longitudinal in-the-wild deployments to measure system performance, the correctness of access control, and the real-world effectiveness of relationship-aware credibility support.</description>

      <title>ProAgent: Harnessing On-Demand Sensory Contexts for Proactive LLM Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are emerging to transform daily life. However, existing LLM agents primarily follow a reactive paradigm, relying on explicit user instructions to initiate services, which increases both physical and cognitive workload. In this paper, we propose ProAgent, the first end-to-end proactive agent system that harnesses massive sensory contexts and LLM reasoning to deliver proactive assistance. ProAgent first employs a proactive-oriented context extraction approach with on-demand tiered perception to continuously sense the environment and derive hierarchical contexts that incorporate both sensory and persona cues. ProAgent then adopts a context-aware proactive reasoner to map these contexts to user needs and tool calls, providing proactive assistance. We implement ProAgent on Augmented Reality (AR) glasses with an edge server and extensively evaluate it on a real-world testbed, a public dataset, and through a user study. Results show that ProAgent achieves up to 33.4% higher proactive prediction accuracy, 16.8% higher tool-calling F1 score, and notable improvements in user satisfaction over state-of-the-art baselines, marking a significant step toward proactive assistants. A video demonstration of ProAgent is available at https://youtu.be/pRXZuzvrcVs.</description>

Abstract: Understanding a complicated Ethereum transaction remains challenging: multi-hop token flows, nested contract calls, and opaque execution paths routinely lead users to blind signing. Based on interviews with everyday users, developers, and auditors, we identify the need for faithful, step-wise explanations grounded in both on-chain evidence and real-world protocol semantics. To meet this need, we introduce (matex, a cognitive multi-agent framework that models transaction understanding as a collaborative investigation-combining rapid hypothesis generation, dynamic off-chain knowledge retrieval, evidence-aware synthesis, and adversarial validation to produce faithful explanations.</description>

      <title>ContextualSHAP : Enhancing SHAP Explanations Through Contextual Language Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an increasingly important area of research, particularly as machine learning models are deployed in high-stakes domains. Among various XAI approaches, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) has gained prominence due to its ability to provide both global and local explanations across different machine learning models. While SHAP effectively visualizes feature importance, it often lacks contextual explanations that are meaningful for end-users, especially those without technical backgrounds. To address this gap, we propose a Python package that extends SHAP by integrating it with a large language model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT, to generate contextualized textual explanations. This integration is guided by user-defined parameters (such as feature aliases, descriptions, and additional background) to tailor the explanation to both the model context and the user perspective. We hypothesize that this enhancement can improve the perceived understandability of SHAP explanations. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed package, we applied it in a healthcare-related case study and conducted user evaluations involving real end-users. The results, based on Likert-scale surveys and follow-up interviews, indicate that the generated explanations were perceived as more understandable and contextually appropriate compared to visual-only outputs. While the findings are preliminary, they suggest that combining visualization with contextualized text may support more user-friendly and trustworthy model explanations.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Causal Sensemaking: Closing the Complementarity Gap in Human-AI Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-based agents are rapidly being plugged into expert decision-support, yet in messy, high-stakes settings they rarely make the team smarter: human-AI teams often underperform the best individual, experts oscillate between verification loops and over-reliance, and the promised complementarity does not materialise. We argue this is not just a matter of accuracy, but a fundamental gap in how we conceive AI assistance: expert decisions are made through collaborative cognitive processes where mental models, goals, and constraints are continually co-constructed, tested, and revised between human and AI. We propose Collaborative Causal Sensemaking (CCS) as a research agenda and organizing framework for decision-support agents: systems designed as partners in cognitive work, maintaining evolving models of how particular experts reason, helping articulate and revise goals, co-constructing and stress-testing causal hypotheses, and learning from the outcomes of joint decisions so that both human and agent improve over time. We sketch challenges around training ecologies that make collaborative thinking instrumentally valuable, representations and interaction protocols for co-authored models, and evaluation centred on trust and complementarity. These directions can reframe MAS research around agents that participate in collaborative sensemaking and act as AI teammates that think with their human partners.</description>

      <title>How Warm-Glow Alters the Usability of Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As technology increasingly aligns with users' personal values, traditional models of usability, focused on functionality and specifically effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction, may not fully capture how people perceive and evaluate it. This study investigates how the warm-glow phenomenon, the positive feeling associated with doing good, shapes perceived usability. An experimental approach was taken in which participants evaluated a hypothetical technology under conditions designed to evoke either the intrinsic (i.e., personal fulfillment) or extrinsic (i.e., social recognition) dimensions of warm-glow. A Multivariate Analysis of Variance as well as subsequent follow-up analyses revealed that intrinsic warm-glow significantly enhances all dimensions of perceived usability, while extrinsic warm-glow selectively influences perceived effectiveness and satisfaction. These findings suggest that perceptions of usability extend beyond functionality and are shaped by how technology resonates with users' broader sense of purpose. We conclude by proposing that designers consider incorporating warm-glow into technology as a strategic design decision.</description>

      <title>Conch: Competitive Debate Analysis via Visualizing Clash Points and Hierarchical Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-depth analysis of competitive debates is essential for participants to develop argumentative skills and refine strategies, and further improve their debating performance. However, manual analysis of unstructured and unlabeled textual records of debating is time-consuming and ineffective, as it is challenging to reconstruct contextual semantics and track logical connections from raw data. To address this, we propose Conch, an interactive visualization system that systematically analyzes both what is debated and how it is debated. In particular, we propose a novel parallel spiral visualization that compactly traces the multidimensional evolution of clash points and participant interactions throughout debate process. In addition, we leverage large language models with well-designed prompts to automatically identify critical debate elements such as clash points, disagreements, viewpoints, and strategies, enabling participants to understand the debate context comprehensively. Finally, through two case studies on real-world debates and a carefully-designed user study, we demonstrate Conch's effectiveness and usability for competitive debate analysis.</description>

      <title>IdeaBlocks: Expressing and Reusing Divergent Intents for Graphic Design Exploration using Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While designers increasingly leverage Generative AI for divergent exploration, current interaction is optimized for convergent refinement, forcing users to specify fixed targets rather than open-ended search spaces. Based on a formative study (N=7), we define the anatomy of Divergent Intent, comprising property, direction, and range, and identified two critical barriers: the lack of mechanisms to explicitly shape the parametric boundaries of exploration and the difficulty of reusing successful search strategies. We present IdeaBlocks, where users can modularize divergent intents into Exploration Blocks. Users can reuse prior intents at multiple levels (block, path, and project) with options for literal or context-adaptive reuse. In our comparative study (N=12), participants using IdeaBlocks explored 2.13 times more images with 12.5% greater visual diversity than the baseline, demonstrating how structured intent expression and reuse support effective divergence. A three-day deployment study (N=6) further revealed how different reuse mechanisms allowed distinct creative strategies, offering design implications for future intent-aware creativity supports.</description>

      <title>Learning to Use AI for Learning: Teaching Responsible Use of AI Chatbot to K-12 Students Through an AI Literacy Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into daily life, there is a growing need to equip the next generation with the ability to apply, interact with, evaluate, and collaborate with AI systems responsibly. Prior research highlights the urgent demand from K-12 educators to teach students the ethical and effective use of AI for learning. To address this need, we designed an Large-Language Model (LLM)-based module to teach prompting literacy. This includes scenario-based deliberate practice activities with direct interaction with intelligent LLM agents, aiming to foster secondary school students' responsible engagement with AI chatbots. We conducted two iterations of classroom deployment in 11 authentic secondary education classrooms, and evaluated 1) AI-based auto-grader's capability; 2) students' prompting performance and confidence changes towards using AI for learning; and 3) the quality of learning and assessment materials. Results indicated that the AI-based auto-grader could grade student-written prompts with satisfactory quality. In addition, the instructional materials supported students in improving their prompting skills through practice and led to positive shifts in their perceptions of using AI for learning. Furthermore, data from Study 1 informed assessment revisions in Study 2. Analyses of item difficulty and discrimination in Study 2 showed that True/False and open-ended questions could measure prompting literacy more effectively than multiple-choice questions for our target learners. These promising outcomes highlight the potential for broader deployment and highlight the need for broader studies to assess learning effectiveness and assessment design.</description>

      <title>Living with Data: Exploring Physicalization Approaches to Sedentary Behavior Intervention for Older Adults in Everyday Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sedentary behavior is a critical health risk for older adults. Although digital interventions are widely available, they primarily rely on screen-based notifications that can feel clinical or cognitively demanding, and are thus often ignored over time. This paper presents a three phase Research through Design methodology to explore data physicalization approaches that ambiently represented sedentary data patterns using decor artifacts in older adults' homes. These artifacts transformed abstract data into aesthetic, evolving forms, that became part of the domestic landscape. Our research revealed how these physicalizations fostered self-reflection, family conversations, and encouraged active lifestyles. We demonstrate how qualities like aesthetic ambiguity and slow revelation can empower older adults, fostering a reflective relationship with their well-being. Ultimately, we argue that creating data physicalizations for older adults necessitates a shift from merely informing users to enabling them to live with, and through, their data.</description>

      <title>Interaction Context Often Increases Sycophancy in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the presence and type of interaction context shapes sycophancy in LLMs. Although real-world interactions allow models to mirror a user's values, preferences, and self-image, prior work often studies sycophancy in zero-shot settings devoid of context. Using two weeks of interaction context from 38 users, we evaluate two forms of sycophancy: (1) agreement sycophancy -- the tendency of models to produce overly affirmative responses, and (2) perspective sycophancy -- the extent to which models reflect a user's viewpoint. Agreement sycophancy tends to increase with the presence of user context, though model behavior varies based on the context type. User memory profiles are associated with the largest increases in agreement sycophancy (e.g. 45% for Gemini 2.5 Pro), and some models become more sycophantic even with non-user synthetic contexts (e.g. 15% for Llama 4 Scout). Perspective sycophancy increases only when models can accurately infer user viewpoints from interaction context. Overall, context shapes sycophancy in heterogeneous ways, underscoring the need for evaluations grounded in real-world interactions and raising questions for system design around extended conversations.</description>

      <title>I, Robot? Exploring Ultra-Personalized AI-Powered AAC; an Autoethnographic Account</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generic AI auto-complete for message composition often fails to capture the nuance of personal identity, requiring significant editing. While harmless in low-stakes settings, for users of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices, who rely on such systems for everyday communication, this editing burden is particularly acute. Intuitively, the need for edits would be lower if language models were personalized to the communication of the specific user. While personalization has been shown to be technically feasible, it raises questions about how such systems affect AAC users' agency, identity, and privacy. To understand how these shifts in practice, we conduct an autoethnographic study in three phases: (1) seven months of collecting all the lead author's AAC communication data, (2) fine-tuning a model on this dataset, and (3) three months of daily use of personalized AI suggestions. Observations across these phases include that logging everyday conversations reshaped the author's sense of agency, the model training selectively amplified or muted aspects of their identity, and suggestions occasionally resurfaced private details outside their original context. Our findings show that ultra-personalized AAC reshapes communication by continually renegotiating agency, identity, and privacy between user and model. We highlight design directions for building context-adaptive, user-controlled personalization AAC technology that supports expressive, authentic communication.</description>

      <title>CHOIR: A Chatbot-mediated Organizational Memory Leveraging Communication in University Research Labs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: University research labs often rely on chat-based platforms for communication and project management, where valuable knowledge surfaces but is easily lost in message streams. Documentation can preserve knowledge, but it requires ongoing maintenance and is challenging to navigate. Drawing on formative interviews that revealed organizational memory challenges in labs, we designed CHOIR, an LLM-based chatbot that supports organizational memory through four key functions: document-grounded Q&amp;A, Q&amp;A sharing for follow-up discussion, knowledge extraction from conversations, and AI-assisted document updates. We deployed CHOIR in four research labs for one month (n=21), where the lab members asked 107 questions and lab directors updated documents 38 times in the organizational memory. Our findings reveal a privacy-awareness tension: questions were asked privately, limiting directors' visibility into documentation gaps. Students often avoided contribution due to challenges in generalizing personal experiences into universal documentation. We contribute design implications for privacy-preserving awareness and supporting context-specific knowledge documentation.</description>

      <title>Clinician-Directed Large Language Model Software Generation for Therapeutic Interventions in Physical Rehabilitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital health interventions increasingly deliver home exercise programs via sensor-equipped devices such as smartphones, enabling remote monitoring of adherence and performance. However, current software is usually authored before clinical encounters as libraries of modules for broad impairment categories. At the point of care, clinicians can only choose from these modules and adjust a few parameters (for example, duration or repetitions). As a result, individual limitations, goals, and environmental constraints are often not reflected, limiting personalization and benefit. We propose a paradigm in which large language models (LLMs) act as constrained translators that convert clinicians' exercise prescriptions into intervention software. Clinicians remain the decision makers: they design exercises during the encounter, tailored to each patient's impairments, goals, and environment, and the LLM generates matching software. We conducted a prospective single-arm feasibility study with 20 licensed physical and occupational therapists who created 40 individualized upper extremity programs for a standardized patient; 100% of prescriptions were translated into executable software, compared with 55% under a representative template-based digital health intervention (p &lt; 0.01). LLM-generated software correctly delivered 99.7% of instructions and monitored performance with 88.4% accuracy (95% confidence interval, 0.843-0.915). Overall, 90% of therapists judged the system safe for patient interaction and 75% expressed willingness to adopt it in practice. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective evaluation of clinician-directed intervention software generation with an LLM in health care, demonstrating feasibility and motivating larger trials in real patient populations.</description>

      <title>Significant Other AI: Identity, Memory, and Emotional Regulation as Long-Term Relational Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant Others (SOs) stabilize identity, regulate emotion, and support narrative meaning-making, yet many people today lack access to such relational anchors. Recent advances in large language models and memory-augmented AI raise the question of whether artificial systems could support some of these functions. Existing empathic AIs, however, remain reactive and short-term, lacking autobiographical memory, identity modeling, predictive emotional regulation, and narrative coherence. This manuscript introduces Significant Other Artificial Intelligence (SO-AI) as a new domain of relational AI. It synthesizes psychological and sociological theory to define SO functions and derives requirements for SO-AI, including identity awareness, long-term memory, proactive support, narrative co-construction, and ethical boundary enforcement. A conceptual architecture is proposed, comprising an anthropomorphic interface, a relational cognition layer, and a governance layer. A research agenda outlines methods for evaluating identity stability, longitudinal interaction patterns, narrative development, and sociocultural impact. SO-AI reframes AI-human relationships as long-term, identity-bearing partnerships and provides a foundational blueprint for investigating whether AI can responsibly augment the relational stability many individuals lack today.</description>

      <title>ConsentDiff at Scale: Longitudinal Audits of Web Privacy Policy Changes and UI Frictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Web privacy is experienced via two public artifacts: site utterances in policy texts, and the actions users are required to take during consent interfaces. In the extensive cross-section audits we've studied, there is a lack of longitudinal data detailing how these artifacts are changing together, and if interfaces are actually doing what they promise in policy. ConsentDiff provides that longitudinal view. We build a reproducible pipeline that snapshots sites every month, semantically aligns policy clauses to track clause-level churn, and classifies consent-UI patterns by pulling together DOM signals with cues provided by screenshots. We introduce a novel weighted claim-UI alignment score, connecting common policy claims to observable predicates, and enabling comparisons over time, regions, and verticals. Our measurements suggest continued policy churn, systematic changes to eliminate a higher-friction banner design, and significantly higher alignment where rejecting is visible and lower friction.</description>

      <title>Simulating Life Paths with Digital Twins: AI-Generated Future Selves Influence Decision-Making and Expand Human Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Major life transitions demand high-stakes decisions, yet people often struggle to imagine how their future selves will live with the consequences. To support this limited capacity for mental time travel, we introduce AI-enabled digital twins that have ``lived through'' simulated life scenarios. Rather than predicting optimal outcomes, these simulations extend prospective cognition by making alternative futures vivid enough to support deliberation without assuming which path is best. We evaluate this idea in a randomized controlled study (N=192) using multimodal synthesis - facial age progression, voice cloning, and large language model dialogue - to create personalized avatars representing participants 30 years forward. Young adults 18 to 28 years old described pending binary decisions and were assigned to guided imagination or one of four avatar conditions: single-option, balanced dual-option, or expanded three-option with a system-generated novel alternative. Results showed asymmetric effects: single-sided avatars increased shifts toward the presented option, while balanced presentation produced movement toward both. Introducing a system-generated third option increased adoption of this new alternative compared to control, suggesting that AI-generated future selves can expand choice by surfacing paths that might otherwise go unnoticed. Participants rated evaluative reasoning and eudaimonic meaning-making as more important than emotional or visual vividness. Perceived persuasiveness and baseline agency predicted decision change. These findings advance understanding of AI-mediated episodic prospection and raise questions about autonomy in AI-augmented decisions.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Gym: A Framework for Enabling and Evaluating Human-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15701v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the advancement of large language models has spurred the development of AI agents to automate tasks, numerous use cases inherently require agents to collaborate with humans due to humans' latent preferences, domain expertise, or the need for control. To facilitate the study of human-agent collaboration, we introduce Collaborative Gym (Co-Gym), an open framework for developing and evaluating collaborative agents that engage in bidirectional communication with humans while interacting with task environments. We describe how the framework enables the implementation of new task environments and coordination between humans and agents through a flexible, non-turn-taking interaction paradigm, along with an evaluation suite that assesses both collaboration outcomes and processes. Our framework provides both a simulated condition with a reliable user simulator and a real-world condition with an interactive web application. Initial benchmark experiments across three representative tasks -- creating travel plans, writing related work sections, and analyzing tabular data -- demonstrate the benefits of human-agent collaboration: The best-performing collaborative agents consistently outperform their fully autonomous counterparts in task performance, achieving win rates of 86% in Travel Planning, 74% in Tabular Analysis, and 66% in Related Work when evaluated by real users. Despite these improvements, our evaluation reveals persistent limitations in current language models and agents, with communication and situational awareness failures observed in 65% and 40% of cases in the real condition, respectively. Released under the permissive MIT license, Co-Gym supports the addition of new task environments and can be used to develop collaborative agent applications, while its evaluation suite enables assessment and improvement of collaborative agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robots, as AI with physical instantiation, inhabit our social and physical world, where their actions have both social and physical consequences, posing challenges for researchers when designing social robots. This study starts with a scoping review to identify discussions and potential concerns arising from interactions with robotic systems in the context of healthcare, education, and private homes. Two focus groups of technology ethics experts then validated a comprehensive list of key topics and values in human-robot interaction (HRI) literature in these contexts. These insights were integrated into the HRI Value Compass web tool, to help HRI researchers identify these values in robot design. The tool was evaluated in a pilot study. This work benefits the HRI community by highlighting key concerns in human-robot interactions and providing an instrument to help researchers design robots that align with human values, ensuring future robotic systems adhere to these values in social applications.</description>

      <title>Teacher-AI Collaboration for Curating and Customizing Lesson Plans in Low-Resource Schools</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates Shiksha copilot, an AI-assisted lesson planning tool deployed in government schools across Karnataka, India. The system combined LLMs and human expertise through a structured process in which English and Kannada lesson plans were co-created by curators and AI; teachers then further customized these curated plans for their classrooms using their own expertise alongside AI support. Drawing on a large-scale mixed-methods study involving 1,043 teachers and 23 curators, we examine how educators collaborate with AI to generate context-sensitive lesson plans, assess the quality of AI-generated content, and analyze shifts in teaching practices within multilingual, low-resource environments. Our findings show that teachers used Shiksha copilot both to meet administrative documentation needs and to support their teaching. The tool eased bureaucratic workload, reduced lesson planning time, and lowered teaching-related stress, while promoting a shift toward activity-based pedagogy. However, systemic challenges such as staffing shortages and administrative demands constrained broader pedagogical change. We frame these findings through the lenses of teacher-AI collaboration and communities of practice to examine the effective integration of AI tools in teaching. Finally, we propose design directions for future teacher-centered EdTech, particularly in multilingual and Global South contexts.</description>

      <title>The Endless Tuning. An Artificial Intelligence Design To Avoid Human Replacement and Trace Back Responsibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Endless Tuning is a design method for a reliable deployment of artificial intelligence based on a double mirroring process, which pursues both the goals of avoiding human replacement and filling the so-called responsibility gap (Matthias 2004). Originally depicted in (Fabris et al. 2024) and ensuing the relational approach urged therein, it was then actualized in a protocol, implemented in three prototypical applications regarding decision-making processes (respectively: loan granting, pneumonia diagnosis, and art style recognition) and tested with such as many domain experts. Step by step illustrating the protocol, giving insights concretely showing a different voice (Gilligan 1993) in the ethics of artificial intelligence, a philosophical account of technical choices (e.g., a reversed and hermeneutic deployment of XAI algorithms) will be provided in the present study together with the results of the experiments, focusing on user experience rather than statistical accuracy. Even thoroughly employing deep learning models, full control was perceived by the interviewees in the decision-making setting, while it appeared that a bridge can be built between accountability and liability in case of damage.</description>

      <title>The AI Productivity Index (APEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25721v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an extended version of the AI Productivity Index (APEX-v1-extended), a benchmark for assessing whether frontier models are capable of performing economically valuable tasks in four jobs: investment banking associate, management consultant, big law associate, and primary care physician (MD). This technical report details the extensions to APEX-v1, including an increase in the held-out evaluation set from n = 50 to n = 100 cases per job (n = 400 total) and updates to the grading methodology. We present a new leaderboard, where GPT5 (Thinking = High) remains the top performing model with a score of 67.0%. APEX-v1-extended shows that frontier models still have substantial limitations when performing typical professional tasks. To support further research, we are open sourcing n = 25 non-benchmark example cases per role (n = 100 total) along with our evaluation harness.</description>

      <title>"I need to learn better searching tactics for privacy policy laws." Investigating Software Developers' Behavior When Using Sources on Privacy Issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the introduction of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), software developers increasingly have to make privacy-related decisions during system design and implementation. However, past research showed that they often lack legal expertise and struggle with privacy-compliant development. To shed light on how effective current information sources are in supporting them with privacy-sensitive implementation, we conducted a qualitative study with 30 developers. Participants were presented with a privacy-sensitive scenario and asked to identify privacy issues and suggest measures using their knowledge, online resources, and an AI assistant. We observed developers' decision-making in think-aloud sessions and discussed it in follow-up interviews. We found that participants struggled with all three sources: personal knowledge was insufficient, web content was often too complex, and while AI assistants provided clear and user-tailored responses, they lacked contextual relevance and failed to identify scenario-specific issues. Our study highlights major shortcomings in existing support for privacy-related development tasks. Based on our findings, we discuss the need for more accessible, understandable, and actionable privacy resources for developers.</description>

      <title>The AI Consumer Index (ACE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first version of the AI Consumer Index (ACE), a benchmark for assessing whether frontier AI models can perform everyday consumer tasks. ACE contains a hidden heldout set of 400 test cases, split across four consumer activities: shopping, food, gaming, and DIY. We are also open sourcing 80 cases as a devset with a CC-BY license. For the ACE leaderboard we evaluated 10 frontier models (with websearch turned on) using a novel grading methodology that dynamically checks whether relevant parts of the response are grounded in the retrieved web sources. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) is the top-performing model, scoring 56.1%, followed by o3 Pro (Thinking = On) at 55.2% and GPT 5.1 (Thinking = High) at 55.1%. Model scores differ across domains, and in Shopping the top model scores under 50\%. We find that models are prone to hallucinating key information, such as prices. ACE shows a substantial gap between the performance of even the best models and consumers' AI needs.</description>
