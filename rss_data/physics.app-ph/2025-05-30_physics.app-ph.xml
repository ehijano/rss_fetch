      <title>Observation of dispersion anomalies by design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Band structures encode electronic, optical, and acoustic properties of matter and can serve as an essential tool in material discovery and design. Dispersion anomalies -- sharp, non-standard features in the frequency-wavenumber relation -- have been historically correlated with phonon-electron coupling or long-range interaction. Through a combination of experimental, numerical, and analytical methods, we show how magnetic couplings can induce negative stiffness and sculpt dispersion relations to support zero-frequency phonon anomalies at arbitrary, non-zero wavenumbers. Our approach enables the realization of complete wavenumber band gaps without time-modulation, electron-phonon coupling, or long-range interactions. We identify the conditions under which non-differentiable zero-frequency phonons exist away from the high-symmetry points. Our framework generalizes across monoatomic and diatomic lattices, locally resonant metamaterials, non-local systems, as well as higher dimensional crystals. In addition, we report the first passive- or active- experimental observation of wavenumber band gaps in higher dimensions. Our work establishes a new paradigm in dispersion engineering and provides means for understanding wave-matter interaction in both the frequency and wavenumber domains.</description>

      <title>Parametric Instability in Discrete Models of Spatiotemporally Modulated Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of parametric instability in discrete models of spatiotemporally modulated materials. These materials are celebrated in part because they exhibit nonreciprocal transmission characteristics. However, parametric instability may occur for strong modulations, or occasionally even at very small modulation amplitudes, and prevent the safe operation of spatiotemporally modulated devices due to an exponential growth in the response amplitude. We use Floquet theory to conduct a detailed computational investigation of parametric instability. We explore the roles of modulation parameters (frequency, amplitude, wavenumber), the number of modulated units, and damping on the stability of the system. We highlight the pivotal role of spatial modulation in parametric instability, a feature that is predominantly overlooked in this context. We use the perturbation method to obtain analytical expressions for modulation frequencies at which the response becomes unstable. We hope that our findings enable and inspire new applications of spatiotemporally modulated materials that operate at higher amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Integrated phononic waveguide on thin-film lithium niobate on diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate wavelength-scale phononic waveguides formed by transfer-printed thin-film lithium niobate (LN) on bulk diamond (LNOD), a material stack that combines the strong piezoelectricity of LN with the high acoustic velocity and color-center compatibility of diamond. We characterize a delay line based on a 100 micron long phononic waveguide at room and cryogenic temperatures. The total insertion loss through the device at 4 kelvin is -5.8 dB, corresponding to a &gt;50% transducer efficiency, at a frequency of 2.8 gigahertz. Our work represents a step towards phonon-mediated hybrid quantum systems consisting of strain-sensitive color centers in diamond.</description>

      <title>Record-high-Q AMTIR-1 microresonators for mid- to long-wave infrared nonlinear photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AMTIR-1 chalcogenide glass has shown its potential for use in thermal imaging systems owing to its low refractive index, thermal resistance and high transparency across the infrared wavelength regime. Here we report a millimeter-scale high-Q whispering gallery mode microresonator made of AMTIR-1. The recorded Q-factor has reached $1.2\times10^7$ at 1550~nm, which is almost two-orders of magnitude higher than previously reported values. We characterize the thermal properties, where low thermal conductivity plays an important role in thermal resonance tuning. We further show that AMTIR-1 resonators support anomalous dispersion as well as a low absorption coefficient near the 7~\textmu m wavelength band, thus offering the possibility of providing suitable platforms for mid-infrared, long-wave infrared nonlinear optics including microresonator frequency comb generation.</description>

      <title>Low-loss, fabrication-tolerant, and highly-tunable Sagnac loop reflectors and Fabry-P\'erot cavities on thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present low-loss ($&lt;1.5\%$) and power-efficient Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) on thin-film lithium niobate. To accurately measure low MZI losses, we develop a self-calibrated method using tunable Sagnac loop reflectors (SLRs) to build cavities. Fabry-P\'erot cavities constructed from these fabrication-tolerant SLRs achieve an intrinsic quality factor of $2 \times 10^6$. By implementing thermal isolation trenches, we also demonstrate a $&gt;10\times$ reduction in power consumption for thermo-optic phase shifters, achieving a $\pi$-phase shift ($P_\pi$) with just 2.5 mW. These tunable and efficient components are key for scaling up to complex photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Periodic Optical Key-Enabled Hybrid Cryptography: Merging Diffractive Physics and Deep Learning for High-Dimensional Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical encryption inherently provides strong security advantages, with hybrid optoelectronic systems offering additional degrees of freedom by integrating optical and algorithmic domains. However, existing optical encryption schemes heavily rely on electronic computation, limiting overall efficiency, while the physical keys are susceptible to damage, compromising both security and system stability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Quasi Periodic Optical Key (QPOK), which combines long range order with short range disorder, enabling enhanced security and robustness against damage within a single platform. By leveraging diffraction symmetry, our design enables optics-driven encryption, effectively shifting the optoelectronic balance toward photonic processing. Moreover, we innovatively apply deep learning to reconstruct the complex optical ciphertext field using only amplitude data and cryptographic keys, simultaneously achieving data compression and improved security. Within this framework, the key space includes continuously tunable parameters such as wavelength, propagation distance, phase modulation, and Q-POK geometry, significantly expanding cryptographic diversity. Our system also demonstrates robust cryptographic reliability by reducing inter-class distances by over 50% and tolerating up to 20% ciphertext loss. Our framework represents a new generation of physically grounded, algorithmically enhanced optical cryptosystems, laying a foundational pathway for scalable, hardware-integrated information security paradigms.</description>

      <title>Localized surface plasmons in a Weyl semimetal nanosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the localized surface plasmon modes of a sub-wavelength spherical nanoparticle composed of a Weyl semimetal, taking into account the axion modification of electrodynamics. We derive analytical solutions for dipole and quadrupole normal modes by employing the quasistatic approximation. The axion term leads to modified Fr\"ohlich conditions, resulting in multiple non-degenerate plasmonic resonances with distinct polarization dependencies. In contrast to isotropic conventional metals, the magnetoelectric properties of Weyl semimetals enable an incident electromagnetic field, with the electric field transverse to the surface of the sphere, to excite a localized surface plasmon.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of electric power generation from Earth's rotation through its own magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth rotates through the axisymmetric part of its own magnetic field, but a simple proof shows that it is impossible to use this to generate electricity in a conductor rotating with Earth.However, we previously identified implicit assumptions underlying this proof and showed theoretically that these could be violated and the proof circumvented. This requires using a soft magnetic material with a topology satisfying a particular mathematical condition and a composition and scale favoring magnetic diffusion, i.e. having a low magnetic Reynolds number Rm (C.F. Chyba, K.P. Hand, Electric power generation from Earth's rotation through its own magnetic field. Phys. Rev. Applied 6, 014017-1-18 (2016)). Here we realize these requirements with a cylindrical shell of manganese-zinc ferrite. Controlling for thermoelectric and other potentially confounding effects (including 60 Hz and RF background), we show that this small demonstration system generates a continuous DC voltage and current of the (low) predicted magnitude. We test and verify other predictions of the theory: voltage and current peak when the cylindrical shell's long axis is orthogonal to both Earth's rotational velocity v and magnetic field; voltage and current go to zero when the entire apparatus (cylindrical shell together with current leads and multimeters) is rotated 90 degrees to orient the shell parallel to v; voltage and current again reach a maximum but of opposite sign when the apparatus is rotated a further 90 degrees; an otherwise-identical solid MnZn cylinder generates zero voltage at all orientations; and a highRm cylindrical shell produces zero voltage. We also reproduce the effect at a second experimental location. The purpose of these experiments was to test the existence of the predicted effect. Ways in which this effect might be scaled to generate higher voltage and current may now be investigated.</description>

Abstract: Rydberg Atomic REceiver (RARE) is driving a paradigm shift in electromagnetic (EM) wave measurement by harnessing the electron transition phenomenon of Rydberg atoms. Operating at the quantum scale, such receivers have the potential to breakthrough the performance limit of classic receivers, sparking a revolution in physical-layer wireless communications. The objective of this paper is to offer insights into RARE-empowered communications. We first provide a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of RAREs. Then, a thorough comparison between RAREs and classic receivers is conducted in terms of the antenna size, sensitivity, and bandwidth. Subsequently, we overview the recent progresses in RARE-aided wireless communications, covering the frequency-division multiplexing, multiple-input-multiple-output, wireless sensing, and quantum many-body techniques. Moreover, the unique application of RARE in multiband sensing and communication is introduced. Finally, we conclude by providing promising research directions.</description>

      <title>Modelling of time-dependent electrostatic effects and AFM-based surface conductivity characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) combined with electrical modes provides a powerful contactless approach to characterize material electrical properties at the nanoscale. However, conventional electrostatic models often overlook dynamic charge effects, which are particularly relevant for 2D materials deposited on insulating substrates. In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework that extends traditional electrostatic models by incorporating charge dynamics, analyzing two key cases: quasi-ideal conductors and quasi-ideal insulators. Our model establishes a characteristic timescale, $\tau$, which governs charge redistribution and measurement reliability. Experimental validation using Graphene Oxide, Reduced Graphene Oxide, and lightly reduced GO demonstrates strong dependence of frequency shift on surface conductivity, confirming our predictions. Temperature-dependent measurements further reveal conductivity variations consistent with disordered electronic materials. These findings provide critical insight into the impact of finite surface conductivity on AFM-based techniques and establish a novel method for evaluating charge dynamics in individual flakes of 2D materials and propose an alternative, contactless method for estimating surface conductivity.</description>
