      <title>On the effects of radiation on mass transfer in binary stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass transfer (MT) in binary systems is a common evolutionary process that can significantly affect the structure, evolution, and final fate of both stars. In modeling MT hydrodynamics, it is usually assumed that the critical point of the flow, where the velocity exceeds the local sound speed, coincides with the inner Lagrange point (L1). However, in massive donors, radiative pressure dominates over gas pressure and the Eddington factor $\Gamma_\text{Edd}$ can reach or exceed unity. If there is significant momentum and/or energy exchange between gas and radiation, the critical point of the flow can shift away from L1, affecting the MT rate ($\dot{M}_\text{d}$). Here, we investigate the effects of radiation on MT using time-steady radiative hydrodynamic equations and the assumption of the von Zeipel theorem. We provide analytical expressions that closely approximate $\dot{M}_\text{d}$ and numerical solutions using a realistic equation of state. We find two main differences with respect to the traditional expressions for $\dot{M}_\text{d}$. First, for Roche-lobe-underfilling donors with $\Gamma_\text{Edd} \lesssim 1$, radiative momentum exchange leads to an exponential increase of $\dot{M}_\text{d}$ as a function of $1-\Gamma_\text{Edd}$. We provide a simple modification of existing prescriptions that takes this effect into account. Second, we find that the photon tiring limit for super-Eddington outflows is much less restrictive near L1 than in spherical stars. We suggest that donors with super-Eddington convectively inefficient subsurface layers are able to drive MT with $-\dot{M}_\text{d} \gtrsim 10^{-2}\,\text{M}_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ even before overfilling their Roche lobes. We characterize the conditions for this new mode of super-Eddington-boosted MT and discuss the implications for binary evolution including the potential link to nonterminal outbursts of Luminous Blue Variables.</description>

      <title>First JWST/NIRSpec Spectroscopy of O Stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining how much mass is removed by stellar winds is crucial to understanding massive star evolution and feedback. However, traditional spectroscopic diagnostics in the UV and optical are not sensitive enough to characterize weak stellar winds of OB stars in low-metallicity environments. A new tool to access weak stellar winds is provided by spectroscopy in the infrared (IR). Stellar atmosphere models indicate that the hydrogen Br$\alpha$ line at $\lambda$\,4.05\,$\mu$m is a useful mass-loss rate indicator, particularly at low metallicity. The unprecedented capabilities of the NIRSpec spectrograph on board of the \emph{James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) allow us to measure this line in spectra of massive stars in other galaxies. In this work, we present the first NIRSpec spectra of O-type stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), which has a metallicity of only 20\% Solar. Our sample consists of thirteen stars with spectral types ranging from O2 to O9.5 including supergiants, giants, and dwarfs. The stars belong to NGC\,346, the most massive young cluster in the SMC. We describe the observing strategy and data reduction, highlighting the treatment of the nebular background emission. The spectra cover the 2.8--5.1 $\mu$m wavelength range, and we detect the Br$\alpha$ line in emission in each of our sample stars. Using a combination of spectral and photometric data ranging from the UV to the IR, we improve the measurements of stellar luminosity and reddening. A first qualitative comparison of the observed Br$\alpha$ line with stellar atmosphere models shows its potential as a wind diagnostic for weak-winded stars.</description>

      <title>Was there a (super)nova in 1408?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1408 CE "guest star" recorded in Chinese historical texts presents a compelling case for identifying a historical stellar transient. While previous studies debated its nature as a meteor, comet, or nova, we re-evaluate the event using original Ming Dynasty records, including a newly found memorial from the imperial court. The object, described as stationary for over ten days, yellow, and luminous (resembling a "Zhou Bo virtue star"), is inconsistent with cometary behavior. Positional analysis locates it near the Niandao asterism (modern Cygnus-Vulpecula region) within the Milky Way, with a derived brightness of -4 to 0 mag. Light-curve stability over ten days and color descriptions align with a slow nova or a supernova. We cross-correlated the historical coordinates with modern catalogs and found a few possible counterparts. Among them, CK Vul - a luminous red nova remnant from 1670 to 1672 - is the most interesting candidate. Could its progenitor system have experienced a precursor classical nova eruption circa 1408 prior to the merger ~200 years later? We also examine cataclysmic variables and planetary nebulae within the 100 square-degree search field, though most lack sufficient brightness or age characteristics. This study emphasizes the value of integrating detailed historical records with contemporary astrophysical data to resolve long-standing controversies over ancient transients. The 1408 event likely represents a rare, well-documented nova, offering insights into pre-modern stellar phenomena and their modern counterparts.</description>

      <title>Investigating Variations in Solar Differential Rotation by Helioseismology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helioseismic signatures of dynamo waves have recently been discovered in variations of the solar differential rotation, offering valuable insights into the type of dynamo mechanism operating in the solar convection zone. To characterize these variations, we analyze p-mode frequency-splitting data estimated using time intervals of various lengths to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in inversions of zonal flows. We introduce a novel time-dependent inversion method that inherently smooths the solution over time, eliminating the need for separate post-processing smoothing. By applying this approach to observational data from the SOHO Michelson Doppler Imager, SDO Helioseismic Magnetic Imager, and Global Oscillation Network Group, we identify similar dynamo wave patterns in both the zonal acceleration and the zonal flow throughout the entire convection zone. Our analysis shows that while using longer time series smooths out temporal variations, the fundamental features observed in the short time series (i.e. 72-day long) persist when inverting datasets covering different time periods. These findings reinforce earlier detections and offer further validation of solar dynamo models. We additionally investigate the dimensionless radial gradient of rotation. Its value is close to -1 and increases in the deeper layers, remaining nearly constant from the equator to mid-latitudes within the depth range of 13 to 35 Mm below the surface; the results at high latitudes remain somewhat inconclusive. The variation of this quantity displays a torsional oscillation-like pattern, albeit with certain differences.</description>

      <title>Spectral Biases, Starspot Morphology, and Dynamo Transitions on the Pre-Main Sequence: Insights from the X-Shooter WTTS Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starspots are ubiquitous in young, low mass stars, yet their impact on the spectral classification and fundamental parameter inference of pre main sequence stars has been largely overlooked. In this study, we demonstrate that cool starspots systematically distort spectral morphology and bias derived effective temperatures, surface gravities, and luminosities in non accreting Weak Lined T Tauri Stars (WTTS). Using a sample of 56 WTTS with high resolution, broad band X-Shooter spectra, we perform two temperature spectral fits that explicitly account for spot coverage and temperature contrast. These composite models consistently outperform traditional single temperature fits, particularly in the 3350 4000 K regime, where spot contributions dominate the red optical and near infrared flux. Moreover, we propose that surface gravity discrepancies between optical and infrared measurements are a natural consequence of spot dominated emission in PMS stars that is accentuated by observational uncertainty. We find that single temperature models can overestimate effective temperatures by up to 700 K and underestimate log g by 1-2 dex. Using spot-corrected effective temperatures, we derive masses and ages from traditional, magnetic, and spotted evolutionary models, finding that spot corrections systematically raise inferred masses by up to 80 percent and stellar ages by up to 0.5 dex. These discrepancies are strongest for stars in the 0.3 to 0.8 solar mass range. Using starspots as a proxy for magnetic topology, we find evidence that a shift from largely axisymmetric to non axisymmetric magnetic fields dominated by small scale structures coincides with the formation of a radiative core during the pre main sequence, effectively separating convective and interface dynamo regimes.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Jetlets Associated with the Disappearance of a Satellite Spot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent small-scale eruptions are fascinating phenomena in the solar atmosphere. However, their underlying physical mechanisms remain unclear. On 2021 May 23, five recurrent jetlets (J1-J5) were observed continuously ejecting from a satellite spot located at the north edge of AR 12824. Using high-resolution, multi-wavelength data from NVST, SDO, and IRIS, we investigate the physical characteristics of these jetlets and their relationship with the satellite spot. The widths of these jetlets range from 1300 to 2900 km, their lifetimes range span 3 to 10 minutes, and their projection speeds vary from 152.8 to 406.0 km s$^{-1}$. During the eruptions, the satellite spot moved northwest at a low speed of 376 $\pm$ 12 m s$^{-1}$. Its area gradually decreased due to magnetic cancellation with surrounding positive magnetic field, resulting in an average cancellation rate of 1.3$\times$10$^{18}$ Mx hr$^{-1}$. Dark lanes that separated from the satellite spot and small pores were observed to move toward nearby these features or dark lanes with opposite polarities, eventually disappearing during the magnetic cancellation process. J4 was driven by an eruption of a micro-filament. Spectral observations revealed a redshift on the right side of J4 and a blueshift on the left side of its base, suggesting a counterclockwise rotation. The horizontal magnetic field of the satellite spot consistently exhibited a vortex structure throughout its evolution until it vanished. The nonlinear force-free field extrapolation confirms that the satellite spot serves as one footpoint of a mini-flux rope. These observations reveal that these jetlets might result from three-dimensional null-point magnetic reconnection, initiated by the continuous eruption of a mini-flux-rope or multiple mini-flux-ropes, driven by sustained magnetic cancellation.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the intensity of the nonwave component of EUV waves on coronal magnetic field configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Mounting evidence has shown that EUV waves consist of a fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave (or shock wave) followed by a slower nonwave component, as predicted by the magnetic fieldline stretching model. However, not all observed events display both wavefronts, particularly the slower nonwave component. Even in case that the slower nonwave component is present, the intensity distribution often exhibits strong anisotropy.
  Aims. This study is intended to unveil the formation condition of the slower nonwave component of EUV waves. Methods. We analyzed the EUV wave event on 8 March 2019, and compared the EUV wave intensity map with the extrapolation coronal potential magnetic field. Data-inspired MHD simulation was also performed.
  Results. Two types of EUV waves are identified, and the slower nonwave component exhibits strong anisotropy. By reconstructing 3D coronal magnetic fields, we found that the slower nonwave component of EUV waves is more pronounced in the regions where magnetic fields are backward-inclined, which is further reproduced by our MHD simulations.
  Conclusions. The anisotropy of the slower nonwave component of EUV waves is strongly related to the magnetic configuration, with backward-inclined field lines favoring their appearance. The more the field lines are forward-inclined, the weaker such wavelike fronts are.</description>

      <title>On the Magnetic Reconnection and its Properties during a Flare Using a Magnetohydrodynamics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the magnetic reconnection during a flare by investigating flare ribbon dynamics using observations and data-constrained magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation. In particular, we estimate the reconnection flux and the reconnection flux rates using flare ribbons of an M1.1 flare hosted by the active region 12184 utilizing the technique developed by Qiu et al. (2002, ApJ, 565, 1335). The reconnection flux and corresponding flux rates are found to be 10^20 Mx and 10^18 Mx/s respectively. To understand the flare onset and the origin of flare ribbons, we perform an MHD simulation initiated by the non-force-free-field extrapolation. Importantly, the extrapolated configuration identifies a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic neutral point and a flux rope in the flaring region, which is crucial to the flaring activity. The reconnection initiates at the null point and, subsequently the flux rope rises and appears to reconnect there, which is favorable for the eruption of the filament. The surrounding field lines also seem to take part in the null point reconnection. In later stage, a current sheet is formed below the null point ensuing a secondary reconnection near an X-type topology, further contributing to the energy release process in the flare. We trace the footpoint evolution of the field lines lying over the flare ribbons and find a significant similarity between the observed flare ribbons and the evolution of footpoints computed from the MHD simulation. We estimated induced electric field during the flare and found it to be $\approx$ .52 V/cm, a slight less value, as per many past literatures. Additional findings are the enhancement of vertical current density near the flaring ribbons, a signature of successive reconnections near the null point. Overall, the present work contributes to the understanding of the ribbon formation in a flaring process and the involved magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Th/Eu abundance ratio of red giants in the Kepler Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The r-process production in the early universe has been well constrained by the extensive studies of metal-poor stars. However, the r-process enrichment in the metal-rich regime is still not well understood. In this study, we examine the abundance ratios of Th and Eu, which represent the actinides and lanthanides, respectively, for a sample of metal-rich disk stars. Our sample covers 89 giant stars in the Kepler field with metallicities $-0.7 \leq \rm{[Fe/H]} \leq 0.4$ and ages from a few hundred Myr to $\sim 14$ Gyr. Age information for this sample is available from stellar seismology, which is essential for studying the radioactive element Th. We derive Th and Eu abundances through $\chi^2$ fitting of high-resolution archival spectra ($R \sim 80,000$) observed with the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) at the Subaru Telescope. We create synthetic spectra for individual stars using a 1D LTE spectral synthesis code, Turbospectrum, adopting MARCS model atmospheres. Our study establishes the use of a less extensively studied Th II line at 5989 angstrom, carefully taking into account the blends of other spectral lines to derive the Th abundance. We successfully determine Eu abundance for 89 stars in our sample and Th for 81 stars. For the remaining 8 stars, we estimate the upper limits of Th abundance. After correcting the Th abundance for the decay, we find no correlation between $\rm{[Th/Eu]}$ and $\rm{[Fe/H]}$, which indicates that actinides production with respect to lanthanides does not depend on metallicity. On the other hand, we find a positive correlation of $\rm{[Th/Eu]}$ with age, with a slope of $0.10 \pm 0.04$. This may hint at the possibility that the dominant r-process sources are different between the early and late universe.</description>

      <title>APE: An analytical protostellar environment to provide physical conditions to chemical models and synthetic observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical modeling and synthetic observations are powerful methods to interpret observations, both requiring a knowledge of the physical conditions. In this paper, we present the Analytical Protostellar Environment (APE) code, which aims at making chemical simulations and synthetic observations accessible. APE contains a physical model of protostellar evolution (including the central object, the envelope, the protoplanetary disk and the outflow) as well as interfaces to publicly available codes to perform chemical simulations, radiative transfer calculations, and synthetic interferometry imaging. APE produces density and temperature maps of protostellar systems. The code can also follow individual particles throughout their journey in a collapsing core. APE includes a treatment of the dust grain size-distribution to compute opacities self-consistently for subsequent radiative transfer. We show an example of application of APE by computing chemical abundance maps of CO, CN, CS, H2CO, and CH3OH in a Class I protostellar system. We also performed synthetic ALMA observations of their molecular emission assuming an edge-on source inclination. The moment 0 maps of CO, CS, and H2CO display an X-shaped emission similar to what is observed toward the Class I source IRAS 04302+2247.</description>

      <title>A magnetic field detection in the massive O-type bright giant 63 Oph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface magnetic fields are detected in less than $10\%$ of the massive O-type star population and even less frequently among `old' massive stars approaching the terminal-age main sequence (TAMS). It is unclear to what extent the rarity of magnetic detections in massive stars near the TAMS is due to magnetic field decay or observational biases. We report the detection of a weak surface magnetic field in the O-type giant 63~Oph ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}=35.0\pm0.3\,$kK, $\log g=3.51\pm0.03$) from new ESPaDOnS circularly polarized spectra. The mean longitudinal field strength associated with the magnetic detection is $\langle B_{z}\rangle=84\pm14\,$G, which we use to set a lower limit on the dipolar field strength of $B_{\mathrm{p}}\geq300\pm50\,$G. We report Balmer line equivalent widths (EW) and radial velocity (RV) measurements from the analysis of spectra primarily obtained by the IACOB project with the FEROS, FIES and HERMES spectrographs. We identify a dominant period of $\sim19.8\,$d in the EWs which we attribute to the effects of a rotating magnetosphere under the Oblique Rotator Model. We do not identify any coherent signals in a time-series analysis of archival Hipparcos, ASAS-SN and K2 photometry. Our findings show that 63~Oph may be a rare link between strongly magnetic massive stars detected on or near the zero-age main sequence and weakly-magnetic O-type supergiants. Additional observations are needed to fully constrain 63~Oph's magnetic field geometry and magnetospheric properties.</description>

Abstract: We present a newly appreciated FU Ori outburst event that began in 2019 and reached a peak in early 2021. Suspected young stellar object WISE J054452.25+333009.6 experienced substantial brightening, in excess of $-5$ mag at optical wavelengths and $-2.5$ mag at mid-infrared wavelengths. The time from near-quiescence to peak brightness was approximately 24 months. Optical and near-infrared spectra confirm that the outbursting source (hereby designated FUOr-Aur 0544+3330) shows all the hallmarks of the FU Ori class, including the Li I indicator of stellar youth. The mix of ionized and neutral atomic lines, alongside prominent molecular absorption features, is consistent with the expected change in spectral type from earlier in the optical to later-type in the near-infrared. The closest analog among well-studied FU Ori objects is V1515 Cyg. Both sources have unusually narrow-lined absorption spectra that can be explained by a face-on disk orientation, such that disk-broadening is minimized and wind-induced blueshift (in e.g. H$\alpha$, NaD, Ca II) is maximized. Both the optical through infrared spectral energy distribution and high-resolution spectrum are well-fit by a pure-accretion disk model. Adopting a distance of $d=1.5$ kpc, the accretion and central star parameters are: $\dot{M} = 10^{-5.48}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, $M_* = 0.17 \ M_\odot$, and $R_\mathrm{inner} = 1.04 \ R_\odot$. Other fitted values are disk inclination $i=5.9$ deg and source extinction $A_V=1.83$ mag. These parameters yield accretion luminosity $L_\mathrm{acc} = 8.4\ L_\odot$ and maximum disk temperature $T_{\rm{max}} = 6218$ K.</description>

Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is poised to revolutionize our scientific understanding of exoplanets, dark matter, dark energy, and general astrophysics, including through an innovative community approach to defining and executing sky surveys. The Roman Observations Time Allocation Committee (ROTAC) was convened to recommend time allocations for the three Core Community Surveys (CCS) using the Wide Field Instrument (WFI): the High Latitude Wide Area Survey, the High Latitude Time Domain Survey, and the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey, as well as balance the time allocation for the General Astrophysics Surveys. Each CCS had a corresponding Definition Committee that collected community input and designed proposals for a nominal (in-guide) survey, as well as underguide and overguide options with smaller and larger time allocations, respectively. These options explored different ways of fulfilling the mission science requirements while maximizing general astrophysics science goals enabled by the surveys. In this report, the ROTAC lays out its recommendations for the three CCS observing designs and the WFI time allotment for CCS (74.5%) and the General Astrophysics Surveys (25.5%).</description>

      <title>Mass Transfer in Tidally Heated Stars Orbiting Massive Black Holes and Implications for Repeating Nuclear Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of stars orbiting close to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can be dramatically modified by tidal heating, which can in principle dissipate an energy much larger than the stellar binding energy. We use analytic models and MESA to explore the coupled dynamics of tidal heating, stellar structural evolution, orbital decay due to gravitational waves and tides, and mass transfer due to Roche lobe overflow. In contrast to more equal mass stellar binaries, the stable mass transfer rate for stars orbiting SMBHs is typically set by the tidal heating timescale (the timescale for tides to increase the stellar radius), not by the gravitational wave orbital decay timescale. The resulting stable mass transfer rate is sensitive to the tidal heating model but is plausibly $\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-5} M_\odot {\, \rm yr^{-1}}$ (and perhaps larger), sufficient to produce low-luminosity active galactic nuclei in many galaxies. The stability of mass transfer is sensitive to where in the stellar interior the tidal energy is dissipated. MESA models confirm the expected result that mass transfer is unstable (stable) if tidal heating increases (decreases) the fraction of the star that is convective. More detailed conclusions about the stability of mass-transfer will require self-consistently calculating how the tidal heating of stars changes in response to internal structural changes produced by the tidal heating itself. Stars with tidal heating-induced mass transfer can produce a large population of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei; they may also be the progenitors of some partial tidal disruption candidates (e.g., ASASSN-14ko) as well as short period quasi-periodic eruptions (e.g., eRO-QPE2 and GSN 069). However, many repeating nuclear transients produced by tidal heating-induced mass loss are likely fainter than those detected thus far, and remain to be discovered.</description>

      <title>The DESI Y1 RR Lyrae catalog II: The metallicity dependency of pulsational properties, the shape of the RR Lyrae instability strip, and metal rich RR Lyrae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) are valuable probes of both Milky Way assembly and stellar-evolution physics. Using a sample 6,240 RRLs obtained in the first year of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, we investigate the metallicity of RRLs and its correlation with their pulsation properties. We find that (1) a clear correlation between period and [Fe/H] reinforces the view that the longstanding Oosterhoff dichotomy arises from the scarcity of intermediate-metallicity Galactic globular clusters hosting sizeable RRL samples; (2) high-amplitude short-period and small-amplitude short-period variables are comparatively metal-rich, with mean [Fe/H] = $-1.39 \pm 0.27$ and $-1.30 \pm 0.28$, respectively; (3) in double-mode pulsators (RRd) the metallicity declines smoothly with increasing fundamental-mode period, and anomalous RRd stars occupy a remarkably narrow [Fe/H] range relative to classical RRd stars; (4) this spectroscopic sample let us, for the first time, place empirical constraints on the metallicity-dependent topology of the instability strip using phase-corrected effective temperatures and a large number of RRLs, where we observe an instability strip that moves towards cooler Teff with declining [Fe/H] with a width consistent with stellar-evolution models; and (5) a subset of metal-rich RRLs exhibits orbits consistent with disk membership and halo kinematics. Our results confirm the tantalizing potential of DESI for Galactic and stellar astrophysics and highlight the importance of the even larger samples of RRLs and data-processing improvements forthcoming in future DESI data releases.</description>

      <title>A Cosmic Miracle: A Remarkably Luminous Galaxy at $z_{\rm{spec}}=14.44$ Confirmed with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a stunning population of bright galaxies at surprisingly early epochs, $z&gt;10$, where few such sources were expected. Here we present the most distant example of this class yet -- MoM-z14, a luminous ($M_{\rm{UV}}=-20.2$) source in the COSMOS legacy field at $z_{\rm{spec}}=14.44^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ that expands the observational frontier to a mere 280 million years after the Big Bang. The redshift is confirmed with NIRSpec/prism spectroscopy through a sharp Lyman-$\alpha$ break and $\approx3\sigma$ detections of five rest-UV emission lines. The number density of bright $z_{\rm{spec}}\approx14-15$ sources implied by our "Mirage or Miracle" survey spanning $\approx350$ arcmin$^{2}$ is $&gt;100\times$ larger ($182^{+329}_{-105}\times$) than pre-JWST consensus models. The high EWs of UV lines (${\approx}15{-}35$ \AA) signal a rising star-formation history, with a ${\approx}10\times$ increase in the last 5 Myr ($\rm{SFR_{\rm{5Myr}}}/\rm{SFR_{\rm{50Myr}}}=9.9^{+3.0}_{-5.8}$). The source is extremely compact (circularized $r_{\rm{e}} = 74^{+15}_{-12}$ pc), and yet resolved, suggesting an AGN is not the dominant source of light. The steep UV slope ($\beta=-2.5^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$) implies negligible dust attenuation and a young stellar population. The absence of a strong damping wing may indicate that the immediate surroundings of MoM-z14 are partially ionized at a redshift where virtually every reionization model predicts a $\approx100\%$ neutral fraction. The nitrogen emission and highly super-solar [N/C]$&gt;1$ hint at an abundance pattern similar to local globular clusters that may have once hosted luminous supermassive stars. Since this abundance pattern is also common among the most ancient stars born in the Milky Way, we may be directly witnessing the formation of such stars in dense clusters, connecting galaxy evolution across the entire sweep of cosmic time.</description>

      <title>The DBL Survey I: discovery of 34 double-lined double white dwarf binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first discoveries of the double-lined double white dwarf (DBL) survey that targets over-luminous sources with respect to the canonical white dwarf cooling sequence according to a set of well-defined criteria. The primary goal of the DBL survey is to identify compact double white dwarf binary star systems from a unique spectral detection of both stars, which then enables a precise quantification of the atmospheric parameters and radial velocity variability of a system. Our search of 117 candidates that were randomly selected from a magnitude limited sample of 399 yielded a 29% detection efficiency with 34 systems exhibiting a double-lined signature. A further 38 systems show strong evidence of being single-lined or potentially-double-lined double white dwarf binaries and 7 single-lined sources from the full observed sample are radial velocity variable. The 45 remaining candidates appear as a single WD with no companion or a non-DA white dwarf, bringing the efficiency of detecting binaries to 62%. Atmospheric fitting of all double-lined systems reveals a large fraction that have two similar mass components that combine to a total mass of 1.0-1.3 solar masses - a class of double white dwarf binaries that may undergo a sub-Chandrasekhar mass type Ia detonation or merge to form a massive O/Ne WD, although orbital periods are required to infer on which timescales. One double-lined system located 49pc away, WDJ181058.67+311940.94, is super-Chandrasekhar mass, making it the second such double white dwarf binary to be discovered.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty of magnetic field in 3D NLTE inversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe our approach to solve the problem of ensuring the solenoidality of the magnetic field vector in three-dimensional (3D) inversions, as well as the estimation of the uncertainty in the inferred magnetic field. The solenoidality of the magnetic field vector is often disregarded in the inversion of spectropolarimetric data due to limitations in the traditional one-dimensional inversion techniques. We propose a method to ensure the solenoidal condition in 3D inversions based on our meshfree approach. The increase in dimensionality with respect to the 1D inversion techniques is such that some of the traditional methods to determine the uncertainties become unfeasible. We propose a method based on a Monte Carlo approach to determine the uncertainty of the magnetic field inference. Due to the physics of the problem, we can compute the uncertainty increasing the total required computational time by just a factor of about two. We also propose a metric to quantify the uncertainty to describe the degree of confidence of the magnetic field inference. Finally, we perform a numerical experiment to demonstrate the feasibility of both the method and the metric proposed to quantify the uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Population III star formation in the presence of turbulence, magnetic fields and ionizing radiation feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence, magnetic fields and radiation feedback are key components that shape the formation of stars, especially in the metal-free environments at high redshifts where Population III stars form. Yet no 3D numerical simulations exist that simultaneously take all of these into account. We present the first suite of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of Population III star formation using the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code FLASH as part of the POPSICLE project. We include both turbulent magnetic fields and ionizing radiation feedback coupled to primordial chemistry, and resolve the collapse of primordial clouds down to few au. We find that dynamically strong magnetic fields significantly slow down accretion onto protostars, while ionizing feedback, as expected, is largely unable to weaken gas accretion at early times. This is because the partially ionized H II region gets trapped near the star due to insufficient radiative outputs from the star. The maximum stellar mass in the HD and RHD simulations that only yield one star exceeds $100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ within the first $5000\,\rm{yr}$. However, in the corresponding MHD and RMHD runs, the maximum mass of Population III stars is only $60\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$. In other realizations where we observe widespread fragmentation leading to the formation of Population III star clusters, the maximum stellar mass is further reduced by a factor of few due to fragmentation-induced starvation. We thus show that magnetic fields are more important than ionizing feedback in regulating the mass of the star during the earliest stages of Population III star formation.</description>

      <title>Jet-shaped filamentary ejecta in common envelope evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations of common envelope evolution (CEE) of a neutron star (NS) that launches jets as it spirals in inside the envelope of a rotating red supergiant (RSG) stellar envelope and find that Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities form filamentary ejecta. We first study the 3D RSG envelope properties before we launch the jets. Adding envelope rotation causes the RSG envelope to expand in the equatorial plane and contract along the poles, leading to non-radial oscillations that decay after two oscillation periods, like the radial oscillation of the non-rotating model. In addition, the envelope becomes convective with large vortices, as in the non-rotating case. Since RSG stars oscillate and have envelope convection, we strengthen the claim that there is no need to relax one-dimensional stellar models of cool giant stars when transporting them to 3D grids. When adding jets, the 3D simulations that include pre-set envelope rotation show that envelope rotation leads to more prominent spiral structures of the ejecta than in the non-rotating case. We map the envelope zones that are Rayleigh-Taylor unstable and conclude that this instability forms the filamentary ejecta, with and without envelope rotation. The jet-inflated high-pressure volumes around the NS accelerate the envelope, a process prone to Rayleigh-Taylor instability.</description>

      <title>Light curves and spectra for stellar collisions between main-sequence stars in galactic nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05265v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-velocity stellar collisions in galactic nuclei produce ejecta that generate potentially observable electromagnetic radiation, making them promising nuclear transients. However, the photometric and spectroscopic properties of these collisions, which would more frequently involve main-sequence stars, remain largely unexplored. Here, using 3D hydrodynamics and 1D radiative-transfer simulations, we investigate the properties and observables of the debris produced in high-velocity collisions between terminal-age main-sequence stars, covering a wide range of collision configurations. The ejecta produce bright ultraviolet (UV) flares with bolometric luminosities typically peaking at $\gtrsim10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, declining steeply as $t^{-2}-t^{-4}$ to reach $\gtrsim10^{41}-10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 0.5 d and leveling off on a plateau at $10^{39}-10^{41.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($M_V$ between $-$10 to $-$15 mag) after a few days. Their spectra evolve considerably during the first few days, morphing from UV- to optical-dominated. The UV range shows numerous resonance transitions from metals like C, N, and O, whereas the optical primarily shows H I Balmer lines. These properties are qualitatively similar to those observed, as well as obtained in models of Type II supernovae. Observables from these events exhibit clear correlations with collision configurations, including impact parameter, relative velocity, and stellar masses. We provide fitting formulae to describe these correlations. Detecting these flares requires sub-day cadence surveys such as ULTRASAT, combined with spectroscopic observations to disentangle degeneracies and infer collision characteristics.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of solar neutrinos confirmed that the inner workings of the Sun generally match our theoretical understanding of the fusion process. Solar neutrinos have also played a role in discovering that neutrinos have mass and that they oscillate. We combine the latest solar neutrino data along with other oscillation data from reactors to determine the Sun's density profile. We derive constraints given the current data and show the anticipated improvements with more reactor neutrino data from JUNO constraining the true oscillation parameters and more solar neutrino data from DUNE which should provide a crucial measurement of $hep$ neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. The analysis is restricted to orbits confined to the reflection-symmetric plane of the spheroidal configuration. Focusing on the internal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to average density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By analyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e., the Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic oscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\pi$. In contrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in both prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with the guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation effects. The results indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.</description>

      <title>The Use of Binary Black Holes Merging in AGN Disks for Hubble Constant Measurements</title>

Abstract: We study the impact of environmental effects on the measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) from gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary black hole mergers residing in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) near the central supermassive black hole. Using the potential hierarchical triple merger candidate GW190514-GW190521 in AGN J124942.3+344929 with its electromagnetic counterpart ZTF19abanrhr as a multimessenger case study, we demonstrate that environmental effects can be negligible for mergers at approximately tens to hundreds of Schwarzschild radii from the supermassive black hole. We find $H_0=40.9_{-8.9}^{+19.3}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ (median and 68\% credible interval) under a flat prior and flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Incorporating GW170817 prior information improves constraints to $H_0=68.8_{-6.0}^{+7.7}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. We suggest that in general, AGN environments could serve as viable laboratories for cosmological studies from GW observations where environmental effects remain below detection thresholds.</description>

      <title>A fundamental limit to how close binary systems can get via stable mass transfer shapes the properties of binary black hole mergers</title>

Abstract: Mass transfer in binary systems is the key process in the formation of various classes of objects, including merging binary black holes (BBHs) and neutron stars. Orbital evolution during mass transfer depends on how much mass is accreted and how much angular momentum is lost $-$ two of the main uncertainties in binary evolution. Here, we demonstrate that, despite these unknowns, a fundamental limit exists to how close binary systems can get via stable mass transfer (SMT), that is robust against uncertainties in orbital evolution. Based on detailed evolutionary models of interacting systems with a BH accretor and a massive star companion, we show that the post-interaction orbit is always wider than $\sim10R_{\odot}$, even with extreme shrinkage due to L2 outflows. Systems evolving towards tighter orbits become unstable and result in stellar mergers. This separation limit has direct implications for the properties of BBH mergers: long delay times ($\gtrsim1 \rm Gyr$), and no high BH spins from the tidal spin-up of helium stars. At high metallicity, the SMT channel may be severely quenched due to Wolf-Rayet winds. The reason for the separation limit lies in the stellar structure, not in binary physics. If the orbit gets too narrow during mass transfer, a dynamical instability is triggered by a rapid expansion of the remaining donor envelope due to its near-flat entropy profile. The closest separations can be achieved from core-He burning ($\sim8-15R_{\odot}$) and Main Sequence donors ($\sim15-30R_{\odot}$), while Hertzsprung Gap donors lead to wider orbits ($\gtrsim30-50R_{\odot}$) and non-merging BBHs. These outcomes and mass transfer stability are governed by the internal composition profiles of donor stars. Thus, the formation of compact binaries is a sensitive probe of chemical mixing in stars. We propose a simple treatment of mass transfer stability to reproduce the detailed results.</description>
