      <title>A Solow-Swan framework for economic growth with memory effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solow-Swan equation is a cornerstone in the development of modern economic growth theory and continues to attract significant scholarly attention. This study incorporates memory effects into the classical Solow-Swan model by introducing a formulation based on the Caputo fractional derivative. A comparative analysis is conducted between the integer-order and fractional-order versions of the model to examine the influence of fractional dynamics on capital accumulation. The findings reveal that the inclusion of a fractional-order derivative significantly affects the trajectory and long-term stability of capital, offering a more flexible and comprehensive framework for modeling economic growth processes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Evidence of Investor Heterogeneity: Retail Cash Flows as Drivers of Market Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study measures the long memory of investor-segregated cash flows within the Korean equity market from 2015 to 2024. Applying detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to BUY, SELL, and NET aggregates, we estimate the Hurst exponent ($H$) using both a static specification and a 250-day rolling window. All series exhibit heavy tails, with complementary cumulative distribution exponents ranging from approximately 2 to 3. As a control, time-shuffled series yield $H \approx 0.5$, confirming that the observed persistence originates from the temporal structure rather than the distributional shape. Our analysis documents long-range dependence and reveals a clear ranking of persistence across investor types. Persistence is strongest for retail BUY and SELL flows, intermediate for institutional flows, and lowest for foreign investor flows. For NET flows, however, this persistence diminishes for retail and institutional investors but remains elevated for foreign investors. The rolling $H$ exhibits clear regime sensitivity, with significant level shifts occurring around key events: the 2018--2019 tariff episode, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the period of disinflation from November 2022 to October 2024. Furthermore, regressions of daily volatility on the rolling $H$ produce positive and statistically significant coefficients for most investor groups. Notably, the $H$ of retail NET flows demonstrates predictive power for future volatility, a characteristic not found in institutional NET flows. These findings challenge the canonical noise-trader versus informed-trader dichotomy, offering a model-light, replicable diagnostic for assessing investor persistence and its regime shifts.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic, Signals-Based Reinterpretation of Microeconomic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Economics has long been a science of static equilibria, in which time is a second-order rather than first-order concern. Without time, economic modelers may neglect or obscure the role of time-dependent phenomena, e.g. path-dependency, and limit their ability to compare agnostically the model results with empirical observations. In this article, I outline a dynamic, signals-based recipe for building microeconomic models from traditional static models. I demonstrate this recipe using a classic "desert island" Robinson Crusoe (RC) model of consumption. Starting from a classic static derivation, I then move to a dynamic view, using the utility function as a generator of force on consumption. Finally, I show that the resulting dynamic model may be expressed in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian terms. I conclude by suggesting a recipe for scientific iteration using these alternate mechanical formulations, and the alternative explanations these dynamic models may suggest compared to employing a static approach to modeling.</description>
