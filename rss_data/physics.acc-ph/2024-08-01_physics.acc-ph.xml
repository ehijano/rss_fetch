      <title>Preparing Fermilab to Carry Out the P5 Plan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past several years, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) has suffered a number of troublesome setbacks. In some cases, failures to respond effectively have only made things worse, resulting in the current crisis atmosphere at the laboratory. This is reflected in part in the poorly rated performance appraisals (or PEMP) that the DOE provides to the lab every year. Three entities are currently responsible for supporting, managing, operating, and leading the lab: the Department of Energy (DOE), Fermi Research Alliance (FRA), and the Laboratory Director Office. Two recent events provide opportunities for interested parties to reverse the recent decline: the release in December 2023 of the P5 Report and the DOE decision to rebid the Management &amp; Operating (M&amp;O) contract. The P5 Report a decadal update of recommendations for US particle physics, includes an ambitious and positive roadmap for projects and activities at Fermilab. Carrying out the P5 plan successfully, however, will also require addressing many of the other problems currently besetting the lab. The selection of a new M&amp;O contractor is under the responsibility of the Deputy Director for Operations of the DOE Office of Science Dr. Juston Fontaine. A new M&amp;O Contractor would replace FRA and name a new Director effective January 1, 2025. A new management team, one hopes, would be motivated to solve problems and would enjoy a honeymoon period, enabling them to make positive changes more easily. Stimulated by these recent developments, the authors of this document, all present or past employees, convened confidentially in order to collect testimonials on a series of events symptomatic of the lab problems, to provide constructive criticism and offer possible solutions. This document summarizes this work.</description>

      <title>cDVAE: Multimodal Generative Conditional Diffusion Guided by Variational Autoencoder Latent Embedding for Virtual 6D Phase Space Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaging the 6D phase space of a beam in a particle accelerator in a single shot is currently impossible. Single shot beam measurements only exist for certain 2D beam projections and these methods are destructive. A virtual diagnostic that can generate an accurate prediction of a beam's 6D phase space would be incredibly useful for precisely controlling the beam. In this work, a generative conditional diffusion-based approach to creating a virtual diagnostic of all 15 unique 2D projections of a beam's 6D phase space is developed. The diffusion process is guided by a combination of scalar parameters and images that are converted to low-dimensional latent vector representation by a variational autoencoder (VAE). We demonstrate that conditional diffusion guided by VAE (cDVAE) can accurately reconstruct all 15 of the unique 2D projections of a charge particle beam's 6 phase space for the HiRES compact accelerator.</description>
