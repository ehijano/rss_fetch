      <title>Limits of the Superconformal Index and the Moduli Space of 3d $\mathcal{N}=3$ Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the Hilbert series of three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=3$ quiver gauge theories by taking a specific limit of the superconformal index. Our approach introduces auxiliary fugacities associated with symmetries which, while not present in the full theory, arise as effective symmetries on specific branches of the moduli space. By evaluating the index in a limit governed by these parameters, we successfully isolate the Hilbert series of the desired branches. We validate our results against the literature and provide several new extensions. We focus primarily on linear and circular quivers with unitary gauge groups, which originate from Type IIB brane configurations involving generic $(p,q)$ fivebranes. We further generalise this approach to star-shaped and orthosymplectic $\mathcal{N}=3$ quivers. Finally, we investigate the geometric branches of affine Dynkin quivers, demonstrating agreement with known results, while offering new predictions for unexplored cases.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric orbifolds with vanishing one-loop vacuum energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of non-supersymmetric type II toroidal asymmetric orbifolds with vanishing vacuum energy at one-loop in string perturbation theory. These are engineered through the conservation of a supercharge-like operator in each individual sector in the orbifold sum, despite the overall explicit breaking of spacetime SUSY. We provide a full classification of such orbifolds with finite Abelian point-group, which can only admit $\mathbb{Z}_k \times \mathbb{Z}_k$ point group with $k=2,3,4$. We present detailed constructions, alongside other examples with non-Abelian point group. For some of these models, it is possible that this cancellation persists at higher loops.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the orthogonal Grassmannian as a novel kinematic space for describing correlators of massless spinning fields in de Sitter space. By automatically encoding the constraints of conformal symmetry and current conservation, the formalism drastically simplifies these correlators. We show that three-point functions are fixed by little group covariance and take the same form as the corresponding Schwinger-parameterized correlators in twistor space. The power of the Grassmannian approach is especially evident for four-point functions, which require dynamical input beyond kinematics. We demonstrate that unitarity enforces the same factorization properties as for scattering amplitudes and use these to bootstrap the four-point functions in several non-trivial examples, including Yang-Mills theory. We find expressions that are astonishingly simple and reveal a close connection to the corresponding scattering amplitudes. Our results suggest that the Grassmannian provides the natural language for spinning correlators in de Sitter space and illuminates their geometric origin.</description>

      <title>Computational quantum field theory for fermion pair creation in 2-dimensional curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similarly to the well-known phenomenon of particle / anti-particle pair production in strong electromagnetic fields (the Schwinger effect), the na\"ive matter field vacuum state can be excited by time-dependent, curved spacetime geometries. This gravitational pair creation corresponds to tunnelling out of a false vacuum. In this work, we study this non-perturbative process using a spacetime resolved numerical approach in the interaction picture. To achieve this, we extend the framework of Computational Quantum Field Theory (CQFT), which allows for efficient numerical time evolution of quantum fields, to spin-$1/2$ fermions in curved spacetime.
  Using this extended framework, we investigate vacuum excitation of a Dirac field induced by a spacetime-curvature quench. In particular, we evolve the fermionic Minkowski vacuum in a $1\!+\!1$-dimensional idealized curved spacetime characterized by a localized ``curvature bump'' generated by a smooth, localized Gaussian deformation of flat spacetime. Vacuum excitation is quantified by computing the fermion--antifermion pair numbers defined with respect to the basis corresponding to flat-spacetime (Minkowski) which is the asymptotic metric corresponding to an observor at infinity.
  We analyze how the excitation depends on the strength and spatial extent of the curvature deformation and discuss the numerical implementation of CQFT in curved backgrounds. While the post-quench geometry considered here is static and no electromagnetic field is included, the present work establishes a foundation for future investigations of particle creation in genuinely time-dependent curved spacetimes and in the presence of electromagnetic backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Probing holographic conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an operational, boundary-first framework that embeds relativistic quantum-information protocols into anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) by coupling an Unruh--DeWitt detector directly to a local scalar primary operator of a holographic CFT. Using the universal CFT Wightman function, we compute the detector's reduced density operator perturbatively, retaining both excitation probabilities and coherences. As a concrete resource-theoretic application, we implement magic resource (mana) harvesting with a qutrit probe. For a CFT dual to global AdS, we show that the harvested mana sharply distinguishes the two admissible scalar quantizations in the Breitenlohner--Freedman window, with the standard quantization yielding systematically larger mana than the alternate one. Our results provide a viable way of testing holography principle through quantum information resource.</description>

      <title>Cancellation of one-parameter graviton gauge dependence in the effective scalar field equation in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate gauge dependence of one-graviton-loop corrections to the effective field equation of the massless, minimally coupled scalar in de Sitter, obtained by including source and observer corrections to the effective self-mass correcting the equation. Using the $\Delta\alpha$ variation of the de Sitter-breaking graviton propagator in a one-parameter family of gauges, we compute the gauge-dependent contributions to the effective self-mass of a massless minimally coupled scalar mediating interactions between heavy scalars. We show that gauge dependence cancels provided the contributions from all diagram classes are collected, including one-loop corrections to external mode functions, which play a qualitatively new role relative to flat space. The resulting cancellation supports the construction of graviton gauge-independent cosmological quantum-gravitational observables from quantum-corrected effective equations.</description>

      <title>Holographic information measures for spin-$3/2$ $\Delta$ baryons in AdS/QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-$3/2$ $\Delta$ baryon resonances are investigated within AdS/QCD, using Rarita-Schwinger fields. The differential configurational entropy (DCE) and differential configurational complexity (DCC) associated with their bulk energy densities are computed. It yields Regge-like trajectories relating configurational information measures to the radial excitation number and the experimental mass spectrum of the $\Delta$ baryons. We then extrapolate the spectrum of heavier $\Delta$ baryon resonances beyond currently established states in the PDG, also comparing them with states in PDG omitted from the summary table. Our results support a relevant interplay among holographic QCD dynamics, configurational information entropy, and baryon spectroscopy in strongly coupled QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate stationary, non-axisymmetric black hole solutions in AdS$_3$ gravity, known as black flower geometries, in the Chern-Simons formulation. Boundary conditions are specified by a collective field theory-inspired Hamiltonian with field-dependent chemical potentials and angularly inhomogeneous boundary data. We construct a tractable class of solutions and analyze their geometric and thermodynamic properties, obtaining an entropy with nontrivial dependence on the angular deformation. Upon quantization of the boundary theory via bosonization, the boundary degrees of freedom are mapped to relativistic free fermions. We explicitly construct and count the microstates associated with a given black flower geometry and find exact agreement with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.</description>

      <title>Escape of quantum information across an analogue black hole horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complete evaporation of black holes, as a natural endpoint of Hawking radiation, gives rise to the black hole information paradox, which fundamentally challenges the principles of unitarity and information conservation in quantum mechanics. Although the AdS/CFT correspondence indicates that information is preserved during black hole evaporation, the precise mechanism by which it is recovered from the Hawking radiation remains an open question. To explore a potential resolution, we investigate information transfer in an analog black hole spacetime realized through position-dependent coupling in an XY spin chain. We derive and demonstrate Page curve-like behavior, and analyze the transmission of quantum resources, such as entanglement and coherence, across the effective horizon. Our results show that quantum resources initially localized within an interior subsystem can be transferred to the exterior via particle radiation through the horizon. This study provides a novel perspective from quantum simulation on how information may escape from black holes, thereby contributing to the further understanding of the black hole information paradox.</description>

      <title>Beyond Wigner: Non-Invertible Symmetries Preserve Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the traditional notion of symmetry in quantum theory was expanded to so-called generalised or categorical symmetries, which, unlike ordinary group symmetries, may be non-invertible. This appears to be at odds with Wigner's theorem, which requires quantum symmetries to be implemented by (anti)unitary -- and hence invertible -- operators in order to preserve probabilities. We resolve this puzzle for (higher) fusion category symmetries $\mathcal{C}$ by proposing that, instead of acting by unitary operators on a fixed Hilbert space, symmetry defects in $\mathcal{C}$ act as isometries between distinct Hilbert spaces constructed from twisted sectors. As a result, we find that non-invertible symmetries naturally act as trace-preserving quantum channels. Crucially, our construction relies on the symmetry category $\mathcal{C}$ being unitary. We illustrate our proposal through several examples that include Tambara-Yamagami, Fibonacci, and Yang-Lee as well as higher categorical symmetries.</description>

      <title>Entanglement harvesting in conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study entanglement harvesting in general $d$-dimensional conformal field theories using pointlike Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled to scalar primary operators. This extends standard harvesting protocols beyond free fields to interacting conformal theories and arbitrary spatial dimensions. We find that increasing the operator scaling dimension suppresses both negativity and mutual information, reflecting the faster decay of correlations. For holographic CFTs, we show that bulk effective field theory enables a separation between field-harvested and communication-mediated entanglement. We also derive asymptotic, closed-form approximations that agree well with numerical results.</description>

      <title>Neutron Stars as Perfect Fluids: Extracting the Linearized Response Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the general relativistic linear tidal response of a neutron star modeled as a barotropic perfect fluid. From the covariant fluid effective action, we linearize about equilibrium and obtain the action for fluid displacements coupled to metric perturbations. Splitting the latter into external and induced parts and integrating out the induced field yields a Hermitian operator and a discrete gapped spectrum of driven modes. Projecting the displacement onto this eigenbasis and integrating out the spatial dependence over the stellar radius reduces the dynamics to tidal-driven oscillators, with couplings set by relativistic inner products and overlap integrals. Matching to the quadrupolar worldline effective action gives a mode-sum response function and analytic dynamical tidal deformabilities from mode frequencies, normalizations, and overlaps.</description>

      <title>The effects of boundary conditions on Rindler's spectral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rindler's metric is an interesting way to incorporate a set of uniformly accelerated observers into space-time coordinates; this is consistent with special and general relativity. It is known that such an acceleration gives rise to the famous Unruh effect. Interestingly, its Galilean limit already shows the appearance of quantized modes for particles in free space, given by Airy functions. This happens when a wall or boundary condition is moving in an accelerated trajectory in free space and in the presence of a field. Here we show that such a boundary, when viewed as a material obstacle in motion, gives rise to quantized modes for the Klein-Gordon and Maxwell fields, as long as the boundary does not touch the singularity at the Rindler wedge. This corresponds to a quantum-mechanical problem with an anomalous fall-to-the-origin potential $-1/x^2$ supplemented with a Dirichlet condition. We provide further mathematical analysis regarding the completeness of the solutions in terms of Hankel functions $H^{(1)}$ of imaginary index and argument, and clarify the nature of the corresponding Sobolev spaces when the boundary condition disappears for the accelerated observer. A detailed interpretation of the transition amplitudes is given in connection with particle production obtained from a Bogoliubov transformation.</description>

      <title>Can Dirac neutrinos destabilize $\mathcal{Z}_2$ domain wall network?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In particle physics model building, a discrete $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry is often spontaneously broken for phenomenological reasons. When this breaking occurs dynamically in the early Universe, stable domain wall networks are formed, which can eventually dominate the cosmic energy density. To avoid this problem, explicit $\mathcal{Z}_2$-breaking terms in the scalar potential are usually introduced in an ad hoc manner. In this Letter, we show that if the same $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry is also responsible for generating light Dirac neutrino masses, such explicit breaking terms can instead arise radiatively from the particles involved in the Dirac mass generation. We find that the resulting bias term scales inversely with the cube of the Dirac neutrino mass, leading to a gravitational wave spectrum proportional to the sixth power of the Dirac neutrino mass. This establishes a nontrivial connection between the Dirac seesaw scale, the domain wall annihilation epoch, and the resulting stochastic gravitational wave signal. We further demonstrate that a wide range of Dirac seesaw scales can be probed by upcoming gravitational wave and cosmic microwave background experiments, while part of the parameter space simultaneously explains the observed baryon asymmetry via Dirac leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>A gravitationally induced decoherence model for photons in the context of the relational formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a model of gravitationally induced decoherence for photons starting from Maxwell theory coupled to linearised gravity, expressed in terms of Ashtekar-Barbero variables and treated as an open quantum field theoretic system. In contrast to quantum mechanical models, the interaction between the system (Maxwell field) and the environment (gravitational field) is not postulated phenomenologically, but is instead dictated by the underlying action in a post-Minkowskian approximation. This framework extends earlier models for a scalar field and enables a more detailed analysis of the role of dynamical reference fields (clocks) within the relational formalism. We show that, for a suitable choice of geometrical clocks together with a U(1)-Gauss clock, and by employing an appropriate combination of the observable map and its dual, the resulting Dirac observables are given directly by the transverse components of the photon field as well as the symmetric-transverse-traceless degrees of freedom of gravitational waves on the linearised phase space of the coupled system. In addition we also compare different choices of Dirac observables and their dynamics. Upon applying a Fock quantisation to the reduced system, we derive the time convolutionless (TCL) master equation, truncated at second order, and analyse its structural properties. These results provide a foundation for further investigations of the decoherence model, including its renormalisation and a detailed study of its one-particle sector, and are found to be structurally consistent with former master equations for photons derived using ADM variables and a specific gauge fixing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review some results and techniques from our papers devoted to the computation of motivic classes of stacks of parabolic Higgs budles and bundles with connections on a curve. In the last section we present some directions for future work, as well as some speculations. The latter include a generalization of the P=W conjecture inspired by the work of Maxim Kontsevich and the third author on the Riemann--Hilbert correspondence for complex symplectic manifolds as well as our running project on the motivic classes of the moduli stacks of nilpotent pairs on the formal disk and geometric Satake correspondence for double affine Grassmannians.</description>

      <title>Geodesic Structure, Thermodynamics and Scalar Perturbations of Mod(A)Max black hole Surrounded by Perfect Fluid Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the optical properties of a spherically symmetric Mod(A)Max black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter, focusing on key features such as the photon sphere radius, shadow, photon trajectories, and the effective radial force experienced by photons. We also study the dynamics of massive particles around the black hole, deriving the effective potential and, from it, the specific energy and angular momentum of particles moving in circular orbits of fixed radii is discussed. The conditions for marginally stable circular orbits are analyzed, highlighting how the geometric parameters that modify the spacetime curvature influence both the optical and dynamical features. Furthermore, we explore the thermodynamic behavior of the black hole by examining its temperature, Gibbs free energy, and heat capacity, as well as its thermodynamic topology. Finally, scalar field perturbations are considered through the massless Klein-Gordon equation, and the quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the eikonal regime are computed, illustrating how the geometric parameters affect the potential and the QNM spectra.</description>

      <title>Quantum Evolution of Hopf Algebra Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, growing attention has been devoted to the possibility that theories with deformed symmetries, associated with certain models of non-commutative spacetime, may encode a fundamental form of decoherence. This effect should be described by a Lindblad-like evolution governed by the non-trivial Hopf algebra structure of the time-evolution generators. In this work we provide a detailed analysis of such possibility for similar Hopf algebra deformations of the Hamiltonian of a qubit. Starting from a critical examination of the very definition of time evolution through the generalized adjoint action, we explore whether a coherent and physically viable framework can be established. In particular, our analysis shows that a more general combination of adjoint actions always guarantees a von Neumann dynamics and, also in the case of deformed spacetime symmetries considered in the literature, a physically viable Lindblad evolution cannot be established.</description>

      <title>Vafa-Witten invariants from wall-crossing for framed sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the refined $\mathrm{SU}(r)$ Vafa-Witten partition function of a smooth projective surface with non-zero holomorphic 2-form. This partition function has a vertical contribution, expressible in terms of nested Hilbert schemes.
  First, we write the vertical contribution in terms of $\chi_y$-genera of moduli spaces of framed sheaves on ${\mathbb P}^2$.
  Then, we state two wall-crossing identities for moduli spaces of framed sheaves: a blow-up formula due to Kuhn-Leigh-Tanaka and a new stable/co-stable wall-crossing formula. We prove the latter using the theory of mixed Hodge modules.
  We apply these identities to obtain constraints on Vafa-Witten invariants predicted by conjectures of G\"ottsche and the second- and third-named authors. For $r=2$, we obtain a proof of the vertical part of a celebrated formula by Vafa-Witten.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Corrections to Scrambling Dynamics in Brownian Spin SYK Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate operator growth in a Brownian spin Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model with random all-to-all interactions, focusing on the full operator-size distribution. For Hamiltonians containing interactions of order two up to $L$, we derive a closed master equation for the Pauli-string expansion coefficients and recast their dynamics into a generating-function formulation suitable for the large-$N$ limit. This approach allows us to diagonalize the leading-order evolution operator explicitly and obtain exact solutions for arbitrary initial operator distributions, including the effects of decoherence. Going beyond leading order, we develop a systematic $1/N$ expansion that captures higher-order corrections to the operator-size dynamics and the late-time behavior. Our results demonstrate that higher-order effects play a crucial role in operator scrambling and that the full operator-size distribution provides a more refined probe of quantum chaos in Brownian and open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Self-resonance preheating in deformed attractor models: oscillon formation and evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that, in potentials that are quadratic near the minimum but shallower away, such as small-$\alpha$ ($\ll M_P^2$) attractors, the inflaton condensate fragments into localized compact objects known as oscillons during self-resonance preheating. In this work we investigate the self-resonance in deformed $\alpha$-attractor T-model with a Gaussian feature near the minimum, distant from inflation's end. Linear analysis reveals altered resonance bands and deformed Floquet charts dependent on feature parameters. In fully nonlinear lattice simulations, we find that the gradient energy transfer is largely independent of the potential feature parameter $h$. In contrast, after resonance terminates, the subsequent evolution of gradient energy becomes strongly dependent on $h$. Statistical analysis reveals that models with the potential feature produce larger number of smaller oscillons, with a reduced energy stored in these objects, increasingly suppressed as the magnitude of $h$ grows. By tracking the total energy and the gradient energy contained in oscillons, we find that in models with nonzero $h$ oscillons are systematically shorter-lived, with this effect strengthening for larger $h$. The gravitational wave emission is dominated by the resonance stage and is strongly suppressed once oscillons form. Potential features leave the low-frequency spectrum largely unchanged but significantly modify the high-frequency tail. Although a complete reheating description requires external couplings and higher-resolution simulations, clear qualitative differences of cosmic expansion history already emerge within our simulated time window. These results highlight the important role of potential features in shaping reheating dynamics and their cosmological implications, and provide a deeper understanding of preheating dynamics and the properties of oscillons.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the classical elliptic Toda chain introduced by Krichever and the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Toda chain introduced by Adler, Shabat and Suris. It is shown that these models can be obtained as particular cases of the elliptic Ruijsenaars chain. We explain how the classical $r$-matrix structures are derived for these chains. Also, as a by-product, we prove that the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Toda chain is gauge equivalent to discrete Landau-Lifshitz model of XYZ type. The elliptic Toda chain is also gauge equivalent to XYZ chain with special values of the Casimir functions at each site.</description>

Abstract: We study modularity properties of generating series of logarithmic Gromov-Witten invariants of elliptic fibrations relative to singular fibers. Motivated by predictions from Vafa-Witten theory, we conjecture that such generating series are mock modular forms. We prove this conjecture for a large class of invariants of the rational elliptic surface mirror to $\mathbb{P}^2$, relative to a cycle of nine rational curves. The proof uses a correspondence between log Gromov-Witten invariants of the mirror and Vafa-Witten invariants of $\mathbb{P}^2$ established in previous work joint with Bousseau, together with known mock modularity results on the Vafa-Witten side.</description>

      <title>Variational Method for Interacting Surfaces with Higher-Form Global Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a variational method for interacting surface systems with higher-form global symmetries. As a natural extension of the conventional second-quantized Hamiltonian of interacting bosons, we explicitly construct a second-quantized Hamiltonian formulated in terms of a closed surface operator $\hat{\phi}[C_p^{}]$ charged under a $p$-form global symmetry. Applying the variational principle, we derive a functional Schr\"{o}dinger equation analogous to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in conventional bosonic systems. In the absence of external forces, the variational equation admits a uniform solution that is uniquely determined by a microscopic interaction potential $U(\psi^*\psi)$ and the chemical potential. This uniform solution describes a uniform gas of bosonic surfaces. Using the obtained energy functional, we show that low-energy fluctuations contain a gapless $p$-form field $A_p^{}$ when the $p$-form global symmetry is $\mathrm{U}(1)$, whereas the $p$-form field becomes massive for discrete symmetries, whose low-energy limit is described by a $\mathrm{BF}$-type topological field theory. As a consequence, the system exhibits abelian topological order with anyonic surface excitations. In the presence of external forces, however, solving the functional equation in full generality remains challenging. We argue, however, that the problem reduces to solving the conventional Gross-Pitaevskii equation when external forces act separately on the center-of-mass and relative motions. In addition, we present analytic solutions for topological defects as analogs of vortex and domain-wall solutions in conventional bosonic systems. Finally, as a concrete microscopic model, we study a $\mathbb{Z}_N^{}$ lattice gauge theory and apply our variational method to this system.</description>

Abstract: We review recent results of net-proton multiplicity fluctuations from STAR experiment, aiming to locate the QCD critical point in high-energy nuclear collisions at RHIC. We show net-proton number cumulant and proton number factorial cumulant ratios up to fourth order using experimental data from RHIC BES-II Au+Au collisions in collider mode and fixed-target mode. The comparison is made between experimental data and non-critical model calculations from Lattice QCD, HRG, hydrodynamic simulations and transport model UrQMD. In addition, we discuss initial volume fluctuation effect, which plays significant role in fixed-target energies. Finally, an outlook on experimental research on the QCD critical point in future experiments will be presented.</description>

Abstract: We develop a coordinate invariant formalism which describes the mechanical and electromagnetic interaction of gravitational waves (GWs) with a wide class of resonant detectors. We solve the GW-modified equations of electrodynamics and elasticity with dynamic boundary conditions using an eigenmode expansion. Furthermore, we take damping effects and electromagnetic back-action on mechanical systems covariantly into account. The resulting coupling coefficients are particularly useful for high-frequency gravitational wave experiments using microwave cavities and allow a straightforward numerical implementation for arbitrary detector geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a Joyce structure, we show that the associated $\mathbb{C}^*$-family of non-linear connections $\mathcal{A}^{\epsilon}$ can be gauged to a standard form $\mathcal{A}^{\epsilon,\text{st}}$ by a gauge transformation $\hat{g}$, formal in $\epsilon$. We show that the corresponding infinitesimal gauge transformation $\dot{g}=\log(\hat{g})$ has a convergent Borel transform, provided $\dot{g}$ vanishes on the base of the Joyce structure. This establishes the first step in showing that such a $\dot{g}$ is resurgent. We also use $\hat{g}$ to produce formal twistor Darboux coordinates for the complex hyperk\"{a}hler structure associated to the Joyce structure, and show a similar result about convergence of the Borel transform of the formal twistor Darboux coordinates.</description>

      <title>Unconventional magnetoelectric conductivity and electrochemical response from dipole-like sources of Berry curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute longitudinal magnetoelectric conductivity ($\sigma_{zz}$) and nonlinear electrochemical response (ECR), applying the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, for three-dimensional nodal-ring semimetals (vortex nodal-rings and $\mathcal P \mathcal T$-symmetric nodal-rings) and three-band Hopf semimetals. While the nodal-curves of the former are taken to lie along the $k_z = 0$-plane, the nodal points of the latter harbour dipoles in their Berry-curvature (BC) profile, with the dipole's axis aligned along the $k_z$-axis. All these systems are topological and are unified on the aspect that their bands possess a vanishing Chern number. The linear response, $\sigma_{zz}$, is obtained from an exact solution when the systems are subjected to collinear electric and magnetic fields applied along the anisotropy axis, viz. $\boldsymbol{\hat z}$. The nonlinear part involves third-rank tensors representing second-order response coefficients, relating the electrical current to the combined effects of the gradient of the chemical potential and an external electric field. We analyse the similarities of the response arising from the vortex nodal-rings and the Hopf semimetals, which can be traced to the dipole-like sources in their BC fields.</description>

Abstract: We present the conservative dynamics of compact binaries to third order in the post-Minkowskian approximation in a theory that extends general relativity by a massless scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. We employ the effective field theory approach to construct the effective action of binary systems by integrating out the metric and scalar degrees of freedom that mediate the gravitational interactions between the two bodies. We derive analytical expressions for the scattering impulse and the deflection angle to third order in the post-Minkowskian expansion. Our results are found to be in agreement, in the overlapping regimes, with state-of-the-art calculations in the post-Newtonian/post-Minkowskian theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the motion of test particles around Kerr--Bertotti--Robinson (KBR) black hole (BH) and explore how the three defining parameters the mass $M$, rotation parameter $a$, and magnetic parameter $B$ influence their dynamics. We derive analytical expressions for the energy and angular momentum of stable equatorial circular orbits, along with the corresponding radial and latitudinal oscillation frequencies, as functions of $M$, $a$, and $B$. We also examine the key features of the quasi-periodic oscillations of test particles near stable circular orbits, including the precession effects such as periastron precession and the Lense-Thirring effect. Finally, we compare our results with those corresponding to the Kerr BH. We find that particle motion is strongly shaped by the BH parameters. Using a WKB approach, we also study scalar quasinormal modes of a rotating KBR BH in an external magnetic field and show that the magnetic field increases damping, while rotation and angular momentum mainly set the oscillation frequencies. Alternatively, general relativistic modelling of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion onto a rapidly rotating KBR BH shows that two distinct physical structures emerge and cyclically transform into one another over time. These processes produce either a strongly oscillating flip-flop shock cone or a nearly stationary toroidal structure, with their formation governed by the black hole spin and magnetic curvature. Power spectral analysis shows that these configurations give rise to low and high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations, offering a unified explanation for the multiple quasi-periodic oscillations observed in rapidly spinning X--ray binaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A long-standing problem in primordial cosmology is to understand the precise relation between the stochastic formalism and standard perturbation theory for light scalar fields in inflationary spacetimes. A complete correspondence between the two frameworks has remained elusive, even for a single self-interacting spectator field on a fixed de Sitter background. In this Letter, we revisit the assumptions underlying the derivation of the Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations that form the basis of the stochastic approach. We show that the standard stochastic treatment is effectively equivalent to neglecting super-long-wavelength modes beyond the observable range described by these equations. Using perturbation theory, we quantify how these modes enter through virtual loop effects and demonstrate that, once treated consistently, they induce definite corrections to both the Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations.</description>

      <title>Fay identities for polylogarithms on higher-genus Riemann surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent construction of polylogarithms on Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus in arXiv:2306.08644 is based on a flat connection assembled from single-valued non-holomorphic integration kernels that depend on two points on the Riemann surface. In this work, we construct and prove infinite families of bilinear relations among these integration kernels that are necessary for the closure of the space of higher-genus polylogarithms under integration over the points on the surface. Our bilinear relations generalize the Fay identities among the genus-one Kronecker-Eisenstein kernels to arbitrary genus. The multiple-valued meromorphic kernels in the flat connection of Enriquez are conjectured to obey higher-genus Fay identities of exactly the same form as their single-valued non-holomorphic counterparts. We initiate the applications of Fay identities to derive functional relations among higher-genus polylogarithms involving either single-valued or meromorphic integration kernels.</description>

      <title>Does connected wedge imply distillable entanglement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ryu-Takayanagi formula predicts that two boundary subsystems $A$ and $C$ can exhibit large mutual information $I(A:C)$ even when they are spatially disconnected on the boundary and separated by a buffer subsystem $B$, as long as $A$ and $C$ have connected entanglement wedge in the bulk. However, whether the reduced state $\rho_{AC}$ contains distillable EPR pairs has remained a longstanding open problem. In this work, we resolve this problem by showing that: i) there is no LO-distillable entanglement at leading order in $G_N$, suggesting the absence of bipartite entanglement in a holographic mixed state $\rho_{AC}$, and ii) one-shot, one-way LOCC-distillable entanglement is given at leading order by locally accessible information $J^W(A|C)$, which is related to the entanglement wedge cross section $E^W$ involving the (third) purifying system $B$ via $J^W(A|C) = S_A - E^W(A:B)$. Namely, we demonstrate that a connected entanglement wedge does not necessarily imply nonzero distillable entanglement in one-shot, one-way LOCC. We also show that entanglement of formation $E_{F}(A:C)$ is given by $E^W(A:C)$ at leading order in holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study covariant open bosonic string field theory in lightcone gauge. When lightcone gauge is well-defined, we find two results. First, the vertices of the gauge-fixed action consist of Mandelstam diagrams with stubs covering specific portions of the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. This is true regardless of how the vertices of the original covariant string field theory are constructed (e.g. through minimal area metrics, hyperbolic geometry, and so on). Second, the portions of moduli space covered by gauge-fixed vertices are changed relative to those covered by the original covariant vertices. The extra portions are supplied through the exchange of longitudinal degrees of freedom in scattering processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the quantum field description of massive Carrollian field theories, emphasizing the critical role of gauge fixing within the Carrollian sector. We illustrate this importance using scalar Carrollian Electrodynamics (sCED) as a primary example. We also present the quantum field description for complex Carrollian scalar fields, Carrollian fermions, and Carrollian Electrodynamics. We highlight the challenges in scalar Carrollian electrodynamics (sCED), where the renormalized mass appears gauge-dependent, and clarify this discrepancy by carefully constructing completely gauge-fixed propagators. We discuss how certain abelian Carrollian field theories do not admit any loop corrections and are trivial in that sense.</description>

      <title>Scale without Conformal Invariance in bottom-up Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In holography, the isometry group of the bulk spacetime corresponds to the symmetries of the boundary theory. We thus approach the question of whether (and when) scale invariance in combination with Poincar\'e invariance implies full conformal invariance in quantum field theory from a holographic bulk perspective. To do so, we study bulk spacetimes that include a warped extra dimension and in which the isometry group corresponds to scale without conformal invariance. Firstly, we show that the bulk Weyl tensor plays a pivotal role in distinguishing those metrics exhibiting conformal invariance (Weyl=0) from those merely exhibiting scale invariance (Weyl$\neq$0). Based on this, we then prove the following theorem: For putative boundary theories with $n\geq2$ dimensions, the bulk metric can not exhibit scale without conformal invariance if its warped extra dimension is compact and the null energy condition is required to hold. For $n=1$, we discuss that a more general ansatz for the bulk metric must be made, a detailed analysis of which is left for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct fully gauge-invariant kinetic terms for open and closed string field theories on a target space with boundary. This is realized by promoting the gauge parameters at the boundary to extra dynamical modes describing boundary degrees of freedom. Having a gauge-invariant classical action, we also construct the corresponding BV master action and show that the master equation is obeyed thanks to a peculiar nilpotent structure of the BV kinetic operator. From this general construction we explicitly derive free actions for massless and massive modes of open and closed strings propagating on a target with a boundary, including linear-dilaton backgrounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11449v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Color multiplets of the gauge fields and fermions on mass shell in SU(N) Yang-Mills theory are classified according to representations of the Weyl group W(SU(N)). The multiplet structure of quark and gluon multiplets has been studied in the framework of a non-perturbative approach by considering complete exact equations of motion of the SU(N) Yang-Mills theory with matter fields. An important case of singlet non-Abelian gluon solutions corresponding to one-dimensional singlet representations of the Weyl group is revised on a rigorous mathematical basis. We demonstrate that Weyl group as a finite color subgroup of SU(N) reveals an inherent color symmetry of quarks and gluons on mass shell which determines a universal color miltiplet structure of quark-gluon solutions in a pure SU(N) Yang-Mills theory and in Abelian projected Yang-Mills theories with quarks. The obtained results allow to introduce strict concepts of fundamental particles, quarks and gluons, which differ drastically from the particle definitions in the conventional perturbative Yang-Mills theory. Possible applications of our results in non-perturbative quantum chromodynamics and hadron physics are discussed.</description>

      <title>Zamolodchikov recurrence relation and modular properties of effective coupling in $\mathcal{N}=2$ SQCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a recurrence relation for the instanton partition function of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM $SU(N)$ gauge theory with $2N$ fundamental multiplets. The main difficulty lies in determining the asymptotic behaviour of the partition function in the regime of large vacuum expectation values of the Higgs field. Using the saddle point method and the $qq$-characters technique, we demonstrate that, in this limit, the partition function is governed by the Quantum Seiberg-Witten curves, as in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit, up to a normalisation constant. With the asymptotic behaviour found, we are able to write the recurrence relation for the partition function and to find the effective infrared coupling constant. The resulting effective constant is an inverse of a modular function with respect to a certain triangle group, and the asymptotic itself is a product of modular functions and forms with respect to triangle groups.</description>

      <title>Worldline Formulations of Covariant Fracton Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop worldline formulations of covariant fracton gauge theories. These are a one-parameter family of gauge theories of a rank-two symmetric tensor field, invariant under a scalar gauge transformation involving a double derivative. These theories, which can be interpreted as linearized gravity theories invariant under longitudinal diffeomorphisms, provide a covariant framework for studying Lorentz-breaking fracton quasiparticles, which are excitations with restricted mobility due to dipole-moment conservation. We construct three worldline models. The first two are obtained by deducing their constraint structure directly from the spacetime gauge transformations. By applying BRST quantization, we show that these models reproduce the BV spectrum and the associated BRST transformations of two specific fracton theories. The third model is defined as a deformation of the second one: although free, it is analyzed by drawing inspiration from the standard treatment of interacting worldline systems, and is shown to capture almost the entire family of covariant fracton theories. Finally, we discuss the gauge-fixing, comparing the BV-BRST spacetime perspective with the worldline analogue of the ``Siegel gauge" employed in string field theory.</description>

      <title>The gyromagnetic factor of charged rotating black holes in various dimensions from scattering amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical black hole spacetimes can be recovered from the classical limit of quantum scattering amplitudes in a low-energy effective field theory of gravity. In this work we compute, at first post-Minkowskian and dipole order, the metric and the electromagnetic potential for charged and rotating black holes in general spacetime dimensions from amplitudes describing the emission of either a graviton or a photon from a massive and charged Dirac fermion field up to one loop. In addition, we introduce a Pauli non-minimal coupling, to parametrize the black hole's gyromagnetic factor $\mathfrak{g}$. We are able to reproduce the Kerr-Newman solution in four dimensions, as well as the Chong-Cveti\v{c}-L\"u-Pope solution, from five-dimensional supergravity, which includes a Chern-Simons interaction. Crucially, we show that for a charged Myers-Perry like black hole in $d+1$ spacetime dimensions, its gyromagnetic factor is equal to $\mathfrak{g}=(d-1)/(d-2)$. Hence, only in $3+1$ dimensions minimal coupling is sufficient to describe black holes from scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Sigma model renormalisation group flows, singularities and some remarks on cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the renormalisation group (RG) flow of two-dimensional sigma models with a generic metric coupling by utilising known results for the Ricci flow. We point out that on many occasions the RG flow develops singularities, due to strong coupling behaviour, before it reaches a UV or an IR fixed point. We illustrate our analysis with several examples. We give particular emphasis to type I singularities, where the length of the curvature of the sigma model target space grows at most as $|t-T|^{-1}$ as the flow parameter $t$ approaches the singularity at $T$. For these, the geometry near the singularity is described in terms of a shrinking Ricci soliton that exhibits a cosmological constant even though the original RG flow does not.
  Assuming that the spacetime satisfies an RG flow equation, we use the Ricci solitons to introduce a cosmological constant in a string theory setting. This can allow for different cosmological constants at different regions of spacetime. In particular, we point out how the de-Sitter space is a solution of the theory. We also raise the question on whether the techniques used to prove the geometrisation conjecture can be applied to prove the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe at large scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Courant-Hilbert (CH) construction of integrable deformations of a two-dimensional principal chiral model (2D PCM) in the context of the four-dimensional Chern-Simons (4D CS) theory. According to this construction, an integrable deformation of 2D PCM is characterized by a boundary function. As a result, the master formula obtained from the 4D CS theory should be corrected by the trace of the energy-momentum tensor so as to support the CH construction. We present some examples of deformation including the $T\bar{T}$-deformation, the root $T\bar{T}$-deformation, the two-parameter mixed deformation, and a logarithmic deformation. Finally, we discuss some generalizations and potential applications of this CH construction.</description>

      <title>Localisation with on-shell supersymmetry algebras via the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism: Localisation as gauge fixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01810v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism provides a powerful technique to deal with gauge and global (super)symmetries that may only hold on shell. We argue that, since global (super)symmetries and gauge symmetries appear on an equal footing in the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, similarly localisation with respect to global (super)symmetries appears on an equal footing with gauge fixing of gauge symmetries; in general, when the gauge-fixing condition is not invariant under the global symmetries, localisation (with respect to a localising fermion) and gauge fixing (with respect to a gauge-fixing fermion) combine into a single operation. Furthermore, this perspective enables supersymmetric localisation using only on-shell supermultiplets, dispensing with auxiliary fields, extending an insight first discovered by Losev and Lysov arXiv:2312.13999. We provide the first examples of on-shell localisation for quantum field theories (together with a companion paper by Arvanitakis arXiv:2511.00144).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a new formula for the symplectic structure on the phase space of open string field theory. Revisiting the setup of Cho, Mazel, and Yin, we use the formula to compute the energy of rolling tachyon solutions on unstable D-branes. An important aspect of the analysis is dealing with the singular ultraviolet behavior of string vertices in Lorentzian signature, a feature we refer to as transgressive locality. This forces us to carry out computations in momentum space, where time and causality are somewhat obscure. Nevertheless the symplectic structure appears to be sensible, giving results in agreement with boundary state computations. As further confirmation of our methods, we study the symplectic structure for rolling tachyons in scalar effective field theory, where vertices show similar high energy behavior to string field theory but the physics is that of local field theory. This model gives interesting insight into the runaway oscillations of the rolling tachyon.</description>

Abstract: $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS surface operator viewed as a conformal defect in rank $N$ 6d (2,0) theory is expected to have a holographic description in terms of a probe M2 brane wrapped on AdS$_3$ in the AdS$_7\times S^4$ M-theory background. The M2 brane has an effective tension T$_2= \frac{2}{ \pi} N$ so that the large tension expansion corresponds to the $1/N$ expansion. The value of the defect conformal anomaly coefficient in $SU(N)$ (2,0) theory was previously argued to be b$=12N- 9 - 3N^{-1}$. Semiclassically quantizing M2 brane it was found in arXiv:2004.04562 that the first two terms in b are indeed reproduced by the classical and 1-loop corrections to the M2 free energy. Here we address the question if the 2-loop term in the M2 brane free energy reproduces the $N^{-1}$ term in b. Despite the general non-renormalizability of the standard BST supermembrane brane action we find that, remarkably, the 2-loop correction to the free energy of the AdS$_3$ M2 brane in AdS$_7\times S^4$ is UV finite (modulo power divergences that can be removed by an analytic regularization). Moreover, the 2-loop correction vanishes in the dimensional and $\zeta$-function regularizations. This result appears to be in disagreement with the non-vanishing of the coefficient of the $N^{-1}$ term in the expected expression for the anomaly coefficient b. We discuss possible resolutions of this puzzle, including the one that the M2 brane probe computation may be capturing the surface defect anomaly in the $U(N)$ rather than the $SU(N)$ boundary 6d CFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a detailed analysis of the disk path integral of timelike Liouville theory, conceived as a tractable and precise toy-model quantum cosmology in two dimensions. Disk path integrals with the insertion of matter field operators, taken along a judiciously chosen complex contour, yield states akin to the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction. Working in the fixed $K$-representation, where $K$ is the trace of the extrinsic curvature, we compute the one-loop wavefunctions and put forward a conjecture for the all-loop expressions. A suitable pairing of Liouville disk path integrals yields a $K$-independent quantity that may form the basis for a well-defined inner product on the space of Euclidean histories. We also consider other ensembles, including one with fixed area, and provide a static patch perspective with a timelike feature.</description>

      <title>The Stretched Horizon Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider four-dimensional general relativity with a positive cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, in the presence of a boundary, $\Gamma$, of finite spatial size. The boundary is located near a cosmological event horizon, and is subject to boundary conditions that fix the conformal class of the induced metric, and, $K$, the trace of the extrinsic curvature along $\Gamma$. The proximity of $\Gamma$ to the horizon is controlled by the dimensionless parameter ${K}{{\Lambda}^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$. We provide an exhaustive analysis of linearised gravitational perturbations for the setup. This is performed both for a $\Gamma$ encasing a portion of the static patch that ends just before the cosmological horizon (pole patch), as well as a $\Gamma$ containing only the region near the cosmological horizon (cosmic patch). In the pole patch, we uncover a layered hierarchy of modes: ordinary normal modes, a novel type of boundary gapless mode, and boundary soft modes of frequency $\omega \approx \pm 2\pi i T_{\text{dS}}$, with $T_{\text{dS}}$ the horizon temperature. Minkowskian behaviour is recovered only for angular momenta $l \gtrsim {K}{{\Lambda}^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$ which can be made parametrically large, thus attenuating previously found growing modes. In the cosmic patch, we uncover sound and shear fluid-dynamical modes that we interpret in terms of a conformal fluid with shear viscosity over entropy density ratio $\tfrac{\eta}{s} = \tfrac{1}{4\pi}$ and vanishing bulk viscosity $\zeta=0$. The fluid dynamical sector is shown to admit a non-linear treatment. We describe a scaling regime in which the stretched horizon gravitational dynamics is dictated by a universal Rindler geometry, independent to the details of the infilling horizon. We briefly discuss quantitative features that distinguish cosmological and black hole horizons away from the Rindler regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a conjectured formula that systematically maps covariant off-shell amplitudes to light-cone wave functions in scalar field theory. Through an explicit comparison at one-loop accuracy, we establish its equivalence to the light-cone perturbation theory series, thereby validating the conjecture at this order. Applying this formula, we efficiently re-derive wave functions from known covariant amplitudes, bypassing both the conceptual complexities of light-cone quantization and the technical challenges of perturbative calculations in this framework. In addition to simplifying computations, this approach opens new avenues for applications in gauge theories and deeper explorations of the fundamental equivalence between covariant and light-cone quantization.</description>

      <title>Scattering Amplitudes and Conservative Binary Dynamics at $O(G^5)$ without Self-Force Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the complete potential-graviton contributions to the conservative radial action and scattering angle for two non-spinning bodies in general relativity, accurate through fifth order in Newton's constant and including second-order self-force (2SF) effects. The calculation is carried out in the scattering-amplitude framework, combining the double copy, effective field theory, and multi-loop integration techniques based on integration by parts and differential equations. To address a major computational bottleneck, we develop improved integration-by-parts algorithms that render calculations at this order tractable. The post-Minkowskian amplitude is presented as a series expansion, following the strategy used earlier in maximal supergravity. For the first self-force sector, which involves only polylogarithmic functions, we also provide a closed-form analytic expression. For the second self-force sector, as in earlier supergravity work, we find nontrivial cancellations among contributions related to integrals supported on Calabi-Yau geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantities computed by minimal cuts, such as entanglement entropies achievable by the Ryu-Takayanagi proposal in the AdS/CFT correspondence, are constrained by linear inequalities. We prove a previously conjectured property of all such constraints: Any $k$ systems on the "greater-than" side of the inequality whose overlap is nonempty are subsumed in some $k$ systems on its "less-than" side (accounting for multiplicity). This finding adds evidence that the same inequalities also constrain the entropies under time-dependent conditions because it preempts a large class of potential counterexamples. We prove several other properties of holographic entropy inequalities and comment on their relation to quantum erasure correction and the Renormalization Group.</description>

      <title>On anomaly free 4d $\mathcal{N}$=4 and 6d (2,0) conformal supergravities and UV finiteness of Poincar\'e supergravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the structure of superconformal anomalies in 4d $\mathcal N$=4 conformal supergravity (CSG) coupled to a number N$_\rm v$ of $ \mathcal N$=4 vector multiplets and 6d (2,0) CSG coupled to N$_{_{\rm T}}$ of (2,0) tensor multiplets. Anomalies cancel if N$_\rm v$=4 and N$_{_{\rm T}}$=26 respectively. If the CSG part of the action is dropped and N$_{\rm v}$=6+ n$_{\rm v}$, the first theory is classically equivalent to the 4d $\mathcal N$=4 Poincar\'e supergravity (PSG) coupled to n$_{\rm v}$ vector multiplets, while the second one with N$_{_{\rm T}}$=5+ n$_{_{\rm T}}$ is classically equivalent to the 6d (2,0) PSG coupled to n$_{\rm T}$ tensor multiplets. We argue that these facts imply that divergences in the 4d PSG with n$_{\rm v}$ vectors should be proportional to n$_{\rm v}$+2 and similarly in the 6d PSG with n$_{_{\rm T}}$ tensors to n$_{_{\rm T}}$-21. These predictions appear to be consistent with known results of explicit scattering amplitude computations in these 4d and 6d PSG theories.</description>

Abstract: We consider $4D$, $\mathcal{N}=4$, $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory formulated in terms of $\mathcal{N}=1$ superfields where the leading low-energy contributions to effective action are given by chiral effective potential. This effective potential is calculated in one- and higher-loop approximations. It is shown that this potential is automatically finite and proportional to the classical chiral potential. All quantum corrections are found explicitly and factored into a coefficient at the classical potential.</description>

      <title>"It from Bit": The Hartle-Hawking state and quantum mechanics for de Sitter observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-state statement for closed universes has sparked considerable discussion. In this paper, we examine its physical meaning in the context of the Hartle-Hawking state and de Sitter space. We argue that the one-state property of closed universes is fully compatible with the finite-dimensional quantum mechanics experienced by observers inside de Sitter space, and that this compatibility requires neither mixing of $\alpha$-sectors nor any modification of the rules of the gravitational path integral. The apparent tension is resolved by sharply distinguishing the baby-universe Hilbert space, namely the space of closed universes viewed from the outside, from the bulk Hilbert space that governs quantum mechanics for an observer inside a single de Sitter universe.
  The baby-universe Hilbert space, together with its commutative operator algebra, is not a quantum-mechanical Hilbert space: it is merely a mathematical repackaging of classical probability theory and carries no quantum-mechanical structure at all, a direct consequence of the one-state property of closed universes. Accordingly, attempting to formulate quantum mechanics directly on the baby-universe Hilbert space conflates two logically distinct structures and leads to physically incorrect conclusions. By contrast, the quantum mechanics experienced by an observer inside de Sitter space emerges from the classical statistics encoded in the baby-universe Hilbert space, providing a concrete realization of Wheeler's idea of "It from Bit." We demonstrate these features by completely solving a topological toy model of one-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. Along the way, we clarify the physical meaning of de Sitter entropy, showing that it corresponds to the coarse-grained entropy of the underlying state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05130v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we model the bounce phase, stability, and the reconstruction of the universe by non-minimal kinetic coupling. In the process, we obtained importance information about the energy density and the matter pressure of the universe in relation to the previous universe through the bounce quantum phase. The novelty of the work is that the scale factor is obtained directly from the model and is fitted with an exponential function, with this view we explore the process of the early universe even the bounce phase. After that, we plot the cosmological parameters in terms of time evolution. In what follows, we investigate the stability of the model by dynamical system analysis in a phase plane. Finally, we examine the stability of the universe, especially in the inflationary period, by using the phase-space trajectories.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Berry phase arising from axion-photon and axion-fermion interactions. The effective Hamiltonians in both systems share the same form, enabling a unified description of the Berry phase and providing a novel perspective on axion experiments. We conceptually propose a new photon-ring experiment for axion detection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that measuring the axion-induced Berry phase offers a unique method for probing the global structure of the Standard Model gauge group and axion-related generalized symmetries.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate static spherically symmetric spacetimes within the framework of symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity in order to describe relativistic stars. We adopt a specific ansatz for the background geometry corresponding to a singularity-free space-time. We obtain an expression for the connection, which allows the derivation of solutions for any $f(Q)$ theory in this context. Our approach aims to address a recurring error appearing in the literature, where even when a connection compatible with spherical symmetry is adopted, the field equation for the connection is systematically omitted and not checked if it is satisfied. For the stellar configuration, we concentrate on the power-law model $f(Q)=Q+\alpha Q_{0}\left( \frac{Q}{Q_{0}}\right) ^{\nu }$. The de Sitter-Schwarzschild geometry naturally emerges as an attractor beyond a certain radius, we thus utilize it as the external solution beyond the boundary of the star. We perform a detailed investigation of the physical characteristics of the interior solution, explicitly determining the mass function, analyzing the resulting gravitational fluid properties and deriving the angular and radial speed of sound.</description>

      <title>No Flavor Anisotropy in the High-Energy Neutrino Sky Upholds Lorentz Invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) would upend the foundations of modern physics. Because LIV effects grow with energy, high-energy astrophysical neutrinos provide the most sensitive tests of Lorentz invariance in the neutrino sector. We examine an understudied yet phenomenologically rich LIV signature: compass asymmetries, where neutrinos of different flavors propagate preferentially along different directions. Using the directional flavor composition of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, i.e., the abundances of $\nu_{e}$, $\nu_{\mu}$, and $\nu_{\tau}$ across the sky, we find no evidence of LIV-induced flavor anisotropy in 7.5 years of IceCube High-Energy Starting Events. Thus, we place upper limits on the values of hundreds of LIV parameters with operator dimensions 2-8, tightening existing limits by orders of magnitude and bounding hundreds of parameters for the first time.</description>

      <title>No-scale Brans-Dicke Gravity -- ultralight scalar boson &amp; heavy inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is very much intriguing if the Planck scale $M_{\rm{Pl}}$ is not a fundamental parameter. The Brans-Dicke gravity is nothing but the theory where the Planck scale $M_{\rm{Pl}}$ is indeed an illusional parameter. The theory predicts a massless scalar boson whose exchanges between matters induce unwanted long range forces. We solve this problem imposing there is no dimensionful parameter in the theory, even at the quantum level. We further extend the theory by including a $R^2$ term and a non-minimal coupling of the Standard Model Higgs to gravity, as their coefficients are dimensionless. This extension provides a heavy inflaton field that is consistent with all cosmological observations, with a potential very similar to that of the Starobinsky model. The inflaton necessarily decays into the massless scalar bosons, resulting in a non-negligible amount of dark radiation in the present universe. We demonstrate that the inflation model yields a sufficiently high reheating temperature for successful leptogenesis, and we also discuss a possible candidate for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Geometry of the moduli space of Hermitian-Einstein connections on manifolds with a dilaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the moduli space of Hermitian-Einstein connections $\text{M}^*_{HE}(M^{2n})$ of vector bundles over compact non-Gauduchon Hermitian manifolds $(M^{2n}, g, \omega)$ that exhibit a dilaton field $\Phi$ admit a strong K\"ahler with torsion structure provided a certain condition is imposed on their Lee form $\theta$ and the dilaton. We find that the geometries that satisfy this condition include those that solve the string field equations or equivalently the gradient flow soliton type of equations. In addition, we demonstrate that if the underlying manifold $(M^{2n}, g, \omega)$ admits a holomorphic and Killing vector field $X$ that leaves $\Phi$ also invariant, then the moduli spaces $\text{M}^*_{HE}(M^{2n})$ admits an induced holomorphic and Killing vector field $\alpha_X$. Furthermore, if $X$ is covariantly constant with respect to the compatible connection $\hat\nabla$ with torsion a 3-form on $(M^{2n}, g, \omega)$, then $\alpha_X$ is also covariantly constant with respect to the compatible connection $\hat D$ with torsion a 3-form on $\text{M}^*_{HE}(M^{2n})$ provided that $K^\flat\wedge X^\flat$ is a $(1,1)$-form with $K^\flat=\theta+2d\Phi$ and $\Phi$ is invariant under both $X$ and $IX$, where $I$ is the complex structure of $M^{2n}$.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory of Chiral Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a (non-)Abelian gauge field acquires an isotropic background configuration during inflation, strong gravitational waves (GWs) with parity-violating polarization, known as chiral GWs, can be produced in addition to the intrinsic unpolarized GWs. However, previous studies have analyzed individual models, leaving the generality of this phenomenon unclear. To perform a model-independent analysis, we construct an effective field theory (EFT) of chiral GWs by extending the EFT of inflation and incorporating gauge fields. The resulting action unifies inflationary models with a $SU(2)$ gauge field, such as chromo-natural inflation and gauge-flation, and ones with a triplet of $U(1)$ gauge fields, systematically encompassing all possible GW production mechanisms consistent with the symmetry breaking induced by the gauge field background. We find that chiral GWs are generically and inevitably produced, provided that the effective energy density of the background gauge field is positive and the gauge kinetic function is not fine-tuned to a specific time dependence. This EFT offers a useful foundation for future phenomenological studies as well as for deepening our theoretical understanding of chiral GWs.</description>

      <title>Measuring spin correlation between quarks during QCD confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vacuum is now understood to possess a rich and complex structure, characterized by fluctuating energy fields and a condensate of virtual quark-antiquark pairs. The spontaneous breaking of the approximate chiral symmetry, signaled by the nonvanishing quark condensate $\langle q\bar{q}\rangle$, is dynamically generated through topologically nontrivial gauge configurations such as instantons. The precise mechanism linking the chiral symmetry breaking to the mass generation associated with quark confinement remains a profound open question in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) - the fundamental theory of strong interaction. High energy proton-proton collisions could liberate virtual quark-antiquark pairs from the vacuum that subsequently undergo confinement to form hadrons, whose properties could serve as probes into QCD confinement and the quark condensate. Here, we report evidence of spin correlations in $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperon pairs inherited from spin-correlated strange quark-antiquark virtual pairs. Measurements by the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory reveal a relative polarization signal of $(18 \pm 4)\%$ that links the virtual spin-correlated quark pairs from the QCD vacuum to their final-state hadron counterparts. Crucially, this correlation vanishes when the hyperon pairs are widely separated in angle, consistent with the decoherence of the quantum system. Our findings provide a new experimental paradigm for exploring the dynamics and interplay of quark confinement and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between new agegraphic dark energy and Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter in the context of \(f(T)\) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the cosmic evolution within the framework of $f(T)$ gravity using a flat-FRW background and model the universe as consisting of three components: baryonic matter, dark matter, and dark energy. We consider the new agegraphic (NA) as an alternative for dark energy and the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) as an alternative for dark matter. After that, first we obtain the Friedman equations and then we obtain the continuity equations in the presence of the interaction term between the dark components of the universe, where the interaction term represents the energy flow from dark matter to dark energy. In what follows, we plot the variation of the cosmological parameters of dark energy in terms of the redshift parameter by using the power-law cosmology. Finally, we investigate the evolution and stability of the universe and report the values of the density parameters of the universe components which confirm the present model with observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a Hilbert space approach to quantum mechanics where space and time are treated on an equal footing. Our approach replaces the standard dependence on an external classical time parameter with a spacetime-symmetric algebraic structure, thereby unifying the axioms that traditionally distinguish the treatment of spacelike and timelike separations. Standard quantum evolution can be recovered from timelike correlators, defined by means of a quantum action operator, a quantum version of the action of classical mechanics. The corresponding map also provides a novel perspective on the path integral formulation, which, in the case of fermions, yields an alternative to the use of Grassmann variables. In addition, the formalism can be interpreted in terms of generalized quantum states, codifying both the conventional information of a quantum system at a given time and its evolution. We show that these states are solutions to a quantum principle of stationary action grounded in timelike correlations and pseudo-entropies</description>

      <title>Goldstone bosons across thermal phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temperature has a significant effect on the properties of quantum field theories (QFTs) with a spontaneously broken symmetry, in particular on the massless Goldstone bosons that exist in the vacuum state. It has recently been shown using lattice calculations for a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ complex scalar field theory that the Goldstone mode persists even when the symmetry is restored above the critical temperature $T_{c}$, and has the properties of a screened excitation, a so-called thermoparticle. In this work, we continue the investigation of this theory by determining explicitly how the Goldstone mode evolves as the temperature is increased both below and above $T_{c}$. We find that the two phases of the theory are entirely characterised by the thermal dissipative effects experienced by the Goldstone mode, with the broken and symmetry-restored phases associated with weak and strong damping, respectively. These findings are consistent with the non-perturbative constraints imposed by spontaneous symmetry breaking, and provide a new way in which to characterise thermal phase transitions in QFTs.</description>

      <title>Extended black hole thermodynamics in a DGP braneworld</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop extended black-hole thermodynamics on a Dvali--Gabadadze--Porrati (DGP) brane by promoting the brane tension $\sigma$ to a thermodynamic variable within the extended Iyer--Wald framework. The brane tension acts as a localized vacuum energy with pressure $P_\sigma \equiv -\sigma$, yielding a new work term $V_\sigma\,\mathrm{d}P_\sigma$ in the first law and the corresponding Smarr relation. For static, spherically symmetric black holes we show that the conjugate volume equals the geometric volume $V_\sigma=\tfrac{4\pi}{3}r_h^3$; for stationary, axisymmetric solutions it admits a covariant, slice-independent definition and evaluates to $V_\sigma=\tfrac{4\pi}{3}\!\left(r_+^3+a^2 r_+\right)$. Working on the ghost-free normal branch, the brane is asymptotically flat with a single horizon, so the construction avoids de Sitter obstructions. Along a flat-brane path, asymptotic flatness is preserved by co-varying the bulk cosmological constant, and induced-gravity effects are suppressed by $r_h/r_c$. These results establish a consistent flat-braneworld realization of black-hole chemistry in which brane tension provides the physically motivated pressure variable.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the first-order QCD phase transition in dense strong interaction matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the phase structure and thermodynamics of QCD in the low temperature and high density region, where a strong, first-order phase transition is expected beyond the critical end point. By solving the quark gap equation in the continuum QCD approach, we reveal the coexistence of the multi-phases both in the microscopic dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking and also in the thermodynamic observables, which manifests the existence of spinodal decomposition during the first-order QCD phase transitions. We also analyse the interface structure of the co-exist Nambu and Wigner phases in the isothermal process during the first-order transition. In particular, the interface tension and interface entropy density are extracted from the isothermal trajectories, which further allows for an analysis on the formation of nuclear bubble, including the bubble radius and its stability at different temperatures. Our predictions may serve as useful inputs for further investigations in heavy-ion physics or astrophysics research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the motion of a particle in the geometry of a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a dark matter (DM) halo with Dehnen type density profile and calculate the orbital periods along with the evolution of the semi-latus rectum and eccentricity for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Such a system emits gravitational waves (GWs), and the particle's orbit evolves under radiation reaction. We also consider the effects of dynamical friction and accretion of DM on the orbital parameters. We find that the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum decrease faster with respect to the case in which EMRI is in empty spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the recently released B-mode polarisation data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) favour a non-vanishing contribution of primordial gravitational waves of inflationary origin which is in tension with the previous BICEP-Keck (BK) measurements. Our analysis uses the third-order slow-roll primordial power spectra, with theoretically motivated priors, on the multifrequency SPT likelihoods complemented by the latest Planck satellite data products. The SPT measurements provide 1.0 bit of information gain on the first slow-roll parameter, which is higher than the 0.9 bit provided by BK even though the SPT sensitivity is five times lower. Moreover, the Bayesian dimensionality on the same parameter exceeds 1.5 for SPT versus 0.3 for BK showing that it is overconstrained by the SPT data. Even if this BB-tension could be the result of a yet to be understood foreground, our findings should motivate for a closer analysis of this unexpected B-modes excess.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce classical and non-deterministic finite automata associated to representations of the braid group. After briefly reviewing basic definitions on finite automata, Coxeter's groups and the associated word problem, we turn to the Artin presentation of the braid group and its quotients. We present various representations of the braid group as deterministic or non-deterministic finite state automata and discuss connections with $q$-Dicke states, as well as Lusztig and crystal bases. We propose the study of the eigenvalue problem of the $\mathfrak{U}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ invariant spin-chain like ``Hamiltonian'' as a systematic means for constructing canonical bases for irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{U}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n).$ This is explicitly proven for the algebra $\mathfrak{U}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_2).$ Special braid representations associated with self-distributive structures are also studied as finite automata. These finite state automata organize clusters of eigenstates of these braid representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have examined the holographic principle as a means of producing dark energy. Here we propose instead the possibility of holographic dark matter. In this case, dark matter does not arise in the framework of particle physics but is derived from the infrared cutoff set by the horizon scale. Using the Ricci cutoff, and a universe containing only baryons and radiation, we can account for the dark matter and naturally explain the coincidence between baryonic and nonbaryonic contributions to the density. In the presence of a pre-existing vacuum energy density our model reverses the sign of this density, thus accounting for the fact that certain string theories generically predict a negative vacuum energy, but observations require a positive value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the structure of both Abelian and non-Abelian non-global logarithms up to four loops for $e^+e^-$ processes in perturbative QCD, where final-state jets are defined using the Cambridge--Aachen (C/A) clustering algorithm. The calculations are performed within the soft (eikonal) approximation using strong-energy ordering of the final-state partons for the case of the dijet invariant mass. The resulting expressions include full colour and complete jet-radius dependence. Compared to the anti-$k_t$ and $k_t$ clustering algorithms, the C/A distribution minimises the impact of these non-global logarithms, making it the preferred choice among the three algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18795v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate wormhole-plus-neutron-star (WH+NS) systems supported by two scalar fields, allowing for both pressure anisotropy of the neutron fluid and magnetic field. In general, such WH+NS systems contain ghosts; however, these ghosts can be eliminated. We find that the wormhole remains traversable regardless of whether anisotropy of the neutron fluid and/or magnetic fields are included. In particular, the null energy condition (NEC) remains violated in the vicinity of the wormhole throat, ensuring the traversable nature of the geometry. For magnetized configurations, the resulting WH+NS systems can become extremely massive, with ADM masses exceeding $8\,M_\odot$, and can exhibit large surface redshifts exceeding $z \simeq 1.5$. Furthermore, we analyze the gravitational-wave echo time of the systems, which serves as a potential observational imprint. Our results indicate that the echo time can vary depending on the fluid anisotropy and the magnetic field configuration, suggesting that WH+NS systems may provide distinctive signals of gravitational echo.</description>

      <title>The Exact Uncertainty Relation and Geometric Speed Limits in Krylov Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Hall's exact uncertainty relation acquires a simple geometric form in the Krylov basis generated by the Liouvillian. In this canonical operator frame, the uncertainty equality implies that the operator amplitude vector evolves on the unit Krylov sphere with constant speed fixed solely by the first Lanczos coefficient. This yields an exact linear bound on geometric operator evolution, independent of higher Lanczos coefficients and valid for arbitrary Hamiltonians, integrable or chaotic. Our results provide the first unified geometric interpretation of exact quantum speed limits and operator growth, identifying the first Lanczos coefficient as the intrinsic speed scale of quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03567v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf 1^2[\mathcal C]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. All physical predictions are local scale invariant, even in the presence of mass terms. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schr\"odinger and Pauli equations, and for the Dirac equation in curved spacetime, each coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique. Our results provide a pivotal understanding of local scale invariance in quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Exact calculations beyond charge neutrality in timelike Liouville field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Timelike Liouville field theory (also known as imaginary Liouville theory or imaginary Gaussian multiplicative chaos) is expected to describe two-dimensional quantum gravity in a positive-curvature regime, but its path integral is not a probability measure and rigorous exact computations are currently available only in the charge-neutral (integer screening) case. In this paper we show that at the special coupling $b=1/\sqrt{2}$, the Coulomb-gas expansion of the timelike path integral becomes explicitly computable beyond charge neutrality. The reason is that the $n$-fold integrals generated by the interaction acquire a Vandermonde/determinantal structure at $b=1/\sqrt{2}$, which allows exact evaluation in terms of classical special functions. We derive Mellin-Barnes type representations (involving the Barnes $G$-function and, in a three-point case, Gauss hypergeometric functions) for the zero- and one-point functions, for an antipodal two-point function, and for a three-point function with a resonant insertion $\alpha_2=b$. We then address the subtle zero-mode integration: after a Gaussian regularization we obtain an explicit renormalized partition function $C(1/\sqrt{2},\mu)=e(4\pi\sqrt2 \mu)^{-1}$, identify distributional limits in the physically relevant regime $\alpha_j=\frac{1}{2}Q+\mathrm{i} P_j$, and compare with the Hankel-contour prescription recently proposed in the physics literature. These results provide the first rigorously controlled family of exact calculations in timelike Liouville theory outside charge neutrality.</description>

      <title>Detection of Gravitational Anomaly at Low Acceleration from a Highest-quality Sample of 36 Wide Binaries with Accurate 3D Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We set out to accurately measure gravity in the low-acceleration range $(10^{-11},10^{-9})$ m s$^{-2}$ from 3D motions of isolated wide binary stars. Gaia DR3 provides precise measurements of the four sky-plane components of the 3D relative displacement and velocity ($\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{v}$) for a wide binary, but not comparably precise line-of-sight (radial) separation and relative velocity $v_{r}$. Based on our new observations and the public databases/publications, we assemble a sample of 36 nearby (distance $&lt;150$pc) wide binaries in the low-acceleration regime with accurate values of $v_{r}$ (uncertainty $&lt; 100$ m s$^{-1}$). Kinematic contaminants such as undetected stellar companions are well under control using various observational diagnostics such as Gaia's ruwe parameter, the color-magnitude diagram, multi-epoch observations of radial velocities, Speckle interferometric follow-up observations, and requiring Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion consistency. For the parameter $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{\gamma}$ with $\gamma \equiv G/G_{\rm N}$ (where $G$ is a parameter generalizing Newton's constant $G_{\rm N}$ in elliptical orbits), we find $\Gamma=0.102_{-0.021}^{+0.023}$, inconsistent with standard gravity at $4.9\sigma$, giving a gravity boost factor of $\gamma=1.600_{-0.141}^{+0.171}$. Four wide binaries have 3D relative velocities exceeding their estimated Newtonian escape velocities with $1&lt;v_{\rm obs}/v_{\rm escN}\le1.2$. These systems are unlikely to be chance associations and are expected in a nonstandard paradigm such as Milgromian dynamics (MOND). The hypothesis that Newtonian gravity can be extrapolated to the low-acceleration limit is falsified by this independent study with accurate 3D velocities. Future radial velocity monitoring and Speckle interferometric imaging for larger samples will be useful to refine the present result.</description>
