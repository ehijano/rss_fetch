      <title>Physics-Driven Self-Supervised Deep Learning for Free-Surface Multiple Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a promising alternative approach for various seismic processing tasks, including primary estimation (or multiple elimination), a crucial step for accurate subsurface imaging. In geophysics, DL methods are commonly based on supervised learning from large amounts of high-quality labelled data. Instead of relying on traditional supervised learning, in the context of free-surface multiple elimination, we propose a method in which the DL model learns to effectively parameterize the free-surface multiple-free wavefield from the full wavefield by incorporating the underlying physics into the loss computation. This, in turn, yields high-quality estimates without ever being shown any ground truth data. Currently, the network reparameterization is performed independently for each dataset. We demonstrate its effectiveness through tests on both synthetic and field data. We employ industry-standard Surface-Related Multiple Elimination (SRME) using, respectively, global least-squares adaptive subtraction and local least-squares adaptive subtraction as benchmarks. The comparison shows that the proposed method outperforms the benchmarks in estimation accuracy, achieving the most complete primary estimation and the least multiple energy leakage, but at the cost of a higher computational burden.</description>

      <title>Physics-Trained Neural Network as Inverse Problem Solver for Potential Fields: An Example of Downward Continuation between Arbitrary Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Downward continuation is a critical task in potential field processing, including gravity and magnetic fields, which aims to transfer data from one observation surface to another that is closer to the source of the field. Its effectiveness directly impacts the success of detecting and highlighting subsurface anomalous sources. We treat downward continuation as an inverse problem that relies on solving a forward problem defined by the formula for upward continuation, and we propose a new physics-trained deep neural network (DNN)-based solution for this task. We hard-code the upward continuation process into the DNN's learning framework, where the DNN itself learns to act as the inverse problem solver and can perform downward continuation without ever being shown any ground truth data. We test the proposed method on both synthetic magnetic data and real-world magnetic data from West Antarctica. The preliminary results demonstrate its effectiveness through comparison with selected benchmarks, opening future avenues for the combined use of DNNs and established geophysical theories to address broader potential field inverse problems, such as density and geometry modelling.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms for Seismic Events Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of seismic events has been crucial for monitoring underground nuclear explosions and unnatural seismic events as well as natural earthquakes. This research is an attempt to apply different machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify various types of seismic events into chemical explosions, collapses, nuclear explosions, damaging earthquakes, felt earthquakes, generic earthquakes and generic explosions for a dataset obtained from IRIS-DMC. One major objective of this research has been to identify some of the best ML algorithms for such seismic events classification. The ML algorithms we are implementing in this study include logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), Na\"ive Bayes, random forest, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees, and linear discriminant analysis. Our implementation of the above ML classifier algorithms required to prepare and preprocess the dataset we obtained so that it will be fit for the ML training and testing applications we sought. After the implementation of the ML algorithms, we were able to classify the seismic event types into seven classes in the dataset, and a comparison of each classifier is made to identify the best algorithm for the seismic data classification. Finally, we made predictions of the different event types using the different classifier algorithms, and evaluated each of the various classifier algorithms for seismic prediction using different evaluation metrics. These evaluation metrics helped us to measure the performance of each algorithm. After implementing the seven ML algorithms and a comparison among those various ML algorithms, it has been demonstrated that the best accuracy among these classifiers happened for the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, with an accuracy of 93.5%.</description>

      <title>A finite element-based machine learning model for hydro-mechanical analysis of swelling behavior in clay-sulfate rocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydro-mechanical behavior of clay-sulfate rocks, especially their swelling properties, poses significant challenges in geotechnical engineering. This study presents a hybrid constrained machine learning (ML) model developed using the categorical boosting algorithm (CatBoost) tuned with a Bayesian optimization algorithm to predict and analyze the swelling behavior of these complex geological materials. Initially, a coupled hydro-mechanical model based on the Richards' equation coupled to a deformation process with linear kinematics implemented within the finite element framework OpenGeoSys was used to simulate the observed ground heave in Staufen, Germany, caused by water inflow into the clay-sulfate bearing Triassic Grabfeld Formation. A systematic parametric analysis using Gaussian distributions of key parameters, including Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, maximum swelling pressure, permeability, and air entry pressure, was performed to construct a synthetic database. The ML model takes time, spatial coordinates, and these parameter values as inputs, while water saturation, porosity, and vertical displacement are outputs. In addition, penalty terms were incorporated into the CatBoost objective function to enforce physically meaningful predictions. Results show that the hybrid approach effectively captures the nonlinear and dynamic interactions that govern hydro-mechanical processes. The study demonstrates the ability of the model to predict the swelling behavior of clay-sulfate rocks, providing a robust tool for risk assessment and management in affected regions. The results highlight the potential of ML-driven models to address complex geotechnical challenges.</description>

      <title>Inversion of Magnetic Data using Learned Dictionaries and Scale Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic data inversion is an important tool in geophysics, used to infer subsurface magnetic susceptibility distributions from surface magnetic field measurements. This inverse problem is inherently ill-posed, characterized by non-unique solutions, depth ambiguity, and sensitivity to noise. Traditional inversion approaches rely on predefined regularization techniques to stabilize solutions, limiting their adaptability to complex or diverse geological scenarios. In this study, we propose an approach that integrates variable dictionary learning and scale-space methods to address these challenges. Our method employs learned dictionaries, allowing for adaptive representation of complex subsurface features that are difficult to capture with predefined bases. Additionally, we extend classical variational inversion by incorporating multi-scale representations through a scale-space framework, enabling the progressive introduction of structural detail while mitigating overfitting. We implement both fixed and dynamic dictionary learning techniques, with the latter introducing iteration-dependent dictionaries for enhanced flexibility. Using a synthetic dataset to simulate geological scenarios, we demonstrate significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy and robustness compared to conventional variational and dictionary-based methods. Our results highlight the potential of learned dictionaries, especially when coupled with scale-space dynamics, to improve model recovery and noise handling. These findings underscore the promise of our data-driven approach for advance magnetic data inversion and its applications in geophysical exploration, environmental assessment, and mineral prospecting.</description>

      <title>Machine learning surrogates for efficient hydrologic modeling: Insights from stochastic simulations of managed aquifer recharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Process-based hydrologic models are invaluable tools for understanding the terrestrial water cycle and addressing modern water resources problems. However, many hydrologic models are computationally expensive and, depending on the resolution and scale, simulations can take on the order of hours to days to complete. While techniques such as uncertainty quantification and optimization have become valuable tools for supporting management decisions, these analyses typically require hundreds of model simulations, which are too computationally expensive to perform with a process-based hydrologic model. To address this gap, we assess a hybrid modeling workflow in which a process-based model is used to generate an initial set of simulations and a machine learning (ML) surrogate model is then trained to perform the remaining simulations required for downstream analysis. As a case study, we apply this workflow to simulations of variably saturated groundwater flow at a prospective managed aquifer recharge site. We compare the accuracy and computational efficiency of several ML architectures, including deep convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks, vision transformers, and networks with Fourier transforms. Our results demonstrate that ML surrogate models can achieve under 10% mean absolute percentage error and yield order-of-magnitude runtime savings over process-based models. Building on these findings, we examine the impacts of key modeling choices on surrogate model accuracy and efficiency. Results show that a normalized loss function improves training stability, while min-max data normalization can significantly reduce error up to a factor of 10 when compared to other treatments such as Z-score and no normalization. Downsampling input features using an autoencoder also decreases memory requirements by training with tensors 4% their original size. By reducing computational costs and...</description>

      <title>Multispectral Indices for Wildfire Management</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing frequency and severity of wildfires requires advanced methods for effective surveillance and management. Traditional ground-based observation techniques often struggle to adapt to rapidly changing fire behavior and environmental conditions. This paper examines the application of multispectral aerial and satellite imagery in wildfire management, emphasizing the identification and analysis of key factors influencing wildfire behavior, such as combustible vegetation and water features. Through a comprehensive review of current literature and the presentation of two practical case studies, we assess various multispectral indices and evaluate their effectiveness in extracting critical environmental attributes essential for wildfire prevention and management. Our case studies highlight several indices as particularly effective for segmentation and extraction: NVDI for vegetation, MNDWI for water features, and MSR for artificial structures. These indices significantly enhance wildfire data processing, thereby supporting improved monitoring and response strategies.</description>

      <title>The Elemental Abundances of Ryugu: Assessment of Chemical Heterogeneities and the Nugget Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hayabusa 2 spacecraft sampled ~5.4 g of asteroid material from the Cb-type asteroid Ryugu. Initial analysis of the Ryugu materials revealed a mineralogical, chemical, and isotopic kinship to the CI chondrites. In this study, we have summarized the elemental abundances of Ryugu samples published to date, and evaluated their compositional variability associated with the CI chondrite data. The abundances of some elements (e.g., P, Ca, Mn, and rare earth elements) in individual Ryugu particles were found to show large relative dispersions compared to the other elements, presumably due to the nugget effect of aqueously formed minor secondary minerals (e.g., dolomite, apatite, magnetite, and pyrrhotite). Consequently, the mean abundances of Ryugu for these elements, calculated using currently available Ryugu data, are accompanied by a certain degree of uncertainties. We suggest establishing a consortium to determine the representative elemental abundances of Ryugu by measuring aliquots from a large homogenized powder sample that can mitigate the nugget effect. Our statistical calculation shows that at least 750 and 400 mg of homogenized samples from Chambers A and C, respectively, are needed to achieve within +/-5% compositional heterogeneity. The data obtained throughout the consortium activity complement the scientific objectives of the Hayabusa2 mission. Moreover, we anticipate that the obtained Ryugu data, coupled with the elemental abundances of CI chondrites, provide new insights into the chemical composition of the Solar System, which will be used by multidisciplinary communities, including Earth and planetary sciences, astronomy, physics, and chemistry.</description>

      <title>A three-layer model for the flow of particulate suspensions driven by sedimentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a system of shallow water-type equations to model laboratory experiments of particle-laden flows. We explore homogeneous liquid-solid suspensions of fine, non-cohesive, monodisperse glass beads which propagate as an equivalent fluid that progressively sediments and forms a growing deposit at the bottom of a smooth channel, and simultaneously creates a thin layer of pure liquid at the surface. The novelty of this model is twofold. First, we fully characterize the first-order behavior of these flows (mean velocity, runout distances and deposits geometry) through the sole sedimentation process of the grains. The model remains very simple and turns out to be effective despite the complex nature of interactions involved in these phenomena. Secondly, the sedimentation dynamics of the grains is observed to not be strongly affected by the flow, remaining comparable to that measured in static suspensions. The mathematical model is validated by comparing the experimental kinematics and deposit profiles with the simulations. The results highlight that this simplified model is able to describe the general features of these flows as well as their deposit morphology, provided that the settling rate is properly adjusted from a threshold Reynolds number, i.e. when the flow becomes sufficiently agitated to disturb and delay the deposition processes.</description>

      <title>Microstructural characterization to reveal evidence of shock deformation in a Campo del Cielo meteorite fragment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of meteorites and their microstructures is a topic which spans multiple fields of research, such as meteoritics and materials science. For materials scientists and engineers, the extreme and unusual conditions which these microstructures form allow for insight into materials which would exist at the edge of our thermomechanical processing abilities. One such microstructure found in low-shock event iron meteorites is Neumann bands. These bands are an array of lenticular deformation twins that form throughout the Fe-Ni matrix with numerous intersections, resulting in many high stress and strain regions within the material's surface. The existence of these regions and the shocks that formed them encourage atypical strain accommodating mechanisms and structural changes of the material. However, direct investigation of the deformation twin intersections and the microstructural behaviour in and around these regions has been limited. In this work, investigation of these regions in a Campo del Cielo meteorite fragment, with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and forescatter electron (FSE) imaging, revealed two primary findings: high-intensity pattern doubling mirrored across the {110} band at twin-twin intersection and microband formation across the sample surface, which suggest multilayer twinning and constraint of the crystal structure at points of twin-twin intersection. Microbands were found to form along the {110} plane and in regions near Neumann bands. The simultaneous existence of Neumann bands (microtwins) and microbands is presented here for a BCC material, and it is believed the Neumann band and microbands formed during different types and/or shock events. The presence of both Neumann bands and microbands within a BCC iron meteorite is previously unreported and may be valuable in furthering our understanding of shock deformation within iron-based materials.</description>

      <title>Soil creep facilitated by cyclic variations of environmental conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sloped terrains tend to creep downward over time, even when their slope is below the nominal angle of repose. This behavior can result from periodic variations in environmental conditions, such as daily or seasonal fluctuations in temperature and humidity. We study this process by considering a model of an athermal yield stress material under an applied stress lower than the critical yield stress value $\sigma_c$. Normally, in such a situation the material does not flow at all. However, under cyclic temporal variation of system parameters a finite amount of irreversible deformation can remain after each cycle, and a long term steady-state flow of the whole system can be induced. In our model, we cycle the strength of internal elastic interactions to mimic the effect of cyclic variation of environmental conditions in the real soils. We find that the amount of deformation per cycle increases if $\sigma_c$ is approached from below, and it decreases and even vanishes at a novel critical stress $\sigma_0&lt;\sigma_c$ when this, in turn, is reached from above. Interestingly, $\sigma_0$ plays a role similar to the endurance limit in the context of fatigue damage propagation. Despite the model's simplicity, our results offer a fresh perspective on subcritical landform evolution, with implications for the creep of hill slopes over long periods and the precursors to runaway landslides.</description>
