      <title>A Game Theoretic Approach to Sustainizability Over Sets and its application to a multi-species population model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a theorem is first proved which presents a game theoretic formulation of a necessary and sufficient sustainizability over a set condition for a general system described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Then, two additional theorems are proved for the n-species Gause-Lotka-Volterra (GLV) population model, establishing necessary and sufficient sustainability and sustainizability conditions over rectangular sets. Three case studies on the May-Leonard, 3-species, GLV model are then presented to illustrate the power of the above Theorems. In two of these case studies (2 and 3), it is shown that a particular instance of the 3-species, GLV model is unsustainable but sustainizable through allowable action.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Kinematics of Recursive Origami Inspired by Spidron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-periodic folding of periodic crease patterns paves the way to novel nonlinear phenomena that cannot be feasible through periodic folding. This paper focuses on the non-periodic folding of recursive crease patterns generalized from Spidron. Although it is known that Spidron has a 1-DOF isotropic rigid folding motion, its general kinematics and dependence on the crease pattern remain unclear. Using the kinematics of a single unit cell of Spidron and the recursive construction of the folded state of multiple unit cells, we consider the folding of Spidron that is not necessarily isotropic. We found that as the number of unit cells increases, the non-periodic folding is restricted and the isotropic folding becomes dominant. Then, we analyze the three kinds of isotropic folding modes by constructing 1-dimensional dynamical systems governing each of them. We show that the dynamical system can possess different recursive natures depending on folding modes even in an identical crease pattern. Furthermore, we show their novel nonlinear nature, including the period-doubling cascade leading to the emergence of chaos.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Interplay of Intrinsic Fluctuation and Complexity in Intracellular Calcium Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concentration of intracellular calcium ion (Ca$^{2+}$) exhibits complex oscillations, including bursting and chaos, as observed experimentally. These dynamics are influenced by inherent fluctuations within cells, which serve as crucial determinants in cellular decision-making processes and fate determination. In this study, we systematically explore the interplay between intrinsic fluctuation and the complexity of intracellular cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics using complexity measures such as permutation entropy (PE) and statistical complexity (SC). Using the chemical Langevin equation, we simulate the stochastic dynamics of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$. Our findings reveal that PE and SC effectively characterize the diverse, dynamic states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ and illustrate their interactions with intrinsic fluctuation. PE analysis elucidates that the chaotic state is more sensitive to intrinsic fluctuation than the other periodic states. Furthermore, we identify distinct states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ occupying specific locations within the theoretical bounds of the complexity-entropy causality plane. These locations indicate varying complexity and information content as intrinsic fluctuation varies. When adjusting the permutation order, the SC for the different states exhibits peaks in an intermediate range of intrinsic fluctuation values. Additionally, we identify scale-free or self-similar patterns in this intermediate range, which are further corroborated by multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. These high-complexity states likely correspond to optimal Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics with biological significance, revealing rich and complex dynamics shaped by the interplay of intrinsic fluctuation and complexity. Our investigation enhances our understanding of how intrinsic fluctuation modulates the complexity of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics that play crucial roles in biological cells.</description>

      <title>Fake turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional dynamical systems projected onto a reduced-order model cease to be deterministic and are best described by probability distributions in state space. Their equations of motion map onto an evolution operator with a deterministic component describing the projected dynamics, and a stochastic one from the neglected dimensions. It is shown that, for projections in which the deterministic component is dominant, `physics-free' stochastic Markovian models can be constructed that mimic many of the statistics of the real flow, even for fairly crude operator approximations. Deterministic models converge to steady states. This is related to general properties of Markov chains and illustrated with data-driven models for a moderate-Reynolds number turbulent channel.</description>
