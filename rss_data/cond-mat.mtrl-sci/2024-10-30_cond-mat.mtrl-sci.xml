      <title>MatExpert: Decomposing Materials Discovery by Mimicking Human Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material discovery is a critical research area with profound implications for various industries. In this work, we introduce MatExpert, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and contrastive learning to accelerate the discovery and design of new solid-state materials. Inspired by the workflow of human materials design experts, our approach integrates three key stages: retrieval, transition, and generation. First, in the retrieval stage, MatExpert identifies an existing material that closely matches the desired criteria. Second, in the transition stage, MatExpert outlines the necessary modifications to transform this material formulation to meet specific requirements outlined by the initial user query. Third, in the generation state, MatExpert performs detailed computations and structural generation to create new materials based on the provided information. Our experimental results demonstrate that MatExpert outperforms state-of-the-art methods in material generation tasks, achieving superior performance across various metrics including validity, distribution, and stability. As such, MatExpert represents a meaningful advancement in computational material discovery using langauge-based generative models.</description>

      <title>Do Small Hole Polarons Form in Bulk Rutile TiO$_2$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hole transport and localization through small polarons is essential to the performance of TiO$_2$ in photocatalysis applications. The existence of small hole polaron in bulk rutile TiO$_2$ has been however controversial with contradicting evidences from theory and experiments. Here, we use first principles computations and more specifically a Koopmans' compliant hybrid functional and charge correction to study small hole polarons in bulk rutile. We find that a fraction of exchange exists satisfying Koopmans' compliance for the polaron state and reproducing the band gap provided that charge correction is used. We clearly show that first principles computations indicate that the small hole polaron is unstable in bulk for rutile and stable for anatase TiO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Static and Microwave Properties of Amorphous Magnets Near Saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static and dynamic properties of magnetically soft amorphous ferromagnets have been studied analytically and numerically within random-field and random-anisotropy models. External field and coherent anisotropy that are weak compared to their random counterparts are sufficient to bring the magnet close to saturation. The scaling of spin-spin correlations in this regime is computed, and its dependence on parameters is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulation. We show that near the ferromagnetic resonance, the spin excitations are damped and spatially localized due to randomness even close to saturation. On increasing the strength of randomness, the localization length goes down in accordance with theoretical expectations, while the damping of spin excitations goes up.</description>

      <title>Giant Negative Linear Compressibility in Orthorhombic Copper Cyanide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most reported negative linear compressibility (NLC) materials exhibit either a small NLC over a large pressure range or a high NLC over a very small pressure range. Here, we report the remarkable discovery of giant NLC in the low-temperature form of CuCN (LT-CuCN) over an unusually large pressure range. High-pressure XRD studies on LT-CuCN observed the NLC of -20.5 TPa-1 along the a-axis at zero pressure, and the ambient orthorhombic phase remained stable up to 9.8 GPa. Pressure and temperature-dependent Raman studies identified the phonon vibrations responsible for NLC and negative thermal expansion (NTE).</description>

      <title>Role of Ion Milling Angle in Determining Conducting and Insulating States on SrTiO3 Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SrTiO3 (STO), a promising wide-bandgap semiconductor for high-k capacitors and photocatalysis, requires precise surface control for device fabrication. This study investigates the impact of ion milling on STO's surface conductivity. We find that ion milling at incident angles below 10 degree preserves the insulating state, while ion milling at larger angles induces a conducting surface with high electron mobility (5000-11000 cm2/Vs). This transition is attributed to the milling penetration depth exceeding the STO lattice constant (3.905 {\AA}). Our results provide valuable insights for optimizing STO-based device fabrication, enabling precise control over surface properties while maintaining desired insulating characteristics.</description>

      <title>Exchange bias-like behavior due to hidden local magnetic state in a Weyl semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Weyl semimetals, which couple magnetic order with topological features, have emerged as promising candidates for advanced topological-materials-based applications. The switching of magnetization and the driving of domain wall motion play key roles in developing such applications. In this study, we suggest that a type of hard-magnetic nuclei dominates the magnetic reversal and induces an exchange bias-like behavior with a prior magnetic history in the bulk Co3Sn2S2 Weyl semimetal. The sign change of the exchange bias-like behavior can be realized by controlling the orientation of such hard-magnetic nuclei. Remarkably, these nuclei can retain their magnetic orientation at a temperature well above the Curie temperature of this material, suggesting the existence of a local magnetic state with non-zero magnetization and high stability. This local state is potentially related to the spin-orbit polaron reported in this system. Our study offers a new scenario for manipulating the magnetic reversal and offers new insights into the magnetism in this Weyl system.</description>

      <title>Single-domain imaging in topological insulator Bi2Te3 thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single crystalline materials, different from polycrystalline and twinning structures, are desired for investigating the intrinsic physical properties, as grain and twin boundaries often work as a source of artifacts. Bismuth chalcogenides, which are van der Waals materials notable as topological insulators, have attracted significant interest due to their rich physical properties. However, the formation of 60{\deg} twin domains is common in these materials. Here, we demonstrate single-domain bismuth chalcogenides. Using atomic force microscopy, we investigated the morphology of Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 grown on Al2O3. Despite lattice constants of Bi2Se3 and Al2O3 substrates being well matched with hybrid symmetry epitaxy, Bi2Se3 exhibited 60{\deg} twin boundaries across the surface. Interestingly, Bi2Te3 showed a single-domain feature across the 10 mm by 10 mm sample even with lattice mismatch. While further in-depth studies are required to understand this difference in the morphology between Bi2Se3/Al2O3 and Bi2Te3/Al2O3, we suggest that the formation of twin boundaries in bismuth chalcogenides is related to the interaction between quintuple layers across the van der Waals gap rather than strain or defects.</description>

      <title>Organic compounds in metallic hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic hydrogen is the most common condensed material in the universe, comprising the centre of gas giant planets. However, experimental studies are extremely challenging, and most of our understanding of this material has been led by theory. Chemistry in this environment has not been probed experimentally, so here we examine hydrocarbon chemistry in metallic hydrogen using density functional theory calculations. We find that carbon and oxygen react with metallic hydrogen to produce an entirely new type of hydrocarbon chemistry based on sixfold coordinated carbon with organic-style molecules CH6, C2H8, C3H10 OH3 NH4 and CH4OH. These are charged molecules stabilised by the metallic environment. Their associated electric fields are screened, giving oscillation in the surrounding electron and proton densities. In view of the excess hydrogen we refer to them as hypermethane, hyperethane etc. The relationship to traditional chemistry is that the metallic background acts as an electron donor and stabilizes negatively charged ions. This enables the formation of six covalent bonds per carbon atom, or three per oxygen atom. This demonstrates that organic chemistry may take place in very different environments from those found on earth, and may be common throughout the universe.</description>

      <title>Impact of synthesis method on the structure and function of high entropy oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The term sample dependence describes the troublesome tendency of nominally equivalent samples to exhibit different physical properties. High entropy oxides (HEOs) are a class of materials where sample dependence has the potential to be particularly profound due to their inherent chemical complexity. In this work, we prepare a spinel HEO of identical nominal composition by five distinct methods, spanning a range of thermodynamic and kinetic conditions: solid state, high pressure, hydrothermal, molten salt, and combustion syntheses. By structurally characterizing these five samples across all length scales with a variety of x-ray methods, we find that while the average structure is unaltered, the samples vary significantly in their local structures and their microstructures. The most profound differences are observed at intermediate length scales, both in terms of crystallite morphology and cation homogeneity. As revealed by x-ray fluorescence microscopy ideal cation homogeneity is achieved only in the case of combustion synthesis. These structural differences in turn significantly alter the observed functional properties, which we demonstrate via characterization of their magnetic response. While ferrimagnetic order is retained across all five samples, the sharpness of the transition, the size of the saturated moment, and the coercivity all show marked variations with synthesis method. We conclude that the chemical flexibility inherent to HEOs is complemented by strong synthesis method dependence, providing another axis along which to optimize these materials for a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Inherent circular dichroism of phonons in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the infrared-active phonons in ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn3S3 using optical spectroscopy. Below the Curie temperature (T~175~K), we observed asymmetric Fano lineshapes of phonons peaks in the optical conductivities, reflecting the presence of electron-phonon coupling (EPC). Additionally, the detected phonon signals by the polar Kerr rotation and the ellipticity spectroscopy indicate the circular dichroism (CD) of phonons. We attribute the CD of phonons to their distinct couplings with charge excitations on the tilted Weyl nodal rings in two circularly polarized channels. Our findings provide experimental evidence that, without external fields, phonons can also become circularly polarized by coupling with the electronic topology. Since the magnetic exchange splitting gradually shifts the topological bands in Co3Sn2S2, the CD of phonons exhibits significant temperature dependence, hinting at a promising approach for manipulation.</description>

      <title>Fractal structure, depinning, and hysteresis of dislocations in high-entropy alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are complex alloys containing multiple elements in high concentrations. Plasticity in HEAs is carried by dislocations, but the random nature of their composition pins dislocations, effectively hindering their motion. We investigate the resulting complex structure of the dislocation in terms of spatial correlation functions, which allow us to draw conclusions on the fractal geometry of the dislocation. At high temperature, where thermal fluctuations dominate, dislocations adopt the structure of a random walk with Hurst exponent $1/2$ or fractal dimension $3/2$. At low temperature we find larger Hurst exponents (lower dimensions), with a crossover to an uncorrelated structure beyond a correlation length. These changes in structure are accompanied by an emergence of hysteresis (and hence pinning) in the motion of the dislocation at low temperature. We use a modified Labusch/Edwards-Wilkinson-model to argue that this correlation length must be an intrinsic property of the HEA. This means dislocations in HEAs are an individual pinning limit, where segments of the dislocation are independently pinned by local distortions of the crystal lattice that are induced by chemical heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>A continuous symmetry breaking measure for finite clusters using Jensen-Shannon divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantitative measure of symmetry breaking is introduced that allows the quantification of which symmetries are most strongly broken due to the introduction of some kind of defect in a perfect structure. The method uses a statistical approach based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The measure is calculated by comparing the transformed atomic density function with its original. Software code is presented that carries the calculations out numerically using Monte Carlo methods. The behavior of this symmetry breaking measure is tested for various cases including finite size crystallites (where the surfaces break the crystallographic symmetry), atomic displacements from high symmetry positions, and collective motions of atoms due to rotations of rigid octahedra. The approach provides a powerful tool for assessing local symmetry breaking and offers new insights that can help researchers understand how different structural distortions affect different symmetry operations.</description>

      <title>Collective Oxygen Transport in Tetragonal Ta$_\mathbf{2}$O$_\mathbf{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In crystalline materials, atomic motion is generally confined to vibrations within a fixed lattice, with significant movement beyond vibrations usually associated with defect migration. Here, we present the discovery of collective ionic transport within the tetragonal phase of tantalum pentoxide (Ta$_{2}$O$_{5}$), a material whose atomic structure has long been a mystery. Through density functional theory calculations, we have definitively determined its atomic structure to be a four-fold screw-symmetric configuration derived from the orthorhombic phase of Ta$_{2}$O$_{5}$. Remarkably, ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations of this structure reveal that specific oxygen atoms undergo collective, floating movements at temperatures as low as a few hundred degrees Celsius, even in the absence of defects. The calculated energy barrier for this motion is exceptionally low (0.2 eV), attributed to extensive structural relaxation around the oxygen transport pathways and the resulting dynamic charge rebalancing. These findings elucidate the previously unexplained high oxygen conductivity in tetragonal Ta$_{2}$O$_{5}$ and provide new insights for designing materials with enhanced atomic mobility.</description>

      <title>Room temperature Multiferroicity and Magnetoelectric coupling in (1-x) BaTiO$_{3-}$(x) CaMnO$_3$ solid solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with magnetoelectric coupling (MEC) between ferroic orders at room temperature are extremely important in modern technology and physics. BaTiO$_3$ is a robust ferroelectric in which several doping have led to MEC. However, often MEC depends on the amount of substitution. In a series of (1-x)BaTiO$_{3.}$(x)CaMnO$_3$ (x=0,0.03, 0.06, 0.09), MEC was only observed in (0.97)BaTiO$_{3.}$(0.03)CaMnO$_3$. The structural modifications with changing substitution reveal a reduced Ti-O-Ti angle for this sample which is the most ferromagnetic in nature. A mixed phase of tetragonal P4mm and hexagonal P6$_3$/mmc space groups of BaTiO$_3$ is observed in the substituted samples, with nominal contribution of the hexagonal phase for x=0.03. A valence state study using XPS and XANES reveals the presence of enhanced proportion of Mn3+ ions in the sample which support a Jahn-Teller distortion, thereby supporting the ferroelectricity for x=0.03. Indirect and direct evidences of MEC was obtained from magnetodielectric and magnetoelectric measurements. A magnetocapacitance of 0.4% was observed with a dc magnetic field of 4kOe at 10kHz, while magnetoelectric coupling coefficient, $\alpha_{\rm ME} \sim 88$ mVcm$^{-1}$Oe$^{-1}$ was obtained for dc magnetic field of 600 Oe and a 10Hz ac field of 40 Oe. Such MEC was not observed for higher substitution which emphasizes the sensitivity of the structural properties on substitution.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the Jahn-Teller effect and magnetic anisotropy in wurtzite Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$N. We search for structural and electronic properties such as the atomic displacements, the Jahn-Teller energy gain, and the density of states. The resulting density of states is dramatically different from previous electronic structure calculations. We obtain a semi-insulating ground state with a small energy gap. Moreover, our present work observes that previous models, based on single ion approximation, fall short of accurately describing the magnetic behavior of (Ga,Mn)N. In realistic thin films, there is a significant probability of the formation of nearest-neighbor Mn-Mn pairs, which break the local symmetry of otherwise isolated magnetic ions; therefore, theoretical models based on isolated Mn ions are incomplete. In our first-principles investigation, we introduce a second Mn ion in the nearest cation position in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Exploring the magnetic energy as a function of spherical angles highlights the presence of additional anisotropy along the Mn-Mn direction, elucidating nuanced magnetic behavior in response to the presence of the nearest-neighbor Mn-Mn pairs. The present investigation adds the missing puzzle in refining our previous theoretical framework used to simulate magnetic properties, including ferromagnetic resonance studies, in Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$N layers.</description>

      <title>Spin wave frequency hysteresis in Ir/Co/Pt multilayers with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results of extensive combined experimental and theoretical investigations on static and dynamic properties of Ir/Co/Pt multilayer with low uniaxial anisotropy and asymmetric Ir/Co and Co/Pt interfaces responsible for large interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (IDMI) are presented. Within longitudinal magneto-optical Kerr effect-based microscopy and magnetic force microscopy studies a complex magnetic configuration was detected: large in-plane magnetized domains of several dozen micrometers size were modulated by a weak stripe domain pattern with periods of about 100 nm. Using Brillouin Light Scattering spectrometry, the hysteresis of the Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks frequencies was observed as a function of the magnetic field. This hysteretic behavior associated with IDMI-induced asymmetry of spin waves dispersion is correlated with switching of the large macro-domains. Using micromagnetic simulations we determine field-dependent magnetization distributions and dispersion relations, proposing an explanation of the observed behavior. The investigated nanostructure can be used as non-volatile spin waves velocity switcher.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to lead-based perovskites, double perovskites have attracted considerable interest due to their ability to modulate photovoltaic properties and high stability through elemental control. However, most double perovskites are mainly faced with large band gap ranges and indirect band gaps. Here, we report the structural, electronic, and optical properties of the double perovskites Cs2RhAgX6 and Cs2IrAgX6 (X = Cl, Br and I) by first-principles calculations. The results of the thermodynamic stability and electronic properties show that the double perovskites have a higher stability and exhibit a suitable band gap range in the field of optoelectronics, their band gap decrease with the substitution of halogen elements from Cl to I (0.55-2.2 eV). In addition, the double perovskite exhibits strong light absorption. These results suggest a great potential for Cs2RhAgX6 and Cs2IrAgX6 (X = Cl, Br and I) perovskites in optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>In-situ Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction Nano-tensile Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology for in-situ Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction (TKD) nano-tensile testing that enables nanoscale characterization of the evolution of complex plasticity mechanisms. By integrating a modified in-situ Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) nanoindenter with a microscale push-to-pull device and a conventional Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) detector, we achieved TKD measurements at high spatial resolution during mechanical deformation. A dedicated Focused Ion Beam (FIB) procedure was developed for site-specific specimen fabrication, including lift-out, thinning, and shaping into a dog-bone geometry. The methodology was demonstrated on two case studies: (i) a metastable $\beta$-Ti single crystal, on which we quantified the initiation and evolution of nanoscale twinning and stress-induced martensitic transformation, and (ii) a $CuAl/Al_2O_3$ nanolaminate, which showed nanoscale plasticity and twinning/detwinning in a complex microstructure. Overall, this approach provides a robust alternative to in-situ EBSD and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) testing, facilitating detailed analysis of deformation mechanisms at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design Method with Enhanced Sampling for Complex Open Crystals: Application to Novel Zeolite Self-Assembly in a Coarse-Grained Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing the synthesis of zeolites and exploring novel frameworks offer pivotal opportunities and challenges in materials design. While inverse design proves highly effective for simpler crystals, its application to intricate structures like zeolites poses severe challenges. Here, we introduce an innovative inverse design workflow tailored to efficiently reproduce target zeolite frameworks in a binary coarse-grained model using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations. This workflow integrates an evolutionary parameter optimization strategy with a variant of the seeding approach. Using this method, we successfully reproduce Z1 and SGT zeolites, and Type-I clathrates, find new optimal parameters for known phases, such as the SOD and CFI, and even discover novel frameworks, such as Z5. This is done within a simple coarse-grained model for a tetrahedra-forming component and a structure-directing agent. Our methodology not only enables the screening of synthesis protocols but also facilitates the discovery of hypothetical zeolites.</description>

      <title>Topological surface state dominated nonlinear transverse response and microwave rectification at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) offers a novel means of uncovering symmetry and topological properties in quantum materials, holding promise for exotic (opto)electronic applications such as microwave rectification and THz detection. The BCD-independent NLHE could exhibit a robust response even at room temperature, which is highly desirable for practical applications. However, in materials with bulk inversion symmetry, the coexistence of bulk and surface conducting channels often leads to a suppressed NLHE and complex thickness-dependent behavior. Here, we report the observation of room-temperature nonlinear transverse response in 3D topological insulator Bi2Te3 thin films, whose electrical transport properties are dominated by topological surface state (TSS). By varying the thickness of Bi2Te3 epitaxial films from 7 nm to 50 nm, we found that the nonlinear transverse response increases with thickness from 7 nm to 25 nm and remains almost constant above 25 nm. This is consistent with the thickness-dependent basic transport properties, including conductance, carrier density, and mobility, indicating a pure and robust TSS-dominated linear and nonlinear transport in thick (&gt;25 nm) Bi2Te3 films. The weaker nonlinear transverse response in Bi2Te3 below 25 nm was attributed to Te deficiency and poorer crystallinity. By utilizing the TSS-dominated electrical second harmonic generation, we successfully achieved the microwave rectification from 0.01 to 16.6 GHz in 30 nm and bulk Bi2Te3. Our work demonstrated the room temperature nonlinear transverse response in a paradigm topological insulator, addressing the tunability of the topological second harmonic response by thickness engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22158v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a first-principles density functional theory (DFT) computational investigation of the luminescence and absorption lineshapes associated with the neutral carbon-oxygen interstitial pair (CiOi) defect in silicon. We obtain the lineshapes of the defect in the dilute limit using a computational methodology that constructs dynamical matrices of supercells containing tens of thousands of atoms, utilizing systems directly accessible through DFT. Both perturbed bulk phonons and localized vibrations contribute to the phonon sideband. We achieve excellent agreement with experimental luminescence data. Our findings further reinforce the attribution of the well-known C-line in silicon to the neutral CiOi complex.</description>

      <title>Raman Polarization Switching in CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconducting CrSBr is a layered A-type antiferromagnet, with individual layers antiferromagnetically coupled along the stacking direction. Due to its unique orthorhombic crystal structure, CrSBr exhibits highly anisotropic mechanical and optoelectronic properties acting itself as a quasi-1D material. CrSBr demonstrates complex coupling phenomena involving phonons, excitons, magnons, and polaritons. Here we show through polarization-resolved resonant Raman scattering the intricate interaction between the vibrational and electronic properties of CrSBr. For samples spanning from few-layer to bulk thickness, we observe that the polarization of the A$_g^2$ Raman mode can be rotated by 90 degrees, shifting from alignment with the crystallographic a (intermediate magnetic) axis to the b (easy magnetic) axis, depending on the excitation energy. In contrast, the A$_g^1$ and A$_g^3$ modes consistently remain polarized along the b axis, regardless of the laser energy used. We access real and imaginary parts of the Raman tensor in our analysis, uncovering resonant electron-phonon coupling.</description>

      <title>Insulating moir\'e homobilayers lack a threefold symmetric second harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atoms within moir\'e bilayers relax in-plane to minimize elastic energy [e.g., Cazeaux et al., J. Elast. 154, 443 (2023)]; such relaxation brings their space group symmetries down to P1. Here, the ab initio second harmonic generation (SHG) of twisted and atomistically optimized hBN bilayers was determined at four twist angles ($\theta=38.21^{\circ}$, $60.00^{\circ}$, $73.17^{\circ}$, and $98.21^{\circ}$) and for three displacements $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ measured away from the ground state $AA^{\prime}$ configuration. All moir\'e bilayers have a P1 space symmetry after structural optimization. This situation is quite different to monolayers with hexagonal lattices, which retain a three-fold symmetry. We point out that the actual symmetries of the SHG reported for hBN bilayers on two experimental works do not coincide with the sixfold symmetric theoretical profiles they provide [either $\sin^2(3\phi)$ or $\cos^2(3\phi)$], and show that the intrinsic low structural symmetry of (atomically optimized) hBN bilayer moir\'es can in fact be read out from experimental SHG intensity profiles--which are tunable by $\theta$ and by the frequency of light $\omega$: The SHG is most definitely not sixfold-symmetric because moir\'es do not retain a three-fold symmetry. Furthermore, an extrinsic twofold symmetry of the SHG emission is realized by tilting the pump by an angle $\alpha$ away from the 2D material's normal, regardless of $\theta$ and $\omega$. The design of in-plane and ultrathin sources of SHG with low symmetry could be useful for the eventual creation of entanglement sources from 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic exchange fields and domain wall superconductivity at an all-oxide superconductor / ferromagnet insulator interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:1804.02094v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At a superconductor-ferromagnet (S/F) interface, the F layer can introduce a magnetic exchange field within the S layer, which acts to locally spin split the superconducting density of states. The effect of magnetic exchange fields on superconductivity has been thoroughly explored at S-ferromagnet insulator (S/FI) interfaces for isotropic s-wave S and a thickness that is smaller than the superconducting coherence length. Here we report a magnetic exchange field effect at an all-oxide S/FI interface involving the anisotropic d-wave high temperature superconductor praseodymium cerium copper oxide (PCCO) and the FI praseodymium calcium manganese oxide (PCMO). The magnetic exchange field in PCCO, detected via magnetotransport measurements through the superconducting transition, is localized to the PCCO/PCMO interface with an average magnitude that depends on the presence or absence of magnetic domain walls in PCMO. The results are promising for the development of all-oxide superconducting spintronic devices involving unconventional pairing and high temperature superconductors.</description>

Abstract: During the dielectric breakdown process of thin solid-state nanopores, the application of high voltages may cause the formation of multi-nanopores on one chip, which number and sizes are important for their applications. Here, simulations were conducted to mimic the investigation of in situ nanopore detection with scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM). Results show that SICM can provide accurate nanopore location and relative pore size. Detection resolution is influenced by the dimensions of the applied probe and separation between the probe and membranes, which can be enhanced under large voltages or a concentration gradient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal nitrides possess exceptional catalytic, electronic and physical properties making them widely used in (opto-)electronics and as hard coatings. When used as films in surface-active applications, however, their performance remains limited by poor mass transfer and reduced accessibility of reactive sites. This is associated to compact film architecture yielded by conventional deposition techniques (e.g., 16-26% for sputtered W$_2$N). Here, we demonstrate a template-free method for the design of highly porous (porosity &gt; 84%) metal nitride films with high compositional versatility, as demonstrated for Cu3N, W2N, MoNx and TiN. These are obtained by exploiting the self-assembly of fractal-like metal oxide agglomerates during deposition from aerosols followed by their dry nitridation. In case of Cu$_3$N, monocristalline oxide nanoparticles were converted to polycrystalline nitrides during nitridation, as traced by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. Such films feature consistently lower resistances than their metal oxide counterparts, as well as high reactivity and mass transfer. This is exploited exemplarily for molecular sensing of NO$_2$ at only 75$^\circ$C temperature, leading to up to a five-fold higher response with faster response time over more compact spin-coated films for. As a result, our approach overcomes critical mass transfer performance limitations of metal nitride films that are also relevant for other applications like electrocatalysis and energy storage.</description>

      <title>Complete mathematical theory of the jamming transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone \&amp; Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson \&amp; Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].</description>

      <title>Optimization of a lattice spring model with elastoplastic conducting springs: A case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a simple lattice spring model in which every spring is elastoplastic and is capable to conduct current. The elasticity bounds of spring $i$ are taken as $[-c_i,c_i]$ and the resistance of spring $i$ is taken as $1/c_i$, which allows us to compute the resistance of the system. The model is further subjected to a gradual stretching and, due to plasticity, the response force increases until a certain terminal value. We demonstrate that the recently developed sweeping process theory can be used to optimize the interplay between the terminal response force and the resistance on a physical domain of parameters $c_i.$ The proposed methodology can be used by practitioners for the design of multi-functional materials as an alternative to topological optimization.</description>

      <title>Voronoi Entropy and long-range order of 2D point sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Voronoi Entropy (VE) and the continuous measure of symmetry (CSM) characterize the orderliness of a set of points on a 2D plane. The Voronoi entropy is the Shannon entropy of the Voronoi tessellation of the plane into polygons, quantifying the diversity of polygons. The VE is widely used to study the self-assembly of colloidal, supramolecular, and other systems. The value of VE changes from S=0 for a completely ordered system, built of polygons with an equal number of sides, to S=1.690+/-0.001 for a random set of points. While the VE takes into account only neighboring polygons, covering the 2D plane imposes constraints on the number of polygons and the number of edges in polygons. Consequently, unlike the conventional Shannon Entropy, the VE captures some long-range order properties of the system. We calculate the VE for several hyperuniform sets of points and compare it with the values of exponents of collective density variables characterizing long-range correlations in the system. We show that the VE correlates with the latter up to a certain saturation level, after which the value of the VE falls to S=0, and we explain this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Topological electronic structure and electronic nematicity in candidate kagome superconductors, ATi$_{3}$Bi$_{5}$ (A = Rb, Cs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The newly discovered family of titanium-based kagome metals, ATi$_{3}$Bi$_{5}$ (where A can be Rb or Cs), has been found to exhibit non-trivial band topology and fascinating electronic instabilities, including electronic nematicity and potential bulk superconductivity. Distinct from their vanadium-based counterparts (AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$), which display a charge density wave (CDW) phase that already breaks rotational symmetry, ATi$_{3}$Bi$_{5}$ shows no evidence of CDW, providing a unique platform to study nematicity in its pure form and its interplay with other correlated quantum phenomena, such as superconductivity. In this review, we highlight recent progress in both experimental and theoretical research on ATi$_{3}$Bi$_{5}$ and discuss the unresolved questions and challenges in this burgeoning field.</description>

      <title>N\'eel Spin-Orbit Torque in Antiferromagnetic Quantum Spin and Anomalous Hall Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interplay between magnetic ordering and topological electrons not only enables new topological phases but also underpins electrical control of magnetism. Here we extend the Kane-Mele model to include the exchange coupling to a collinear background antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, which can describe transition metal trichalcogenides. Owing to the spin-orbit coupling and staggered on-site potential, the system could exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall and quantum spin Hall effects in the absence of a net magnetization. Besides the chiral edge states, these topological phases support a staggered Edelstein effect through which an applied electric field can generate opposite non-equilibrium spins on the two AFM sublattices, realizing the N\'eel-type spin-orbit torque (NSOT). Contrary to known NSOTs in AFM metals driven by conduction currents, our NSOT arises from pure adiabatic currents devoid of Joule heating, while being a bulk effect not carried by the edge currents. By virtue of the NSOT, the electric field of a microwave can drive the AFM dynamics with a remarkably high efficiency. Compared to the ordinary AFM resonance driven by the magnetic field, the new mechanism can enhance the resonance amplitude by more than one order of magnitude and the absorption rate of the microwave power by over two orders of magnitude. Our findings unravel an incredible way to exploit AFM topological phases to achieve ultrafast magnetic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Electromotive force generation in a ferromagnetic metal thin film under the ferromagnetic resonance excitation with permanent magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) excitation of a ferromagnetic metal single-layer film was tried by using a couple of permanent magnets as the source of the uniform static magnetic field and by using a co-planer waveguide connected with a network analyzer as the source of the radiofrequency (RF) magnetic field. A typical FMR spectrum of a ferromagnetic Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ thin film was successfully obtained and a clear electromotive force (EMF) was generated in the Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ thin film under the FMR excitation with the permanent magnets. That is, we achieved EMF generation in a Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ thin film under the FMR excitation with the permanent magnets, which can be applied as a simple energy transduction technology from ambient RF energy to electrical energy.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Janus IV-B transition metal chalcogenide hydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional Janus transition-metal chalcogenide -hydrides (2D-JTMCs) feature a three layered structure, with a central layer of transition metal atoms, with chalcogenides below and hydogens above. This asymmetry endows 2D-JTMCs with unique and tunable electronic, optical, and mechanical properties. In this paper, we systematically investigate two-dimensional hexagonal 2H and 1T Janus transition metal chalcogenide (JTMC) hydrides (MXH), with M = Ti, Zr, Hf, and X = S, Se, Te. These JTMCs exhibit metallic behavior with single band crossings at the Fermi level, primarily dominated by transition metal d orbitals and phonon stability, evidenced by DFPT calculations. We estimate Tc using the Allen-Dynes formula and the closing superconducting gap by solving anisotropic gap equations of the Migdal-Eliashberg equations. Calculated Tc values for these materials range from 10 K to 35 K.</description>

      <title>Structural and electrical properties of fiber textured and epitaxial molybdenum thin films prepared by magnetron sputter epitaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molybdenum (Mo) due to its optimal structural, physical, and acoustic properties find application as electrode material in aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) and aluminum nitride (AlN) based bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators. Epitaxial Mo thin films exhibiting low resistivity can improve the performance of the BAW resonator by enhancing both the electromechanical coupling coefficient and quality factor. In this study, we systematically vary the growth temperature of Mo grown on fiber-textured and epitaxial wurtzite-aluminum nitride (AlN) to study the changes in structural and electrical properties of the Mo films. Results show that Mo grown at 700{\deg}C on epitaxial AlN exhibit low surface roughness, large average grain diameter, low resistivity, and high crystal quality. XRD pole figure and phi-scan reveal that irrespective of the growth temperature, Mo is fiber textured on fiber-textured AlN, and has three rotational domains on epitaxial AlN. The study shows that the resistivity of Mo reduces with increasing growth temperature, which we relate to increasing average grain diameter. Additionally, we show that fiber-textured Mo has more high angle grain boundaries resulting in consistently higher resistivity than its epitaxial equivalent.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Order and Long-Range Interactions in Mesoscopic Ising Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the design of magnetic ordering in one-dimensional mesoscopic magnetic Ising chains by modulating long-range interactions. These interactions are affected by geometrical modifications to the chain, which adjust the energy hierarchy and the resulting magnetic ground states. Consequently, the magnetic ordering can be tuned between antiferromagnetic and dimer antiferromagnetic phases. These phases are experimentally observed in chains fabricated using both conventional electron-beam lithography and ion implantation techniques, demonstrating the feasibility of controlling magnetic properties at the mesoscale. The ability of attaining these magnetic structures by thermal annealing, underlines the potential of using such systems instead of simulated annealers in tackling combinatorial optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectric polymer generators: the large bending regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an important difference between piezoelectric polymer films and solid crystals for the application to piezoelectric generators. In the case of polymers, the optimal piezoelectric response imposes {\it a large bending regime}. Starting from the linear Curie's constitutive equations, we develop an analytical model under the assumption of the large bending regime resulting from bulge testing configuration. This model shows a specific non-linear piezoelectric response, that follows a power $2/3$ of the mechanical excitation. The piezoelectric voltage and the corresponding power are then studied experimentally as a function of the angular frequency $\omega$ of the mechanical excitation, the load resistance $R$, and the thickness of the film $\ell$. The experimental results carried out on piezoelectric PVDF films validate the model.</description>

      <title>Low-Dimensional Solid-State Single-Photon Emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state single-photon emitters (SPEs) are attracting significant attention as fundamental components in quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Low-dimensional materials-based SPEs (LD-SPEs) have drawn particular interest due to their high photon extraction efficiency, ease of integration with photonic circuits, and strong coupling with external fields. The accessible surfaces of LD materials allow for deterministic control over quantum light emission, while enhanced quantum confinement and light-matter interactions improve photon emissive properties. This review examines recent progress in LDSPEs across four key materials: zero-dimensional (0D) semiconductor quantum dots, one-dimensional (1D) nanotubes, two-dimensional (2D) materials, including hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). We explore their structural and photophysical properties, along with techniques such as spectral tuning and cavity coupling that enhance SPE performance. Finally, we address future challenges and suggest strategies for optimizing LD-SPEs for practical quantum applications.</description>

      <title>On resolving meso-scale calculations of pore-collapse-generated hotspots in energetic crystals for consistency with atomistic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meso-scale calculations of pore collapse and hotspot formation in energetic crystals provide closure models to macro-scale hydrocodes for predicting the shock sensitivity of energetic materials. To this end, previous works obtained atomistics-consistent material models for two common energetic crystals, HMX and RDX, such that pore collapse calculations adhered closely to molecular dynamics (MD) results on key features of energy localization, particularly the profiles of the collapsing pores, appearance of shear bands, and the transition from viscoplastic to hydrodynamic collapse. However, some important aspects such as the temperature distributions in the hotspot were not as well captured. One potential issue was noted but not resolved adequately in those works, namely the grid resolution that should be employed in the meso-scale calculations for various pore sizes and shock strengths. Conventional computational mechanics guidelines for selecting meshes as fine as possible, balancing computational effort, accuracy and grid independence, were shown not to produce physically consistent features associated with shear localization. Here, we examine the physics of pore collapse, shear band evolution and structure, and hotspot formation, for both HMX and RDX; we then evaluate under what conditions atomistics-consistent models yield physically correct (considering MD as ground truth) hotspots for a range of pore diameters, from nm to microns, and for a wide range of shock strengths. The study provides insights into the effects of pore size and shock strength on pore collapse and hotspots, identifying aspects such as size-independent behaviors, and proportion of energy contained in shear as opposed to jet impact-heated regions of the hotspot. Areas for further improvement of atomistics-consistent material models are also indicated.</description>

      <title>Procedures for proper validation of record critical current density claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High critical current density Jc is generally the most important property of any superconductor used for applications. The critical current Ic is most frequently measured by transport 4 probe V-I techniques and the measured Ic is then divided by the cross-sectional area to give the critical current density Jc. This method is normally error-free. Occasionally however, Ic and Jc are computed from measurements of the magnetic moment and two recent papers (Goyal et al. 2024 Nat. Commun. 15, 6523 and Polichetti et al. 2024 arXiv:2410.09197) illustrate some of the perils of reporting properties of REBa2Cu3O7-{\delta} (REBCO) films grown on a coated conductor substrate using only magnetic evaluations. Correct data analysis is made difficult by the persistent use of cgs units in commercial instrument outputs and by misapplication of handbook Bean model formulae, which in this case led to an order of magnitude Jc overestimate, which of course renders the original world record claim invalid. The laudable attempt of the authors to explain their original mistake has unfortunately its own errors. Here we explain explicitly how errors are still present in the second paper and provide correct expressions for the conversion of magnetic moments to Jc values using Bean model expressions. An important conclusion is that record Jc values ought always to be validated by real transport measurements and by cross-reference to similar samples and their reported Jc values.</description>

Abstract: We investigate how growth of an oxide film will influence the deuterium recycling properties of Li on plasma facing surfaces. Lithium films on the walls or plasma-facing material surfaces of a fusion vacuum vessel improves plasma performance in part by removing residual impurity atoms from the plasma. Oxygen atoms, from residual water vapor or eroded oxide surfaces, are a prominent ubiquitous impurity that can create a layer of oxide on lithium films. The results of the work herein also indicate a possibility for determining the thickness of the oxide layer on such Li films by measuring the reflection probability of incident deuterium particles from the surface.</description>

Abstract: Efficient hybrid DFT simulations of solid state materials would be extremely beneficial for computational chemistry and materials science, but is presently bottlenecked by difficulties in computing Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange with plane wave orbital bases. We present a GPU-accelerated, Gaussian orbital based integral algorithm for systems with periodic boundary conditions, which takes advantage of Ewald summation to efficiently compute electrostatic interactions. We have implemented this approach into the TeraChem software package within the $\Gamma$ point approximation, enabling simulation of unit cells with hundreds or thousands of atoms at the HF or hybrid DFT level on a single GPU card. Our implementation readily parallelizes over multiple GPUs and paves the road to accurate simulation of the properties and dynamics of extended materials in both the ground and excited states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The knowledge of Half-Heusler compounds have attracted much attention as materials for thermoelectric applications. In this work, we investigate, using first-principles calculations, the electronic, vibrational, and defect properties of TiXSn (X=Ni, Pd, Pt) half-Heusler compounds. The knowledge of such properties is vital for the understanding and improvement of thermoelectric transport properties of these materials. The band gap of the three compounds increase with the atomic number of the group 10 elements, in agreement with previous findings. The electronic effective masses of the three compounds are similar, while the heavy hole effective mass of TiPtSn is larger than those of the other two materials. Our calculations of the phonon dispersion included the calculation of the LO-TO splitting indicating that TiNiSn has a stronger ionic character and polar scattering of charge carriers by optical phonons in the case of low doping. Calculation of the formation energy of Ni interstitial defect in TiNiSn is very low, in agreement with previous results. Surprisingly, for the Pd interstitial in TiPdSn the formation energy is negative, suggesting that the full-Heusler structure can be more stable than the half-Heusler one. On the other hand, the formation energy of an interstitial in TiPtSn is significantly higher, suggesting smaller effects on both electronic structure and transport properties. The formation energy of all substitutional defects investigated are substantially higher than that of interstitial ones, suggesting that they should occur in very low concentrations.</description>

Abstract: While extensive studies have been conducted on purely elastic ribbons, in this paper we explore the influence of magnetisation on the deformation of planar ferromagnetic elastic ribbons. We begin the investigation by deriving the leading-order magnetic energy associated with a curved planar ferromagnetic elastic ribbon. The sum of the magnetic and the elastic energy is the total energy of the ribbon. We derive the equilibrium equations by taking the first variation of the total energy. We then systematically determine and analyse solutions to these equilibrium equations under various canonical boundary conditions. We also analyse the stability of the equilibrium solutions. Comparing our findings with the well-studied Euler's Elastica provides insights into the magnetic effects on the deformation behaviour of elastic ribbons. Our analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between magnetisation and the mechanical response of planar ferromagnetic structures, and offers valuable insights for both theoretical and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Observation of converse flexoelectric effect in topological semimetals</title>

Abstract: A strong coupling between electric polarization and elastic deformation in solids is an important factor in creating useful electromechanical nanodevices. Such coupling is typically allowed in insulating materials with inversion symmetry breaking as exemplified by the piezoelectric effect in ferroelectric materials. Therefore, materials with metallicity and centrosymmetry have tended to be out of scope in this perspective. Here, we report the observation of giant elastic deformation by the application of an alternating electric current in topological semimetals (V,Mo)Te2, regardless of the centrosymmetry. Considering the crystal and band structures and the asymmetric measurement configurations in addition to the absence of the electromechanical effect in a trivial semimetal TiTe2, the observed effect is discussed in terms of a Berry-phase-derived converse flexoelectric effect in metals. The observation of the flexoelectric effect in topological semimetals paves a way for a new type of nanoscale electromechanical sensors and energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Effect of disorder on Berry curvature and quantum metric in two-band gapped graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometric properties of parameter space are mostly described by Berry curvature and quantum metric, which are the imaginary and real part of quantum geometric tensor, respectively. In this work, we calculate the dressed Berry curvature and quantum metric containing eight Feynman diagrams, which are proportional to the leading-order of the concentration of impurities. For a two-band gapped graphene model, we find the disorder does not break the original symmetry but decrease (increase) the absolute value of Berry curvature and quantum metric in conduction (valence) band. We show how impurities affect the Berry curvature and quantum metric, deepening our understanding of the impurity effect on the electron transport properties in two-band gapped graphene.</description>

      <title>Strong enhancement of magnetic coercivity induced by uniaxial stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of permanent magnets is intricately tied to their magnetic hysteresis loop. In this study, we investigate the heavy-fermion ferromagnet CeAgSb$_2$ through magnetization measurements under uniaxial stress. We observe a 2400 % increase in magnetic coercivity with just a modest stress of approximately 1 kbar. This effect persists even after pressure release, attributable to stress-induced defects that efficiently pin domain walls. Other magnetic properties such as ordering temperature and saturation moment exhibit only weak pressure dependencies and display full reversibility. Our findings offer a promising route for increasing coercive field strength and enhancing the energy product in ferromagnetic materials and are potentially applicable to a broad spectrum of commercial or emerging magnetic applications.</description>
