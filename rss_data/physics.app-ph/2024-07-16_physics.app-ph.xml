      <title>Buffer-less Gallium Nitride High Electron Mobility Heterostructures on Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thick metamorphic buffers are perceived to be indispensable for the heteroepitaxial integration of III-V semiconductors on silicon substrates with large thermal expansion and lattice mismatches. However, III-nitride buffers in conventional GaN-on-Si high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) heterostructures impose a substantial thermal resistance, throttling heat extraction, which reduces device efficiency and lifetime. Herein, bypassing the buffer, we demonstrate the direct growth of GaN after the AlN nucleation layer on silicon by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). By varying reactor pressure, we modulate the growth stress in the submicron epilayers and realise threading dislocation densities similar to that in thick buffered structures. We achieve a GaN-to-substrate thermal resistance of (11(+/-)4) ((m^2)K(GW^-1)), an order of magnitude reduction over conventional designs on silicon and one of the lowest on any non-native substrate. AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterojunctions on this platform show a characteristic 2D electron gas (2DEG), the room-temperature Hall-effect mobility of which, at over 2000 (cm^2/(V-s)), rivals the best-reported values. The low-temperature magnetoresistance of this 2DEG shows clear Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations, a quantum lifetime &gt; 0.180 ps, and tell-tale signatures of spin-splitting. These results may establish a new paradigm for nitride HEMTs, potentially accelerating applications from energy-efficient transistors to fundamental investigations on electron dynamics in this 2D wide-bandgap system.</description>

      <title>Achieving Peta-Ohm Resistance for Semi-Insulating 4H-SiC Devices by Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing demands for precise current measurements, such as atto-ampere-level measurement of cross-cellular biological current transduction, have spotlighted a pressing need for low-noise resistors with ultra-high resistance immune to voltage fluctuations. Traditional semi-insulating materials, however, struggle to provide consistent resistance across varying voltages. To bridge this gap, we introduce a design that integrates semi-insulating 4H-SiC with atomic-level metal oxide interlayers and electrodes. The strategic adjustment of surface states via atomic-scale metal oxide layers optimizes the work functions on 4H-SiC surfaces, validated through density functional theory simulations. This design transcends conventional limitations, establishing an ideal Ohmic behavior and maintains Peta-Ohm-level resistance, unaffected by voltage variations. These on-chip devices with fine-tuned resistance are compatible with integrated circuit manufacturing processes, making them ideally suited for applications in precision electronics.</description>

      <title>High-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging of melt pool dynamics during ultrasonic melt processing of Al6061</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasonic processing of solidifying metals in additive manufacturing can provide grain refinement and advantageous mechanical properties. However, the specific physical mechanisms of microstructural refinement relevant to laser-based additive manufacturing have not been directly observed because of sub-millimeter length scales and rapid solidification rates associated with melt pools. Here, high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging is used to observe the effect of ultrasonic vibration directly on melt pool dynamics and solidification of Al6061 alloy. The high temporal and spatial resolution enabled direct observation of cavitation effects driven by a 20.2 kHz ultrasonic source. We utilized multiphysics simulations to validate the postulated connection between ultrasonic treatment and solidification. The X-ray results show a decrease in melt pool and keyhole depth fluctuations during melting and promotion of pore migration toward the melt pool surface with applied sonication. Additionally, the simulation results reveal increased localized melt pool flow velocity, cooling rates, and thermal gradients with applied sonication. This work shows how ultrasonic treatment can impact melt pools and its potential for improving part quality.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Si-doped Al-rich thin regrown Al(Ga)N films on AlN on sapphire templates with $\gt10^{15}/cm^3$ free carrier concentration using close-coupled showerhead MOCVD reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin Si-doped Al-rich (Al&gt;0.85) regrown Al(Ga)N layers were deposited on AlN on Sapphire template using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) techniques. The optimization of the deposition conditions such as temperature, V/III ratio, deposition rate, and Si concentration resulted in a high charge carrier concentration (&gt;$10^{15}/cm^{3}$) in the Si-doped Al-rich Al(Ga)N films. A pulsed deposition condition was employed to achieve a controllable Al composition greater than 95% and to prevent unintended Ga incorporation in the AlGaN material deposited using the close-coupled showerhead reactor. Also, the effect of unintentional Si incorporation on free charge carrier concentration at the regrowth interface was observed by varying the thickness of the regrown Al(Ga)N layer. A maximum charge carrier concentration of $4.8\times 10^{16}/cm^3$ and $7.5\times 10^{15}/cm^3$ were achieved for Al0.97Ga0.03N and AlN films with thickness &lt;300 nm compared to previously reported n-Al(Ga)N films with thickness $\ge$400 nm deposited using MOCVD technique.</description>

      <title>High Voltage (~2 kV) field-plated Al0.64Ga0.36N-channel HEMTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High voltage (~2 kV) AlGaN-channel HEMTs were fabricated with 64% Aluminum composition in the channel. The average on-resistance was ~75 ohm. mm (~21 miliohm. cm^2) for LGD = 20 microns. Breakdown voltage reached &gt;3 kV (tool limit) before passivation however it reduced to ~2 kV after SiN surface passivation and field plates. The apparent high breakdown voltage prior to passivation can possibly be attributed to the field plate effect of the charged trap states of the surface. The breakdown voltage and RON demonstrated a strong linear correlation in a scattered plot with ~50 measured transistors. In pulsed IV measurements with 100 microsecond pulse width and 40 V of off-state bias (tool limit), the dynamic RON increased by ~5% compared to DC RON and current collapse was &lt;10%.</description>

      <title>Effect of microstructure on fatigue properties of hyperelastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homogenization is a technique for the analysis of complex materials by replacing them with equivalent homogeneous materials that exhibit similar properties. By constructing a three-dimensional (3D) porous material model and employing homogenization technique, effective properties of the hydrogel pore structure were calculated. It is found that the microstructure of hyperelastic materials has considerable influence on their macroscopic mechanical properties, pores with a radius of up to 65 microns at a small strain can significantly reinforce material structure and improve its fatigue resistance. This work highlights the potential of engineering pore structures for the enhancement of mchanical properties and durability of hydrogels.</description>

      <title>An electromagnetic-thermal-mechanical coupling model of dry-wound HTS coil based on T-A formulation with Neumann boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-physics coupling behaviours of HTS coils have now received much attention. In particular, the electromagnetic field, temperature field and mechanical deformation interact with each other during quench of high-field magnets. Accurate analysis of coupling behaviours becomes the key to designing magnets and quench protection. In this paper, a multi-physics coupling model is proposed based on T-A formulation with Neumann boundary conditions. It is convenient to analyse the effects of deformation and temperature on the electromagnetic field, as well as the redistribution of the current between the different layers during quench.</description>

      <title>Integral Micromorphic Model Reproducing Dispersion in 1D Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper develops a new integral micromorphic elastic continuum model, which can describe dispersion properties of band-gap metamaterials, i.e., metamaterials that inhibit propagation of waves in a certain frequency range. The enrichment consists in nonlocal averaging of three terms in the expression for the potential energy density of the standard micromorphic continuum. After proper calibration, such a formulation can exactly reproduce two given branches of the dispersion curve (acoustic and optical), even in cases with a band gap. The calibration process exploits Fourier images of the unknown weight functions, which are analytically deduced from the dispersion relation of the material of interest. The weight functions are then reconstructed in the spatial domain by numerical evaluation of the inverse Fourier transform. The presented approach is validated on several examples, including a discrete mass-spring chain with two alternating masses, for which the dispersion relation has an explicit analytical form and the optical and acoustic branches are separated by a band gap.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Based Prediction of Proton Conductivity in Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have demonstrated their potential as solid-state electrolytes in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. However, the number of MOFs reported to exhibit proton conductivity remains limited, and the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not fully elucidated, complicating the design of proton-conductive MOFs. In response, we developed a comprehensive database of proton-conductive MOFs and applied machine learning techniques to predict their proton conductivity. Our approach included the construction of both descriptor-based and transformer-based models. Notably, the transformer-based transfer learning (Freeze) model performed the best with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.91, suggesting that the proton conductivity of MOFs can be estimated within one order of magnitude using this model. Additionally, we employed feature importance and principal component analysis to explore the factors influencing proton conductivity. The insights gained from our database and machine learning model are expected to facilitate the targeted design of proton-conductive MOFs.</description>

      <title>Measuring kinetic inductance and superfluid stiffness of two-dimensional superconductors using high-quality transmission-line resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of van der Waals superconductors in recent years has generated a lot of excitement for their potentially novel pairing mechanisms. However, their typical atomic-scale thickness and micrometer-scale lateral dimensions impose severe challenges to investigations of pairing symmetry by conventional methods. In this report we demonstrate a new technique that employs high-quality-factor superconducting resonators to measure the kinetic inductance -- up to a part per million -- and loss of a van der Waals superconductor. We analyze the equivalent circuit model to extract the kinetic inductance, superfluid stiffness, penetration depth, and ratio of imaginary and real parts of the complex conductivity. We validate the technique by measuring aluminum and finding excellent agreement in both the zero-temperature superconducting gap as well as the complex conductivity data when compared with BCS theory. We then demonstrate the utility of the technique by measuring the kinetic inductance of multi-layered niobium diselenide and discuss the limits to the accuracy of our technique when the transition temperature of the sample, NbSe$_2$ at 7.06 K, approaches our Nb probe resonator at 8.59 K. Our method will be useful for practitioners in the growing fields of superconducting physics, materials science, and quantum sensing, as a means of characterizing superconducting circuit components and studying pairing mechanisms of the novel superconducting states which arise in layered 2D materials and heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Order parameters and phase transitions of continual learning in deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) enables animals to learn new tasks without erasing prior knowledge. CL in artificial neural networks (NNs) is challenging due to catastrophic forgetting, where new learning degrades performance on older tasks. While various techniques exist to mitigate forgetting, theoretical insights into when and why CL fails in NNs are lacking. Here, we present a statistical-mechanics theory of CL in deep, wide NNs, which characterizes the network's input-output mapping as it learns a sequence of tasks. It gives rise to order parameters (OPs) that capture how task relations and network architecture influence forgetting and knowledge transfer, as verified by numerical evaluations. We found that the input and rule similarity between tasks have different effects on CL performance. In addition, the theory predicts that increasing the network depth can effectively reduce overlap between tasks, thereby lowering forgetting. For networks with task-specific readouts, the theory identifies a phase transition where CL performance shifts dramatically as tasks become less similar, as measured by the OPs. Sufficiently low similarity leads to catastrophic anterograde interference, where the network retains old tasks perfectly but completely fails to generalize new learning. Our results delineate important factors affecting CL performance and suggest strategies for mitigating forgetting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humanity has long sought inspiration from nature to innovate materials and devices. As science advances, nature-inspired materials are becoming part of our lives. Animate materials, characterized by their activity, adaptability, and autonomy, emulate properties of living systems. While only biological materials fully embody these principles, artificial versions are advancing rapidly, promising transformative impacts across various sectors. This roadmap presents authoritative perspectives on animate materials across different disciplines and scales, highlighting their interdisciplinary nature and potential applications in diverse fields including nanotechnology, robotics and the built environment. It underscores the need for concerted efforts to address shared challenges such as complexity management, scalability, evolvability, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ethical and environmental considerations. The framework defined by classifying materials based on their level of animacy can guide this emerging field encouraging cooperation and responsible development. By unravelling the mysteries of living matter and leveraging its principles, we can design materials and systems that will transform our world in a more sustainable manner.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocal Response in Silicon Photonic Resonators Integrated with 2D CuCrP2S6 at Short-Wave Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving non-reciprocal optical behavior in integrated photonics with high efficiency has long been a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a non-reciprocal magneto-optic response by integrating multilayer 2D CuCrP2S6 (CCPS) onto silicon micro ring resonators (MRRs).Under an applied magnetic field, the CCPS intralayer ferromagnetic ordering, characterized by easy-plane magneto-crystalline anisotropy, induces asymmetrical modal responses in the clockwise (CW)and counterclockwise (CCW) light propagation directions. The proposed configuration achieves a low insertion loss of 0.15 dB and a high isolation ratio of 28 dB at 1550 nm. Notably, it exhibits a significant resonance wavelength splitting of 0.4 nm between the counter propagation directions, supporting a 50 GHz optical bandwidth. Operating directly in the transverse electric (TE) mode, it aligns with the main polarization used in silicon photonics circuit, eliminating the need for additional polarization management. The device is ultra-compact, with 2D flake interaction length ranging from 22 um to 55 um and a thickness between 39 nm and 62 nm. Its operation range covers the entire C-band with a bandwidth of up to 100 nm. These attributes make our hybrid CCPS/Si device ideal for advanced non-reciprocal optical applications in the short-wave infrared (SWIR)spectrum, crucial for enhancing the resilience of optical systems against back-reflections.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the readout of a superconducting qubit for repeated measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Readout of superconducting qubits faces a trade-off between measurement speed and unwanted back-action on the qubit caused by the readout drive, such as $T_1$ degradation and leakage out of the computational subspace. The readout is typically benchmarked by integrating the readout signal and choosing a binary threshold to extract the "readout fidelity". We show that such a characterization may significantly overlook readout-induced leakage errors. We introduce a method to quantitatively assess this error by repeatedly executing a composite operation -- a readout preceded by a randomized qubit-flip. We apply this technique to characterize the dispersive readout of an intrinsically Purcell-protected qubit. We report a binary readout fidelity of $99.63\%$ and quantum non-demolition (QND) fidelity exceeding $99.00\%$ which takes into account a leakage error rate of $0.12\pm0.03\%$, under a repetition rate of $(380 \rm{ns})^{-1}$ for the composite operation.</description>

      <title>Microwave Cavity Mode Optimisation by Background Anti-Resonance Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To derive the best oscillator phase noise when implementing a high-Q resonator, the spectral line-shape must have high contrast and symmetry. Ideally, this line-shape is Lorentzian, however, in a high mode density spectral region, low-Q background spurious modes interact and distort the resonance. For a sapphire-loaded cavity resonator operating with whispering gallery modes we show that this high contrast and symmetry can be achieved by changing the dimensions of the surrounding cavity shield to tune the background low-Q structures into anti-resonance. This works because the high-Q resonances are primarily defined by the sapphire while the background modes are defined by the cavity shield. Alternatively, it was shown that a similar result can be achieved by exciting the high-Q resonator with a balanced microwave dipole probe in a Mach Zehnder interferometric configuration. The probe was constructed from two separate coaxial electric field probes symmetrically inserted into a cylindrical cavity resonator, from opposite sides with a small gap between them, so they can behave like an active wire dipole antenna. The power into the two separate probes may be matched with an external variable attenuator in one of the arms of the interferometer. Conversely, the phase between the two electric field probes may be changed with an external variable phase shifter, which changes the nature of the field components the probe couples to. The probe couples to the high-Q resonant modes as well as low-Q background modes, which can be made resonant or anti-resonant for the high-Q modes by changing this external phase. When the background modes are in anti-resonance the line shape of the high-Q mode can be made symmetric and with higher contrast. This technique was applied to both whispering gallery sapphire modes, as well as hollow cavity resonators, without changing the dimensions of the cavity.</description>

      <title>Modeling Defect-Level Switching for Highly-Nonlinear and Hysteretic Electronic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04108</link>

Abstract: Previously, we demonstrated hysteretic and persistent changes of resistivity in two-terminal electronic devices based on charge trapping and detrapping at immobile metastable defects [H. Yin, A. Kumar, J.M. LeBeau, and R. Jaramillo, Phys. Rev. Applied 15, 014014 (2021)]; we termed these devices as defect-level switching (DLS) devices. DLS devices feature all-electronic resistive switching and thus are volatile because of the voltage-time dilemma. However, the dynamics of volatile resistive switches may be valuable for emerging applications such as selectors in crosspoint memory, and neuromorphic computing concepts. To design memory and computing circuits using these volatile resistive switches, accurate modeling is essential. In this work we develop an accurate and analytical model to describe the switching physics in DLS devices, based on the established theories of point defect metastability in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) and II-VI semiconductors. The analytical nature of our model allows for time-efficient simulations of dynamic behavior of DLS devices. We model the time durations of SET and RESET programming pulses, which can be exponentially shortened with respect to the pulse amplitude. We also demonstrate the concept of inverse design: given desired resistance states, the width and amplitude of the programming signal can be chosen accordingly.</description>

      <title>Pound-Drever-Hall Feedforward: Laser Phase Noise Suppression beyond Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) laser frequency stabilization is a powerful technique widely used for building narrow-linewidth lasers. This technique is however ineffective in suppressing high-frequency (&gt;100~kHz) laser phase noise detrimental for many applications. Here, we introduce an effective method which can greatly enhance its high-frequency performance. The idea is to recycle the residual PDH signal of a laser locked to a cavity, by feedforwarding it directly to the laser output field after a delay fiber. Using this straightforward method, we demonstrate a phase noise suppression capability about 4 orders of magnitude better than just using usual PDH feedback for phase noise around a few MHz. We further find that this method exhibits noise suppression performance equivalent to cavity filtering. The new method holds great promise for applications demanding highly stable lasers with diminished phase noise up to tens of MHz, e.g. precise and high-speed control of atomic and molecular quantum states.</description>

      <title>Datacube segmentation via Deep Spectral Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extended Vision techniques are ubiquitous in physics. However, the data cubes steaming from such analysis often pose a challenge in their interpretation, due to the intrinsic difficulty in discerning the relevant information from the spectra composing the data cube.
  Furthermore, the huge dimensionality of data cube spectra poses a complex task in its statistical interpretation; nevertheless, this complexity contains a massive amount of statistical information that can be exploited in an unsupervised manner to outline some essential properties of the case study at hand, e.g.~it is possible to obtain an image segmentation via (deep) clustering of data-cube's spectra, performed in a suitably defined low-dimensional embedding space.
  To tackle this topic, we explore the possibility of applying unsupervised clustering methods in encoded space, i.e. perform deep clustering on the spectral properties of datacube pixels. A statistical dimensional reduction is performed by an ad hoc trained (Variational) AutoEncoder, in charge of mapping spectra into lower dimensional metric spaces, while the clustering process is performed by a (learnable) iterative K-Means clustering algorithm.
  We apply this technique to two different use cases, of different physical origins: a set of Macro mapping X-Ray Fluorescence (MA-XRF) synthetic data on pictorial artworks, and a dataset of simulated astrophysical observations.</description>
