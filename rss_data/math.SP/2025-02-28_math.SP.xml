      <title>On the Spectral Analysis of Power Graph of Dihedral Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power graph \( \mathcal{G}_G \) of a group \( G \) is a graph whose vertex set is \( G \), and two elements \( x, y \in G \) are adjacent if one is an integral power of the other. In this paper, we determine the adjacency, Laplacian, and signless Laplacian spectra of the power graph of the dihedral group \( D_{2pq} \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are distinct primes. Our findings demonstrate that the results of Romdhini et al. [2024], published in the \textit{European Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics}, do not hold universally for all \( n \geq 3 \). Our analysis demonstrates that their results hold true exclusively when \( n = p^m \) where \( p \) is a prime number and \( m \) is a positive integer. The research examines their methodology via explicit counterexamples to expose its boundaries and establish corrected results. This study improves past research by expanding the spectrum evaluation of power graphs linked to dihedral groups.</description>

      <title>Decay of resolvent kernels and Schr\"odinger eigenstates for L\'evy operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spatial decay behaviour of resolvent kernels for a large class of non-local L\'evy operators and bound states of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operators. Our findings naturally lead us to proving results for L\'evy measures, which have subexponential or exponential decay, respectively. This leads to sharp transitions in the the decay rates of the resolvent kernels. We obtain estimates that allow us to describe and understand the intricate decay behaviour of the resolvent kernels and the bound states in either regime, extending findings by Carmona, Masters and Simon for fractional Laplacians (the subexponential regime) and classical relativistic operators (the exponential regime). Our proofs are mainly based on methods from the theory of operator semigroups.</description>

      <title>First order operators on shrinking graph-like spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we discuss the convergence of first order operators on a thickened graph (a graph-like space) towards a similar operator on the underlying metric graph. On the graph-like space, the first order operator is of the form exterior derivative (the gradient) on functions and its adjoint (the negative divergence) on closed 1-forms (irrotational vector fields). Under the assumption that each cross section of the tubular edge neighbourhood is convex, that each vertex neighbourhood is simply connected and under suitable uniformity assumptions (which hold in particular, if the spaces are compact) we establish generalised norm resolvent convergence of the first order operator on the graph-like space towards the one on the metric graph. The square of the first order operator is of Laplace type; on the metric graph, the function (0-form) component is the usual standard (Kirchhoff) Laplacian. A key ingredient in the proof is a uniform Gaffney estimate: such an estimate follows from an equality relating here the divergence operator with all (weak) partial derivatives and a curvature term, together with a (localised) Sobolev trace estimate.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic limit of Dirac Hamiltonians with Aharonov-Bohm fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterise the families of self-adjoint Dirac and Schr\"{o}dinger operators with Aharonov-Bohm magnetic field, and we exploit the non-relativistic limit of infinite light speed to connect the former to the latter. The limit consists of the customary removal of the rest energy and of a suitable scaling, with the light speed, of the short-scale boundary condition of self-adjointness. This ensures that the scattering length of the Aharonov-Bohm interaction is preserved along the limit. Noteworthy is the fact that the whole family of Dirac-AB operators is mapped, in the non-relativistic limit, into the physically relevant sub-family of $s$-wave, angular-momentum-commuting, Schr\"{o}\-dinger-AB Hamiltonians with relativistic Dirac approximants.</description>

      <title>Fourier transforms and iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of bounding the Fourier transforms of stationary measures of iterated function systems (IFSs) and how the pseudo-randomness of the IFS either due to arithmetic, algebraic or geometric reasons is reflected in the behaviour of the Fourier transform. We outline various methods that have been built to estimate the Fourier transform of stationary measures arising e.g. from thermodynamical formalism, additive combinatorics, random walks on groups and hyperbolic dynamics. Open problems, prospects and recent links to quantum chaos are also highlighted.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between validity of the $p$-Poincar\'e inequality and finiteness of the strict $p$-capacitary inradius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19207v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the $p$-Poincar\'e inequality holds on an open set $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ if and only if the strict $p$-capacitary inradius of $\Omega$ is finite. To that end, new upper and lower bounds for the infimum for the associated nonlinear Rayleigh quotients are derived.</description>
