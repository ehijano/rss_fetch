      <title>SCALE: Self-regulated Clustered federAted LEarning in a Homogeneous Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18387</link>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative approach for enabling distributed machine learning while preserving user privacy, yet it faces challenges like communication inefficiencies and reliance on centralized infrastructures, leading to increased latency and costs. This paper presents a novel FL methodology that overcomes these limitations by eliminating the dependency on edge servers, employing a server-assisted Proximity Evaluation for dynamic cluster formation based on data similarity, performance indices, and geographical proximity. Our integrated approach enhances operational efficiency and scalability through a Hybrid Decentralized Aggregation Protocol, which merges local model training with peer-to-peer weight exchange and a centralized final aggregation managed by a dynamically elected driver node, significantly curtailing global communication overhead. Additionally, the methodology includes Decentralized Driver Selection, Check-pointing to reduce network traffic, and a Health Status Verification Mechanism for system robustness. Validated using the breast cancer dataset, our architecture not only demonstrates a nearly tenfold reduction in communication overhead but also shows remarkable improvements in reducing training latency and energy consumption while maintaining high learning performance, offering a scalable, efficient, and privacy-preserving solution for the future of federated learning ecosystems.</description>

      <title>How to Rent GPUs on a Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The explosion in Machine Learning (ML) over the past ten years has led to a dramatic increase in demand for GPUs to train ML models. Because it is prohibitively expensive for most users to build and maintain a large GPU cluster, large cloud providers (Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud) have seen explosive growth in demand for renting cloud-based GPUs. In this cloud-computing paradigm, a user must specify their demand for GPUs at every moment in time, and will pay for every GPU-hour they use. ML training jobs are known to be parallelizable to different degrees. Given a stream of ML training jobs, a user typically wants to minimize the mean response time across all jobs. Here, the response time of a job denotes the time from when a job arrives until it is complete. Additionally, the user is constrained by some operating budget. Specifically, in this paper the user is constrained to use no more than $b$ GPUs per hour, over a long-run time average. The question is how to minimize mean response time while meeting the budget constraint. Because training jobs receive a diminishing marginal benefit from running on additional GPUs, allocating too many GPUs to a single training job can dramatically increase the overall cost paid by the user. Hence, an optimal rental policy must balance a tradeoff between training cost and mean response time. This paper derives the optimal rental policy for a stream of training jobs where the jobs have different levels of parallelizability (specified by a speedup function) and different job sizes (amounts of inherent work). We make almost no assumptions about the arrival process and about the job size distribution. Our optimal policy specifies how many GPUs to rent at every moment in time and how to allocate these GPUs.</description>
