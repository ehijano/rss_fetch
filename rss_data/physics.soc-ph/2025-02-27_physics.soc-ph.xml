      <title>Democratic Thwarting of Majority Rule in opinion dynamics: 1. Unavowed Prejudices versus Contrarians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study the conditions under which a democratic dynamics of a public debate drives a Minority-to-Majority transition. A landscape of the opinion dynamics is thus built using the Galam Majority Model (GMM) in a 3-dimensional parameter space for three different sizes r=2, 3, 4 of local discussing groups. The related parameters are (p_0, k, x), the respective proportions of initial agents supporting opinion A, unavowed tie prejudices breaking in favor of opinion A, and contrarians. Combining k and x yields unexpected and counterintuitive results. In most part of the landscape the final outcome is predetermined with a single attractor dynamics independently of the initial supports for the competing opinions. Large domains of (k, x) values are found to lead an initial minority to turn majority democratically without any external influence. A new alternating regime is also unveiled in narrow ranges of extreme proportions of contrarians. The findings indicate that the expected democratic character of free opinion dynamics is indeed rarely satisfied. The actual values of (k, x) are found to be instrumental to predetermine the final winning opinion. Therefore, the conflicting challenge for the predetermined opinion to loose, is to modify these values appropriately to become the winner. However, developing a model which could help manipulating public opinion rises ethical questions. The issue is discussed in the conclusion.</description>

      <title>Global Streams, Local Currents: A Data Analysis on Global VOD Content Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores global VOD (video on demand) content consumption patterns through a network-based approach. We used Netflix's 'TV-shows' ranking data, spanning 822 days across 71 countries, to construct a network where countries are represented as nodes and consumption similarities are reflected as link weights. By applying the Louvain algorithm, we identified three distinct consumption groups: 'North America and Pan-Europe', 'Asia and Middle East', and 'Central and South America group'. These groups align closely with geographic, historical, and linguistic divisions, despite no predefined grouping criteria. Notably, Turkiye, often considered a cultural and regional crossroads, exhibited some classification ambiguity but was ultimately grouped with Asia and Middle East. Our findings also reveal the dominant influence of the United States across all groups, while South Korean content, particularly after the success of "Squid Game" in 2021, has gained and sustained popularity in Asia and Middle East and Latin America. This study, based on data, demonstrates that deep-seated cultural histories continue to shape global consumption patterns, even amidst rapid changes in media platforms and content production dynamics.</description>

      <title>Viral mutation spread controlled by inter-host network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increase in the connectivity between hosts in recent times has facilitated the emergence of more aggressive mutant viral strains, making their containment and eradication significantly more challenging compared to the original variants. We focus on the evolution of a new more aggressive mutant strain that appears in the system and competes with a previous version. The role of host interaction network topology in the emergence and spatial diffusion of these highly contagious strains is analyzed, as well as how network-based interventions can help mitigate their spread. To address these issues, we present simplified mathematical models that qualitatively describe the occurrence, propagation, and impact of such mutations within host-interaction networks. By incorporating the topology of the host network into the analysis, a more advanced framework is proposed to curb the growth of mutant strains. Extensive numerical simulations of these models offer insights into the mechanisms driving viral evolution, the dynamics of contagion, and the topological influence of host networks on viral spread and containment strategies.</description>

      <title>Sustainable intensification of small-scale aquaculture systems depends on the local context and characteristics of producers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aquaculture has been the fastest growing food production sector globally due to its potential to improve food security, stimulate economic growth, and reduce poverty. Its rapid development has been linked to sustainability challenges, many of which are still unresolved and poorly understood. Small-scale producers account for an increasing fraction of aquacultural output. At the same time, many of these producers experience poverty, food insecurity, and rely on unimproved production practices. We develop a stylized mathematical model to explore the effects of ecological, social, and economic factors on the dynamics of a small-scale pond aquaculture system. Using analytical and numerical methods, we explore the stability, asymptotic dynamics, and bifurcations of the model. Depending on the characteristics of the system, the model exhibits one of three distinct configurations: monostability with a global poverty trap in a nutrient-dominated or fish-dominated system; bistability with poverty trap and well-being attractors; multistability with poverty trap and two well-being attractors with different characteristics. The model results show that intensification can be sustainable only if it takes into account the local social-ecological context. In addition, the heterogeneity of small-scale aquaculture producers matters, as the effects of intensification can be unevenly distributed among them. Finally, more is not always better because too high nutrient input or productivity can lead to a suboptimal attractor or system collapse.</description>

      <title>From Staging to Insight: An Educational Path to Understanding Bell's Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Physics is a cornerstone of modern science and technology, yet a comprehensive approach to integrating it into school curricula and communicating its foundations to policymakers, industrial stakeholders, and the general public has yet to be established. In this paper, we discuss the rationale for introducing entanglement and Bell's inequalities to a non-expert audience, and how these topics have been presented in the exhibit "Dire l'indicibile" ("Speaking the Unspeakable"), as a part of the Italian Quantum Weeks project. This initiative aims to make quantum mechanics accessible to all, bridging the gap between complex scientific principles and public understanding. Our approach meets the challenge of simplifying quantum concepts without sacrificing their core meaning, specifically avoiding the risks of oversimplification and inaccuracy. Through interactive activities, including a card game demonstration and the staging of CHSH experiments, participants explore the fundamental differences between classical and quantum probabilistic predictions. They gain insights into the significance of Bell inequality verification experiments and the implications of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics. Preliminary results from both informal and formal assessment sessions are encouraging, suggesting the effectiveness of this approach.</description>

      <title>A simple and flexible algorithm to generate real-world networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces an algorithm that generates undirected graphs with three main characteristics of real-world networks: scale-freeness, short distances between nodes (small-world phenomenon), and large clustering coefficients. The main idea is to perform random walks across the network and, at each iteration, add special edges with a decreasing probability to link more distant nodes, following a specific probability distribution. A key advantage of our algorithm is its simplicity and flexibility in creating networks with different characteristics without using global information about network topology. We show how the parameters can be adjusted to generate networks with specific average distances and clustering coefficients, maintaining a long-tailed degree distribution. The implementation of our algorithm is publicly available on a GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Network dynamics of community resilience and recovery: new frontier in disaster research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disasters impact communities through interconnected social, spatial, and physical networks. Analyzing network dynamics is crucial for understanding resilience and recovery. We highlight six studies demonstrating how hazards and recovery processes spread through these networks, revealing key phenomena, such as flood exposure, emergent social cohesion, and critical recovery multipliers. This network-centric approach can uncover vulnerabilities, inform interventions, and advance equitable resilience strategies in the face of escalating risks.</description>

      <title>Towards an AI co-scientist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific discovery relies on scientists generating novel hypotheses that undergo rigorous experimental validation. To augment this process, we introduce an AI co-scientist, a multi-agent system built on Gemini 2.0. The AI co-scientist is intended to help uncover new, original knowledge and to formulate demonstrably novel research hypotheses and proposals, building upon prior evidence and aligned to scientist-provided research objectives and guidance. The system's design incorporates a generate, debate, and evolve approach to hypothesis generation, inspired by the scientific method and accelerated by scaling test-time compute. Key contributions include: (1) a multi-agent architecture with an asynchronous task execution framework for flexible compute scaling; (2) a tournament evolution process for self-improving hypotheses generation. Automated evaluations show continued benefits of test-time compute, improving hypothesis quality. While general purpose, we focus development and validation in three biomedical areas: drug repurposing, novel target discovery, and explaining mechanisms of bacterial evolution and anti-microbial resistance. For drug repurposing, the system proposes candidates with promising validation findings, including candidates for acute myeloid leukemia that show tumor inhibition in vitro at clinically applicable concentrations. For novel target discovery, the AI co-scientist proposed new epigenetic targets for liver fibrosis, validated by anti-fibrotic activity and liver cell regeneration in human hepatic organoids. Finally, the AI co-scientist recapitulated unpublished experimental results via a parallel in silico discovery of a novel gene transfer mechanism in bacterial evolution. These results, detailed in separate, co-timed reports, demonstrate the potential to augment biomedical and scientific discovery and usher an era of AI empowered scientists.</description>

      <title>2064 global population crisis scenario predicted by the most general dynamic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is currently no consensus on how the global population will evolve in the next decades and in the next century. Currently, none of the known mathematical population-dynamic models can reproduce all these four types of functions as its solutions. This is of course a great impediment on the way towards forecasting trends in global population growth, which is an ever more urgent exercise in an era dominated by substantial climate and ecological threats. In this paper, we remedy to this situation by reporting on a population dynamic model, a single nonlinear differential equation adapted from the physics of disordered systems, which is able to mathematically describe all the various regimes encountered in the global population recorded as a function of time, over the past 12000 years until now. Regimes of simple exponential growth (Malthus), logistic (Verhulst) plateaus as well as stretched-exponential and compressed-exponential growth regimes are all reliably described by this mathematical equation in its various limits. In particular, two different scenarios are predicted. In one of them, which assumes that the future evolution would continue along a similar pattern as the past decades (hence without any major global ecological crisis affecting the resource exploitation), a von Foerster-type doomsday scenario with a sudden rise of the global population to unsustainable levels could appear as early as 2078. In the opposite scenario, if a global ecological crisis were to set in today, affecting the ability to exploit resources, given the current estimates of the Earth's carrying capacity, the global population is forecasted to reduce by half by 2064. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic model provides with a new aggregated parameter (K, in the model) that can be monitored and controlled so as to avoid the doomsday scenarios.</description>

      <title>The computational power of a human society: a new model of social evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social evolutionary theory seeks to explain increases in the scale and complexity of human societies, from origins to present. Over the course of the twentieth century, social evolutionary theory largely fell out of favor as a way of investigating human history, just when advances in complex systems science and computer science saw the emergence of powerful new conceptions of complex systems, and in particular new methods of measuring complexity. We propose that these advances in our understanding of complex systems and computer science should be brought to bear on our investigations into human history. To that end, we present a new framework for modeling how human societies co-evolve with their biotic environments, recognizing that both a society and its environment are computers. This leads us to model the dynamics of each of those two systems using the same, new kind of computational machine, which we define here. For simplicity, we construe a society as a set of interacting occupations and technologies. Similarly, under such a model, a biotic environment is a set of interacting distinct ecological and environmental processes. This provides novel ways to characterize social complexity, which we hope will cast new light on the archaeological and historical records. Our framework also provides a natural way to formalize both the energetic (thermodynamic) costs required by a society as it runs, and the ways it can extract thermodynamic resources from the environment in order to pay for those costs -- and perhaps to grow with any left-over resources.</description>

      <title>Fusion divided: what prevented European collaboration on controlled thermonuclear fusion in 1958</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva is renowned for operating the world`s largest particle accelerator and is often regarded as a model of high-profile international collaboration. Less well known, however, is a key episode from the late 1950s, when CERN was confronted with the research priorities of similar organisations. The issue centred on a CERN-sponsored study group on controlled thermonuclear fusion, which brought together scientists from CERN member states, as well as representatives from the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM), the European Nuclear Energy Agency (ENEA), and the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). While the CERN Study Group on Fusion Problems succeeded in creating an international network for exchanging reports and coordinating projects to avoid duplication, it ultimately failed to establish joint fusion research programmes. This article explores the reasons behind this outcome to provide insights into intergovernmental power dynamics, underlying competition, and how these factors favoured the creation of a new fusion research institution in the UK, the Culham Laboratory. In doing so, the article contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of science in European integration, while also highlighting that CERN`s involvement in application-oriented research remains an underexplored aspect of its history.</description>

      <title>Hallmarks of Deception in Asset-Exchange Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transient and steady-state dynamics of the Bennati-Dragulescu-Yakovenko money game in the presence of probabilistic cheaters, who can misrepresent their financial status by claiming to have no money. We derive the steady-state wealth distribution per player analytically, and show how the presence of hidden cheaters can be inferred from the relative variance of wealth per player. In scenarios with a finite number of cheaters amidst an infinite pool of honest players, we identify a critical probability of cheating at which the total wealth owned by the cheaters experiences a second-order discontinuity. Below this point, the transition probability to lose money is larger than the probability to gain; conversely, above this point, the direction is reversed. We further establish a threshold cheating probability at which cheaters collectively possess half of the total wealth in the game. Lastly, we provide bounds on the rate at which both cheaters and honest players can gain or lose wealth, contributing to a deeper understanding of deception in asset exchange models.</description>
