      <title>A Framework to Pinpoint Bottlenecks in Emerging Solar Cells and Disordered Devices via Differential Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in the development of materials for the next generation of solar cells, sensors and transistors is linking macroscopic device performance to underlying microscopic properties. For years, fabrication of devices has been faster than our ability to characterize them. This has led to a random walk of material development, with new materials being proposed faster than our understanding. We present two neural network-based methods for extracting key material parameters, including charge carrier mobility and trap state density, in optoelectronic devices such as solar cells. Our methods require solely measured light current--voltage curve and modest computational resources, making our approach applicable in even minimally equipped laboratories. Unlike traditional machine learning models, our methods place the final material values in a non-Gaussian likelihood distribution, allowing confidence assessment of each predicted parameter. We demonstrate these techniques using fresh PM6:Y12 and degraded PM6:BTP-eC9 organic solar cells.</description>

      <title>Magneto-photoelectrochemical 2D heterojunction platform for biosensing detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensors exhibit significant potential for biomolecule detection due to their high sensitivity and low background noise. However, their performance is severely constrained by the rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. This study innovatively introduces a non-contact magnetic modulation strategy to suppress electron-hole recombination by manipulating carrier spin states, thereby significantly enhancing photoelectric conversion efficiency. Building on this mechanism, we developed a novel magnetically modulated PEC biosensing platform based on the MXenes/cobalt-doped titanium dioxide (Co-TiO2) heterostructure. This platform achieved ultrasensitive detection of protein kinase A (PKA) activity. Compared to an identical probe-modified biosensor without magnetic field application, the developed platform demonstrated a 68.75% enhancement in detection sensitivity and achieved an ultralow detection limit for PKA of 0.00016 U/mL. It also exhibited a wide linear range from 0.005 to 80 U/mL. This research not only provides a novel methodology for kinase activity analysis but also pioneers the innovative strategy of magnetic modulation for enhanced PEC sensing. It opens new avenues for developing high-performance biosensing platforms, holding significant promise for early disease diagnosis and drug screening applications.</description>

      <title>Wide-Angle Reflection Suppression of Dielectric Slabs Using Nonlocal Metasurface Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any discontinuity of constitutive parameters along a wave propagation path causes scattering. For a plane wave incident onto a flat dielectric slab, reflection becomes strongly dependent on the incident angle as the electrical thickness becomes large. This behavior limits the applicability of conventional single- and multilayer anti-reflective coatings. Recently, inspired by the generalized Huygens' condition, synthesized admittance sheets implemented as metasurfaces with local response have been shown to remove reflection from a dielectric slab in a wide range of incident angles, applicable, however, only in the case of small optical slab thickness. In this work, we study plane wave transmission through dielectric slabs with arbitrary thickness coated from both sides by identical metasurfaces with nonlocal response, whose grid impedance is angularly dependent (spatially dispersive). Nonlocality is shown to play a key role in obtaining wide-angle reflection suppression in the case of optically thick slabs. To validate our approach, we study a metasurface realization composed of Interconnected Split-Ring Resonators that approximates the predicted spatial dispersion law. As demonstrated numerically and experimentally, such properly devised nonlocal metasurface coatings indeed provide transmittance enhancement (and reflectance suppression) of thick dielectric slabs across a broad range of angles, paving the path to optically thin and easy-to-fabricate anti-reflective coatings efficiently operating in a wide angular range even for optically thick dielectric slabs.</description>

      <title>Electrically-gated laser-induced spin dynamics in magneto-electric iron garnet at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast pump-probe imaging reveals that the efficiency of optical excitation of coherent spins waves in epitaxial iron garnet films can be effectively controlled by an external electric field at room temperature. Although a femtosecond laser pulse alone does not excite any pronounced coherent spin oscillations, an electrical gating with the field of 0.5 MV/m dramatically changes the outcome in a laser-induced launching of spin waves. The effect, demonstrated under room-temperature conditions, is estimated to be orders of magnitude larger than in magnetic van der Waals semiconductors observed at 10 K. This electrical gating of laser-induced spin dynamics enriches opto-magnonics with a new tool and thus opens up a new avenue in fundamental and applied magnonics research.</description>

      <title>Transversality-Enforced Tight-Binding Model for 3D Photonic Crystals aided by Topological Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tight-binding models can accurately predict the band structure and topology of crystalline systems and they have been heavily used in solid-state physics due to their versatility and low computational cost. It is quite straightforward to build an accurate tight-binding model of any crystalline system using the maximally localized Wannier functions of the crystal as a basis. In 1D and 2D photonic crystals, it is possible to express the wave equation as two decoupled scalar eigenproblems where finding a basis of maximally localized Wannier functions is feasible using standard Wannierization methods. Unfortunately, in 3D photonic crystals, the vectorial nature of the electromagnetic solutions cannot be avoided. This precludes the construction of a basis of maximally localized Wannier functions via usual techniques. In this work, we show how to overcome this problem by using topological quantum chemistry which will allow us to express the band structure of the photonic crystal as a difference of elementary band representations. This can be achieved by the introduction of a set of auxiliary modes, as recently proposed by Solja\v{c}i\'c et. al., which regularize the $\Gamma$-point obstruction arising from transversality constraint of the Maxwell equations. The decomposition into elementary band representations allows us to isolate a set of pseudo-orbitals that permit us to construct an accurate transversality-enforced tight-binding model (TETB) that matches the dispersion, symmetry content, and topology of the 3D photonic crystal under study. Moreover, we show how to introduce the effects of a gyrotropic bias in the framework, modeled via non-minimal coupling to a static magnetic field. Our work provides the first systematic method to analytically model the photonic bands of the lowest transverse modes over the entire BZ via a TETB model.</description>

      <title>On-chip microwave coherent source with in-situ control of the photon number distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent photon sources are key elements in different applications, ranging from quantum sensing to quantum computing. The possibility of designing and engineering superconducting circuits behaving like artificial atoms supports the realization of quantum optics protocols, including microwave photons generation. Here we propose and theoretically investigate a design that allows a tunable photon injection directly on-chip. Our approach enables control of the emission via an external knob while preserving, in principle, the stability and linewidth characteristics. This is achieved by replacing the conventional capacitive link between the source and the reservoir with a tunable coupler, with the advantage of avoiding direct dynamical manipulation of the photon source dynamics, providing pulsed control of the emission. We validate the dynamical control of the generated state under the effect of an external flux threading the tunable coupler and discuss the possibility of employing this scheme also in the context of multiple bosonic reservoirs.</description>

      <title>A geometric condition for robot-swarm cohesion and cluster-flock transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a geometric design rule for size-controlled clustering of self-propelled particles. We show that active particles that tend to rotate under an external force have an intrinsic, signed parameter with units of curvature which we call curvity, that can be derived from first principles. Experiments with robots and numerical simulations show that properties of individual robots (radius and curvity) control pair cohesion in a binary system, and the stability of flocking and self-limiting clustering in a swarm, with applications in meta-materials and in embodied decentralized control.</description>

      <title>Integrated Silicon Nitride Devices via Inverse Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated photonic devices made of silicon nitride (SiN), which can be integrated with silicon-on-insulator and III-V platforms, are expected to drive the expansion of silicon photonics technology. However, the relatively low refractive index contrast of SiN is often considered a limitation for creating compact and efficient devices. Here, we present three freeform SiN devices-a coarse wavelength-division multiplexer, a five-mode mode-division multiplexer, and a polarization beam splitter-while systematically benchmarking both the design capability and the fabrication repeatability and robustness of inverse-designed components. We demonstrate up to a 1200x reduction in footprint while maintaining relatively large minimum feature sizes of up to 160 nm, showing that inverse-designed SiN devices can be as compact as their silicon counterparts. These results enable high-density integration in SiN photonics and pave the way for multidimensional data transmission and quantum applications, as the inverse design technique can be applied to different SiN thicknesses and is potentially extendable to other low- and mid-index platforms.</description>
