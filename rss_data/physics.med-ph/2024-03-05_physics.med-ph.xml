      <title>RAIDER: Rapid, anatomy-independent deep learning-based chemical shift-encoded MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Despite recent advances, chemical shift-encoded MRI (CSE-MRI) remains a challenging problem and many algorithms are computationally expensive, leading to interest in deep learning-based methods. However, initial attempts have used convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are limited by data requirements, poor generalisability across different anatomies (anatomy- dependence) and training time. To address these limitations, we propose RAIDER, a method for rapid, anatomy-independent deep learning-based CSE-MRI.
  Theory and Methods: RAIDER uses two multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), each trained separately with simulated single-voxel data, thus avoiding the degeneracy encountered during training when using only one network. During inference, the solution from one of the two networks is chosen based on likelihood. Performance and speed are investigated in a series of simulation experiments, in phantoms and in vivo.
  Results: RAIDER is approximately 700 times faster than conventional fitting, taking 14us per voxel rather than 10ms, and offers performance similar to that of conventional fitting. It produces accurate fat fraction measurements in phantoms and in vivo images with different anatomies, despite having been trained only on simulation data.
  Conclusion: RAIDER resolves the problems posed by degeneracy, avoids the training data requirements of CNN-based methods and markedly reduces computational cost compared to conventional fitting.</description>

      <title>Proton Resonance Shift Thermometry: A review of modern clinical practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become a popular modality in guiding minimally invasive thermal therapies, due to its advanced, non-ionizing, imaging capabilities and its ability to record changes in temperature. A variety of MR thermometry techniques have been developed over the years, and Proton Resonance Frequency (PRF) Shift Thermometry is the current clinical gold standard to treat a variety of cancers. It is used extensively to guide hyperthermic thermal ablation techniques such as high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and laser-induced thermal therapy (LITT). Essential attributes of PRF Shift Thermometry include excellent linearity with temperature, good sensitivity, and independence from tissue type. This non-invasive temperature mapping method gives accurate quantitative measures of the temperature evolution inside biological tissues. In this review, the current status and new developments in the fields of MR-guided HIFU and LITT are presented with an emphasis on breast, prostate, bone, uterine and brain treatments.</description>

      <title>Impact of wavefront shape on nonlinear ultrasound imaging of monodisperse microbubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) combines nonlinear, resonant microbubbles (MBs) with dedicated pulse sequences to reveal the vascular function of organs. Clinical ultrasound contrast agents consist of polydisperse MB suspensions with diameters ranging from 0.5 to 10 um and resonance frequencies ranging from 1 to 15 MHz. As a result, just a small fraction of MBs resonates at a given ultrasound frequency. MB suspensions with narrow size distributions can be tuned for a specific imaging frequency, boost CEUS sensitivity and enable deeper vascular imaging. However, their enhanced nonlinear behavior makes imaging susceptible to nonlinear wave propagation artifacts. Here, we numerically investigate the impact of the acoustic wavefront shape on the imaging of nonlinear, monodisperse MBs. Specifically, our approach relies on an extension of the Iterative Nonlinear Contrast Source (INCS) method that accounts for all nonlinear effects in CEUS. We demonstrate that supersonic x-shaped wavefronts referred to as x-waves can be used to generate ultrasound images of monodisperse MBs without nonlinear wave propagation artifacts. On the contrary, imaging based on focused, planar and diverging wavefronts leads to significant nonlinear artifacts. Taken together, our results show that x-waves can harness the full potential of monodisperse MBs by enabling their sensitive and specific detection in a tissue context.</description>

      <title>Optical-coherence-tomography-based deep-learning scatterer-density estimator using physically accurate noise model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a deep-learning-based scatterer density estimator (SDE) that processes local speckle patterns of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and estimates the scatterer density behind each speckle pattern. The SDE is trained using large quantities of numerically simulated OCT images and their associated scatterer densities. The numerical simulation uses a noise model that incorporates the spatial properties of three types of noise, i.e., shot noise, relative-intensity noise, and non-optical noise. The SDE's performance was evaluated numerically and experimentally using two types of scattering phantom and in vitro tumor spheroids. The results confirmed that the SDE estimates scatterer densities accurately. The estimation accuracy improved significantly when compared with our previous deep-learning-based SDE, which was trained using numerical speckle patterns generated from a noise model that did not account for the spatial properties of noise.</description>

      <title>XProspeCT: CT Volume Generation from Paired X-Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is a beneficial imaging tool for diagnostic purposes. CT scans provide detailed information concerning the internal anatomic structures of a patient, but present higher radiation dose and costs compared to X-ray imaging. In this paper, we build on previous research to convert orthogonal X-ray images into simulated CT volumes by exploring larger datasets and various model structures. Significant model variations include UNet architectures, custom connections, activation functions, loss functions, optimizers, and a novel back projection approach.</description>

      <title>Myasthenia Gravis Diagnosis with Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern medicine aims to diagnose diseases at early stages which constitutes a relevant task of biomedical research. The present investigation focuses on myasthenia, a disease that takes the third place in terms of frequency worldwide, has complex symptoms and is difficult to treat. It is early diagnostics that allows for providing competent medical assistance and, sometimes, curing the patient. To detect the cause of the disease, the Raman spectroscopy was used to study blood serum samples covered with quartz glass with gold clusters embedded. The Raman cross-section has been amplified with the gold nanoparticles which made it possible to detect Botulotoxin-A in blood serum of patients suffering from myasthenia</description>

      <title>Neural blind deconvolution for deblurring and supersampling PSMA PET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00590</link>

Abstract: Objective: To simultaneously deblur and supersample prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) images using neural blind deconvolution. Approach: Blind deconvolution is a method of estimating the hypothetical "deblurred" image along with the blur kernel (related to the point spread function) simultaneously. Traditional \textit{maximum a posteriori} blind deconvolution methods require stringent assumptions and suffer from convergence to a trivial solution. A method of modelling the deblurred image and kernel with independent neural networks, called "neural blind deconvolution" had demonstrated success for deblurring 2D natural images in 2020. In this work, we adapt neural blind deconvolution for PVE correction of PSMA PET images with simultaneous supersampling. We compare this methodology with several interpolation methods, using blind image quality metrics, and test the model's ability to predict kernels by re-running the model after applying artificial "pseudokernels" to deblurred images. The methodology was tested on a retrospective set of 30 prostate patients as well as phantom images containing spherical lesions of various volumes. Results: Neural blind deconvolution led to improvements in image quality over other interpolation methods in terms of blind image quality metrics, recovery coefficients, and visual assessment. Predicted kernels were similar between patients, and the model accurately predicted several artificially-applied pseudokernels. Localization of activity in phantom spheres was improved after deblurring, allowing small lesions to be more accurately defined. Significance: The intrinsically low spatial resolution of PSMA PET leads to PVEs which negatively impact uptake quantification in small regions. The proposed method can be used to mitigate this issue, and can be straightforwardly adapted for other imaging modalities.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear interaction of two cross-propagating plane waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ideal contrast-enhanced ultrasound image should display microbubble-induced nonlinearities while avoiding wave propagation nonlinearities. One of the most successful ultrasound pulse sequences to disentangle these nonlinear effects relies on the transmission of cross-propagating plane waves. However, theory describing the noncollinear nonlinear interaction of two finite plane waves has not been fully developed and a better understanding of these effects would improve contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging further. Here, local nonlinear interactions at the intersection of two plane-waves are investigated by extending the Westervelt equation with a term including the Lagrangian density. The Iterative Nonlinear Contrast Source (INCS) method is employed to numerically solve this full nonlinear wave equation for two 3D finite cross-propagating pulsed plane waves. In addition, analytical expressions for the cross-propagation of two infinite continuous plane waves are derived. Numerical results obtained with INCS show good agreement with the analytical expressions. Overall, the generated results show that the pressure associated with local nonlinear effects is two orders of magnitude lower than the pressure associated with global nonlinear effects. Local nonlinear effects are therefore expected to be negligible in the context of single-shot ultrasound imaging, but they may influence approaches that subtract pressure fields such as amplitude modulation or pulse inversion.</description>
