      <title>Apparatus to visualize flows in superfluid $^4$He below 1 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a versatile apparatus for optical observations of experimental processes at temperatures down to 0.1 K. The cooling is achieved by a wet cryostat with a dilution refrigerator on a vibrationally-isolated platform, capable of continuous rotation at angular velocity of up to 3 rad/s. The illumination light beam from lasers on a non-rotating optical table at room temperature is introduced via an optical fiber. The images are transferred to the intensified camera at room temperature through a coherent bundle of $10^5$ optical fibers giving a spatial resolution of $\sim 30 \mu$m, depending on the magnification used. The adjustment of the position of the illumination light, as well as of the focusing of the camera on the object under investigation, can be controlled remotely with the help of piezoelectric positioners. The apparatus was used for visualization of particles dispersed in superfluid helium at temperatures down to 0.14 K. In one version of experiment, fluorescent light from clouds of excimer molecules He$_2^*$, generated in liquid helium by electron impact from electrons injected by sharp field-emission tips, was recorded and analyzed. In another, fluorescent particles of diameters between 1 $\mu$m and 6 $\mu$m were initially loaded onto the horizontal surface of a piezoelectric crystal of LiNbO$_3$ and then injected into liquid helium by short bursts of high-amplitude oscillations at the crystal's resonant frequency 1 MHz. The particle trajectories were filmed at a frame rate of up to 990 fps and analyzed.</description>

      <title>Assessing quantum coherence in quantum annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Demonstrating genuine many-body quantum coherence in large-scale quantum processors remains a central challenge for near-term quantum technologies. Recent experiments on D-Wave quantum annealers have investigated quenches of Ising chains and observed defect densities that show Kibble-Zurek scaling, consistent with coherent quantum dynamics. However, identical scaling can arise from classical or thermal processes. Here we propose the use of many-body coherent oscillations (MBCO) as a diagnostic for the identification of system-wide coherence in analog quantum simulators. Solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, we show that quenches of a staggered one-dimensional Ising chain across a quantum critical point produce oscillatory signatures in defect observables. We implement this model on the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer. Using fast-anneal protocols, we find that, although defect densities follow Kibble-Zurek scaling, the expected oscillatory behavior is absent. We demonstrate that static disorder associated with individual qubits is not likely responsible for the absence of MBCO. Modest modifications to annealing schedules can dramatically enhance oscillation visibility. This work gives a general roadmap for the search for quantum coherence in noisy, large-scale quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the sign problem by quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notorious sign problem severely limits the applicability of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, as statistical errors grow exponentially with system size and inverse temperature. A recent proposal of a quantum-computing stochastic series expansion (qc-SSE) method suggested that the problem could be avoided by introducing constant energy shifts into the Hamiltonian. Here we critically examine this framework and show that it does not strictly resolve the sign problem for Hamiltonians with non-commuting terms. Instead, it provides a practical mitigation strategy that suppresses the occurrence of negative weights. Using the antiferromagnetic anisotropic XY chain as a test case, we analyze the dependence of the average sign on system size, temperature, anisotropy, and shift parameters. An operator contraction method is introduced to improve efficiency. Our results demonstrate that moderate shifts optimally balance sign mitigation and statistical accuracy, while large shifts amplify errors, leaving the sign problem unresolved but alleviated.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to Adiabaticity via Adaptive Quantum Zeno Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum Zeno dynamics arising from monitoring a time-dependent projector. Starting from a stroboscopic measurement protocol, it is shown that the effective Hamiltonian for Zeno dynamics involves a nonadiabatic geometric connection that takes the form of the Kato-Avron Hamiltonian for parallel transport, stirring the evolution within the time-dependent Zeno subspace. The latter reduces to counterdiabatic driving when projective measurements are performed in the instantaneous energy eigenbasis of the quantum system. The effective Zeno Hamiltonian can also be derived in the context of continuous quantum measurements of a time-dependent observable and the non-Hermitian evolution with a complex absorbing potential varying in time. Our results thus provide a unified framework for realizing shortcuts to adiabaticity via adaptive quantum Zeno measurements.</description>
