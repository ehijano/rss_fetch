      <title>Tunable Plasmonic Absorption in Metal-Dielectric Multilayers via FDTD Simulations and an Explainable Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic devices, fundamental to modern nanophotonics, exploit resonant interactions between light and free electrons in metals to achieve enhanced light trapping and electromagnetic field confinement. However, modeling their complex, nonlinear optical responses remains computationally intensive. In this work, we combine finite-difference time-domain simulations with machine learning to simulate and predict absorbed power behavior in multilayer plasmonic stacks composed of SiO2, gold, silver, and indium tin oxide. By varying Au and Ag thicknesses (10-50nm) across a spectral range of 300-1500nm, we generate spatial absorption maps and integrated power metrics from full-wave solutions to Maxwell's equations. A multilayer perceptron models global absorption behavior with a mean absolute error of 0.0953, while a convolutional neural network predicts spatial absorption distributions with an MAE of 0.0101. SHapley Additive exPlanations identify plasmonic layer thickness and excitation wavelength as dominant contributors to absorption, which peaks between 450 and 850~nm. Gold demonstrates broader and more sustained absorption compared to silver, although both metals exhibit reduced efficiency outside the resonance window. This integrated FDTD-ML framework offers a fast, explainable, and accurate approach for investigating tunable plasmonic behavior in multilayer systems, with applications in optical sensing, photovoltaics, and nanophotonic device design.</description>

      <title>A GPU-Accelerated Three-Dimensional Crack Element Method for Transient Dynamic Fracture Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel three-dimensional Crack Element Method (CEM) designed to model transient dynamic crack propagation in quasi-brittle materials efficiently. CEM introduces an advanced element-splitting algorithm that enables element-wise crack growth, including crack branching. Based on the evolving topology of split elements, an original formulation for computing the fracture energy release rate in three dimensions is derived. A series of benchmark examples is conducted to demonstrate that the proposed 3D CEM accurately simulates both single crack propagation and complex crack branching scenarios. Furthermore, all three-dimensional simulations are GPU-accelerated, achieving high levels of computational efficiency, consistency, and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Convolutional autoencoders for the reconstruction of three-dimensional interfacial multiphase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a comprehensive investigation of autoencoders for reduced-order modeling of three-dimensional multiphase flows. Focusing on the accuracy of reconstructing multiphase flow volume/mass fractions with a standard convolutional architecture, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of different interface representation choices (diffuse, sharp, level set). We use a combination of synthetic data with non-trivial interface topologies and high-resolution simulation data of multiphase homogeneous isotropic turbulence for training and validation. This study clarifies the best practices for reducing the dimensionality of multiphase flows via autoencoders. Consequently, this paves the path for uncoupling the training of autoencoders for accurate reconstruction and the training of temporal or input/output models such as neural operators (e.g., FNOs, DeepONets) and neural ODEs on the lower-dimensional latent space given by the autoencoders. As such, the implications of this study are significant and of interest to the multiphase flow community and beyond.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As blockchain technology rapidly evolves, researchers face a significant challenge due to diverse and non-standardized simulation parameters, which hinder the replicability and comparability of research methodologies. This paper introduces a Generic Framework for Optimization in Blockchain Simulators (GFOBS), a comprehensive and adaptable solution designed to standardize and optimize blockchain simulations. GFOBS provides a flexible platform that supports various optimization algorithms, variables, and objectives, thereby catering to a wide range of blockchain research needs. The paper's key contributions are threefold: the development of GFOBS as a versatile tool for blockchain simulation optimization; the introduction of an innovative optimization method using warm starting technique; and the proposition of a novel concurrent multiprocessing technique for simultaneous simulation processes. These advancements collectively enhance the efficiency, replicability, and standardization of blockchain simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Method-Based Reasoning for Large Language Models: Extraction, Reuse, and Continuous Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04289v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across a wide range of language tasks. However, their reasoning process is primarily guided by statistical patterns in training data, which limits their ability to handle novel problems and perform consistent logical reasoning. In this paper, we propose a method-based model that enhances LLMs with explicit, reusable procedures extracted from training content, generated responses, and user interactions. Each method is represented as a pair consisting of a problem and its corresponding solution, stored externally and ranked based on feedback. When a new query is received, the system retrieves and applies the most relevant methods to guide the LLM's response. Our model enables continual learning, method reuse, and logical consistency beyond next-token prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the system improves factual verification and generalization in complex prompts, and that newly learned methods can outperform earlier ones through user-driven refinement.</description>

      <title>Extreme Event Precursor Prediction in Turbulent Dynamical Systems via CNN-Augmented Recurrence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general framework to predict precursors to extreme events in turbulent dynamical systems. The approach combines phase-space reconstruction techniques with recurrence matrices and convolutional neural networks to identify precursors to extreme events. We evaluate the framework across three distinct testbed systems: a triad turbulent interaction model, a prototype stochastic anisotropic turbulent flow, and the Kolmogorov flow. This method offers three key advantages: (1) a threshold-free classification strategy that eliminates subjective parameter tuning, (2) efficient training using only $\mathcal{O}(100)$ recurrence matrices, and (3) ability to generalize to unseen systems. The results demonstrate robust predictive performance across all test systems: 96\% detection rate for the triad model with a mean lead time of 1.8 time units, 96\% for the anisotropic turbulent flow with a mean lead time of 6.1 time units, and 93\% for the Kolmogorov flow with a mean lead time of 22.7 units.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Taskforce Collaboration: Self-Correction of Compounding Errors in Long-Form Literature Review Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Literature reviews play an important role in scientific research. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have boosted the development of automated systems for the entire literature review workflow, from retrieval to manuscript drafting. However, a key challenge is that mistakes made in early stages can propagate and amplify in subsequent steps, leading to compounding errors that undermine the faithfulness of the final review. To tackle this issue, we propose the Multi-Agent Taskforce Collaboration (MATC) framework, which consists of a manager agent and four executor agents for literature searching, outline generation, fact localization, and manuscript drafting. We propose three novel collaboration paradigms, forming exploration, exploitation, and experience taskforces, to effectively organize agents and mitigate compounding errors both between and within executor agents. Experimental results show that MATC achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks. We further propose a new benchmark dataset featuring more diverse topics for faithful literature review generation.</description>

      <title>Compressing Large Language Models with PCA Without Performance Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Principal Component Analysis (PCA), when applied in a structured manner, either to polar-transformed images or segment-wise to token sequences, enables extreme compression of neural models without sacrificing performance. Across three case studies, we show that a one-layer classifier trained on PCA-compressed polar MNIST achieves over 98 percent accuracy using only 840 parameters. A two-layer transformer trained on 70-dimensional PCA-reduced MiniLM embeddings reaches 76.62 percent accuracy on the 20 Newsgroups dataset with just 81000 parameters. A decoder-only transformer generates coherent token sequences from 70-dimensional PCA embeddings while preserving over 97 percent cosine similarity with full MiniLM representations, using less than 17 percent of the parameter count of GPT-2. These results highlight PCA-based input compression as a general and effective strategy for aligning model capacity with information content, enabling lightweight architectures across multiple modalities.</description>

      <title>Bridging Simulation and Experiment: A Self-Supervised Domain Adaptation Framework for Concrete Damage Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable assessment of concrete degradation is critical for ensuring structural safety and longevity of engineering structures. This study proposes a self-supervised domain adaptation framework for robust concrete damage classification using coda wave signals. To support this framework, an advanced virtual testing platform is developed, combining multiscale modeling of concrete degradation with ultrasonic wave propagation simulations. This setup enables the generation of large-scale labeled synthetic data under controlled conditions, reducing the dependency on costly and time-consuming experimental labeling. However, neural networks trained solely on synthetic data often suffer from degraded performance when applied to experimental data due to domain shifts. To bridge this domain gap, the proposed framework integrates domain adversarial training, minimum class confusion loss, and the Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) strategy. These components work jointly to facilitate effective knowledge transfer from the labeled simulation domain to the unlabeled experimental domain, achieving accurate and reliable damage classification in concrete. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves notable performance improvements, reaching an accuracy of 0.7762 and a macro F1 score of 0.7713, outperforming both the plain 1D CNN baseline and six representative domain adaptation techniques. Moreover, the method exhibits high robustness across training runs and introduces only minimal additional computational cost. These findings highlight the practical potential of the proposed simulation-driven and label-efficient framework for real-world applications in structural health monitoring.</description>

      <title>SoK: Stablecoins for Digital Transformation -- Design, Metrics, and Application with Real World Asset Tokenization as a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stablecoins have become a foundational component of the digital asset ecosystem, with their market capitalization exceeding 230 billion USD as of May 2025. As fiat-referenced and programmable assets, stablecoins provide low-latency, globally interoperable infrastructure for payments, decentralized finance, DeFi, and tokenized commerce. Their accelerated adoption has prompted extensive regulatory engagement, exemplified by the European Union's Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation, MiCA, the US Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, GENIUS Act, and Hong Kong's Stablecoins Bill. Despite this momentum, academic research remains fragmented across economics, law, and computer science, lacking a unified framework for design, evaluation, and application. This study addresses that gap through a multi-method research design. First, it synthesizes cross-disciplinary literature to construct a taxonomy of stablecoin systems based on custodial structure, stabilization mechanism, and governance. Second, it develops a performance evaluation framework tailored to diverse stakeholder needs, supported by an open-source benchmarking pipeline to ensure transparency and reproducibility. Third, a case study on Real World Asset tokenization illustrates how stablecoins operate as programmable monetary infrastructure in cross-border digital systems. By integrating conceptual theory with empirical tools, the paper contributes: a unified taxonomy for stablecoin design; a stakeholder-oriented performance evaluation framework; an empirical case linking stablecoins to sectoral transformation; and reproducible methods and datasets to inform future research. These contributions support the development of trusted, inclusive, and transparent digital monetary infrastructure.</description>

      <title>GlaBoost: A multimodal Structured Framework for Glaucoma Risk Stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early and accurate detection of glaucoma is critical to prevent irreversible vision loss. However, existing methods often rely on unimodal data and lack interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. In this paper, we present GlaBoost, a multimodal gradient boosting framework that integrates structured clinical features, fundus image embeddings, and expert-curated textual descriptions for glaucoma risk prediction. GlaBoost extracts high-level visual representations from retinal fundus photographs using a pretrained convolutional encoder and encodes free-text neuroretinal rim assessments using a transformer-based language model. These heterogeneous signals, combined with manually assessed risk scores and quantitative ophthalmic indicators, are fused into a unified feature space for classification via an enhanced XGBoost model. Experiments conducted on a real-world annotated dataset demonstrate that GlaBoost significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving a validation accuracy of 98.71%. Feature importance analysis reveals clinically consistent patterns, with cup-to-disc ratio, rim pallor, and specific textual embeddings contributing most to model decisions. GlaBoost offers a transparent and scalable solution for interpretable glaucoma diagnosis and can be extended to other ophthalmic disorders.</description>

      <title>VAE-DNN: Energy-Efficient Trainable-by-Parts Surrogate Model For Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a trainable-by-parts surrogate model for solving forward and inverse parameterized nonlinear partial differential equations. Like several other surrogate and operator learning models, the proposed approach employs an encoder to reduce the high-dimensional input $y(\bm{x})$ to a lower-dimensional latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$. Then, a fully connected neural network is used to map $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$ to the latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_h}$, of the PDE solution $h(\bm{x},t)$. Finally, a decoder is utilized to reconstruct $h(\bm{x},t)$. The innovative aspect of our model is its ability to train its three components independently. This approach leads to a substantial decrease in both the time and energy required for training when compared to leading operator learning models such as FNO and DeepONet. The separable training is achieved by training the encoder as part of the variational autoencoder (VAE) for $y(\bm{x})$ and the decoder as part of the $h(\bm{x},t)$ VAE. We refer to this model as the VAE-DNN model. VAE-DNN is compared to the FNO and DeepONet models for obtaining forward and inverse solutions to the nonlinear diffusion equation governing groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer. Our findings indicate that VAE-DNN not only demonstrates greater efficiency but also delivers superior accuracy in both forward and inverse solutions compared to the FNO and DeepONet models.</description>

      <title>FinMMR: Make Financial Numerical Reasoning More Multimodal, Comprehensive, and Challenging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present FinMMR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark tailored to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in financial numerical reasoning tasks. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work introduces three significant advancements. (1) Multimodality: We meticulously transform existing financial reasoning benchmarks, and construct novel questions from the latest Chinese financial research reports. FinMMR comprises 4.3K questions and 8.7K images spanning 14 categories, including tables, bar charts, and ownership structure charts. (2) Comprehensiveness: FinMMR encompasses 14 financial subdomains, including corporate finance, banking, and industry analysis, significantly exceeding existing benchmarks in financial domain knowledge breadth. (3) Challenge: Models are required to perform multi-step precise numerical reasoning by integrating financial knowledge with the understanding of complex financial images and text. The best-performing MLLM achieves only 53.0% accuracy on Hard problems. We believe that FinMMR will drive advancements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Portfolio Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate benchmark deep reinforcement learning algorithms on the task of portfolio optimisation using simulated data. The simulator to generate the data is based on correlated geometric Brownian motion with the Bertsimas-Lo market impact model. Using the Kelly criterion (log utility) as the objective, we can analytically derive the optimal policy without market impact as an upper bound to measure performance when including market impact. We find that the off-policy algorithms DDPG, TD3 and SAC are unable to learn the right $Q$-function due to the noisy rewards and therefore perform poorly. The on-policy algorithms PPO and A2C, with the use of generalised advantage estimation, are able to deal with the noise and derive a close to optimal policy. The clipping variant of PPO was found to be important in preventing the policy from deviating from the optimal once converged. In a more challenging environment where we have regime changes in the GBM parameters, we find that PPO, combined with a hidden Markov model to learn and predict the regime context, is able to learn different policies adapted to each regime. Overall, we find that the sample complexity of these algorithms is too high for applications using real data, requiring more than 2m steps to learn a good policy in the simplest setting, which is equivalent to almost 8,000 years of daily prices.</description>

Abstract: Fashion is a powerful force in the modern world. It is one of the most accessible means of self-expression, thereby playing a significant role in our society. Yet, it is plagued by well-documented issues of waste and human rights abuses. Fast fashion in particular, characterized by its disposable nature, contributes extensively to environmental degradation and CO$_2$ emissions, surpassing the combined outputs of France, Germany, and the UK, but its economic contributions have somewhat shielded it from criticism. In this paper, we examine the demand for fast fashion, with a focus on Spain. We explore the individual decision-making process involved in choosing to buy fast fashion and the role of awareness regarding working conditions, environmental consequences, and education on sustainable fashion in influencing consumer behavior. By employing Agent-Based Modeling, we investigate the factors influencing garment consumption patterns and how shifts in public opinion can be achieved through peer pressure, social media influence, and government interventions. Our study revealed that government interventions are pivotal, with the state's campaigns setting the overall tone for progress, although its success is conditioned by social media and polarization levels of the population. Importantly, the state does not need to adopt an extremely proactive stance or continue the campaigns indefinitely to achieve optimal results, as excessive interventions yield diminishing returns.</description>

      <title>A CFL condition for the finite cell method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13675</link>

Abstract: Immersed boundary finite element methods allow the user to bypass the potentially troublesome task of boundary-conforming mesh generation. When combined with explicit time integration, poorly cut elements with little support in the physical domain lead to a severely reduced critical time step size, posing a major challenge for immersed wave propagation simulations. The finite cell method stabilizes cut elements by defining the weak form of the problem also in the fictitious domain, but scaled by a small value $\alpha$. This paper investigates the effect of the finite cell method on the critical time step size for explicit time integration. Starting with an analytical one-degree-of-freedom model, we systematically study the influence of $\alpha$-stabilization on the maximum eigenvalue, and thus on the critical time step size, for corner and sliver cuts. The analysis is complemented by a numerical study of an example with one element and increasing polynomial degree, confirming that the critical time step size does not decrease below a certain limit, even as the cut fraction tends to zero. This lower bound is controlled by the choice of $\alpha$. In higher dimensions, sliver cuts are found to be more detrimental than corner cuts, thus determining the minimum critical time step size. Increasing the polynomial degree has only little effect on this degradation. Based on these observations, we derive an estimate of the minimum critical time step size as a function of $\alpha$, which we use to propose a modified CFL condition for the finite cell method. The validity of this condition is demonstrated on a two-dimensional perforated plate example.</description>

      <title>Optimistic MEV in Ethereum Layer 2s: Why Blockspace Is Always in Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Layer 2 rollups are rapidly absorbing DeFi activity, securing over $40 billion and accounting for nearly half of Ethereum's DEX volume by Q1 2025, yet their MEV dynamics remain understudied. We address this gap by defining and quantifying optimistic MEV, a form of speculative, on-chain MEV whose detection and execution logic reside largely on-chain in smart contracts. As a result of their speculative nature and lack of off-chain opportunity verification, optimistic MEV transactions frequently decide not to execute any trades.
  In this work, we focus on cyclic arbitrage, which we find is predominantly executed as optimistic MEV on Layer 2s. Using our multi-stage identification pipeline on Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism, we show that in Q1 2025, transactions from cyclic arbitrage contracts account for over 50% of on-chain gas on Base and Optimism and 7% on Arbitrum, driven mainly by "interaction" probes (on-chain computations searching for arbitrage). This speculative probing indicates that cyclic arbitrage on Layer 2s is predominantly executed as optimistic MEV and contributes to generally keeping blocks on Base and Optimism persistently full. Despite consuming over half of on-chain gas, these optimistic MEV transactions pay less than one quarter of total gas fees. Cross-network comparison reveals divergent success rates, differing patterns of code reuse, and sensitivity to varying sequencer ordering and block production times. Finally, OLS regressions link optimistic MEV trade count to ETH volatility, retail trading activity, and DEX aggregator usage. Together, these findings show that optimistic MEV has become a major source of persistent spam-like transaction activity on Layer 2s, dominating blockspace with low-value probes and reshaping the composition of on-chain activity.</description>

      <title>SINDyG: Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-Structured Data, with Applications to Stuart-Landau Oscillator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04463v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combination of machine learning (ML) and sparsity-promoting techniques is enabling direct extraction of governing equations from data, revolutionizing computational modeling in diverse fields of science and engineering. The discovered dynamical models could be used to address challenges in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, epidemiology, and beyond. However, most existing sparse identification methods for discovering dynamical systems treat the whole system as one without considering the interactions between subsystems. As a result, such models are not able to capture small changes in the emergent system behavior. To address this issue, we developed a new method called Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-structured data (SINDyG), which incorporates the network structure into sparse regression to identify model parameters that explain the underlying network dynamics. We tested our proposed method using several case studies of neuronal dynamics, where we modeled the macroscopic oscillation of a population of neurons using the extended Stuart-Landau (SL) equation and utilize the SINDyG method to identify the underlying nonlinear dynamics. Our extensive computational experiments validate the improved accuracy and simplicity of discovered network dynamics when compared to the original SINDy approach. The proposed graph-informed penalty can be easily integrated with other symbolic regression algorithms, enhancing model interpretability and performance by incorporating network structure into the regression process.</description>

      <title>FinanceReasoning: Benchmarking Financial Numerical Reasoning More Credible, Comprehensive and Challenging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce FinanceReasoning, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) in financial numerical reasoning problems. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work provides three key advancements. (1) Credibility: We update 15.6% of the questions from four public datasets, annotating 908 new questions with detailed Python solutions and rigorously refining evaluation standards. This enables an accurate assessment of the reasoning improvements of LRMs. (2) Comprehensiveness: FinanceReasoning covers 67.8% of financial concepts and formulas, significantly surpassing existing datasets. Additionally, we construct 3,133 Python-formatted functions, which enhances LRMs' financial reasoning capabilities through refined knowledge (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 91.6% for GPT-4o). (3) Challenge: Models are required to apply multiple financial formulas for precise numerical reasoning on 238 Hard problems. The best-performing model (i.e., OpenAI o1 with PoT) achieves 89.1% accuracy, yet LRMs still face challenges in numerical precision. We demonstrate that combining Reasoner and Programmer models can effectively enhance LRMs' performance (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 87.8% for DeepSeek-R1). Our work paves the way for future research on evaluating and improving LRMs in domain-specific complex reasoning tasks.</description>
