      <title>Bayesian model mixing with multi-reference energy density functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliably predicting nuclear properties across the entire chart of isotopes is important for applications ranging from nuclear astrophysics to superheavy science to nuclear technology. To this day, however, all the theoretical models that can scale at the level of the chart of isotopes remain semi phenomenological. Because they are fitted locally, their predictive power can vary significantly; different versions of the same theory provide different predictions. Bayesian model mixing takes advantage of such imperfect models to build a local mixture of a set of models to make improved predictions. Earlier attempts to use Bayesian model mixing for mass table calculations relied on models treated at single-reference energy density functional level, which fail to capture some of the correlations caused by configuration mixing or the restoration of broken symmetries. In this study we have applied Bayesian model mixing techniques within a multi-reference energy density functional (MR-EDF) framework. We considered predictions of two-particle separation energies from particle number projection or angular momentum projection with four different energy density functionals - a total of eight different MR-EDF models. We used a hierarchical Bayesian stacking framework with a Dirichlet prior distribution over weights together with an inverse log-ratio transform to enable positive correlations between different models. We found that Bayesian model mixing provide significantly improved predictions over results from single MR-EDF calculations.</description>

      <title>Reduced Basis Method for Few-body Bound State Emulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in both theoretical and computational methods have enabled large-scale, precision calculations of the properties of atomic nuclei. With the growing complexity of modern nuclear theory, however, also comes the need for novel methods to perform systematic studies and quantify the uncertainties of models when confronted with experimental data. This study presents an application of such an approach, the reduced basis method, to substantially lower computational costs by constructing a significantly smaller Hamiltonian subspace informed by previous solutions. Our method shows comparable efficiency and accuracy to other dimensionality reduction techniques on an artificial three-body bound system while providing a richer representation of physical information in its projection and training subspace. This methodological advancement can be applied in other contexts and has the potential to greatly improve our ability to systematically explore theoretical models and thus enhance our understanding of the fundamental properties of nuclear systems.</description>

      <title>A unified mechanism for the origin and evolution of nuclear magicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple pattern of organisation, the nuclear shell structure, emerges from the complex interactions between nucleons in nuclei and determines, to some significant degree, nuclear structure properties. Recent experimental investigations of exotic nuclei revealed a shortfall in our current understanding of nuclear shell evolution and nuclear magicity. We introduce a novel perspective where the Dirac mass kinetic term, which stems from the singular participation of a spin-0 boson in the nuclear strong force, plays a pivotal role in generating the nuclear shell structure. Namely, the combination of the Dirac mass kinetic Term with the spin-orbit term redefines magic numbers both in stable and exotic nuclei. The identification of this mechanism allows to provide a broad understanding of the origin and evolution of nuclear magic numbers.</description>

      <title>Three-nucleon force effects in polarization transfers from the doubly spin-polarized initial proton-deuteron state to the outgoing proton in proton-deuteron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss new spin observables presently accessible to measurement, namely polarization transfer coefficients from doubly spin-polarized initial state to the outgoing proton in the elastic proton-deuteron (pd) scattering and in the deuteron breakup reactions. The sensitivity of these observables to three-nucleon force (3NF) effects is investigated and compared to sensitivities of the constituent standard single polarization transfer coefficients. $K_{y,y}^{y'}$ in elastic pd scattering, for which large 3NF effects, up to 40\%, have been found at higher energies, seems the most promising observable to measure.</description>

      <title>Critical fluid dynamics in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a numerical method for simulating stochastic fluid dynamics near a critical point in the Ising universality class. This theory is known as model H, and is expected to govern the non-equilibrium dynamics of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) near a possible critical endpoint of the phase transition between a hadron liquid and the quark-gluon plasma. The numerical algorithm is based on a Metropolis scheme, and automatically ensures that the distribution function of the hydrodynamic variables in equilibrium is independent of the transport coefficients and only governed by the microscopic free energy. We verify dynamic scaling near the critical point of a two and three-dimensional fluid and extract the associated critical exponent $z$. We find $z\simeq 3$ in three dimensions, and $z\simeq 2$ for a two-dimensional fluid. In a finite system, we observe a crossover between the mean field value $z=4$ and the true critical exponent $z\simeq 3$ ($z \simeq 2$ in $d=2$). This crossover is governed by the values of the correlation length and the renormalized shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Improved structure of calcium isotopes from ab initio calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The in-medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG) is a powerful and flexible many-body method to compute the structure of nuclei starting from nuclear forces. Recent developments have extended the IMSRG from its standard truncation at the normal-ordered two-body level, the IMSRG(2), to a precision approximation including normal-ordered three-body operators, the IMSRG(3)-$N^7$. This improvement provides a more precise solution to the many-body problem and makes it possible to quantify many-body uncertainties in IMSRG calculations. We explore the structure of $^{44,48,52}$Ca using the IMSRG(3)-$N^7$, focusing on understanding existing discrepancies of the IMSRG(2) to experimental results. We find a significantly better description of the first $2^+$ excitation energy of $^{48}Ca$, improving the description of the shell closure at $N=28$. At the same time, we find that the IMSRG(3)-$N^7$ corrections to charge radii do not resolve the systematic underprediction of the puzzling large charge radius difference between $^{52}$Ca and $^{48}$Ca. We present estimates of many-body uncertainties of IMSRG(2) calculations applicable also to other systems based on the size extensivity of the method.</description>

      <title>Robust correlation between binding energies and charge radii of mirror nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the charge density from the two-parameter Fermi model, a robust and nontrival correlation between binding energis and charge radii of mirror nuclei is newly proposed. This correlation enables simple yet reliable predictions of the nuclear mass and charge radius of proton-rich nuclei. The validity of these predictions is demonstrated by comparing the predicted binding energies and charge radii with experimental data and predictions from other models. All 197 predicted binding energies and 199 charge radii involved in the comparisons are tabulated in the Supplemental Materials of this paper. The noticeable discrepancies are attributed to the large asymmetry in charge densities of mirror nuclei, suggesting that the proposed correlation could be a sensitive probe for local structural anomaly, such as shell closure and proton halo. The difference in mass dependence of charge radii near the proton dripline compared to those along the $\beta$-stability line supports the validity of our prediction method.</description>

      <title>Learning Hadron Emitting Sources with Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlation function observed in high-energy collision experiments encodes critical information about the emitted source and hadronic interactions. While the proton-proton interaction potential is well constrained by nucleon-nucleon scattering data, these measurements offer a unique avenue to investigate the proton-emitting source, reflecting the dynamical properties of the collisions. In this Letter, we present an unbiased approach to reconstruct proton-emitting sources from experimental correlation functions. Within an automatic differentiation framework, we parameterize the source functions with deep neural networks, to compute correlation functions. This approach achieves a lower chi-squared value compared to conventional Gaussian source functions and captures the long-tail behavior, in qualitative agreement with simulation predictions.</description>

      <title>Simple Scaling Laws for Energy Correlators in Nuclear Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collider experiments involving nuclei provide a direct means of studying exotic states of nuclear matter. Recent measurements of energy correlators in both proton-nucleus (p-A) and nucleus-nucleus (A-A) collisions reveal sizable modifications, attributable to nuclear effects, compared to proton-proton (p-p) collisions. Energy correlators, and their associated light-ray operator product expansion (OPE), allow scaling behaviors of the measured spectrum to be directly mapped to properties of the underlying quantum field theory. Here, we demonstrate for the first time how this mapping occurs in nuclear collisions, and highlight how the light-ray OPE characterizes leading nuclear effects. We show that the leading modification to the energy correlator distribution is characterized by an enhancement of the expectation value of twist-4 light-ray operators, resulting in a scaling for the ratio of the two-point correlator in nuclear matter to that in vacuum of $\sim 1+a\theta^2$ up to quantum corrections. We verify that this leading twist-4 correction accurately describes recent A-A and p-A data, and is thus sufficient to capture the scaling behavior within the angular range measured for jet radii used in nuclear experiments. Our light-ray OPE based approach lays the groundwork for a rigorous characterization of nuclear modification to energy correlator observables.</description>

      <title>Kaon Distribution Functions from Empirical Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using available information from Drell-Yan data on pion and kaon structure functions, an approach is described which enables the development of pointwise profiles for all pion and kaon parton distribution functions (DFs) without reference to theories of hadron structure. The key steps are construction of structure-function-constrained probability-weighted ensembles of valence DF replicas and use of an evolution scheme for parton DFs that is all-orders exact. The DFs obtained express qualitatively sound features of light-meson structure, e.g., the effects of Higgs boson couplings into QCD and the size of heavy-quark momentum fractions in light hadrons. In order to improve the results, additional and more precise data on the $u$-quark-in-kaon, $u^K$, to $u$-quark-in-pion, $u^\pi$, DF ratio would be necessary. Of greater value would be extraction of $u^K$ alone, thereby avoiding inference from the ratio: currently, the data-based form of $u^K$ is materially influenced by results for $u^\pi$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new model-independent method for determining hadronic resonances from lattice QCD. The formalism is derived from the general principles of unitarity and analyticity, as encoded in the $N/D$ representation of a partial-wave two-body amplitude. The associated quantization condition relates the finite-volume spectrum to the infinite-volume numerator, $\mathcal{N}$, used to reconstruct the scattering amplitude from dispersive relations. Unlike the original L\"uscher condition, this new formalism is valid for energies coinciding with the left-hand cuts from arbitrary one- and multi-particle exchanges.</description>

      <title>Towards a parameter-free determination of critical exponents and chiral phase transition temperature in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to quantify the universal properties of the chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD, we make use of an improved, renormalized order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking which is obtained as a suitable difference of the $2$-flavor light quark chiral condensate and its corresponding light quark susceptibility. Having no additive ultraviolet as well as multiplicative logarithmic divergences, we use ratios of this order parameter constructed from its values for two different light quark masses. We show that this facilitates determining in a parameter-independent manner, the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ and the associated critical exponent $\delta$ which, for sufficiently small values of the light quark masses, controls the quark mass dependence of the order parameter at $T_c$. We present first results of these calculations from our numerical analysis performed with staggered fermions on $N_\tau=8$ lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exact analytical solution to the nonlinear relativistic Boltzmann equation for a massless gas with a non-isotropic cross section is given in a homogeneous spacetime. By employing a trial solution, we construct a set of nonlinear coupled equations for scalar moments and solve this set exactly. Our analytical solution with nontrivial scattering angle dependence contained can be mapped onto the BKW solution of a homogeneous nonrelativistic gas of Maxwell molecules. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a feasible region determined by physical requirements. The analytical solution with parameters within the feasible region admits a stable fixed point corresponding to the equilibrium solution of the Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <title>Luminosity predictions for the first three ionisation stages of W, Pt and Au to probe potential sources of emission in kilonova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large number of R-matrix calculations of electron impact excitation for heavy elements (Z &gt; 70) have been performed in recent years for applications in fusion and astrophysics research. With the expanding interest in heavy ions due to kilonova (KN) events such as AT2017gfo and GRB230307A, this new data can be utilised for the diagnosis and study of observed KN spectra. In this work recently computed electron-impact excitation effective collision strengths are used, for the first three ionisation stages of tungsten (W, Z = 74), platinum (Pt, Z = 78) and gold (Au, Z = 79), to construct basic collisional radiative models tailored for the late stage nebular phases of KN. Line luminosities are calculated at a range of electron temperatures and densities and the strengths of these lines for a representative ion mass are compared. For the case of W III, these optically thin intensities are additionally used to constrain the mass of this ion in both AT2017gfo and GRB230307A. Comparing with theoretical predictions of nucleosynthesis yields from neutron star merger simulations, broad agreement with the inferred ion masses of W is found. Furthermore, we highlight the value of W measurements by showing that the abundance of other groups of elements and outflow properties are constrained by exploiting theoretically motivated correlations between the abundance of W and that of lanthanides or third r-process peak elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the role of gluon dynamics in $\eta'$ physics and in nucleon resonances where excitations of gluonic potentials may also be important. Interesting phenomenology includes a possible narrow near threshold resonance in $\eta'$ photoproduction and whether the parity doublets observed in the higher mass nucleon resonance spectrum might be hinting a possible second minimum in the confinement potential corresponding to supercritical confinement.</description>

      <title>Statistical Theory of Neutron-Induced Nuclear Fission and of Heavy-Ion Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For both reactions we use an approach similar to that of compound-nucleus reaction theory. For neutron-induced fission, we describe the compound system generated by absorption of the neutron and the nuclear system near the scission point as two statistically independent systems governed by random-matrix theory. The systems are connected either by a barrier penetration factor or by a set of transition states above the barrier. Each system is coupled to a different set of channels. An analogous model is used for heavy-ion fusion. Assuming that (seen from the entrance channel) the system on the other side of the barrier is in the regime of strongly overlapping resonances, we obtain for fixed spin and parity closed-form analytical expressions for the total probability for fission and for fusion. Parts of these expressions can be calculated reliably within existing compound-nucleus reaction theory. The remaining parts are the probabilities for passage through or over the barrier. These may be determined theoretically from the liquid-drop model or experimentally from total fission or fusion cross sections.</description>

      <title>An MLE-based analysis of flow factorization and event-plane correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we use the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) to explore factorization and event-plane correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Our analyses incorporate both numerical simulations and publicly available data from the CMS Collaboration. We focus on Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV. The differential flows obtained for various centrality windows and momentum cuts are consistent with conventional methodologies such as multi-particle cumulants and event-plane methods. Leveraging these findings, we proceed to undertake further analysis of flow factorization and event-plane correlations. These quantities are relevant because of their sensitivity to initial-state fluctuations. While higher-order correlators might provide different implementations of factorization ratio, the MLE estimator is readily applied to these scenarios. Moreover, MLE's unique capabilities allow us to compute specific correlators that are typically inaccessible by other means. As an asymptotically normal and unbiased estimator, MLE provides a valuable alternative tool for flow and correlation analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic \textit{ab initio} study of the low-lying states in beryllium isotopes from $^7\text{Be}$ to $^{12}\text{Be}$ using nuclear lattice effective field theory with the N$^3$LO interaction. Our calculations achieve excellent agreement with experimental data for energies, radii, and electromagnetic properties. We introduce a novel, model-independent method to quantify nuclear shapes, uncovering a distinct pattern in the interplay between positive and negative parity states across the isotopic chain. Our geometrical analysis reveals prominent two-center cluster structures, the emergence of one-neutron halo, and complex nuclear molecular dynamics, underscoring the strong clustering features inherent to beryllium isotopes.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy tetraquark states in a mass splitting model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Treating the $X(4140)$ as a compact $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ state and using its mass as a reference scale, we systematically estimate the masses of doubly heavy tetraquark states $QQ\bar{q}\bar{q}$ where $Q=c,b$ and $q=u,d,s$. Their decay properties are studied with a simple rearrangement scheme. Based on our results, the lowest $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ $bb\bar{n}\bar{n}$ state is a stable tetraquark about 20 MeV below the $\bar{B}^*\bar{B}$ threshold. The mass and width of the low-mass $0(1^+)$ $cc\bar{n}\bar{n}$ ($n=u,d$) tetraquark are compatible with the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ observed by the LHCb Collaboration. The location of the lowest $0(0^+)$ and $0(1^+)$ $bc\bar{n}\bar{n}$ states are found to be close to the $\bar{B}D$ and $\bar{B}^*D$ thresholds, respectively. We hope that the predicted ratios between partial widths of different channels may be helpful to identify compact tetraquark states from future measurements.</description>

      <title>QCD Phase Diagram and the Finite Volume Fireball: A Model Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental investigations of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter involve collisions of heavy ions at ultrarelativistic velocities. The medium created in such a collision is often of dimensions a few fermi, in particular in the Beam Energy Scan experiments. An understanding of the effect of the finite volume and the boundary is important for connecting the experimental results to the phase diagram.
  Using the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model, an effective theory for the chiral transition of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), we have studied the effect of the finite volume of the fireball on the transition line at finite temperature and density using the MIT boundary condition to mimic the condition that the system is deconfined inside. The shift of the transition temperature for finite volume and finite volume effect on number density and its susceptibilities are studied. The volume effects should be considered when looking for signatures of the phase diagram in experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many excited states in the hadron spectrum have large branching ratios to three-hadron final states. Understanding such particles from first principles QCD requires input from lattice QCD with one-, two-, and three-meson interpolators as well as a reliable three-body formalism relating finite-volume spectra at unphysical pion mass values to the scattering amplitudes at the physical point. In this work, we provide the first-ever calculation of the resonance parameters of the $\omega$ meson from lattice QCD, including an update of the formalism through matching to effective field theories. The main result of this pioneering study, the pole position of the $\omega$ meson at $\sqrt{s_\omega}= (778.0(11.2)-i\,3.0(5) )\,\mathrm{MeV}$, agrees reasonably well with experiment. In addition we provide an estimate of the $\omega-\rho$ mass difference as $29(15)\,\mathrm{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>Fundamental physical constants, operation of physical phenomena and entropy increase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03773v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approaching the problem of understanding fundamental physical constants (FPCs) started with discussing the role these constants play in high-energy nuclear physics and astrophysics. Condensed matter physics was relatively unexplored in this regard. More recently, it was realised that FPCs set lower or upper bounds on key condensed matter properties. Here, we discuss a much wider role played by FPCs in condensed matter physics: at given environmental conditions, FPCs set the observability and operation of entire physical effects and phenomena. We discuss structural and superconducting phase transitions and transitions between different states of matter, with implications for life processes. We also discuss metastable states, transitions between them, chemical reactions and their products. A byproduct of this discussion is that the order of magnitude of the transition temperature can be calculated from FPCs only. We show that the new states emerging as a result of various transitions increase the phase space and entropy. Were FPCs to take different values, these transitions would become inoperative at our environmental conditions and the new states due to these transitions would not emerge. This suggests that the current values of FPCs, by enabling various transitions and reactions which give rise to new states, promote entropy increase. Based on this entropy increase and the associated increase of statistical probability, we conjecture that entropy increase is a selection principle for FPCs considered to be variable in earlier discussions.</description>

      <title>Probing the QCD Critical End Point with Finite-Size Scaling of Net-Baryon Cumulant Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) critical end point (CEP) is a central focus in heavy-ion physics, as it provides insights into the phase structure of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions. Finite-size scaling (FSS) analysis is applied to explore the critical behavior of cumulant ratios \( C_2/C_1 \), \( C_3/C_2 \), \( C_4/C_2 \), \( C_3/C_1 \), and \( C_4/C_1 \), measured in Au+Au collisions across the Beam Energy Scan (BES) range of 7.7 to 200 GeV. The inferred CEP from the FSS analysis is located at \(\sqrt{s}_{\text{CEP}} \approx 33.0 \, \text{GeV}\), corresponding to \( \mu_{B,\text{CEP}} \approx 130 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( T_{\text{CEP}} \approx 158.5 \, \text{MeV}\), as derived from the freeze-out curve. The scaling functions for these cumulant ratios reveal non-monotonic patterns, where critical fluctuations manifest as distinct scaling behaviors. Specifically, the FSS analysis demonstrates upward divergence of \( C_2/C_1 \) and \( C_4/C_1 \), and downward divergence of \( C_3/C_2 \) and \( C_4/C_2 \), consistent with theoretical expectations for critical dynamics near the CEP. These findings validate the robustness of these cumulant ratios as effective probes for critical phenomena, offering structured evidence for the inferred CEP in QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Effect of invisible neutrino decay on neutrino oscillation at long baselines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the effect of invisible neutrino decay of the third neutrino state for accelerator neutrino experiments at two different baselines, 1300 km with a liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) detector (similar to DUNE) and 2588 km with a water Cherenkov detector (similar to P2O). For such baselines, the matter effect starts to become important. Our aim is to ascertain the sensitivity to mass hierarchy and octant of $\theta_{23}$ in these two experiments in the presence of a decaying neutrino state. We compare and contrast the results of the two experimental setups. We find that, in general, hierarchy sensitivity decreases in the presence of decay. However, if we consider decay only in the opposite hierarchy (test scenario), in the 2588 km setup, the hierarchy sensitivity with the true hierarchy as IH is larger than the no decay case. We also study the dependence of hierarchy sensitivity with true $\theta_{23}$. We find that the dominant muon background in P2O plays an important role in how the hierarchy sensitivity depends on $\theta_{23}$. The octant sensitivity for both setups increases in the presence of decay except for the LArTPC setup in case true $\theta_{23}=49^\circ$. To understand the octant sensitivity results in the two setups, we check the synergy in sensitivity between electron and muon channels as a function of test $\theta_{23}$. We also study the degeneracies in the test $\theta_{23}-\delta_{CP}$ plane and find that combined analysis of the two setups removes all the degeneracies in the test $\theta_{23}-\delta_{CP}$ plane at $5\sigma$ significance.</description>

      <title>Small-$x$ evolution of dipole amplitude in momentum space: forward--off-forward correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have shown that the small-$x$ evolution of the off-forward leading-log dipole scattering amplitudes, both pomeron and odderon, in the momentum space can be completely determined by the evolution of the respective forward amplitudes, with rescaled momenta. In position space, if there is translation symmetry (assumption of a large nucleus), the dipole cross section depends on the positions of quarks and anti-quarks only through their separation. The present study is an equivalent proposition in the momentum space -- where translation symmetry in momentum bifurcates the amplitudes into two translationally symmetric functions along the ${\bf k}$ line in the ${\bf k}-{\bf \Delta}$ plane. It also shows that high energy evolutions of dipole GTMDs can be achieved only by studying the evolution of dipole TMDs at small-$x$.</description>

      <title>Nucleon relativistic weak-neutral axial-vector four-current distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic full weak-neutral axial-vector four-current distributions inside a general spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system are systematically studied for the first time, where the second-class current contribution associated with the induced (pseudo-)tensor form factor (FF) is included. For experimental measurements, we explicitly derive the first exact full tree-level unpolarized differential cross sections of both (anti)neutrino-nucleon and (anti)neutrino-antinucleon elastic scatterings. We clearly demonstrate that the 3D axial charge distribution in the Breit frame, being purely imaginary and parity-odd, is in fact related to the induced (pseudo-)tensor FF $G_T^Z(Q^2)$ rather than the axial FF $G_A^Z(Q^2)$. We study the frame-dependence of full axial-vector four-current distributions for a moving system, and compared them with their light-front counterparts. We clarify the role played by Melosh rotations, and classify the origin of distortions in light-front distributions into three key sources using the lemma that we have proposed and verified in this work. In particular, we show that the second-class current contribution, although explicitly included, does not contribute in fact to the mean-square axial and spin radii. We finally illustrate our results in the case of a proton using the weak-neutral axial-vector FFs extracted from experimental data.</description>

Abstract: The observations of compact star inspirals from LIGO/Virgo combined with mass and radius measurements from NICER provide a valuable tool to study the highly uncertain equation of state (EOS) of dense matter at the densities characteristic of compact stars. In this work, we constrain the solid states of strange-cluster matter, called strangeon matter, as the putative basic units of the ground state of bulk strong matter using a Bayesian statistical method, incorporating the mass and radius measurements of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, and the recent data for the $1.4\ M_{\odot}$ pulsar PSR J0437-4715. We also include constraints from gravitational wave events GW170817 and GW190814. Under the prior assumption of a finite number of quarks in a strangeon, $N_{\rm q}$, our analysis reveals that current mass-radius measurements favor a larger $N_{\rm q}$. Specifically, the results support the scenario where a strangeon forms a stable bound state with $N_{\rm q}=18$, symmetric in color, flavor, and spin spaces, compared to the minimum $N_{\rm q}$ prior. The comparative analyses of the posterior EOS parameter spaces derived from three-parameter model and two-parameter model demonstrate a consistent prediction under identical observational constraints. In particular, our results indicate that the most probable values of the maximum mass are found to be $3.58^{+0.16}_{-0.12}\ M_{\odot}$ ($3.65^{+0.18}_{-0.16}\ M_{\odot}$) at $90\%$ confidence level for three-parameter (two-parameter) EOS considering the constraints of GW190814. The corresponding radii for $1.4\ M_{\odot}$ and $2.1\ M_{\odot}$ stars are $12.04^{+0.27}_{-0.31}~\rm km$ ($12.16^{+0.26}_{-0.31}~\rm km$) and $13.43^{+0.31}_{-0.32}~\rm km$ ($13.60^{+0.29}_{-0.34}~\rm km$), respectively. This result may impact interestingly on the research of multiquark states, which could improve our understanding of the nonperturbative strong force.</description>
