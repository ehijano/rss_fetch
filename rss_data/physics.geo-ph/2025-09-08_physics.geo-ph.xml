      <title>Relativity of Time in Earthquake Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop an understanding of the proper time of the Tohoku earthquake source. The paper is dedicated to the 120th anniversary of Einstein's theory of relativity, but the dedication is symbolic, since we are investigating a purely non-relativistic geophysical object. We still found it possible to borrow the terms time relativity and proper time from the theory of relativity. The concept of the proper time of the source is developed by us within the framework of the phenomenological theory of earthquakes. The paper describes a procedure for measuring proper time using observation data of foreshocks and aftershocks. We synchronized the imaginary underground clock that counted the proper time and the clock that showed world time. The idea of a hypothetical underground clock turned out to be effective. We have shown that the proper time of the source flows unevenly relative to the flow of world time. Two phases of the evolution of the source before the main shock of the earthquake were discovered. This complements the picture of three-phase relaxation of the source after the main shock, which we established earlier. The uneven flow of proper time relative to world time indicates the non-stationarity of the source parameters. The overall conclusion is that the concept of the proper time of the source has enriched the possibilities of experimental study of earthquakes.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of slip dynamics, scaling &amp; statistical laws emerge from simplified model of fault and damage zone architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismological and geodetic observations of a fault zone reveal a wide range of slip dynamics, scaling, and statistical laws. However, the underlying physical mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we show that incorporating an off-fault damage zone-characterized by distributed fractures surrounding a main fault-can reproduce many key features observed in seismic and geodetic data. We model a 2D shear fault zone in which off-fault cracks follow power-law size and density distributions, and are oriented either optimally or parallel to the main fault. All fractures follow the rate-and-state friction law with parameters chosen such that each can host slip instabilities. We do not introduce spatial heterogeneities in the frictional properties of the fault. Using quasi-dynamic boundary integral simulations accelerated by hierarchical matrices, we simulate slip dynamics of this system and analyze the events produced both on and off the main fault. Despite the spatially uniform frictional properties, we observe a natural continuum from slow to fast ruptures, as observed in nature. Our simulations reproduce the Omori law, the inverse Omori law, the Gutenberg-Richter scaling, and the moment-duration scaling. We also observe seismicity localizing toward the main fault when an event is about to nucleate on the main fault. During slow slip events, off-fault seismicity migrates in a pattern resembling a fluid diffusion front, despite the absence of fluids in the model. We also show that tremors, Very Low Frequency Earthquakes (VLFEs), Low Frequency Earthquakes (LFEs), Slow Slip Events (SSEs), and earthquakes (EQs) can all emerge naturally in the `digital twin' framework.</description>

      <title>Ice-free geomorphometry of Enderby Land, East Antarctica: 2. Coastal oases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geomorphometric modeling and mapping of ice-free Antarctic areas can be applied for obtaining new quantitative knowledge about the topography of these unique landscapes and for the further use of morphometric information in Antarctic research. Within the framework of a project of creating a physical geographical thematic scientific reference geomorphometric atlas of ice-free areas of Antarctica, we performed geomorphometric modeling and mapping of five key coastal oases of Enderby Land, East Antarctica. These include, from west to east, the Konovalov Oasis, Thala Hills (Molodezhny and Vecherny Oases), Fyfe Hills, and Howard Hills. As input data, we used five fragments of the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA). For the coastal oases and adjacent ice sheet and glaciers, we derived models and maps of eleven, most scientifically important morphometric variables (i.e., slope, aspect, horizontal curvature, vertical curvature, minimal curvature, maximal curvature, catchment area, topographic wetness index, stream power index, total insolation, and wind exposition index). In total, we derived 60 maps in 1:50,000 and 1:75,000 scales. The obtained models and maps describe the coastal oases of Enderby Land in a rigorous, quantitative, and reproducible manner. New morphometric data can be useful for further geological, geomorphological, glaciological, ecological, and hydrological studies of this region.</description>

      <title>Surface Wave-Aerodynamic Roughness Length Model for Air-Sea Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new model to evaluate the equivalent hydrodynamic length or surface roughness, z0, of ocean waves is developed and tested. The proposed Surface Wave-Aerodynamic Roughness Length (SWARL) model requires maps of the wave surface height at consecutive times and the air flow characteristic Reynolds number as inputs. Pressure drag is accounted for by approximating the relative velocity in a frame moving with the local wave phase-speed assuming ideal inviscid ramp flow (Ayala et al. 2024). Drag from viscous and unresolved ripples is modeled using the standard equilibrium model. The SWARL model is tested using over 300 datasets for monochromatic and broad-spectrum wave surfaces. The model-predicted z0 and drag coefficients are compared to measured values, as well as commonly used wave parametrization methods found in the literature. For datasets with well-characterized surfaces, the proposed model shows significantly better agreement with data compared to prior models. For data that did not include a full characterization of the wave fields (typically field data), the model yields predictions with accuracy similar to prior models. Results highlight that including detailed flow physics and extensive wave-field characterization in the modeling of z0 can provide significant improvements in roughness-length based modeling of air-sea interactions.</description>
