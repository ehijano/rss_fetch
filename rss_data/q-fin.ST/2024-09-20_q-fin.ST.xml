      <title>Quantifying neural network uncertainty under volatility clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-series with volatility clustering pose a unique challenge to uncertainty quantification (UQ) for returns forecasts. Methods for UQ such as Deep Evidential regression offer a simple way of quantifying return forecast uncertainty without the costs of a full Bayesian treatment. However, the Normal-Inverse-Gamma (NIG) prior adopted by Deep Evidential regression is prone to miscalibration as the NIG prior is assigned to latent mean and variance parameters in a hierarchical structure. Moreover, it also overparameterizes the marginal data distribution. These limitations may affect the accurate delineation of epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties. We propose a Scale Mixture Distribution as a simpler alternative which can provide favorable complexity-accuracy trade-off and assign separate subnetworks to each model parameter. To illustrate the performance of our proposed method, we apply it to two sets of financial time-series exhibiting volatility clustering: cryptocurrencies and U.S. equities and test the performance in some ablation studies.</description>

      <title>Designing an attack-defense game: how to increase robustness of financial transaction models via a competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Banks routinely use neural networks to make decisions. While these models offer higher accuracy, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks, a risk often overlooked in the context of event sequences, particularly sequences of financial transactions, as most works consider computer vision and NLP modalities.
  We propose a thorough approach to studying these risks: a novel type of competition that allows a realistic and detailed investigation of problems in financial transaction data. The participants directly oppose each other, proposing attacks and defenses -- so they are examined in close-to-real-life conditions.
  The paper outlines our unique competition structure with direct opposition of participants, presents results for several different top submissions, and analyzes the competition results. We also introduce a new open dataset featuring financial transactions with credit default labels, enhancing the scope for practical research and development.</description>
