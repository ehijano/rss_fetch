      <title>Extrinsic Characterisations of Immersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We outline the history of the idea of deformation of space, which lead to the concept of curvature invariants, as we understand them today, including contributions of E. Bacaloglu and F. Casorati, among others. We pursue the following question: what is the best way to quantify the deformation of space? This important question could be viewed in a new paradigm after 1956, when John F. Nash, Jr. proved that a Riemannian manifold can be immersed isometrically into an Euclidean ambient space of dimension sufficiently large. This important theorem allowed to view the representation of space from its exterior, from an outside perspective. In 1968, S.-S. Chern pointed out that a key technical element in applying Nash's Theorem effectively is finding useful relationships between intrinsic and extrinsic quantities characterising immersions. And such relations seem to be rather few, at least few enough to present us with a technical challenge in applying Nash's Theorem. One technical difficulty is presented by the passing through the narrow gateway provided by Gauss' equation, and that's why in order to obtain some new results it might be useful to include additional natural conditions. A turning point in the history of the question we pursue was an enlightening paper written by B.-Y. Chen in 1993, which paved the way for a deeper understanding of the meaning of the Riemannian inequalities between intrinsic and extrinsic quantities. Our present discussion invites a reflection on whether we could hope to characterise submanifolds by using mainly extrinsic quantities.</description>

      <title>Connected Theorems: A Graph-Based Approach to Evaluating Mathematical Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of mathematical results plays a central role in assessing researchers' contributions and shaping the direction of the field. Currently, such evaluations rely primarily on human judgment, whether through journal peer review or committees at research institutions. To complement these traditional processes, we propose a data-driven approach. We construct a hierarchical graph linking theorems, papers, and fields to capture their citation relationships. We then introduce a PageRank-style algorithm to compute influence scores for these entities. Using these scores, we analyze the evolution of field rankings over time and quantify the impact between fields. We hope this framework can contribute to the development of more advanced, quantitative methods for evaluating mathematical research and serve as a complement to expert assessment.</description>
