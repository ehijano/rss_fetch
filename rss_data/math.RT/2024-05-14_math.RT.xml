      <title>Positive formula for the product of conjugacy classes on the unitary group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convolution product of two generic conjugacy classes of the unitary group $U_n$ is described by a probability distribution on the space of central measures which admits a density. Relating the convolution to the quantum Littlewood-Richardson coefficients and using recent results describing those coefficients, we give a manifestly positive formula for this density. In the same flavor as the hive model of Knutson and Tao, this formula is given in terms of a subtraction-free sum of volumes of explicit polytopes. As a consequence, this expression also provides a positive formula for the volume of moduli spaces of $SU_n$-valued flat connections on the three-holed two dimensional sphere, which was first given by Witten in terms of an infinite sum of characters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an arbitrary equidimensional quiver representation, we proposed the method of construction of a system of free generators of the field of $U$-invariants. The construction of the section and system of generators depends on the choice of a map that assign to each vertex one of the arrows incident to it.</description>

      <title>Geometric model for vector bundles via infinite marked strips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometric model for the category of vector bundles over the weighted projective line of type (2,2,n). This model is based on the orbit space of an infinite marked strip under a specific group action. By establishing a bijection between indecomposable bundles and orbits of line segments on the strip, we interpret dimensions of extension spaces as intersection indices of these line segment orbits. Furthermore, our investigation yields geometric interpretations for various aspects, including the slope of indecomposable bundles, the Picard group action, vector bundle duality, projective covers and injective hulls of extension bundles.</description>

      <title>Modulus of continuity of Kerov transition measure for continual Young diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition measure is a foundational concept introduced by Sergey Kerov to represent the shape of a Young diagram as a centered probability measure on the real line. Over a period of decades the transition measure turned out to be an invaluable tool for many problems of the asymptotic representation theory of the symmetric groups. Kerov also showed how to expand this notion for a wider class of continual diagrams so that the transition measure provides a homeomorphism between a subclass of continual diagrams (having a specific support) and a class of centered probability measures with a support contained in a specific interval. We quantify the modulus of continuity of this homeomorphism. More specifically, we study the dependence of the cumulative distribution function of Kerov transition measure on the profile of a diagram at the locations where the profile is not too steep.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and let $\textrm{cd}(G)$ be the set of all complex irreducible character degrees of $G.$ In this paper, we show that if $\textrm{cd}(G)=\textrm{cd}(H),$ where $H$ is a finite simple exceptional group of Lie type, then $G\cong H\times A,$ where $A$ is an abelian group. This completes the verification of Huppert's Conjecture for all finite simple exceptional groups of Lie type.</description>

      <title>A formal categorical approach to the homotopy theory of dg categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a bicategory which refines the localization of the category of dg categories with respect to quasi-equivalences and investigate its properties via formal category theory. Concretely, we first introduce the bicategory of dg categories $\mathsf{DBimod}$ whose Hom categories are the derived categories of dg bimodules and then define the desired bicategory as the sub-bicategory $\mathsf{DBimod}^\text{rqr}$ consisting only of right quasi-representable dg bimodules. The first half of the paper is devoted to the study of adjunctions and equivalences in these bicategories. We then show that the embedding $\mathsf{DBimod}^\text{rqr} \hookrightarrow \mathsf{DBimod}$ is a proarrow equipment in the sense of Richard J. Wood, which is a framework for formal category theory and makes it possible to talk about (weighted) (co)limits in an abstract way. Thus we obtain the notion of homotopical (co)limits in a dg category, including homotopical shifts and cones, by which we obtain a formal categorical characterization of pretriangulated dg categories. As an immediate application we give a conceptual proof of the fact that the pretriangulatedness is preserved under the gluing procedure.</description>

      <title>Square-integrable representations and the coadjoint action of solvable Lie groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.01034v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the square-integrable representations of (connected, simply connected) solvable Lie groups in terms of the generalized orbits of the coadjoint action. We prove that the normal representations corresponding, via the Puk\'anszky correspondence, to open coadjoint orbits are type I, not necessarily square-integrable representations. We show that the quasi-equivalence classes of type I square-integrable representations are in bijection with the simply connected open coadjoint orbits, and the existence of an open coadjoint orbit guarantees the existence of a compact open subset of the space of primitive ideals of the group. When the nilradical has codimension 1, we prove that the isolated points of the primitive ideal space are always of type I. This is not always true for codimension greater than 2, as shown by specific examples of solvable Lie groups that have dense, but not locally closed, coadjoint orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we give a purely derivator theoretical reformulation and proof of a classic result of Happel and Ladkani, showing that it occurs uniformly across stable derivators and it is then independent of coefficients. The resulting equivalence provides a bridge between homotopy theory and representation theory: indeed, we explain how our result is a derivator-theoretic version of the $\infty$-Dold-Kan correspondence for bounded cochain complexes. Moreover, our equivalence can also be realised as an action of a spectral bimodule in the setting of universal tilting theory developed by Groth and \v{S}\v{t}ov\'i\v{c}ek.</description>

      <title>On the regular representation of solvable Lie groups with open coadjoint quasi-orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a Lie theoretic intrinsic characterization of the connected and simply connected solvable Lie groups whose regular representation is a factor representation. When this is the case, the corresponding von Neumann algebras are isomorphic to the hyperfinite II$_\infty$ factor, and every Casimir function is constant. We thus obtain a family of geometric models for the standard representation of that factor. Finally, we show that the regular representation of any connected and simply connected solvable Lie group with open coadjoint orbits is always of type I, though the group needs not be of type I, and include some relevant examples.</description>

      <title>Characters of $GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$ and vertex operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a vertex operator approach to construct and compute all complex irreducible characters of the general linear group $\GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$. Green's theory of $\GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$ is recovered and enhanced under the realization of the Grothendieck ring of representations $R_G=\bigoplus_{n\geq 0}R(\GL_n(\mathbb F_q))$ as two isomorphic Fock spaces associated to two infinite-dimensional $F$-equivariant Heisenberg Lie algebras $\widehat{\mathfrak{h}}_{\hat{\overline{\mathbb F}}_q}$ and $\widehat{\mathfrak{h}}_{\overline{\mathbb F}_q}$, where $F$ is the Frobenius automorphism of the algebraically closed field $\overline{\mathbb F}_q$. Under this picture, the irreducible characters are realized by the Bernstein vertex operators for Schur functions, the characteristic functions of the conjugacy classes are realized by the vertex operators for the Hall-Littlewood functions, and the character table is completely given by matrix coefficients of vertex operators of these two types. One of the features of the current approach is a simpler identification of the Fock space $R_G$ as the Hall algebra of symmetric functions via vertex operator calculus, and another is that we are able to compute in general the character table, where Green's degree formula is demonstrated as an example.</description>

      <title>Cluster categories for completed infinity-gons I: Categorifying triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Paquette and Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m recently introduced cluster-type categories for completed infinity-gons, which are discs with an infinite closed set of marked points on their boundary. They classify (weak) cluster-tilting subcategories, which turn out to be in bijection with very special triangulations of the disc. This is in contrast to Igusa and Todorov's earlier work in the uncompleted case, in which every triangulation corresponds to a weak cluster-tilting subcategory.
  In this paper, we replace the triangulated structure of Paquette and Y{\i}ld{\i}r{\i}m's category by an extriangulated substructure and prove that, with this structure, the weak cluster-tilting subcategories are once again in bijection with triangulations. We further show that functorial finiteness of such a subcategory is equivalent to a very mild condition on the triangulation. This condition also appears in \c{C}anak\c{c}{\i} and Felikson's study of infinite rank cluster algebras from Teichm\"uller theory. By comparison with the combinatorics of triangulations, we are also able to characterise when weak cluster-tilting subcategories can be mutated in this new extriangulated category.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a microlocal characterisation of character sheaves on a reductive Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of sufficiently large positive characteristic: a perverse irreducible G-equivariant sheaf is a character sheaf if and only if it has nilpotent singular support and is quasi-admissible. We also present geometric proofs, in positive characteristic, of the equivalence between being admissible and being a character sheaf, and various characterisations of cuspidal sheaves, following the work of Mirkovi\'c.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the electrical Lie algebras originally introduced by Lam and Pylyavskyy in several ways. To each Kac-Moody Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ we associate two types (vertex type and edge type) of the generalized electrical algebras. The electrical Lie algebras of vertex type are always subalgebras of $\mathfrak{g}$ and are flat deformations of the nilpotent Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$. In many cases including $sl_n$, $so_n$, and $sp_{2n}$ we find new (edge) models for our generalized electrical Lie algebras of vertex type. Finding an edge model in general is an interesting an open problem.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Grothendieck polynomials appearing in the K-theory of Grassmannians, which are analogs of Schur polynomials. This paper aims to establish a version of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for Grothendieck polynomials of the Grassmannian type. This rule allows us to express the product of a Grothendieck polynomial with a power sum symmetric polynomial into a linear combination of other Grothendieck polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let G be a reductive algebraic group in classical types A, B, D and e be an element of its Lie algebra with Z its centraliser in G for the adjoint action. We suppose that e identifies with an nilpotent matrix of order two, which guarantees the number of Z-orbits in the flag variety of G is finite. For types B, D in characteristic two, we also suppose the image of e is totally isotropic. We show that any closure Y of such orbit is normal. We also prove that Y is Cohen-Macaulay with rational singularities provided that the base field is of characteristic zero, and that Cohen-Macaulayness remains in any characteristic for type A. We exhibit a birational, rational morphism onto Y involving Schubert varieties. Our work generalizes a result by N. Perrin and E. Smirnov on Springer fibers ([PS12]).</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal braidings and pre-Cartier bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an infinitesimal counterpart to the notion of braided category. The corresponding infinitesimal braidings are natural transformations which are compatible with an underlying braided monoidal structure in the sense that they constitute a first-order deformation of the braiding. This extends previously considered infinitesimal symmetric or Cartier categories, where involutivity of the braiding and an additional commutativity of the infinitesimal braiding with the symmetry are required. The generalized pre-Cartier framework is then elaborated in detail for the categories of (co)quasitriangular bialgebra (co)modules and we characterize the resulting infinitesimal $\mathcal{R}$-matrices (resp. $\mathcal{R}$-forms) on the bialgebra. It is proven that the latter are Hochschild $2$-cocycles and that they satisfy an infinitesimal quantum Yang-Baxter equation, while they are Hochschild $2$-coboundaries under the Cartier (co)triangular assumption in the presence of an antipode. We provide explicit examples of infinitesimal braidings, particularly on quantum $2\times 2$-matrices, $\mathrm{GL}_q(2)$, Sweedler's Hopf algebra and via Drinfel'd twist deformation. As conceptual tools to produce examples of infinitesimal braidings we prove an infinitesimal version of the FRT construction and we provide a Tannaka-Krein reconstruction theorem for pre-Cartier coquasitriangular bialgebras. We comment on the deformation of infinitesimal braidings and construct a quasitriangular structure on formal power series of Sweedler's Hopf algebra.</description>

      <title>Prolongement analytique de fonctions $\zeta$ et de fonctions $L$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wiles' work on Fermat's last Theorem highlighted the power of $p$-adic methods to prove the existence of analytic continuations of $\zeta$ and $L$ functions. These methods have become considerably more sophisticated in recent years, and have produced a wealth of beautiful results: Hasse--Weil conjecture for genus $2$ curves, holomorphy of $L$-functions of symmetric powers of modular forms, etc. We present some of these advances.</description>

      <title>On Some Extensions of $\pi$-Regular Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some variations of $\pi$-regular and nil clean rings were recently introduced in \cite{5,8,7}, respectively. In this paper, we examine the structure and relationships between these classes of rings. Specifically, we prove that $(m, n)$-regularly nil clean rings are left-right symmetric and also show that the inclusions ($D$-regularly nil clean) $\subseteq$ (regularly nil clean) $\subseteq$ ($(m,n)$-regularly nil clean) hold, as well as we answer Questions 1, 2 and 3 posed in \cite{8}. Moreover, some other analogous questions concerning the symmetric properties of certain classes of rings are treated as well by proving that centrally Utumi rings are always strongly $\pi$-regular.</description>

      <title>Crystals for set-valued decomposition tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe two crystal structures on set-valued decomposition tableaux. These provide the first examples of interesting "$K$-theoretic" crystals on shifted tableaux. Our first crystal is modeled on a similar construction of Monical, Pechenik, and Scrimshaw for semistandard (unshifted) set-valued tableaux. Our second crystal is adapted from the "square root" operators introduced by Yu on the same set. Neither of our shifted crystals is normal, but we conjecture that our second construction is connected with a unique highest weight element. These results lead to partial progress on a conjectural formula of Cho--Ikeda for $K$-theoretic Schur $P$-functions. We also study a new category of "square root crystals" that includes our second construction and Yu's set-valued tableau crystals as examples. We observe that Buch's formula for the coefficients expanding products of symmetric Grothendieck functions has a simple description in terms of the tensor product for this category.</description>

      <title>Companion points and locally analytic socle conjecture for Steinberg case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we will modify the Breuil-Hellmann-Schraen's (more generally, resp.,Breuil-Ding's) local model for the trianguline variety (resp.,Bernstein paraboline variety) to certain semistable (resp., potentially semistable) non-crystalline point with regular Hodge-Tate weights. Then we prove the existence of expected companion points on the (definite) eigenvariety and locally analytic socle conjecture for certain semistable non-crystalline Galois representations (in other words, the so-called Steinberg case), under some wild hypothesis on on trianguline variety and the usual Taylor-Wiles assumptions.</description>
