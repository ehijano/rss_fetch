      <title>Quantile Predictions for Equity Premium using Penalized Quantile Regression with Consistent Variable Selection across Multiple Quantiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers equity premium prediction, for which mean regression can be problematic due to heteroscedasticity and heavy-tails of the error. We show advantages of quantile predictions using a novel penalized quantile regression that offers a model for a full spectrum analysis on the equity premium distribution. To enhance model interpretability and address the well-known issue of crossing quantile predictions in quantile regression, we propose a model that enforces the selection of a common set of variables across all quantiles. Such a selection consistency is achieved by simultaneously estimating all quantiles with a group penalty that ensures sparsity pattern is the same for all quantiles. Consistency results are provided that allow the number of predictors to increase with the sample size. A Huberized quantile loss function and an augmented data approach are implemented for computational efficiency. Simulation studies show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Empirical results show that the proposed method outperforms several benchmark methods. Moreover, we find some important predictors reverse their relationship to the excess return from lower to upper quantiles, potentially offering interesting insights to the domain experts. Our proposed method can be applied to other fields.</description>

      <title>Lead Times in Flux: Analyzing Airbnb Booking Dynamics During Global Upheavals (2018-2022)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Short-term shifts in booking behaviors can disrupt forecasting in the travel and hospitality industry, especially during global crises. Traditional metrics like average or median lead times often overlook important distribution changes. This study introduces a normalized L1 (Manhattan) distance to assess Airbnb booking lead time divergences from 2018 to 2022, focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic across four major U.S. cities. We identify a two-phase disruption: an abrupt change at the pandemic's onset followed by partial recovery with persistent deviations from pre-2018 patterns. Our method reveals changes in travelers' planning horizons that standard statistics miss, highlighting the need to analyze the entire lead-time distribution for more accurate demand forecasting and pricing strategies. The normalized L1 metric provides valuable insights for tourism stakeholders navigating ongoing market volatility.</description>
