      <title>A particle-in-Fourier method with energy conservation for non-periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel particle-in-Fourier (PIF) scheme that extends its applicability to non-periodic boundary conditions. Our method handles free space boundary conditions by replacing the Fourier Laplacian operator in PIF with a mollified Green's function as first introduced by Vico-Greengard-Ferrando. This modification yields highly accurate free space solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson system, while still maintaining energy conservation up to an error bounded by the time step size. We also explain how to extend our scheme to arbitrary Dirichlet boundary conditions via standard potential theory, which we illustrate in detail for Dirichlet boundary conditions on a circular boundary. We support our approach with proof-of-concept numerical results from two-dimensional plasma test cases to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and conservation properties of the scheme.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Finite Element Interpolated Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of neural networks to approximate partial differential equations (PDEs) has gained significant attention in recent years. However, the approximation of PDEs with localised phenomena, e.g., sharp gradients and singularities, remains a challenge, due to ill-defined cost functions in terms of pointwise residual sampling or poor numerical integration. In this work, we introduce $h$-adaptive finite element interpolated neural networks. The method relies on the interpolation of a neural network onto a finite element space that is gradually adapted to the solution during the training process to equidistribute a posteriori error indicator. The use of adaptive interpolation is essential in preserving the non-linear approximation capabilities of the neural networks to effectively tackle problems with localised features. The training relies on a gradient-based optimisation of a loss function based on the (dual) norm of the finite element residual of the interpolated neural network. Automatic mesh adaptation (i.e., refinement and coarsening) is performed based on a posteriori error indicators till a certain level of accuracy is reached. The proposed methodology can be applied to indefinite and nonsymmetric problems. We carry out a detailed numerical analysis of the scheme and prove several a priori error estimates, depending on the expressiveness of the neural network compared to the interpolation mesh. Our numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the method in capturing sharp gradients and singularities for forward PDE problems, both in 2D and 3D scenarios. We also show that the proposed preconditioning strategy (i.e., using a dual residual norm of the residual as a cost function) enhances training robustness and accelerates convergence.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Multi-continuum Model for Multiscale Flow Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiscale problems can usually be approximated through numerical homogenization by an equation with some effective parameters that can capture the macroscopic behavior of the original system on the coarse grid to speed up the simulation. However, this approach usually assumes scale separation and that the heterogeneity of the solution can be approximated by the solution average in each coarse block. For complex multiscale problems, the computed single effective properties/continuum might be inadequate. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based multi-continuum model to enrich the homogenized equation and improve the accuracy of the single continuum model for multiscale problems with some given data. Without loss of generalization, we consider a two-continuum case. The first flow equation keeps the information of the original homogenized equation with an additional interaction term. The second continuum is newly introduced, and the effective permeability in the second flow equation is determined by a neural network. The interaction term between the two continua aligns with that used in the Dual-porosity model but with a learnable coefficient determined by another neural network. The new model with neural network terms is then optimized using trusted data. We discuss both direct back-propagation and the adjoint method for the PDE-constraint optimization problem. Our proposed learning-based multi-continuum model can resolve multiple interacted media within each coarse grid block and describe the mass transfer among them, and it has been demonstrated to significantly improve the simulation results through numerical experiments involving both linear and nonlinear flow equations.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving, weighted implicit-explicit schemes for multi-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes/Darcy coupled nonlocal Allen-Cahn model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multitude of substances exist as mixtures comprising multiple chemical components in the natural world. These substances undergo morphological changes under external influences. the phase field model coupled with fluid flow, the dynamic movement and evolution of the phase interface intricately interact with the fluid motion. This article focuses on the N-component models that couple the conservative Allen-Cahn equation with two types of incompressible fluid flow systems: the Navier-Stokes equation and the Darcy equation. By utilizing the scalar auxiliary variable method and the projection method, we innovatively construct two types of structure-preserving weighted implicit-explicit schemes for the coupled models, resulting in fully decoupled linear systems and second-order accuracy in time. The schemes are proved to be mass-conservative. In addition, with the application of $G$-norm inspired by the idea of $G$-stability, we rigorously establish its unconditional energy stability. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is verified by some numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Prediction of discretization of online GMsFEM using deep learning for Richards equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new coarse-scale approximation strategy for the nonlinear single-continuum Richards equation as an unsaturated flow over heterogeneous non-periodic media, using the online generalized multiscale finite element method (online GMsFEM) together with deep learning. A novelty of this approach is that local online multiscale basis functions are computed rapidly and frequently by utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs). More precisely, we employ the training set of stochastic permeability realizations and the computed relating online multiscale basis functions to train neural networks. The nonlinear map between such permeability fields and online multiscale basis functions is developed by our proposed deep learning algorithm. That is, in a new way, the predicted online multiscale basis functions incorporate the nonlinearity treatment of the Richards equation and refect any time-dependent changes in the problem's properties. Multiple numerical experiments in two-dimensional model problems show the good performance of this technique, in terms of predictions of the online multiscale basis functions and thus finding solutions.</description>

      <title>Generalized multiscale finite element method for a nonlinear elastic strain-limiting Cosserat model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For nonlinear Cosserat elasticity, we consider multiscale methods in this paper. In particular, we explore the generalized multiscale finite element method (GMsFEM) to solve an isotropic Cosserat problem with strain-limiting property (ensuring bounded linearized strains even under high stresses). Such strain-limiting Cosserat model can find potential applications in solids and biological fibers. However, Cosserat media with naturally rotational degrees of freedom, nonlinear constitutive relations, high contrast, and heterogeneities may produce challenging multiscale characteristics in the solution, and upscaling by multiscale methods is necessary. Therefore, we utilize the offline and residual-based online (adaptive or uniform) GMsFEM in this context while handling the nonlinearity by Picard iteration. Through various two-dimensional experiments (for perforated, composite, and stochastically heterogeneous media with small and big strain-limiting parameters), our numerical results show the approaches' convergence, efficiency, and robustness. In addition, these results demonstrate that such approaches provide good accuracy, the online GMsFEM gives more accurate solutions than the offline one, and the online adaptive strategy has similar accuracy to the uniform one but with fewer degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transition problems on curved surfaces can lead to a panopticon of fascinating patterns. In this paper we consider finite element approximations of phase field models with a spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic surface energy density. The problems are either posed in $\mathbb R^3$ or on a two-dimensional hypersurface in $\mathbb R^3$. In the latter case, a fundamental choice regarding the anisotropic energy density has to be made. Our numerical method can be employed both situations, where for the problems on hypersurfaces the algorithm uses parametric finite elements. We prove an unconditional stability result for our schemes and present several numerical experiments, including for the modelling of ice crystal growth on a sphere.</description>

      <title>Partially explicit splitting scheme with explicit-implicit-null method for nonlinear multiscale flow problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an efficient approach to solve nonlinear high-contrast multiscale diffusion problems. We incorporate the explicit-implicit-null (EIN) method to separate the nonlinear term into a linear term and a damping term, and then utilise the implicit and explicit time marching scheme for the two parts respectively. Due to the multiscale property of the linear part, we further introduce a temporal partially explicit splitting scheme and construct suitable multiscale subspaces to speed up the computation. The approximated solution is splitted into these subspaces associated with different physics. The temporal splitting scheme employs implicit discretization in the subspace with small dimension that representing the high-contrast property and uses explicit discretization for the other subspace. We exploit the stability of the proposed scheme and give the condition for the choice of the linear diffusion coefficient. The convergence of the proposed method is provided. Several numerical tests are performed to show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Low-rank tensor product Richardson iteration for radiative transfer in plane-parallel geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiative transfer equation (RTE) has been established as a fundamental tool for the description of energy transport, absorption and scattering in many relevant societal applications, and requires numerical approximations. However, classical numerical algorithms scale unfavorably with respect to the dimensionality of such radiative transfer problems, where solutions depend on physical as well as angular variables. In this paper we address this dimensionality issue by developing a low-rank tensor product framework for the RTE in plane-parallel geometry. We exploit the tensor product nature of the phase space to recover an operator equation where the operator is given by a short sum of Kronecker products. This equation is solved by a preconditioned and rank-controlled Richardson iteration in Hilbert spaces. Using exponential sums approximations we construct a preconditioner that is compatible with the low-rank tensor product framework. The use of suitable preconditioning techniques yields a transformation of the operator equation in Hilbert space into a sequence space with Euclidean inner product, enabling rigorous error and rank control in the Euclidean metric.</description>

      <title>A LSTM-enhanced surrogate model to simulate the dynamics of particle-laden fluid systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical treatment of fluid-particle systems is a very challenging problem because of the complex coupling phenomena occurring between the two phases. Although accurate mathematical modelling is available to address this kind of application, the computational cost of the numerical simulations is very expensive. The use of the most modern high-performance computing infrastructures could help to mitigate such an issue but not completely fix it. In this work, we develop a non-intrusive data-driven reduced order model (ROM) for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) - Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations. The ROM is built using the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) for the computation of the reduced basis space and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for the computation of the reduced coefficients. We are interested in dealing both with system identification and prediction. The most relevant novelties rely on (i) a filtering procedure of the full-order snapshots to reduce the dimensionality of the reduced problem and (ii) a preliminary treatment of the particle phase. The accuracy of our ROM approach is assessed against the classic Goldschmidt fluidized bed benchmark problem. Finally, we also provide some insights about the efficiency of our ROM approach.</description>

Finite element method, finite difference method and other numerical simulations are effective numerical calculation methods for electrofluid dynamics models.

      <title>Understanding the PDHG Algorithm via High-Resolution Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) is widely recognized across various fields of mathematics and engineering. Its variant, the generalized Lasso, finds extensive application in the fields of statistics, machine learning, image science, and related areas. Among the optimization techniques used to tackle this issue, saddle-point methods stand out, with the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm emerging as a particularly popular choice. However, the iterative behavior of PDHG remains poorly understood. In this paper, we employ dimensional analysis to derive a system of high-resolution ordinary differential equations (ODEs) tailored for PDHG. This system effectively captures a key feature of PDHG, the coupled $x$-correction and $y$-correction, distinguishing it from the proximal Arrow-Hurwicz algorithm. The small but essential perturbation ensures that PDHG consistently converges, bypassing the periodic behavior observed in the proximal Arrow-Hurwicz algorithm. Through Lyapunov analysis, We investigate the convergence behavior of the system of high-resolution ODEs and extend our insights to the discrete PDHG algorithm. Our analysis indicates that numerical errors resulting from the implicit scheme serve as a crucial factor affecting the convergence rate and monotonicity of PDHG, showcasing a noteworthy pattern also observed for the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), as identified in [Li and Shi, 2024]. In addition, we further discover that when one component of the objective function is strongly convex, the iterative average of PDHG converges strongly at a rate $O(1/N)$, where $N$ is the number of iterations.</description>

Abstract: We improve the classical results by Brenner and Thom\'ee on rational approximations of operator semigroups. In the setting of Hilbert spaces, we introduce a finer regularity scale for initial data, provide sharper stability estimates, and obtain optimal approximation rates. Moreover, we strengthen a result due to Egert-Rozendaal on subdiagonal Pad\'e approximations of operator semigroups. Our approach is direct and based on the theory of the $\mathcal B$- functional calculus developed recently. On the way, we elaborate a new and simple approach to construction of the $\mathcal B$-calculus thus making the paper essentially self-contai</description>

      <title>Energy diminishing implicit-explicit Runge--Kutta methods for gradient flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on the development and analysis of a group of high-order implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge--Kutta (RK) methods that are suitable for discretizing gradient flows with nonlinearity that is Lipschitz continuous. We demonstrate that these IMEX-RK methods can preserve the original energy dissipation property without any restrictions on the time-step size, thanks to a stabilization technique. The stabilization constants are solely dependent on the minimal eigenvalues that result from the Butcher tables of the IMEX-RKs. Furthermore, we establish a simple framework that can determine whether an IMEX-RK scheme is capable of preserving the original energy dissipation property or not. We also present a heuristic convergence analysis based on the truncation errors. This is the first research to prove that a linear high-order single-step scheme can ensure the original energy stability unconditionally for general gradient flows. Additionally, we provide several high-order IMEX-RK schemes that satisfy the established framework. Notably, we discovered a new four-stage third-order IMEX-RK scheme that reduces energy. Finally, we provide numerical examples to demonstrate the stability and accuracy properties of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Convergence and error estimates of a penalization finite volume method for the compressible Navier-Stokes system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In numerical simulations a smooth domain occupied by a fluid has to be approximated by a computational domain that typically does not coincide with a physical domain. Consequently, in order to study convergence and error estimates of a numerical method domain-related discretization errors, the so-called variational crimes, need to be taken into account. In this paper we present an elegant alternative to a direct, but rather technical, analysis of variational crimes by means of the penalty approach. We embed the physical domain into a large enough cubed domain and study the convergence of a finite volume method for the corresponding domain-penalized problem. We show that numerical solutions of the penalized problem converge to a generalized, the so-called dissipative weak, solution of the original problem. If a strong solution exists, the dissipative weak solution emanating from the same initial data coincides with the strong solution. In this case, we apply a novel tool of the relative energy and derive the error estimates between the numerical solution and the strong solution. Extensive numerical experiments that confirm theoretical results are presented.</description>

      <title>Reduced Membrane Model for Liquid Crystal Polymer Networks: Asymptotics and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a reduced membrane model of liquid crystal polymer networks (LCNs) via asymptotics and computation. This model requires solving a minimization problem for a non-convex stretching energy. We show a formal asymptotic derivation of the 2D membrane model from 3D rubber elasticity. We construct approximate solutions with point defects. We design a finite element method with regularization, and propose a nonlinear gradient flow with Newton inner iteration to solve the non-convex discrete minimization problem. We present numerical simulations of practical interests to illustrate the ability of the model and our method to capture rich physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Scalable Implicit Solvers with Dynamic Mesh Adaptation for a Relativistic Drift-Kinetic Fokker-Planck-Boltzmann Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider a relativistic drift-kinetic model for runaway electrons along with a Fokker-Planck operator for small-angle Coulomb collisions, a radiation damping operator, and a secondary knock-on (Boltzmann) collision source. We develop a new scalable fully implicit solver utilizing finite volume and conservative finite difference schemes and dynamic mesh adaptivity. A new data management framework in the PETSc library based on the p4est library is developed to enable simulations with dynamic adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), distributed memory parallelization, and dynamic load balancing of computational work. This framework and the runaway electron solver building on the framework are able to dynamically capture both bulk Maxwellian at the low-energy region and a runaway tail at the high-energy region. To effectively capture features via the AMR algorithm, a new AMR indicator prediction strategy is proposed that is performed alongside the implicit time evolution of the solution. This strategy is complemented by the introduction of computationally cheap feature-based AMR indicators that are analyzed theoretically. Numerical results quantify the advantages of the prediction strategy in better capturing features compared with nonpredictive strategies; and we demonstrate trade-offs regarding computational costs. The robustness with respect to model parameters, algorithmic scalability, and parallel scalability are demonstrated through several benchmark problems including manufactured solutions and solutions of different physics models. We focus on demonstrating the advantages of using implicit time stepping and AMR for runaway electron simulations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces CUQIpy, a versatile open-source Python package for computational uncertainty quantification (UQ) in inverse problems, presented as Part I of a two-part series. CUQIpy employs a Bayesian framework, integrating prior knowledge with observed data to produce posterior probability distributions that characterize the uncertainty in computed solutions to inverse problems. The package offers a high-level modeling framework with concise syntax, allowing users to easily specify their inverse problems, prior information, and statistical assumptions. CUQIpy supports a range of efficient sampling strategies and is designed to handle large-scale problems. Notably, the automatic sampler selection feature analyzes the problem structure and chooses a suitable sampler without user intervention, streamlining the process. With a selection of probability distributions, test problems, computational methods, and visualization tools, CUQIpy serves as a powerful, flexible, and adaptable tool for UQ in a wide selection of inverse problems. Part II of the series focuses on the use of CUQIpy for UQ in inverse problems with partial differential equations (PDEs).</description>

      <title>CUQIpy: II. Computational uncertainty quantification for PDE-based inverse problems in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverse problems, particularly those governed by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), are prevalent in various scientific and engineering applications, and uncertainty quantification (UQ) of solutions to these problems is essential for informed decision-making. This second part of a two-paper series builds upon the foundation set by the first part, which introduced CUQIpy, a Python software package for computational UQ in inverse problems using a Bayesian framework. In this paper, we extend CUQIpy's capabilities to solve PDE-based Bayesian inverse problems through a general framework that allows the integration of PDEs in CUQIpy, whether expressed natively or using third-party libraries such as FEniCS. CUQIpy offers concise syntax that closely matches mathematical expressions, streamlining the modeling process and enhancing the user experience. The versatility and applicability of CUQIpy to PDE-based Bayesian inverse problems are demonstrated on examples covering parabolic, elliptic and hyperbolic PDEs. This includes problems involving the heat and Poisson equations and application case studies in electrical impedance tomography and photo-acoustic tomography, showcasing the software's efficiency, consistency, and intuitive interface. This comprehensive approach to UQ in PDE-based inverse problems provides accessibility for non-experts and advanced features for experts.</description>

      <title>Stability of step size control based on a posteriori error estimates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A posteriori error estimates based on residuals can be used for reliable error control of numerical methods. Here, we consider them in the context of ordinary differential equations and Runge-Kutta methods. In particular, we take the approach of Dedner &amp; Giesselmann (2016) and investigate it when used to select the time step size. We focus on step size control stability when combined with explicit Runge-Kutta methods and demonstrate that a standard I controller is unstable while more advanced PI and PID controllers can be designed to be stable. We compare the stability properties of residual-based estimators and classical error estimators based on an embedded Runge-Kutta method both analytically and in numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Let data talk: data-regularized operator learning theory for inverse problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regularization plays a pivotal role in integrating prior information into inverse problems. While many deep learning methods have been proposed to solve inverse problems, determining where to apply regularization remains a crucial consideration. Typical methods regularize neural networks via architecture, wherein neural network functions parametrize the parameter of interest or the regularization term. We introduce a novel approach, denoted as the "data-regularized operator learning" (DaROL) method, designed to address PDE inverse problems. The DaROL method trains a neural network on data, regularized through common techniques such as Tikhonov variational methods and Bayesian inference. The DaROL method offers flexibility across different frameworks, faster inverse problem-solving, and a simpler structure that separates regularization and neural network training. We demonstrate that training a neural network on the regularized data is equivalent to supervised learning for a regularized inverse map. Furthermore, we provide sufficient conditions for the smoothness of such a regularized inverse map and estimate the learning error in terms of neural network size and the number of training samples.</description>

      <title>Weighted least-squares approximation with determinantal point processes and generalized volume sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating a function from $L^2$ by an element of a given $m$-dimensional space $V_m$, associated with some feature map $\varphi$, using evaluations of the function at random points $x_1,\dots,x_n$. After recalling some results on optimal weighted least-squares using independent and identically distributed points, we consider weighted least-squares using projection determinantal point processes (DPP) or volume sampling. These distributions introduce dependence between the points that promotes diversity in the selected features $\varphi(x_i)$. We first provide a generalized version of volume-rescaled sampling yielding quasi-optimality results in expectation with a number of samples $n = O(m\log(m))$, that means that the expected $L^2$ error is bounded by a constant times the best approximation error in $L^2$. Also, further assuming that the function is in some normed vector space $H$ continuously embedded in $L^2$, we further prove that the approximation is almost surely bounded by the best approximation error measured in the $H$-norm. This includes the cases of functions from $L^\infty$ or reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Finally, we present an alternative strategy consisting in using independent repetitions of projection DPP (or volume sampling), yielding similar error bounds as with i.i.d. or volume sampling, but in practice with a much lower number of samples. Numerical experiments illustrate the performance of the different strategies.</description>

      <title>Recovering the Polytropic Exponent in the Porous Medium Equation: Asymptotic Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the time dependent Porous Medium Equation, $u_t = \Delta u^\gamma$ with real polytropic exponent $\gamma&gt;1$, subject to a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. We are interested in recovering $\gamma$ from the knowledge of the solution $u$ at a given large time $T$. Based on an asymptotic inequality satisfied by the solution $u(T)$, we propose a numerical algorithm allowing us to recover $\gamma$. An upper bound for the error between the exact and recovered $\gamma$ is then showed. Finally, numerical investigations are carried out in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Fourth-order entropy-stable lattice Boltzmann schemes for hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for the development of fourth-order lattice Boltzmann schemes to tackle multidimensional nonlinear systems of conservation laws. Our numerical schemes preserve two fundamental characteristics inherent in classical lattice Boltzmann methods: a local relaxation phase and a transport phase composed of elementary shifts on a Cartesian grid. Achieving fourth-order accuracy is accomplished through the composition of second-order time-symmetric basic schemes utilizing rational weights. This enables the representation of the transport phase in terms of elementary shifts. Introducing local variations in the relaxation parameter during each stage of relaxation ensures the entropic nature of the schemes. This not only enhances stability in the long-time limit but also maintains fourth-order accuracy. To validate our approach, we conduct comprehensive testing on scalar equations and systems in both one and two spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Linear Bandits with Partial Distributed Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of global reward maximization with only partial distributed feedback. This problem is motivated by several real-world applications (e.g., cellular network configuration, dynamic pricing, and policy selection) where an action taken by a central entity influences a large population that contributes to the global reward. However, collecting such reward feedback from the entire population not only incurs a prohibitively high cost but often leads to privacy concerns. To tackle this problem, we consider differentially private distributed linear bandits, where only a subset of users from the population are selected (called clients) to participate in the learning process and the central server learns the global model from such partial feedback by iteratively aggregating these clients' local feedback in a differentially private fashion. We then propose a unified algorithmic learning framework, called differentially private distributed phased elimination (DP-DPE), which can be naturally integrated with popular differential privacy (DP) models (including central DP, local DP, and shuffle DP). Furthermore, we prove that DP-DPE achieves both sublinear regret and sublinear communication cost. Interestingly, DP-DPE also achieves privacy protection ``for free'' in the sense that the additional cost due to privacy guarantees is a lower-order additive term. In addition, as a by-product of our techniques, the same results of ``free" privacy can also be achieved for the standard differentially private linear bandits. Finally, we conduct simulations to corroborate our theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of DP-DPE.</description>

      <title>An Active Contour Model Driven By the Hybrid Signed Pressure Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the influence of imaging equipment and complex imaging environments, most images in daily life have features of intensity inhomogeneity and noise. Therefore, many scholars have designed many image segmentation algorithms to address these issues. Among them, the active contour model is one of the most effective image segmentation algorithms.This paper proposes an active contour model driven by the hybrid signed pressure function that combines global and local information construction. Firstly, a new global region-based signed pressure function is introduced by combining the average intensity of the inner and outer regions of the curve with the median intensity of the inner region of the evolution curve. Then, the paper uses the energy differences between the inner and outer regions of the curve in the local region to design the signed pressure function of the local term. Combine the two SPF function to obtain a new signed pressure function and get the evolution equation of the new model. Finally, experiments and numerical analysis show that the model has excellent segmentation performance for both intensity inhomogeneous images and noisy images.</description>
