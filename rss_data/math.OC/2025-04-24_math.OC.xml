      <title>Robustifying networks for flow problems against edge failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the robust version of a multi-commodity network flow problem. The robustness is defined with respect to the deletion, or failure, of edges. While the flow problem itself is a polynomially-sized linear program, its robust version is a saddle-point problem with discrete variables. We present two approaches for the solution of the robust network flow problem. One way is to formulate the problem as a bigger linear program. The other is to solve a multi-level optimization problem, where the linear programs appearing at the lower level can be solved by the dual simplex method with a warm start. We then consider the problem of robustifying the network. This is accomplished by optimally using a fixed budget for strengthening certain edges, i.e., increasing their capacity. This problem is solved by a sequence of linear programs at the upper level, while at the lower levels the mentioned dual simplex algorithm is employed.</description>

      <title>Singular Arcs in Optimal Control: Closed-loop Implementations without Workarounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singular arcs emerge in the solutions of Optimal Control Problems (OCPs) when the optimal inputs on some finite time intervals cannot be directly obtained via the optimality conditions. Solving OCPs with singular arcs often requires tailored treatments, suitable for offline trajectory optimization. This approach can become increasingly impractical for online closed-loop implementations, especially for large-scale engineering problems. Recent development of Integrated Residual Methods (IRM) have indicated their suitability for handling singular arcs; the convergence of error measures in IRM automatically suppresses singular arc-induced fluctuations and leads to non-fluctuating solutions more suitable for practical problems. Through several examples, we demonstrate the advantages of solving OCPs with singular arcs using {IRM} under an economic model predictive control framework. In particular, the following observations are made: (i) IRM does not require special treatment for singular arcs, (ii) it solves the OCPs reliably with singular arc fluctuation suppressed, and (iii) the closed-loop results closely match the analytic optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>Neural Contraction Metrics with Formal Guarantees for Discrete-Time Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contraction metrics are crucial in control theory because they provide a powerful framework for analyzing stability, robustness, and convergence of various dynamical systems. However, identifying these metrics for complex nonlinear systems remains an open challenge due to the lack of scalable and effective tools. This paper explores the approach of learning verifiable contraction metrics parametrized as neural networks (NNs) for discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems. While prior works on formal verification of contraction metrics for general nonlinear systems have focused on convex optimization methods (e.g. linear matrix inequalities, etc) under the assumption of continuously differentiable dynamics, the growing prevalence of NN-based controllers, often utilizing ReLU activations, introduces challenges due to the non-smooth nature of the resulting closed-loop dynamics. To bridge this gap, we establish a new sufficient condition for establishing formal neural contraction metrics for general discrete-time nonlinear systems assuming only the continuity of the dynamics. We show that from a computational perspective, our sufficient condition can be efficiently verified using the state-of-the-art neural network verifier $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN, which scales up non-convex neural network verification via novel integration of symbolic linear bound propagation and branch-and-bound. Built upon our analysis tool, we further develop a learning method for synthesizing neural contraction metrics from sampled data. Finally, our approach is validated through the successful synthesis and verification of NN contraction metrics for various nonlinear examples.</description>

      <title>Advancing Frontiers of Path Integral Theory for Stochastic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) problems arise in systems influenced by uncertainty, such as autonomous robots or financial models. Traditional methods like dynamic programming are often intractable for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems due to the curse of dimensionality. This dissertation explores the path integral control framework as a scalable, sampling-based alternative. By reformulating SOC problems as expectations over stochastic trajectories, it enables efficient policy synthesis via Monte Carlo sampling and supports real-time implementation through GPU parallelization.
  We apply this framework to six classes of SOC problems: Chance-Constrained SOC, Stochastic Differential Games, Deceptive Control, Task Hierarchical Control, Risk Mitigation of Stealthy Attacks, and Discrete-Time LQR. A sample complexity analysis for the discrete-time case is also provided. These contributions establish a foundation for simulator-driven autonomy in complex, uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of a Hessian-free inequality and Lipschitz continuous Hessian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that if a twice differentiable function has a Lipschitz continuous Hessian, then its gradients satisfy a Jensen-type inequality. In particular, this inequality is Hessian-free in the sense that the Hessian does not actually appear in the inequality. In this paper, we show that the converse holds in a generalized setting: if a continuos function from a Hilbert space to a reflexive Banach space satisfies such an inequality, then it is Fr\'echet differentiable and its derivative is Lipschitz continuous. Our proof relies on the Baillon-Haddad theorem.</description>

      <title>Perturbed Gradient Descent via Convex Quadratic Approximation for Nonconvex Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization is a fundamental tool in hierarchical decision-making and has been widely applied to machine learning tasks such as hyperparameter tuning, meta-learning, and continual learning. While significant progress has been made in bilevel optimization, existing methods predominantly focus on the {nonconvex-strongly convex, or the} nonconvex-PL settings, leaving the more general nonconvex-nonconvex framework underexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by developing an efficient gradient-based method inspired by the recently proposed Relaxed Gradient Flow (RXGF) framework with a continuous-time dynamic. In particular, we introduce a discretized variant of RXGF and formulate convex quadratic program subproblems with closed-form solutions. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis, demonstrating that under the existence of a KKT point and a regularity assumption {(lower-level gradient PL assumption)}, our method achieves an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^{1.5})$ in terms of the squared norm of the KKT residual for the reformulated problem. Moreover, even in the absence of the regularity assumption, we establish an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^{3})$ for the same metric. Through extensive numerical experiments on convex and nonconvex synthetic benchmarks and a hyper-data cleaning task, we illustrate the efficiency and scalability of our approach.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss how a general bilinear finite-dimensional closed quantum system with dispersed parameters can be steered between eigenstates. We show that, under suitable conditions on the separation of spectral gaps and the boundedness of parameter dispersion, rotating wave and adiabatic approximations can be employed in cascade to achieve population inversion between arbitrary eigenstates. We propose an explicit control law and test numerically the sharpness of the conditions on several examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the continuous-discrete projection filter for the exponential-family manifolds with conjugate likehoods. We first derive the local projection error of the prediction step of the continuous-discrete projection filter. We then derive the exact Bayesian update algorithm for a class of discrete measurement processes with additive Gaussian noise. Lastly, we present a numerical simulation of the stochastic van der Pol filtering problem with a nonlinear measurement process. The proposed projection filter shows superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art parametric continuous-discrete filtering methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal scheduling of energy and mass flows based on networked multi-carrier hubs formulation: a general framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to increased energy demand and environmental concerns such as greenhouse gas emissions and natural resources depletion, optimizing energy and raw materials usage has recently drawn much attention. Achieving more synergy between different energy sectors and manufacturing processes could lead to substantial improvements. Energy hubs are already well-known solutions for studying multi-carrier energy systems. In the present study, a multi-carrier hub is defined as a geographic area where different processes take place to convert energy and material flows possibly consumed locally, stored, or exported. Hub boundaries correspond to an area small enough to neglect losses when energy and materials flows are exchanged between the processes. A general formulation is introduced to model such a hub. This formalism encompasses all the possible configurations without limitations or preconceptions regarding used carriers or processes' architecture. For this purpose, a new hub representation is proposed that allows optimization while considering all possible arrangements (parallel, serial, or a combination of them). It is implemented in a framework that allows the creation of several multi-carrier hubs and connecting some of them to exchange flows through dedicated networks. The formalism is based on linear programming (LP). The features of the developed framework are illustrated by a case study consisting of a network made of three hubs and considering heat, electricity, water, and hydrogen flows.The study aims to optimally schedule processes usage and materials and energy storage to minimize the cost of imported resources. The study is done in a short-term period. It shows the benefits of synergy between the different processes in the hub.</description>

      <title>Obtaining Structural Network Controllability with Higher-Order Local Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a network of identical, first-order linear systems, and investigate how replacing a subset of the systems composing the network with higher-order ones, either taken to be generic or specifically designed, may affect its controllability. After establishing a correspondence between state controllability in networks of first-order systems with output controllability in networks of higher-order systems, we show that adding higher-order dynamics may require significantly fewer subsystem modifications to achieve structural controllability, when compared to first-order heterogeneous subsystems. Furthermore, we characterize the topology of networks (which we call X-networks) in which the introduction of heterogeneous local dynamics is not necessary for structural output controllability, as the latter can be attained by suitable higher-order subsystems with homogeneous internal dynamics.</description>

      <title>A decision support system for optimised industrial water management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water scarcity and the low quality of wastewater produced in industrial applications present significant challenges, particularly in managing fresh water intake and reusing residual quantities. These issues affect various industries, compelling plant owners and managers to optimise water resources within their process networks. To address this cross-sector business requirement, we propose a Decision Support System (DSS) designed to capture key network components, such as inlet streams, processes, and outlet streams. Data provided to the DSS are exploited by an optimisation module, which supports both network design and operational decisions. This module is coupled with a generic mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model, which is linearised into a compact mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation capable of delivering fast optimal solutions across various network designs and input parameterisations. Additionally, a Constraint Programming (CP) approach is incorporated to handle nonlinear expressions through straightforward modeling. This state-of-the-art generalised framework enables broad applicability across a wide range of real-world scenarios, setting it apart from the conventional reliance on customised solutions designed for specific use cases. The proposed framework was tested on 500 synthetic data instances inspired by historical data from three case studies. The obtained results confirm the validity, computational competence and practical impact of our approach both among their operational and network design phases, demonstrating significant improvements over current practices. Notably, the proposed approach achieved a 17.6% reduction in freshwater intake in a chemical industry case and facilitated the reuse of nearly 90% of wastewater in an oil refinery case.</description>

      <title>Knapsack with compactness: a semidefinite approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The min-knapsack problem with compactness constraints extends the classical knapsack problem, in the case of ordered items, by introducing a restriction ensuring that they cannot be too far apart. This problem has applications in statistics, particularly in the detection of change-points in time series. In this paper, we propose a semidefinite programming approach for this problem, incorporating compactness in constraints or in objective. We study and compare the different relaxations, and argue that our method provides high-quality heuristics and tight bounds. In particular, the single hyperparameter of our penalized semidefinite models naturally balances the trade-off between compactness and accuracy of the computed solutions. Numerical experiments illustrate, on the hardest instances, the effectiveness and versatility of our approach compared to the existing mixed-integer programming formulation.</description>

      <title>Controllability problem of an evolution equation with singular memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses control problems governed by a semilinear evolution equation with singular memory kernel $\kappa(t)=\alpha e^{-\beta t}\frac{t^{\nu-1}}{\Gamma(\nu)}$, where $\alpha&gt;0, \beta\ge 0$, and $0&lt;\nu&lt;1$. We examine the existence of a mild solution and the approximate controllability of both linear and semilinear control systems. To this end, we introduce the concept of a resolvent family associated with the linear evolution equation with memory and develop some of its essential properties. Subsequently, we consider a linear-quadratic regulator problem to determine the optimal control that yields approximate controllability for the linear control system. Furthermore, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence of a mild solution and the approximate controllability of a semilinear system in a super-reflexive Banach space. Additionally, we present an approximate controllability result within the framework of a general Banach space. Finally, we apply our theoretical findings to investigate the approximate controllability of the heat equation with singular memory.</description>

      <title>Rescaling and unconstrained minimisation of convex quadratic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of a class of piecewise-fractional maps arising from the introduction of an invariance under rescaling into convex quadratic maps. The subsequent maps are quasiconvex, and pseudoconvex on specific convex cones; they can be optimised via exact line search along admissible directions, and the iterates then inherit a bidimensional optimality property. We study the minimisation of such relaxed maps via coordinate descents with gradient-based rules, placing a special emphasis on coordinate directions verifying a maximum-alignment property in the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces related to the underlying positive-semidefinite matrices. In this setting, we illustrate that accounting for the optimal rescaling of the iterates can in certain situations substantially accelerate the unconstrained minimisation of convex quadratic maps.</description>

      <title>A Robust Fault Detection Filter for Linear Time-Varying System with Non-Gaussian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of robust fault detection filtering for linear time-varying (LTV) systems with non-Gaussian noise and additive faults. The conventional generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) method utilizes the Kalman filter, which may exhibit inadequate performance under non-Gaussian noise conditions. To mitigate this issue, a fault detection method employing the $H_{\infty}$ filter is proposed. The $H_{\infty}$ filter is first derived as the solution to a regularized least-squares (RLS) optimization problem, and the effect of faults on the output prediction error is then analyzed. The proposed approach using the $H_{\infty}$ filter demonstrates robustness in non-Gaussian noise environments and significantly improves fault detection performance compared to the original GLR method that employs the Kalman filter. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated using numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Derivative-free Constrained Optimization with a Penalty-Interior Point Method and Direct Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose the joint use of a mixed penalty-interior point method and direct search, for addressing nonlinearly constrained derivative-free optimization problems. A merit function is considered, wherein the set of nonlinear inequality constraints is divided into two groups: one treated with a logarithmic barrier approach, and another, along with the equality constraints, addressed using a penalization term. This strategy, is adapted and incorporated into a direct search method, enabling the effective handling of general nonlinear constraints. Convergence to KKT-stationary points is established under continuous differentiability assumptions, without requiring any kind of convexity. Using CUTEst test problems, numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and overall effectiveness of the proposed method, when compared with state-of-the-art solvers</description>

      <title>Applied Sheaf Theory For Multi-agent Artificial Intelligence (Reinforcement Learning) Systems: A Prospectus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a pedagogical introduction to classical sheaf theory and sheaf cohomology, followed by a research prospectus exploring potential applications to multi-agent artificial intelligence systems. The first section offers a comprehensive overview of fundamental sheaf-theoretic concepts-presheaves, sheaves, stalks, and cohomology-aimed at researchers in computer science and AI who may not have extensive background in algebraic topology. The second section presents a detailed research prospectus that outlines a roadmap for developing sheaf-theoretic approaches to model and analyze complex systems of interacting agents. We propose that sheaf theory's inherent local-to-global perspective may provide valuable mathematical tools for reasoning about how local agent behaviors collectively determine emergent system properties. The third section contains a literature review connecting sheaf theory with existing research in multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and economic modeling. This paper does not present a completed model but rather lays theoretical groundwork and identifies promising research directions that could bridge abstract mathematics with practical AI applications, potentially revealing new approaches to coordination and emergence in multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Recursive feasibility for stochastic MPC and the rationale behind fixing flat tires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of designing stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) schemes for linear systems affected by unbounded disturbances. The contribution of the paper is rooted in a measured-state initialization strategy. First, due to the nonzero probability of violating chance-constraints in the case of unbounded noise, we introduce ellipsoidal-based probabilistic reachable sets and we include constraint relaxations to recover recursive feasibility conditioned to the measured state. Second, we prove that the solution of this novel SMPC scheme guarantees closed-loop chance constraints satisfaction under minimum relaxation. Last, we demonstrate that, in expectation, the need of relaxing the constraints vanishes over time, which leads the closed-loop trajectories steered towards the unconstrained LQR invariant region. This novel SMPC scheme is proven to satisfy the recursive feasibility conditioned to the state realization, and its superiority with respect to open-loop initialization schemes is shown through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>What makes a good public EV charging station? A revealed preference study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To determine the optimal locations for electric vehicle charging stations, optimisation models need to predict which charging stations users will select. We estimate discrete choice models to predict the usage of charging stations using only readily available information for charging network operators. Our parameter values are estimated from a unique, revealed preferences dataset of charging sessions in Montreal, Quebec. We find that user distance to stations, proximity to home areas, and the number of outlets at each station are significant factors for predicting station usage. Additionally, amenities near charging stations have a neutral effect overall, with some users demonstrating strong preference or aversion for these locations. High variability among the preferences of users highlight the importance of models which incorporate panel effects. Moreover, integrating mixed logit models within the optimization of charging station network design yields high-quality solutions, even when evaluated under other model specifications.</description>

      <title>An Inverse Source Problem for Semilinear Stochastic Hyperbolic Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates an inverse source problem for general semilinear stochastic hyperbolic equations. Motivated by the challenges arising from both randomness and nonlinearity, we develop a globally convergent iterative regularization method that combines Carleman estimate with fixed-point iteration. Our approach enables the reconstruction of the unknown source function from partial lateral Cauchy data, without requiring a good initial guess. We establish a new Carleman estimate for stochastic hyperbolic equations and prove the convergence of the proposed method in weighted spaces. Furthermore, we design an efficient numerical algorithm that avoids solving backward stochastic partial differential equations and is robust to randomness in both the model and the data. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>Linear Test Approach to Global Controllability of Higher-Order Nonlinear Dispersive Equations with Finite-Dimensional Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of higher-order nonlinear dispersive equations posed on the circle, subject to additive forcing by a finite-dimensional control. Our main objective is to establish approximate controllability by using the controllability of the inviscid Burgers system, linearized around a suitably constructed trajectory. In contrast to earlier approaches based on Lie algebraic techniques, our method offers a more concise proof and sheds new light on the structure of the control. Although the approach necessitates a higher-dimensional control space, both the structure and dimension of the control remain uniform with respect to the order of the dispersive equation and the control time.</description>

      <title>On Josephy-Halley method for generalized equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the classical third-order Halley iteration to the setting of generalized equations of the form \[ 0 \in f(x) + F(x), \] where \(f\colon X\longrightarrow Y\) is twice continuously Fr\'echet-differentiable on Banach spaces and \(F\colon X\tto Y\) is a set-valued mapping with closed graph. Building on predictor-corrector framework, our scheme first solves a partially linearized inclusion to produce a predictor \(u_{k+1}\), then incorporates second-order information in a Halley-type corrector step to obtain \(x_{k+1}\). Under metric regularity of the linearization at a reference solution and H\"older continuity of \(f''\), we prove that the iterates converge locally with order \(2+p\) (cubically when \(p=1\)). Moreover, by constructing a suitable scalar majorant function we derive semilocal Kantorovich-type conditions guaranteeing well-definedness and R-cubic convergence from an explicit neighbourhood of the initial guess. Numerical experiments-including one- and two-dimensional test problems confirm the theoretical convergence rates and illustrate the efficiency of the Josephy-Halley method compared to its Josephy-Newton counterpart.</description>

      <title>On the Degree Automatability of Sum-of-Squares Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sum-of-Squares (SoS) hierarchy, also known as Lasserre hierarchy, has emerged as a promising tool in optimization. However, it remains unclear whether fixed-degree SoS proofs can be automated [O'Donnell (2017)]. Indeed, there are examples of polynomial systems with bounded coefficients that admit low-degree SoS proofs, but these proofs necessarily involve numbers with an exponential number of bits, implying that low-degree SoS proofs cannot always be found efficiently.
  A sufficient condition derived from the Nullstellensatz proof system [Raghavendra and Weitz (2017)] identifies cases where bit complexity issues can be circumvented. One of the main problems left open by Raghavendra and Weitz is proving any result for refutations, as their condition applies only to polynomial systems with a large set of solutions.
  In this work, we broaden the class of polynomial systems for which degree-$d$ SoS proofs can be automated. To achieve this, we develop a new criterion and we demonstrate how our criterion applies to polynomial systems beyond the scope of Raghavendra and Weitz's result. In particular, we establish a separation for instances arising from Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). Moreover, our result extends to refutations, establishing that polynomial-time refutation is possible for broad classes of polynomial time solvable constraint problems, highlighting a first advancement in this area.</description>

      <title>Scheduling and dimensioning of heterogeneous energy stores, with applications to future GB storage needs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.00102v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future ``net-zero'' electricity systems in which all or most generation is renewable may require very high volumes of storage, provided jointly by a number of heterogeneous technologies, in order to manage the associated variability in the generation-demand balance. We consider the problems of scheduling and dimensioning such storage. We develop a value-function based approach to optimal scheduling, and show that, to a good approximation, the problem to be solved at each successive point in time reduces to a linear programme with a particularly simple solution. We show that approximately optimal scheduling may be achieved without the need for a running forecast of the future generation-demand balance. We examine the applicability of the above theory to future GB storage needs, and discuss how it may be used to enable the most economic dimensioning of such storage, with possible savings of tens of billions of pounds, relative to the use of a single technology.</description>

      <title>An Operator Learning Approach to Nonsmooth Optimal Control of Nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal control problems with nonsmooth objectives and nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) constraints are challenging, mainly because of the underlying nonsmooth and nonconvex structures and the demanding computational cost for solving multiple high-dimensional and ill-conditioned systems after mesh-based discretization. To mitigate these challenges numerically, we propose an operator learning approach in combination with an effective primal-dual optimization idea which can decouple the treatment of the control and state variables so that each of the resulting iterations only requires solving two PDEs. Our main purpose is to construct neural surrogate models for the involved PDEs by operator learning, allowing the solution of a PDE to be obtained with only a forward pass of the neural network. The resulting algorithmic framework offers a hybrid approach that combines the efficiency and generalization of operator learning with the model-based nature and structure-friendly efficiency of primal-dual-based algorithms. The primal-dual-based operator learning approach offers numerical methods that are mesh-free, easy to implement, and adaptable to various optimal control problems with nonlinear PDEs. It is notable that the neural surrogate models can be reused across iterations and parameter settings, hence retraining of neural networks can be avoided and computational cost can be substantially alleviated. We affirmatively validate the efficiency of the primal-dual-based operator learning approach across a range of typical optimal control problems with nonlinear PDEs.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a globalized inexact semismooth Newton method applied to strongly convex optimization problems in Hilbert spaces. Here, the semismooth Newton method is appplied to the dual problem, which has a continuously differentiable objective. We prove global strong convergence of iterates as well as transition to local superlinear convergence. The latter needs a second-order Taylor expansion involving semismooth derivative concepts. The convergence of the globalized method is demonstrated in numerical examples, for which the local unglobalized method diverges.</description>

      <title>Scheduling problem of aircrafts on a same runway and dual runways</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22124v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the scheduling problems of landing and takeoff aircraft on a same runway and on dual runways are addressed. In contrast to the approaches based on mixed-integer optimization models in existing works, our approach focuses on the minimum separation times between aircraft by introducing some necessary assumptions and new concepts including relevance, breakpoint aircraft, path and class-monotonically-decreasing sequence. Four scheduling problems are discussed including landing scheduling problem, takeoff scheduling problem, and mixed landing and takeoff scheduling problems on a same runway and on dual runways with the consideration of conversions between different aircraft sequences in typical scenarios. Two real-time optimal algorithms are proposed for the four scheduling problems by fully exploiting the combinations of different classes of aircraft, and necessary definitions, lemmas and theorems are presented for the optimal convergence of the algorithms. Numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. In particular, when $100$ aircraft are considered, by using the algorithm in this paper, the optimal solution can be obtained in less than $5$ seconds, while by using the CPLEX software to solve the mix-integer optimization model, the optimal solution cannot be obtained within $1$ hour.</description>

      <title>An Operator Splitting Method for Large-Scale CVaR-Constrained Quadratic Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a fast and scalable method for solving quadratic programs with conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) constraints. While these problems can be formulated as standard quadratic programs, the number of variables and constraints grows linearly with the number of scenarios, making general-purpose solvers impractical for large-scale problems. Our method combines operator splitting with a specialized $O(m\log m)$ algorithm for projecting onto CVaR constraints, where $m$ is the number of scenarios. The method alternates between solving a linear system and performing parallel projections: onto CVaR constraints using our specialized algorithm and onto box constraints with a closed-form solution. Numerical examples from several application domains demonstrate that our method outperforms general-purpose solvers by several orders of magnitude on problems with up to millions of scenarios. Our method is implemented in an open-source package called CVQP.</description>

      <title>QoS-based Beamforming and Compression Design for Cooperative Cellular Networks via Lagrangian Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the quality-of-service (QoS)-based joint beamforming and compression design problem in the downlink cooperative cellular network, where multiple relay-like base stations (BSs), connected to the central processor via rate-limited fronthaul links, cooperatively transmit messages to the users. The problem of interest is formulated as the minimization of the total transmit power of the BSs, subject to all users' signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints and all BSs' fronthaul rate constraints. In this paper, we first show that there is no duality gap between the considered joint optimization problem and its Lagrangian dual by showing the tightness of its semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Then, we propose an efficient algorithm based on the above duality result for solving the considered problem. The proposed algorithm judiciously exploits the special structure of an enhanced Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the considered problem and finds the solution that satisfies the enhanced KKT conditions via two fixed point iterations. Two key features of the proposed algorithm are: (1) it is able to detect whether the considered problem is feasible or not and find its globally optimal solution when it is feasible; (2) it is highly efficient because both of the fixed point iterations in the proposed algorithm are linearly convergent and evaluating the functions in the fixed point iterations are computationally cheap. Numerical results show the global optimality and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Suppose we observe a Poisson process in real time for which the intensity may take on two possible values $\lambda_0$ and $\lambda_1$. Suppose further that the priori probability of the true intensity is not given. We solve a minimax version of Bayesian problem of sequential testing of two simple hypotheses to minimize a linear combination of the probability of wrong detection and the expected waiting time in the worst scenario of all possible priori distributions. An equivalent characterization for the least favorable distributions is derived and a sufficient condition for the existence is concluded.</description>

      <title>Predictive and prescriptive analytics for multi-site modelling of frail and elderly patient services</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many economies are challenged by the effects of an ageing population, particularly in sectors where resource capacity planning is critical, such as healthcare. This research addresses the operational challenges of bed and staffing capacity planning in hospital wards by using predictive and prescriptive analytical methods, both individually and in tandem. We applied these methodologies to a study of 165,000 patients across a network of 11 hospitals in the UK. Predictive modelling, specifically Classification and Regression Trees, forecasts patient length of stay based on clinical and demographic data. On the prescriptive side, deterministic and two-stage stochastic optimisation models determine optimal bed and staff planning strategies to minimise costs. Linking the predictive models with the prescriptive optimisation models, generates demand forecasts that inform the optimisation process, providing accurate and practical solutions. The results demonstrate that this integrated approach captures real-world variations in patient LOS and offers a 7% cost saving compared to average-based planning. This approach helps healthcare managers make robust decisions by incorporating patient-specific characteristics, improving capacity allocation, and mitigating risks associated with demand variability. Consequently, this combined methodology can be broadly extended across various sectors facing similar challenges, showcasing the versatility and effectiveness of integrating predictive and prescriptive analytics.</description>

      <title>Fast OMP for Exact Recovery and Sparse Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00146</link>

Abstract: Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) has been a powerful method in sparse signal recovery and approximation. However OMP suffers computational issue when the signal has large number of non-zeros. This paper advances OMP in two fronts: it offers a fast algorithm for the orthogonal projection of the input signal at each iteration, and a new selection criterion for making the greedy choice, which reduces the number of iterations it takes to recover the signal. The proposed modifications to OMP directly reduce the computational complexity. Experiment results show significant improvement over the classical OMP in computation time. The paper also provided a sufficient condition for exact recovery under the new greedy choice criterion. For general signals that may not have sparse representations, the paper provides a bound for the approximation error. The approximation error is at the same order as OMP but is obtained within fewer iterations and less time.</description>

      <title>Robust Model Predictive Control Exploiting Monotonicity Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17348</link>

Abstract: Robust model predictive control algorithms are essential for addressing unavoidable errors due to the uncertainty in predicting real-world systems. However, the formulation of such algorithms typically results in a trade-off between conservatism and computational complexity. Monotone systems facilitate the efficient computation of reachable sets and thus the straightforward formulation of a robust model predictive control approach optimizing over open-loop predictions. We present an approach based on the division of reachable sets to incorporate feedback in the predictions, resulting in less conservative strategies. The concept of mixed-monotonicity enables an extension of our methodology to non-monotone systems. The potential of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through a nonlinear high-dimensional chemical tank reactor cascade case study.</description>

      <title>Optimal Rates for Robust Stochastic Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms in high-dimensional settings are highly susceptible to the influence of even a small fraction of structured outliers, making robust optimization techniques essential. In particular, within the $\epsilon$-contamination model, where an adversary can inspect and replace up to an $\epsilon$-fraction of the samples, a fundamental open problem is determining the optimal rates for robust stochastic convex optimization (SCO) under such contamination. We develop novel algorithms that achieve minimax-optimal excess risk (up to logarithmic factors) under the $\epsilon$-contamination model. Our approach improves over existing algorithms, which are not only suboptimal but also require stringent assumptions, including Lipschitz continuity and smoothness of individual sample functions. By contrast, our optimal algorithms do not require these stringent assumptions, assuming only population-level smoothness of the loss. Moreover, our algorithms can be adapted to handle the case in which the covariance parameter is unknown, and can be extended to nonsmooth population risks via convolutional smoothing. We complement our algorithmic developments with a tight information-theoretic lower bound for robust SCO.</description>

      <title>The monopolist's free boundary problem in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Monopolist's problem with a focus on the free boundary separating bunched from unbunched consumers, especially in the plane, and give a full description of its solution for the family of square domains $\{(a,a+1)^2\}_{a \ge 0}$. The Monopolist's problem is fundamental in economics, yet widely considered analytically intractable when both consumers and products have more than one degree of heterogeneity. Mathematically, the problem is to minimize a smooth, uniformly convex Lagrangian over the space of nonnegative convex functions. What results is a free boundary problem between the regions of strict and nonstrict convexity. Our work is divided into three parts: a study of the structure of the free boundary problem on convex domains in $\mathbf{R}^n$ showing that the product allocation map remains Lipschitz up to most of the fixed boundary and that each bunch extends to this boundary; a proof in $\mathbf{R}^2$ that the interior free boundary can only fail to be smooth in one of four specific ways (cusp, high frequency oscillations, stray bunch, nontranversal bunch); and, finally, the first complete solution to Rochet and Chon\'e's example on the family of squares $\Omega = (a,a+1)^2$, where we discover bifurcations first to targeted and then to blunt bunching as the distance $a \ge 0$ to the origin is increased. We use techniques from the study of the Monge--Amp\'ere equation, the obstacle problem, and localization for measures in convex-order.</description>
