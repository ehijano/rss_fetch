      <title>Arrival time and Bohmian Mechanics: It is the theory which decides what we can measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we analyze recent proposals by Das and D\"{u}rr (DD) to measure the arrival time distributions of quantum particles within the framework of de Broglie Bohm theory (or Bohmian mechanics). We also analyze the criticisms made by Goldstein Tumulka and Zangh\`{i} (GTZ) of these same proposals, and show that each protagonist is both right and wrong. In fine, we show that DD's predictions are indeed measurable in principle, but that they will not lead to violations of the no-signalling theorem used in Bell's theorem, in contradiction with some of Das and Maudlin's hopes.</description>

      <title>A critique of one of Galileo's mental experiments and an explanation on why bodies fall with equal acceleration through the vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the famous thought experiment studied in this article, Galileo attempted to refute the Aristotelian hypothesis that heavier bodies should fall more quickly than lighter ones. After pointing out some inconsistencies in Galileo's approach, we show, through the design of two alternative but equivalent experiments, that from his imaginary experiment, it is not possible to reach the conclusion that all bodies fall simultaneously. We show why, to explain the result of this type of experience, it is necessary to establish the equivalence between inertial and gravitational masses derived exclusively from experience.</description>

      <title>How the Michelson and Morley experiment was reinterpreted by special relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elucidate how different theoretical assumptions bring about radically different interpretations of the same experimental result. We do this by analyzing special relativity as it was originally formulated. Then, we examine the relationship of the theory with the result of the Michelson and Morley experiment. We point out that in diverse a historical context the same experiment can be thought of as providing different conceptualizations of phenomena. This demonstrates why special relativity prevailed over its rival theories. This theory made a new reinterpretation of the experiment by associating it with a novel phenomenon, namely, the invariance of the speed of light, a phenomenon that was not the one originally investigated. This leads us to an understanding of how this experiment could have been interpreted in a completely different historical context.</description>

      <title>Relativity with or without light and Maxwell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complex relationship between Einstein's second postulate and the Maxwell electromagnetic theory is elucidated. A simple deduction of the main results of the Ignatowski approach to the theory of relativity is given. The peculiar status of the principle of relativity among the Maxwellians is illustrated.</description>
