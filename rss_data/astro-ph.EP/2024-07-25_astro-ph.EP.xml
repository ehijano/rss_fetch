      <title>Axisymmetric Dynamos Sustained by Ohm's Law in a Nearly-Spherical Rotating Viscous Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work tackles a significant challenge in dynamo theory: the possibility of long-term amplification and maintenance of an axisymmetric magnetic field. We introduce a novel model that allows for non-trivial axially-symmetric steady-state solutions for the magnetic field, particularly when the dynamo operates primarily within a "nearly-spherical" toroidal volume inside a fluid shell surrounding a solid core. In this model, Ohm's law is generalized to include the restoring friction force, which aligns the velocity of the shell with the rotational speed of the inner core and outer mantle. Our findings reveal that, in this context, Cowling's theorem and the neutral point argument are modified, leading to magnetic energy growth for a suitable choice of toroidal flow. The global equilibrium magnetic field that emerges from our model exhibits a dipolar character.</description>

      <title>Subaru/CHARIS High-Resolution Mode Spectroscopy of the Brown Dwarf Companion HD 33632 Ab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs (BD) are model degenerate in age and mass. High-contrast imaging and spectroscopy of BD companions to host stars where the mass and age can be independently constrained by dynamics and stellar age indicators respectively provide valuable tests of BD evolution models. In this paper, we present a new epoch of Subaru/CHARIS H- and K-band observations of one such previously discovered system, HD 33632 Ab. We reanalyze the mass and orbit using our new epoch of extracted relative astrometry, and fit extracted spectra to the newest generation of equilibrium, disequilibrium, and cloudy spectral and evolution models for BDs. No spectral model perfectly agrees with evolutionary tracks and the derived mass and age, instead favoring a somewhat younger BD than the host star's inferred age. This tension can potentially be resolved using atmosphere and evolution models that consider both clouds and disequilibrium chemistry simultaneously, or by additional future spectra at higher resolution or in other band passes. Photometric measurements alone remain consistent with the luminosity predicted by evolutionary tracks. Our work highlights the importance of considering complexities like clouds, disequilibrium chemistry, and composition when comparing spectral models to evolutionary tracks.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Characterization of the Limb Asymmetry -- Transit Time Degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheres are not spatially homogeneous. This is particularly true for hot, tidally locked exoplanets with large day-to-night temperature variations, which can yield significant differences between the morning and evening terminators -- known as limb asymmetry. Current transit observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are precise enough to disentangle the separate contributions of these morning and evening limbs to the overall transmission spectrum in certain circumstances. However, the signature of limb asymmetry in a transit light curve is highly degenerate with uncertainty in the planet's time of conjunction. This raises the question of how precisely transit times must be measured to enable accurate studies of limb asymmetry, particularly with JWST. Although this degeneracy has been discussed in the literature, a general description of it has not been presented. In this work, we show how this degeneracy results from apparent changes in the transit contact times when the planetary disk has asymmetric limb sizes. We derive a general formula relating the magnitude of limb asymmetry to the amount which it would cause the apparent time of conjunction to vary, which can reach tens of seconds. Comparing our formula to simulated observations, we find that numerical fitting techniques add additional bias to the measured time, of generally less than a second, resulting from the occultation geometry. We also derive an analytical formula for this extra numerical bias. These formulae can be applied to planning new observations or interpreting literature measurements, and we show examples for commonly studied exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Climate Transition to Temperate Nightside at High Atmosphere Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our recent work shows how M-Earth climates and transmission spectra depend on the amount of ice-free ocean on the planet's dayside and the mass of N2 in its atmosphere. M-Earths with more ice-free ocean and thicker atmospheres are hotter and more humid, and have larger water vapour features in their transmission spectra. In this paper, we describe a climate transition in high-pN2 simulations from the traditional ``eyeball" M-Earth climate, in which only the substellar region is temperate, to a ``temperate nightside" regime in which both the dayside and the nightside are entirely ice-free. Between these two states, there is a ``transition" regime with partial nightside ice cover. We use 3D climate simulations to describe the climate transition from frozen to deglaciated nightsides. We attribute this transition to increased advection and heat transport by water vapour in thicker atmospheres. We find that the nightside transitions smoothly back and forth between frozen and ice-free when the instellation or pCO2 is perturbed, with no hysteresis. We also find an analogous transition in colder planets: those with thin atmospheres can have a dayside hotspot when the instellation is low, whereas those with more massive atmospheres are more likely to be in the ``snowball" regime, featuring a completely frozen dayside, due to the increased advection of heat away from the substellar point. We show how both of these climate transitions are sensitive to instellation, land cover, and atmosphere mass. We generate synthetic transmission spectra and phase curves for the range of climates in our simulations.</description>

      <title>Infrared Colors of Small Serendipitously-Found Asteroids in the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The UKIRT Hemisphere Survey covers the northern sky in the infrared from 0-60 degrees declination. Current data releases include both J and K bands, with H-band data forthcoming. Here we present a novel pipeline to recover asteroids from this survey data. We recover 26,138 reliable observations, corresponding to 23,399 unique asteroids, from these public data. We measure J-K colors for 601 asteroids. Our survey extends about two magnitudes deeper than 2MASS. We find that our small inner main belt objects are less red than larger inner belt objects, perhaps because smaller asteroids are collisionally younger, with surfaces that have been less affected by space weathering. In the middle and outer main belt, we find our small asteroids to be redder than larger objects in their same orbits, possibly due to observational bias or a disproportionate population of very red objects among these smaller asteroids. Future work on this project includes extracting moving object measurements from H and Y band data when it becomes available.</description>

      <title>Ephemeris Reconstruction for Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko During Rosetta Proximity Phase from Radiometric Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides a continuous ephemeris reconstruction for comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by reanalyzing Rosetta radiometric measurements and Earth-based astrometry. Given the comet-to-spacecraft relative trajectory provided by the navigation team, these measurements were used to estimate the comet state and some critical physical parameters, most notably the non-gravitational accelerations induced by the outgassing of surface volatiles, for which different models were tested and compared. The reference reconstructed ephemeris, which uses a stochastic acceleration model, has position uncertainties below 10 km, 30 km, and 80 km in the orbital radial, tangential, and normal directions for the whole duration of the Rosetta proximity phase (from July 2014 to October 2016). Furthermore, the solution can fit ground-based astrometry between March 2010 and July 2018, covering a complete heliocentric orbit of 67P. The estimated comet non-gravitational accelerations are dominated by the orbital radial and normal components, reaching peak values of $(1.28 \pm 0.17) \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m/s}^2$ and $(0.52 \pm 0.20) \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m/s}^2$, respectively 15 days and 24 days after perihelion. Furthermore, the acceleration magnitude is shown to have a steep dependence on the comet heliocentric distance $\text{NGA} \sim r_\odot^{-6}$ and shows asymmetries in the pre- and post-perihelion activities. The estimated acceleration components, agnostic due to the limited physical assumptions, could be used as a constraint for future investigations involving high-fidelity thermophysical models of the comet surface.</description>

      <title>TOI-1408: Discovery and Photodynamical Modeling of a Small Inner Companion to a Hot Jupiter Revealed by TTVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery and characterization of a small planet, TOI-1408 c, on a 2.2-day orbit located interior to a previously known hot Jupiter, TOI-1408 b ($P=4.42$ d, $M=1.86\pm0.02\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$, $R=2.4\pm0.5\,R_\mathrm{Jup}$) that exhibits grazing transits. The two planets are near 2:1 period commensurability, resulting in significant transit timing variations (TTVs) for both planets and transit duration variations (TDVs) for the inner planet. The TTV amplitude for TOI-1408 c is 15% of the planet's orbital period, marking the largest TTV amplitude relative to the orbital period measured to date. Photodynamical modeling of ground-based radial velocity (RV) observations and transit light curves obtained with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and ground-based facilities leads to an inner planet radius of $2.22\pm0.06\,R_\oplus$ and mass of $7.6\pm0.2\,M_\oplus$ that locates the planet into the Sub-Neptune regime. The proximity to the 2:1 period commensurability leads to the libration of the resonant argument of the inner planet. The RV measurements support the existence of a third body with an orbital period of several thousand days. This discovery places the system among the rare systems featuring a hot Jupiter accompanied by an inner low-mass planet.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of exocomet transits: Insights from \{beta} Pic and KIC 3542116</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the topic of existence and exploration of exocomets has been gaining increasing attention. The asymmetrical decrease in the stellar brightness due to the passage of a comet-like object in front of the star was successfully predicted. It was subsequently confirmed on the basis of the light curves of stars observed by Kepler and TESS orbital telescopes. Since then, there have been successful attempts to fit the asymmetrical dips observed in the stellar light curves utilizing a simple 1D model of an exponentially decaying optically thin dust tail. In this work, we propose fitting the photometric profiles of some known exocomet transits based on a Monte Carlo approach to build up the distribution of dust particles in a cometary tail. As the exocomet prototypes, we used the physical properties of certain Solar System comets belonging to the different dynamical groups and moving at heliocentric distances of 0.6 au, 1.0 au, 5.0 au, and 5.5 au. We obtained a good agreement between the observed and modeled transit light curves. We also show that the physical characteristics of dust particles, such as the particle size range, the power index of dust size distribution, the particle terminal velocity, and distance to the host star affect the shape of the transit light curve, while the dust productivity of the comet nucleus and the impact parameter influence its depth and duration. The estimated dust production rates of the transiting exocomets are at the level of the most active Solar System comets.</description>

      <title>HAMSTER: Hyperspectral Albedo Maps dataset with high Spatial and TEmporal Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface albedo is an important parameter in radiative transfer simulations of the Earth's system, as it is fundamental to correctly calculate the energy budget of the planet. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites continuously monitor daily and yearly changes in reflection at the planetary surface. The MODIS Surface Reflectance black-sky albedo dataset (MCD43D, version 6.1) gives detailed albedo maps in seven spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared range. These albedo maps allow us to classify different Lambertian surface types and their seasonal and yearly variability and change, albeit only in seven spectral bands. However, a complete set of albedo maps covering the entire wavelength range is required to simulate radiance spectra, and to correctly retrieve atmospheric and cloud properties from Earth's remote sensing. We use a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) regression algorithm to generate hyperspectral albedo maps of Earth. Combining different datasets of hyperspectral reflectance laboratory measurements for various dry soils, vegetation surfaces, and mixtures of both, we reconstruct the albedo maps in the entire wavelength range from 400 to 2500~nm. The PCA method is trained with a 10-years average of MODIS data for each day of the year. We obtain hyperspectral albedo maps with a spatial resolution of 0.05{\deg} in latitude and longitude, a spectral resolution of 10~nm, and a temporal resolution of 1~day. Using the hyperspectral albedo maps, we estimate the spectral profiles of different land surfaces, such as forests, deserts, cities and icy surfaces, and study their seasonal variability. These albedo maps shall enable to refine calculations of Earth's energy budget, its seasonal variability, and improve climate simulations.</description>

      <title>Threat Level Estimation From Possible Break-Up Events In LEO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NASA Standard Break-Up Model models collisions and explosions in space, which identifies the future distribution of debris. Given a possible break-up event, this work analyses the threat posed by the generated debris in the orbit of an asset spacecraft. Using the Koopman Operator solution of the $J_2$ perturbed two-body dynamics, the family of all possible orbits that cross the asset's pathway is identified and parameterized according to their velocity. The threat level assessment of a collision onto the asset is estimated considering the intersection between the velocities of the break-up model and the Koopman transfer solutions.</description>

      <title>GJ 238 b: A 0.57 Earth Radius Planet Orbiting an M2.5 Dwarf Star at 15.2 pc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of the transiting planet GJ 238 b, with a radius of $0.566\pm0.014$ R$_{\oplus}$ ($1.064\pm0.026$ times the radius of Mars) and an orbital period of 1.74 day. The transit signal was detected by the TESS mission and designated TOI-486.01. The star's position close to the Southern ecliptic pole allows for almost continuous observations by TESS when it is observing the Southern sky. The host star is an M2.5 dwarf with $V=11.57\pm0.02$ mag, $K=7.030\pm0.023$ mag, a distance of $15.2156\pm0.0030$ pc, a mass of $0.4193_{-0.0098}^{+0.0095}$ M$_{\odot}$, a radius of $0.4314_{-0.0071}^{+0.0075}$ R$_{\odot}$, and an effective temperature of $3{,}485\pm140$ K. We validate the planet candidate by ruling out or rendering highly unlikely each of the false positive scenarios, based on archival data and ground-based follow-up observations. Validation was facilitated by the host star's small size and high proper motion, of $892.633\pm0.025$ mas yr$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Catalog of Proper Orbits for 1.25 Million Main Belt Asteroids and Discovery of 136 New Collisional Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proper elements of asteroids are obtained from the instantaneous orbital elements by removing periodic oscillations produced by gravitational interactions with planets. They are unchanging in time, at least if chaotic dynamics and non-gravitational forces could be ignored, and can therefore be used to identify fragments of major collisions (asteroid families) that happened eons ago. Here we present a new catalog of proper elements for 1.25 million main belt asteroids. We explain the methodology, evaluate uncertainties, and discuss how the new catalog can be used to identify asteroid families. A systematic search for families yielded 153 cases not reported in Nesvorn\'y at al. (2015) -- 17 of these cases were identified in various other publications, 136 cases are new discoveries. There are now 274 families in the asteroid belt in total (plus a handful of families in the resonant Hilda population). We analyzed several compact families in detail. The new family around the middle belt asteroid (9332) 1990SB1 (9 members) is the youngest family found so far (estimated formation only 16-17 kyr ago). New families (1217) Maximiliana, (6084) Bascom, (10164) Akusekijima and (70208) 1999RX33 all formed 0.5-2.5 Myr ago. The (2110) Moore-Sitterly family is a close pair of relatively large bodies, 2110 and 44612, and 15 small members all located sunwards from 2110 and 44612, presumably a consequence of the Yarkovsky drift over the estimated family age (1.2-1.5 Myr). A systematic characterization of the new asteroid families is left for future work.</description>

Abstract: Here, I present the community with exoTEDRF (EXOplanet Transit and Eclipse Data Reduction Framework; formerly known as supreme-SPOON), an end-to-end pipeline for data reduction and light curve analysis of time series observations (TSOs) of transiting exoplanets with JWST. The pipeline is highly modular and designed to produce reliable spectra from raw JWST exposures. exoTEDRF (pronounced exo-tedorf) consists of four stages, each of which are further subdivided into a series of steps. These steps can either be run individually, for example in a Jupyter notebook, or via the command line using the provided configuration files. The steps are highly tunable, allowing full control over every parameter in the reduction. Each step also produces diagnostic plots to allow the user to verify their results at each intermediate stage, and compare outputs with other pipelines if so desired. Finally, exoTEDRF has also been designed to be run in "batch" mode: simultaneously running multiple reductions, each tweaking a subset of parameters, to understand any impacts on the resulting atmosphere spectrum.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances within 100 pc. A sample of G, K, and M main-sequence stars</title>

Abstract: To date, we have access to enormous inventories of stellar spectra that allow the extraction of atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances essential in stellar studies. However, characterizing such a large amount of data is complex and requires a good understanding of the studied object to ensure reliable and homogeneous results. In this study, we present a methodology to measure homogenously the basic atmospheric parameters and detailed chemical abundances of over 1600 thin disk main-sequence stars in the 100 pc solar neighborhood, using APOGEE-2 infrared spectra. We employed the code tonalli to determine the atmospheric parameters using a prior on log g. The log g prior in tonalli implies an understanding of the treated population and helps to find physically coherent answers. Our atmospheric parameters agree within the typical uncertainties (100 K in Teff, 0.15 dex in log g and $[M/H]$) with previous estimations of ASPCAP and Gaia DR3. We use our temperatures to determine a new infrared color-temperature sequence, in good agreement with previous works, that can be used for any main-sequence star. Additionally, we used the BACCHUS code to determine the abundances of Mg, Al, Si, Ca, and Fe in our sample. The five elements (Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Fe) studied have an abundance distribution centered around slightly sub-solar values, in agreement with previous results for the solar neighborhood. The over 1600 main-sequence stars atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances presented here are useful in follow-up studies of the solar neighborhood or as a training set for data-driven methods.</description>

      <title>The operationally ready full three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D MHD) model from the Sun to Earth: COCONUT+Icarus</title>

Abstract: Solar wind modelling has become a crucial area of study due to the increased dependence of modern society on technology, navigation, and power systems. Accurate space weather forecasts can predict upcoming threats to Earth's geospace. In this study, we examine a novel full magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) chain from the Sun to Earth. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the capabilities of the full MHD modelling chain from the Sun to Earth by finalising the implementation of the full MHD coronal model into the COolfluid COroNa UnsTructured (COCONUT) model and coupling it to the MHD heliospheric model Icarus. The resulting coronal model has significant advantages compared to the pre-existing polytropic alternative, as it models a more realistic bi-modal wind, which is crucial for heliospheric studies.
  In this study, only thermal conduction, radiative losses, and approximated coronal heating function were considered in the energy equation. A realistic specific heat ratio was applied. The output of the coronal model was used to onset the 3D MHD heliospheric model Icarus. A minimum solar activity case was chosen as the first test case for the full MHD model. The numerically simulated data in the corona and the heliosphere were compared to observational products. We present a first attempt to obtain the full MHD chain from the Sun to Earth with COCONUT and Icarus. The coronal model has been upgraded to a full MHD model for a realistic bi-modal solar wind configuration. The approximated heating functions have modelled the wind reasonably well, but simple approximations are not enough to obtain a realistic density-speed balance or realistic features in the low corona and farther, near the outer boundary. The full MHD model was computed in 1.06 h on 180 cores of the Genius cluster of the Vlaams Supercomputing Center, which is only 1.8 times longer than the polytropic simulation.</description>

      <title>Warps and Breaks in Circumbinary Discs</title>

Abstract: Disc warping, and possibly disc breaking, has been observed in protoplanetary discs around both single and multiple stars. Large warps can break the disc, producing multiple observational signatures. In this work, we use comparisons of disc timescales to derive updated formulae for disc breaking, with better predictions as to when and where a disc is expected to break and how many breaks could occur. Disc breaking is more likely for discs with small inner cavities, cooler temperatures, and steeper power-law profiles, such that thin, polar-aligning discs are more likely to break. We test our analytic formulae using 3D grid-based simulations of protoplanetary discs warped by the gravitational torque of an inner binary. We reproduce the expected warp behaviors in different viscosity regimes and observe disc breaking at locations in agreement with our derived equations. As our simulations only show disc breaking when disc viscosity is low, we also consider a viscous criterion for disc breaking, where rapid alignment to the precession vector can prevent a break by reducing the maximum misalignment between neighboring rings. We apply these results to the GW Orionis circumtriple disc, and find that the precession induced from the central stars can break the disc if it is relatively thin. We expect repeated or multiple disc breaking to occur for discs with sufficiently steep power law profiles. We simulate a polar-aligning disc around an eccentric binary with steep power-law profiles, and observe two separate breaking events at locations in rough agreement with our analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Spatial Variations of Jovian Tropospheric Ammonia via Ground-Based Imaging</title>

Abstract: Current understanding of the ammonia distribution in Jupiter's atmosphere is provided by observations from major ground-based facilities and spacecraft, and analyzed with sophisticated retrieval models that recover high fidelity information, but are limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Here we show that the ammonia abundance in Jupiter's upper troposphere, which tracks the overturning atmospheric circulation, can be simply, but reliably determined from continuum-divided ammonia and methane absorption-band images made with a moderate-sized Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope (SCT). In 2020-21, Jupiter was imaged in the 647-nm ammonia absorption band and adjacent continuum bands with a 0.28-m SCT, demonstrating that the spatially-resolved ammonia optical depth could be determined with such a telescope. In 2022-23, a 619 nm methane-band filter was added to provide a constant reference against which to correct the ammonia abundances (column-averaged mole fraction) for cloud opacity variations. These 0.28-m SCT results are compared with observations from: a) the MUSE instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT) b) TEXES mid-infrared spectrometer used on the NASA's InfraRed Telescope Facility (IRTF); and c) the Gemini telescopes, and are shown to provide reliable maps of ammonia abundance. Meridional and longitudinal features are examined, including the Equatorial Zone (EZ) ammonia enhancement, the North Equatorial Belt (NEB) depletion, depletion above the Great Red Spot (GRS), and longitudinal enhancements in the northern EZ. This work demonstrates meaningful ammonia monitoring can be achieved with small telescopes that can complement spacecraft and major ground-based facility observations.</description>

      <title>A Novel Method to Constrain Tidal Quality Factor from A Non-synchronized Exoplanetary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to constrain the tidal quality factor, $Q'$, from an observed non-synchronized star-planet system consisting of a slowly rotating low-mass star and a close-in Jovian planet, taking into account the co-evolution of stellar spin and planetary orbit due to the tidal interaction and the magnetic braking. On the basis of dynamical system theory, the track of the co-evolution of angular momentum from the fast rotator regime for such a system exhibits the existence of a forbidden region in the $\Omega_\mathrm{orb}$ -- $\Omega_\mathrm{spin}$ plane , where $\Omega_\mathrm{spin}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{orb}$ denote the angular velocity of the stellar spin and planetary orbit, respectively. The forbidden region is determined primarily by the strength of the tidal interaction. By comparing ($\Omega_\mathrm{orb},\Omega_\mathrm{spin}$) of a single star-planet system to the forbidden region, we can constrain the tidal quality factor regardless of the evolutionary history of the system. The application of this method to the star-planet system, NGTS-10 -- NGTS-10 b, gives $Q' \gtrsim 10^8$, leading to an tight upper bound on the tidal torque. Since this cannot be explained by previous theoretical predictions for non-synchronized star-planet systems, our result requires mechanisms that suppress the tidal interaction in such systems.</description>
