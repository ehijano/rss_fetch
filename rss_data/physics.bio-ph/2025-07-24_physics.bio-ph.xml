      <title>Insights into experimental evaluation of the non-fourier heat transfer model in biological tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of heat transfer mechanisms in biological tissues is essential for the advancement of thermal therapeutic techniques and the development of accurate bioheat transfer models. Conventional models often fail to capture the inherently complex thermal behavior of biological media, necessitating more sophisticated approaches for experimental validation and parameter extraction. In this study, the Two-Dimensional Three-Phase Lag (TPL) heat transfer model, implemented via the finite difference method (FDM), was employed to extract key phase lag parameters characterizing heat conduction in bovine skin tissue. Experimental measurements were obtained using a 450 nm laser source and two non-contact infrared sensors. The influence of four critical parameters was systematically investigated: heat flux phase lag ($\tau_{q}$), temperature gradient phase lag ($\tau_{\theta}$), thermal displacement coefficient ($k^*$), and thermal displacement phase lag ($\tau_{v}$). A carefully designed experimental protocol was used to assess each parameter independently. The results revealed that the extracted phase lag values were substantially lower than those previously reported in the literature. This highlights the importance of high-precision measurements and the need to isolate each parameter during analysis. These findings contribute to the refinement of bioheat transfer models and hold potential for improving the efficacy and safety of clinical thermal therapies.</description>

      <title>From shallow to full wrapping: geometry and deformability dictate lipid vesicle internalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deformability of vesicles critically influences their engulfment by lipid membranes, a process central to endocytosis, viral entry, drug delivery, and intercellular transport. While theoretical models have long predicted this influence, direct experimental validation has remained elusive. Here, we combine experiments with continuum simulations to quantify how vesicle deformability affects the engulfment of small giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) by larger GUVs under depletion-induced adhesion. Using 3D confocal reconstructions, we extract vesicle shape, curvature, wrapping fraction, and the bendo-capillary length, a characteristic length scale that balances membrane bending and adhesion forces. We find that when vesicle size exceeds this length scale, engulfment is primarily governed by geometry. In contrast, when vesicle size is comparable to this scale, deformability strongly affects the transition between shallow, deep, and fully wrapped states, leading to suppression of full engulfment of vesicles. These findings connect theoretical predictions with direct measurements and offer a unified framework for understanding vesicle-mediated uptake across both synthetic and biological systems, including viral entry, synthetic cell design, drug delivery, and nanoparticle internalization.</description>

      <title>Molecular Mechanisms Underlying the Effects of Urea and the Structural Dynamics of Bovine Serum Albumin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The disruption of protein structures by denaturants like urea is well studied, though its molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we investigated how urea affects the structural stability of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) at concentrations from 0 M to 5 M. Our results reveal that urea induces a dehydration/rehydration cycle, characterized by displacement and partial replacement of water molecules in BSAs hydration shell. At low concentrations, urea reduces protein/water hydrogen bonds while enhancing protein-urea interactions. At higher concentrations, urea aggregation limits these interactions, promoting rehydration and changes in tertiary structure, while secondary structure remains largely intact. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of protein denaturation and stability by urea.</description>

      <title>RAPID-Net: Accurate Pocket Identification for Binding-Site-Agnostic Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate identification of druggable pockets and their features is essential for structure-based drug design and effective downstream docking. Here, we present RAPID-Net, a deep learning-based algorithm designed for the accurate prediction of binding pockets and seamless integration with docking pipelines. On the PoseBusters benchmark, RAPID-Net-guided AutoDock Vina achieves 54.9% of Top-1 poses with RMSD &lt; 2 A and satisfying the PoseBusters chemical-validity criterion, compared to 49.1% for DiffBindFR. On the most challenging time split of PoseBusters aiming to assess generalization ability (structures submitted after September 30, 2021), RAPID-Net-guided AutoDock Vina achieves 53.1% of Top-1 poses with RMSD &lt; 2 A and PB-valid, versus 59.5% for AlphaFold 3. Notably, in 92.2% of cases, RAPID-Net-guided Vina samples at least one pose with RMSD &lt; 2 A (regardless of its rank), indicating that pose ranking, rather than sampling, is the primary accuracy bottleneck. The lightweight inference, scalability, and competitive accuracy of RAPID-Net position it as a viable option for large-scale virtual screening campaigns. Across diverse benchmark datasets, RAPID-Net outperforms other pocket prediction tools, including PUResNet and Kalasanty, in both docking accuracy and pocket-ligand intersection rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of RAPID-Net to accelerate the development of novel therapeutics by highlighting its performance on pharmacologically relevant targets. RAPID-Net accurately identifies distal functional sites, offering new opportunities for allosteric inhibitor design. In the case of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2, RAPID-Net uncovers a wider array of potential binding pockets than existing predictors, which typically annotate only the orthosteric pocket and overlook secondary cavities.</description>
