      <title>Implementation of cosmological bounce inflation with Nojiri-Odintsov generalized holographic dark fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current work reports a study on bounce cosmology with a highly generalized holographic dark fluid inspired by S. Nojiri and S. D. Odintsov, 2017, European Physical Journal C, 77, pp.1-8. The holographic dark fluid that is mostly used for late-time acceleration has been implemented to reconstruct towards realisation of cosmological bounce. We first used the most generalized Nojiri-Odintsov(NO) cutoff to implement the holographic dark fluid. Accordingly, we have reconstructed this dark fluid via some solutions of scale factors. With those solutions, we have explored the evolution of different cosmological parameters. We have examined the effects of each reconstructed parameter in the context of the realization of the cosmic bounce. Next, we use the analytical inferences of the scalar spectral index, tensor-to-scalar ratio, and slow-roll characteristics of the model to study a bounce inflationary scenario. Since inflation is usually associated with the existence of scalar fields, we looked at a possible relationship between NO generalized holographic dark energy and scalar field models. Plotting the evolution of the potential that results from the scalar fields against time. Finally, we investigated the GSL of thermodynamics in the pre-and post-bounce scenarios.</description>

      <title>Einstein-AdS gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics, magnetic black holes, thermodynamics in an extended phase space and Joule--Thomson expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Einstein's gravity with negative cosmological constant coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics proposed earlier. The metric and mass functions and corrections to the Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m solution are obtained. Black hole solutions can have one or two horizons. Thermodynamics and phase transitions of magnetically charged black holes in Anti-de Sitter spacetime are investigated. The first law of black hole thermodynamics is formulated and the generalized Smarr relation is proofed. By calculating the Gibbs free energy and heat capacity we study the black hole stability. Zero-order (reentrant), first-order, and second-order phase transitions are analysed. The Joule--Thomson expansion is considered showing the cooling and heating phase transitions. It was shown that the principles of causality and unitarity are satisfied in the model under consideration.</description>

      <title>Crystalline Vacuum as the Background of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multiscale expansion procedure reveals a crystalline vacuum state arising as a result of resonant interactions among weak Planck-scale waves on spinor and cospinor manifolds. Quarks are presented as elastic modulations of the vacuum crystal. The complementing modes are identified with colors, and distinctions between flavors are attributed to asymmetries of the vacuum lattice. Repercussion of the theory include insights into the nature of quantum uncertainty and dark matter and energy.</description>
