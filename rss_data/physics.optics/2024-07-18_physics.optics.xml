      <title>Understanding the temperature conditions for controlled splicing between silica and fluoride fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the efficacy of thermal splicing conditions between silica and zirconium-fluoride fibers, focusing on achieving mechanical strength between the two fibers. A comprehensive characterization of the thermal profile in the hot zone of the filament splicer was conducted using a fiber Bragg grating, providing valuable insights into its stability and overall performance. Results demonstrate mechanically strong joints and suggest a very narrow temperature window to achieve strong connection between the two materials. Moreover, we characterize the surface composition of the ZrF4 fiber using energy dispersive spectroscopy following splicing at ideal temperatures, as well as at higher and lower temperatures. This work paves the way towards future implementation of silica and fluoride fibers splicing using alternative splicing solutions such as CO2 laser system while raising interesting facts for further studies in the specific field.</description>

      <title>Nanophotonic-Enhanced Thermal Circular Dichroism for Chiral Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular Dichroism (CD) can distinguish the handedness of chiral molecules. However, it is typically very weak due to vanishing absorption at low molecular concentrations. Here, we suggest Thermal Circular Dichroism (TCD) for chiral detection, leveraging the temperature difference in the chiral sample when subjected to right and left-circularly polarized excitations. The TCD combines the enantiospecificity of circular dichroism with the higher sensitivity of thermal measurements, while introducing new opportunities in the thermal domain that can be synergistically combined with optical approaches. We propose a theoretical framework to understand the TCD of individual and arrays of resonators covered by chiral molecules. To enhance the weak TCD of chiral samples, we first use individual dielectric Mie resonators and identify chirality transfer and self-heating as the underlying mechanisms giving rise to the differential temperature. However, inherent limitations imposed by the materials and geometries of such resonators make it challenging to surpass a certain level in enhancements. To overcome this, we suggest nonlocal thermal and electromagnetic interactions in arrays. We predict that a combination of chirality transfer to Mie resonators, collective thermal effects, and optical lattice resonance could, in principle, offer more than 4 orders of magnitude enhancement in TCD. Our thermonanophotonic-based approach thus establishes key concepts for ultrasensitive chiral detection.</description>

      <title>Emerging Quadrature Lattices of Kerr Combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quadrature lattice is a coupled array of squeezed vacuum field quadratures that offers new avenues in shaping the quantum properties of multimode light [1-3]. Such lattices are described within the framework of non-Hermitian, non-dissipative physics and exhibit intriguing lattice phenomena such as lattice exceptional points, edge-states, entanglement and non-Hermitian skin effect, offering fundamentally new methods for controlling quantum fluctuations [1, 4]. Nonlinear resonators are suitable for studying multimode pair-generation processes and squeezing which are non-dissipative in \chi(2) and \chi(3) materials [5-12], but observing non-Hermitian lattice phenomena in photonic quadrature lattices was not achieved. Remarkably, in dissipative Kerr microcombs [13], which have revolutionized photonic technology, such lattices emerge and govern the quantum noise that leads to comb formation. Thus, they offer a unique opportunity to realize quadrature lattices, and to study and manipulate multimode quantum noise which is essential for any quantum technology. Here, we experimentally study non-Hermitian lattice effects in photonic quadrature lattices for the first time. Our photonic quadrature lattices emerge at Kerr microcomb transitions, allowing us to observe fundamental connections between dispersion symmetry, frequency-dependent squeezed supermodes, and non-Hermitian lattice physics in an integrated setup. Our work unifies two major fields, quantum non-Hermitian physics and Kerr combs, and opens the door to utilizing dissipative Kerr combs to experimentally explore rich non-Hermitian physics in the quantum regime, engineer quantum light, and develop new tools to study the quantum noise and formation of Kerr combs.</description>

      <title>High-energy tunable ultraviolet pulses generated by optical leaky wave in filamentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraviolet pulses could open up new opportunities for the study of strong-field physics and ultrafast science. However, the existing methods for generating ultra-violet pulses face difficulties in fulfilling the twofold requirements of high energy and wavelength tunability simultaneously. Here, we theoretically demonstrate the generation of high-energy and wavelength tunable ultraviolet pulses in preformed air-plasma channels via the leaky wave emission. The output ultraviolet pulse has a tunable wavelength ranging from 250 nm to 430 nm and an energy level up to sub-mJ. An octave-spanning ultraviolet supercontinuum with a flatness better than 3 dB can also be obtained via longitudinally modulated dispersion. Such a high-energy tunable ultraviolet light source may provide promising opportunities for characterization of ultrafast phenomena such as molecular breakup, and also an important driving source for the generation of high-energy attosecond pulses.</description>

      <title>Excitation and manipulation of super cavity solitons in multi-stable passive Kerr resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the theoretical analysis as well as the numerical simulations about the nonlinear dynamics of cavity solitons in a passive Kerr resonator operating in the multistable regime under the condition of a sufficiently strong pump. In this regime, the adjacent tilted cavity resonances might overlap, thus leading to the co-existence of combinatory states of temporal cavity solitons and the extended modulation instability patterns. Very interestingly, the cavity in the regime of multistablity may sustain distinct families of cavity solitons, vividly termed as super cavity solitons with much higher intensity and broader spectra if compared with those in the conventional bi-stable regime. The description of such complex cavity dynamics in the multstable regime requires either the infinite-dimensional Ikeda map, or the derived mean-field coupled Lugiato-Lefever equations by involving the contributing cavity resonances. With the latter model, for the first time, we revealed the existence of different orders of super cavity solitons, whose stationary solutions were obtained by using the Newton-Raphson algorithm. Along this line, with the continuation calculation, we have plotted the Hopf / saddle-node bifurcation curves, thus identifying the existing map of the stable and breathing (super) cavity solitons. With this defined parameter space, we have proposed an efficient method to excite and switch the super cavity solitons by adding an appropriate intensity (or phase) perturbation on the pump. Such deterministic cavity soliton manipulation technique is demonstrated to underpin the multi-level coding, which may enable the large capacity all-optical buffering based on the passive fiber ring cavities.</description>

      <title>Hybridization of terahertz phonons and magnons in disparate and spatially-separated material specimens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between light and matter in condensed matter excitations and electromagnetic resonators serves as a rich playground for fundamental research and lies at the core of photonic and quantum technologies. Herein, we present comprehensive experimental and theoretical studies of the photon-mediated hybridization of magnons and phonons in the terahertz (THz) range. We demonstrate the intriguing concept of composite states formed by distinct electric and magnetic quasiparticles strongly coupled to the same optical cavity modes. Specifically, we explore magnons excited in a slab of an antiferromagnetic crystal and phonons excited in a distinct specimen of an insulating material. The crystal slabs form an optical cavity with Fabry-P\'erot oscillations in the THz range. We demonstrate hybridized phonon-magnon polariton modes and their tunability by adjusting the distance between the slabs, showing that hybridization persists even at separations up to several millimeters. The experimental results are interpreted using both classical and quantum electrodynamical models. The quantum description allows us to quantify the degree of hybridization that is linked to a topological behavior of the electric field phasor, in agreement with the classical electrodynamics expectations. Importantly, the presented results refer to temperature conditions and cavities of millimeter size, paving the way for engineering realistic, frequency-tunable THz devices through the hybridization of electric (phononics) and magnetic (spintronics) elementary excitations of matter.</description>

      <title>0.7 MW Yb:YAG pumped degenerate optical parametric oscillator at 2.06 {\mu}m</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency comb and field-resolved broadband absorption spectroscopy are promising techniques for rapid, precise, and sensitive detection of short-lived atmospheric pollutants on-site. Enhancing detection sensitivity in absorption spectroscopy hinges on bright sources that cover molecular resonances and fast signal modulation techniques to implement lock-in detection schemes efficiently. Yb:YAG thin-disk lasers, combined with optical parametric oscillators (OPO), present a compelling solution to fulfill these requirements. In this work, we report on a bright OPO pumped by a Yb:YAG thin-disk Kerr-lens mode-locked oscillator delivering 2.8 W, 114 fs pulses at 2.06 {\mu}m with an averaged energy of 90 nJ. The OPO cavity operates at 30.9 MHz pulse repetition rates, the second harmonic of the pump cavity, allowing for broadband, efficient, and dispersion-free modulation of the OPO output pulses at 15.45 MHz rate. With 13% optical-to-optical conversion efficiency and a high-frequency intra-cavity modulation, this scalable scheme holds promise to advance the detection sensitivity and frontiers of field-resolved spectroscopic techniques.</description>

      <title>Double Etch Method for the Fabrication of Nanophotonic Devices from Van der Waals Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of van der Waals (vdW) materials into photonic devices has laid out a foundation for many new quantum and optoelectronic applications. Despite tremendous progress in the nanofabrication of photonic building blocks from vdW crystals, there are still limitations, specifically with large-area devices and masking. Here, we focus on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as a vdW material and present a double etch method that overcomes problems associated with methods that employ metallic films and resist-based films for masking. Efficacy of the developed protocol is demonstrated by designing and fabricating a set of functional photonic components including waveguides, ring resonators and photonic crystal cavities. The functionality of the fabricated structures is demonstrated through optical characterization over several key spectral ranges. These include the near-infrared and blue ranges, where the hBN boron vacancy (VB-) spin defects and the coherent B center quantum emitters emit, respectively. The double etch method enables fabrication of high-quality factor optical cavities and constitutes a promising pathway toward on-chip integration of vdW materials.</description>

      <title>MIR laser CEP estimation using machine learning concepts in bulk high harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) is of paramount importance for experiments involving few cycle intense laser fields. Common measurement techniques include f-2f interferometry or stereo-ATI setups. These approaches are adequate, but are challenging to implement on demand, at different locations as additional metrology tools, in intense few cycle laser-matter interaction experiments, such as those prevalent in sophisticated user beamlines. In addition there are inherent difficulties for CEP measured at non-conventional laser wavelengths (like e.g. mid infrared) and measurements above 10 kHz laser repetition rates, on single shot basis. Here we demonstrate both by simulations and by experiments a machine learning (ML) driven method for CEP estimation in the mid infrared, which is readily generalizable for any laser wavelength and possibly up to MHz repetition rates. The concept relies on the observation of the spectrum of high harmonic generation (HHG) in bulk material and the use of ML techniques to estimate the CEP of the laser. Once the ML model is trained, the method provides a way for cheap and compact real-time CEP tagging. This technique can complement the otherwise sophisticated monitoring of CEP, and is able to capture the complex correlation between the CEP and the observable HHG spectra.</description>

      <title>High-contrast imaging at first-light of the GMT: the wavefront sensing and control architecture of GMagAO-X</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Giant Magellan Adaptive Optics eXtreme (GMagAO-X) instrument is a first-light high-contrast imaging instrument for the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT). GMagAO-X's broad wavelength range and the large 25-meter aperture of the GMT creates new challenges: control of all 21.000 actuators; phasing GMT's segmented primary mirror to nm levels; active control of atmospheric dispersion to sub milli-arcsecond residuals; no chromatic pupil shear to minimize chromatic compensation errors; integrated focal plane wavefront sensing and control (WFSC). GMagAO-X will have simultaneous visible and infra-red WFS channels to control the 21.000 actuator DM. The infra-red arm will be flexible by incorporating switchable sensors such as the pyramid or Zernike WFS. One innovation that we developed for GMagAO-X is the Holographic Dispersed Fringe Sensor that measures differential piston. We have also developed several integrated coronagraphic wavefront sensors to control non-common path aberrations exactly where we need to sense them. We will discuss the key components of the WFSC strategies for GMagAO-X that address the challenges posed by the first high-contrast imaging system on the ELTs.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low threshold chaos in cavity magnomechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity magnomechanics using mechanical degrees of freedom in ferromagnetic crystals provides a powerful platform for observing many interesting classical and quantum nonlinear phenomena in the emerging field of magnon spintronics. However, to date, the generation and control of chaotic motion in a cavity magnomechanical system remain an outstanding challenge due to the inherently weak nonlinear interaction of magnons. Here, we present an efficient mechanism for achieving magnomechanical chaos, in which the magnomechanical system is coherently driven by a two-tone microwave field consisting of a pump field and a probe field. Numerical simulations show that the relative phase of the two input fields plays an important role in controlling the appearance of chaotic motion and, more importantly, the threshold power of chaos is reduced by 6 orders of magnitude from watts to microwatts. In addition to providing insight into magnonics nonlinearity, cavity magnomechanical chaos will always be of interest because of its significance both in fundamental physics and potential applications ranging from ultra-low threshold chaotic motion to chaos-based secret information processing.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Misalignment Tolerances for Implicit Electric Field Conjugation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High contrast imaging of extrasolar planets and circumstellar disks requires extreme wavefront stability. Such stability can be achieved with active wavefront control (WFC). The next generation of ground- and space-based telescopes will require a robust form of WFC in order to image planets at small inner working angles and extreme flux ratios with respect to the host star. WFC algorithms such as implicit Electric Field Conjugation (iEFC) reduce stellar leakage by minimizing the electric field within a given region of an image, creating a dark hole. iEFC utilizes an empirical approach to sense and remove speckles in the focal plane. While iEFC is empirically calibrated and can handle optical model errors, there are still model assumptions made during the calibration. The performance of iEFC will degrade if the system changes due to slow, optomechanical drifts. In this work, we assess the iEFC performance impacts of pupil misalignments on the deformable mirror and focal plane misalignments on the detector. We base our analysis on the MagAO-X instrument, an extreme AO system installed on the Magellan-Clay telescope, to develop iEFC misalignment tolerancing requirements for both ground- and space-based missions. We present end-to-end physical optics simulations of the MagAO-X instrument, demonstrating iEFC alignment tolerance.</description>

      <title>Can dissipation induce a transition between many-body localized and thermal states?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The many-body mobility edge (MBME) in energy, which separates thermal states from many-body localization (MBL) states, is a critical yet controversial concept in many-body systems. Here we examine the quasiperiodic $t_1-t_2$ model that features a mobility edge. With the addition of nearest-neighbor interactions, we demonstrate the potential existence of a MBME. Then we investigate the impact of a type of bond dissipation on the many-body system by calculating the steady-state density matrix and analyzing the transport behavior, and demonstrate that dissipation can cause the system to predominantly occupy either the thermal region or the MBL region, irrespective of the initial state. Finally, we discuss the effects of increasing system size. Our results indicate that dissipation can induce transitions between thermal and MBL states, providing a new approach for experimentally determining the existence of the MBME.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately measuring the translations of objects between images is essential in many fields, including biology, medicine, chemistry, and physics. One important application is tracking one or more particles by measuring their apparent displacements in a series of images. Popular methods, such as the center-of-mass, often require idealized scenarios to reach the shot-noise limit of particle tracking and are, therefore, not generally applicable to multiple image types. More general methods, like maximum likelihood estimation, reliably approach the shot-noise limit, but are too computationally intense for use in real-time applications. These limitations are significant, as real-time, shot-noise-limited particle tracking is of paramount importance for feedback control systems. To fill this gap, we introduce a new cross-correlation-based algorithm that approaches shot-noise-limited displacement detection and a GPU-based implementation for real-time image analysis of a single particle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave propagation through random continuous media remains an important fundamental problem with applications ranging from remote sensing to quantum communication. Typically, such media are characterized by smooth refractive index fluctuations whose impact on the wave can be captured by the stochastic parabolic equation. The latter can be solved numerically by means of a split-step method, which replaces the continuous medium with a number of discrete phase screens derived from the medium's power spectrum. We introduce and benchmark highly accurate and efficient hybrid phase screens for arbitrary power spectra which are based on the combination of Zernike and Fourier phase screens.</description>

      <title>Versatile, fast and accurate frequency excursions with a semiconductor laser</title>

Abstract: Achieving accurate arbitrary frequency excursions with a laser can be quite a technical challenge, especially when steep slopes (GHz/$\mu$s) are required, due to both deterministic and stochastic frequency fluctuations. In this work we present a multi-stage correction combining four techniques: pre-distorsion of the laser modulation, iterative correction, opto-electronic feedback loop and feed-forward correction. This combination allows not only to compensate for the non-instantaneous response of the laser to an input modulation, but also to correct in real time the stochastic frequency fluctuations. We implement this multi-stage architecture on a commercial DBR laser and verify its efficiency, first with monochromatic operation and second with highly demanding frequency excursions. We demonstrate that our multi-stage correction not only enables a strong reduction of the laser linewidth, but also allows steep frequency excursions with a relative RMS frequency error well below $1$%, and a laser spectral purity consistently better than $100$~kHz even in the midst of GHz-scale frequency excursions.</description>

      <title>Floquet systems with continuous dynamical symmetries: characterization, time-dependent Noether charge, and solvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02143</link>

Abstract: We study quantum Floquet (periodically-driven) systems having continuous dynamical symmetry (CDS) consisting of a time translation and a unitary transformation on the Hilbert space. Unlike the discrete ones, the CDS strongly constrains the possible Hamiltonians $H(t)$ and allows us to obtain all the Floquet states by solving a finite-dimensional eigenvalue problem. Besides, Noether's theorem leads to a time-dependent conservation charge, whose expectation value is time-independent throughout evolution. We exemplify these consequences of CDS in the seminal Rabi model, an effective model of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamonds without strain terms, and Heisenberg spin models in rotating fields. Our results provide a systematic way of solving for Floquet states and explain how they avoid hybridization in quasienergy diagrams.</description>

      <title>Telling different unravelings apart via nonlinear quantum-trajectory averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03452v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation (ME) governs the density matrix of open quantum systems (OQSs). When an OQS is subjected to weak continuous measurement, its state evolves as a stochastic quantum trajectory, whose statistical average solves the ME. The ensemble of such trajectories is termed an unraveling of the ME. We propose a method to operationally distinguish unravelings produced by the same ME in different measurement scenarios, using nonlinear averages of observables over trajectories. We apply the method to the paradigmatic quantum nonlinear system of resonance fluorescence in a two-level atom. We compare the Poisson-type unraveling, induced by direct detection of photons scattered from the two-level emitter, and the Wiener-type unraveling, induced by phase-sensitive detection of the emitted field. We show that a quantum-trajectory-averaged variance is able to distinguish these measurement scenarios. We evaluate the performance of the method, which can be readily extended to more complex OQSs, under a range of realistic experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Four no-go theorems on the existence of spin and orbital angular momentum of massless bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past thirty years there has been an ever-increasing interest in the so-called orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, driven in large part by its diverse range of applications, from new imaging techniques to optical tweezers. However, there are fundamental theoretical issues with splitting the photon angular momentum operator into spin (SAM) and orbital angular momentum parts. While such an SAM-OAM splitting is simple and unambiguous for massive particles, there are many different proposed splittings for massless photons and no consensus about which is correct. Moreover, it has been explicitly shown that most of the proposed SAM and OAM operators do not satisfy the defining commutation relations of angular momentum operators and are thus not legitimate splittings. Here we prove that it is generally impossible to split the total angular momentum operator of massless bosons, like photons and gravitons, into spin and orbital parts. We show that the obstruction to such a splitting can be understood as both geometric and topological. We prove two additional no-go theorems which generalize this result, in particular showing that there are no SAM-OAM splittings even if (1) the SAM operator is allowed to represent non-internal symmetries or (2) if one allows the SAM and OAM operators to generate non-$\mathrm{SO}(3)$ symmetries. We show how gauge redundant descriptions of massless particles can suggest SAM-OAM splittings which are invalid once gauge-invariance is imposed.</description>
