      <title>Approximations in Besov Spaces and Jump Detection of Besov Functions with Bounded Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a proof that functions belonging to Besov spaces $B^{r}_{q,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^N,\mathbb{R}^d)$, $q\in [1,\infty)$, $r\in(0,1)$, satisfy the following formula under a certain condition:
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:main result in abstract} \lim_{{\epsilon}\to 0^+}\frac{1}{|\ln{\epsilon}|}\left[u_{\epsilon}\right]^q_{W^{r,q}(\mathbb{R}^N,\mathbb{R}^d)}=N\lim_{{\epsilon}\to 0^+}\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}\frac{1}{{\epsilon}^N}\int_{B_{\epsilon}(x)}\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^q}{|x-y|^{rq}}dydx. \end{equation} Here, $\left[\cdot\right]_{W^{r,q}}$ represents the Gagliardo seminorm, and $u_{\epsilon}$ denotes the convolution of $u$ with a mollifier $\eta_{(\epsilon)}(x):=\frac{1}{\epsilon^N}\eta\left(\frac{x}{\epsilon}\right)$, $\eta\in W^{1,1}(\mathbb{R}^N),\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}\eta(z)dz=1$. Furthermore, we prove that every function $u$ in $BV(\mathbb{R}^N,\mathbb{R}^d)\cap B^{1/p}_{p,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^N,\mathbb{R}^d),p\in(1,\infty),$ satisfies \begin{multline} \lim_{\epsilon\to 0^+}\frac{1}{|\ln{\epsilon}|}\left[u_{\epsilon}\right]^q_{W^{1/q,q}(\mathbb{R}^N,\mathbb{R}^d)}=N\lim_{{\epsilon}\to 0^+}\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}\frac{1}{{\epsilon}^N}\int_{B_{\epsilon}(x)}\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^q}{|x-y|}dydx =\left(\int_{S^{N-1}}|z_1|~d\mathcal{H}^{N-1}(z)\right)\int_{\mathcal{J}_u} \Big|u^+(x)-u^-(x)\Big|^q d\mathcal{H}^{N-1}(x), \end{multline} for every $1&lt;q&lt;p$. Here $u^+,u^-$ are the one-sided approximate limits of $u$ along the jump set $\mathcal{J}_u$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic order of the quantization error for a class of self-similar measures with overlaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N$ be a set of equi-contractive similitudes on $\mathbb{R}^1$ satisfying the finite-type condition. We study the asymptotic quantization error for self-similar measures $\mu$ associated with $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N$ and a positive probability vector. With a verifiable assumption, we prove that the upper and lower quantization coefficient for $\mu$ are both bounded away from zero and infinity. This can be regarded as an extension of Graf and Luschgy's result on self-similar measures with the open set condition. Our result is applicable to a significant class of self-similar measures with overlaps, including Erd\"{o}s measure, the $3$-fold convolution of the classical Cantor measure and the self-similar measures on some $\lambda$-Cantor sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a nonempty finite subset of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^k$ $(k\ge 2)$. We prove that if a function $f\colon \mathbb{R}^k\to \mathbb{C}$ is such that the sum of $f$ on every congruent copy of $K$ is zero, then $f$ vanishes everywhere. In fact, a stronger, weighted version is proved. As a corollary we find that every finite subset $K$ of $\mathbb{R}^k$ having at least two elements is a Jackson set; that is, no subset of $\mathbb{R}^k$ intersects every congruent copy of $K$ in exactly one point.</description>

      <title>The truncated moment problem on reducible cubic curves I: Parabolic and Circular type relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the bivariate truncated moment problem (TMP) of degree $2k$ on reducible cubic curves. First we show that every such TMP is equivalent after applying an affine linear transformation to one of 8 canonical forms of the curve. The case of the union of three parallel lines was solved in 2022 by the second author, while the degree 6 cases in 2017 by the first author. Second we characterize in terms of concrete numerical conditions the existence of the solution to the TMP on two of the remaining cases concretely, i.e., a union of a line and a circle $y(ay+x^2+y^2)=0, a\in \mathbb{R}\setminus \{0\}$, and a union of a line and a parabola $y(x-y^2)=0$. In both cases we also determine the number of atoms in a minimal representing measure.</description>

      <title>Squares of symmetric operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the approach proposed in [5] , in an infinite-dimensional separable complex Hilbert space we give abstract constructions of families $\{{\mathcal T}_z\}_{{\rm Im\,} z&gt;0}$ of closed densely defined symmetric operators with the properties: (I) the domain of ${\mathcal T}_z^2$ is a core of ${\mathcal T}_z$, (II) the domain of ${\mathcal T}_z^2$ is dense but note a core of ${\mathcal T}_z$, (III) the domain of ${\mathcal T}_z^2$ is nontrivial but non-dense. For this purpose a class of maximal dissipative operators is defined and studied. The case ${\rm dom\,} {\mathcal T}_z^2=\{0\}$ has been considered in [5].
  Given a densely defined closed symmetric operator $S$, in terms of the intersection of the domain of $S$ with ${\rm ran\,} (S-\lambda I)$ and the projection of the domain of the adjoint $S^*$ on ${\rm ran\,} (S-\lambda I)$, $\lambda\in{\mathbb C}\setminus{\mathbb R}$, necessary and sufficient conditions for the cases (I)--(III) related to the domain of $S^2$, are obtained.</description>

      <title>Limited type subsets of locally convex spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $1\leq p\leq q\leq\infty.$ Being motivated by the classical notions of limited, $p$-limited and coarse $p$-limited subsets of a Banach space, we introduce and study $(p,q)$-limited subsets and their equicontinuous versions and coarse $p$-limited subsets of an arbitrary locally convex space $E$. Operator characterizations of these classes are given. We compare these classes with the classes of bounded, (pre)compact, weakly (pre)compact and relatively weakly sequentially (pre)compact sets. If $E$ is a Banach space, we show that the class of coarse $1$-limited subsets of $E$ coincides with the class of $(1,\infty)$-limited sets, and if $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, then the class of coarse $p$-limited sets in $E$ coincides with the class of $p$-$(V^\ast)$ sets of Pe{\l}czy\'{n}ski. We also generalize a known theorem of Grothendieck.</description>

      <title>Factorization of anti-linear and $C$-normal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A conjugation $C$ is an anti-linear isometric involution on a complex Hilbert space $\clh$, and $T\in \clb(\clh)$ is conjugate normal if $T^*T = CTT^*C$ holds for some conjugation (C). In this paper, we provide a factorization and range inclusion theorem for anti-linear operators, and consequently, establish the polar decomposition for anti-linear operators by applying the Douglas theorem on majorization of Hilbert space operators. Moreover, we present a factorization of $C$-normal operators based on the polar decomposition. Lastly, we study the Cartesian decomposition of conjugate normal operators, thereby expanding the results in [18].</description>

      <title>Curvature and Other Local Inequalities in Markov Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the approach of Ivanisvili and Volberg towards functional inequalities for probability measures with strictly convex potentials, we investigate the relationship between curvature bounds in the sense of Bakry-Emery and local functional inequalities. We will show that not only is the earlier approach for strictly convex potentials extendable to Markov semigroups and simplified through use of the $\Gamma$-calculus, providing a consolidating machinery for obtaining functional inequalities new and old in this general setting, but that a converse also holds. Local inequalities obtained are proven equivalent to Bakry-Emery curvature. Moreover we will develop this technique for metric measure spaces satisfying the RCD condition, providing a unified approach to functional and isoperimetric inequalities in non-smooth spaces with a synthetic Ricci curvature bound. Finally, we are interested in commutation properties for semi-group operators on $\mathbb{R}^n$ in the absence of positive curvature, based on a local eigenvalue criteria.</description>

      <title>Equipment Health Assessment: Time Series Analysis for Wind Turbine Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we leverage SCADA data from diverse wind turbines to predict power output, employing advanced time series methods, specifically Functional Neural Networks (FNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. A key innovation lies in the ensemble of FNN and LSTM models, capitalizing on their collective learning. This ensemble approach outperforms individual models, ensuring stable and accurate power output predictions. Additionally, machine learning techniques are applied to detect wind turbine performance deterioration, enabling proactive maintenance strategies and health assessment. Crucially, our analysis reveals the uniqueness of each wind turbine, necessitating tailored models for optimal predictions. These insight underscores the importance of providing automatized customization for different turbines to keep human modeling effort low. Importantly, the methodologies developed in this analysis are not limited to wind turbines; they can be extended to predict and optimize performance in various machinery, highlighting the versatility and applicability of our research across diverse industrial contexts.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space-Valued LQG Mean Field Games: An Infinite-Dimensional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of Hilbert space-valued Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) mean field games (MFGs), generalizing the classic LQG mean field game theory to scenarios where the state equations are driven by infinite-dimensional stochastic equations. In this framework, state and control processes take values in separable Hilbert spaces. Moreover, the state equations involve infinite dimensional noises, namely $Q$-Wiener processes. All agents are coupled through the average state of the population appearing in their linear dynamics and quadratic cost functional. In addition, the diffusion coefficient of each agent involves the state, control, and the average state processes. We first study the well-posedness of a system of coupled infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations, which forms the foundation of MFGs in Hilbert spaces. Next, we develop the Nash Certainty Equivalence principle and obtain a unique Nash equilibrium for the limiting Hilbert space-valued MFG. Finally, we establish the $\epsilon$-Nash property for the finite-player game in Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Locally adjointable operators on Hilbert $C^*$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the theory of Hilbert $C^*$-modules over a $C^*$-algebra $A$ (in contrast with the theory of Hilbert spaces) not each bounded operator ($A$-homomorphism) admits an adjoint. The interplay between the sets of adjointable and non-adjointable operators plays a very important role in the theory. We study an intermediate notion of locally adjointable operator $F:M \to N$, i.e. such an operator that $F\circ g$ is adjointable for any adjointable $g: A \to M$. We have introduced this notion recently and it has demonstrated its usefulness in the context of theory of uniform structures on Hilbert $C^*$-modules. In the present paper we obtain an explicit description of locally adjointable operators in important cases.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for particle gradient descent, and extensions of the log-Sobolev and Talagrand inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove non-asymptotic error bounds for particle gradient descent (PGD)~(Kuntz et al., 2023), a recently introduced algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of large latent variable models obtained by discretizing a gradient flow of the free energy. We begin by showing that, for models satisfying a condition generalizing both the log-Sobolev and the Polyak--{\L}ojasiewicz inequalities (LSI and P{\L}I, respectively), the flow converges exponentially fast to the set of minimizers of the free energy. We achieve this by extending a result well-known in the optimal transport literature (that the LSI implies the Talagrand inequality) and its counterpart in the optimization literature (that the P{\L}I implies the so-called quadratic growth condition), and applying it to our new setting. We also generalize the Bakry--\'Emery Theorem and show that the LSI/P{\L}I generalization holds for models with strongly concave log-likelihoods. For such models, we further control PGD's discretization error, obtaining non-asymptotic error bounds. While we are motivated by the study of PGD, we believe that the inequalities and results we extend may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The toral contractions and $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-contractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.08380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider distinguished varieties in the bidisc $\mathbb D^2$ and the symmetrized bidisc $\mathbb{G}_2$. A commuting pair of Hilbert space operators $(S,P)$ for which $\Gamma=\overline{\mathbb{G}}_2$ is a spectral set is called a \textit{$\Gamma$-contraction}. A commuting pair of contractions $(T_1,T_2)$ is said to be \textit{toral} if there is a toral polynomial $p\in \mathbb C[z_1,z_2]$ such that $p(T_1,T_2)=0$. Similarly, a $\Gamma$-contraction $(S,P)$ is called $\Gamma$-\textit{distinguished} if $(S,P)$ is annihilated by a $\Gamma$-distinguished polynomial in $\mathbb C[z_1,z_2]$. The main results af this article are the following: we find a necessary and sufficient condition such that a toral pair of contractions dilates to a toral pair of isometries. Also, we characterize all $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-contractions that admit $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-isometric dilations. We determine the distinguished boundary of a distinguished variety in $\mathbb D^2$ and $\mathbb G_2$. Then we prove that a pair of commuting contractions $(T_1,T_2)$ (or a $\Gamma$-contraction $(S,P)$) dilates to a toral pair of isometries (or a $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-isometry) if and only if there is a toral polynomial (or $\Gamma$-distinguished polynomial) $p\in \mathbb C[z_1,z_2]$ such that $Z(p) \cap \overline{\mathbb D}^2$ (or $Z(p) \cap \overline{\mathbb G}_2$) is a complete spectral set for $(T_1,T_2)$ (or $(S,P)$). We provide several examples at places to show the contrasts between the theory of toral contractions and $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-contractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06723v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by some recent results, but also referring to recognized classics, we compute the essential norm and the weak essential norm of multiplication operators acting between two distinct K{\" o}the spaces both defined over the same $\sigma$-finite measure space. A by-product of the technology we have developed here are some applications to Banach sequence spaces related to decreasing functions and to Banach spaces of analytic functions on the unit disc, in particular, Hardy spaces. We will close our work with some specific examples illustrating the previously obtained results including Musielak--Orlicz sequence spaces (in particular, Nakano sequence spaces) as well as Lorentz and Marcinkiewicz sequence spaces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the projection constant of the space of operators on $n$-dimensional Hilbert spaces, with the trace norm, $\mathcal S_1(n)$. We show an integral formula for the projection constant of $\mathcal S_1(n)$; namely $ \boldsymbol{\lambda}\big(\mathcal S_1(n)\big) = n \int_{\mathcal U_n} \vert \text{tr}(U) \vert \,dU \,, $ where the integration is with respect to the Haar probability measure on the group $\mathcal U_n$ of unitary operators. Using a probabilistic approach, we derive the limit formula $ \lim_{n\to \infty} \boldsymbol{\lambda}\big(\mathcal S_1(n)\big)/n = \sqrt{\pi}/2\,. $</description>

      <title>Projection constants for spaces of Dirichlet polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a frequency sequence $\omega=(\omega_n)$ and a finite subset $J \subset \mathbb{N}$, we study the space $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}^{J}(\omega)$ of all Dirichlet polynomials $D(s) := \sum_{n \in J} a_n e^{-\omega_n s}, \, s \in \mathbb{C}$. The main aim is to prove asymptotically correct estimates for the projection constant $\boldsymbol{\lambda}\big(\mathcal{H}_\infty^{J}(\omega) \big)$ of the finite dimensional Banach space $\mathcal{H}_\infty^{J}(\omega)$ equipped with the norm $\|D\|= \sup_{\text{Re}\,s&gt;0} |D(s)|$. Based on harmonic analysis on $\omega$-Dirichlet groups, we prove the formula $ \boldsymbol{\lambda}\big(\mathcal{H}_\infty^{J}(\omega) \big) = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{2T} \int_{-T}^T \Big|\sum_{n \in J} e^{-i\omega_n t}\Big|\,dt\,, $ and apply it to various concrete frequencies $\omega$ and index sets $J$. To see an example, combining with a recent deep result of Harper from probabilistic analytic number theory, we for the space $\mathcal{H}_\infty^{\leq x}\big( (\log n)\big)$ of all ordinary Dirichlet polynomials $D(s) = \sum_{n \leq x} a_n n^{-s}$ of length $x$ show the asymptotically correct order $ \boldsymbol{\lambda}\big(\mathcal{H}_\infty^{\leq x}\big( (\log n)\big)\big) \sim \sqrt{x}/(\log \log x)^{\frac{1}{4}}. $</description>

      <title>On the essential decreasing of the summation order in the Abel-Lidskii sense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a theorem allowing to claim that the series summation order in the Abel-Lidskii sense can be decreased to a value less than the infimum of the Schatten index of the corresponding operator. This fact creates a prerequisite to consider a hypotheses that the supplementary multiplier of the exponential type in the integral construction has an exclusively artificial origin.</description>

      <title>Herglotz's representation and Caratheodory's approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Herglotz's representation of holomorphic functions with positive real part and Carath\'eodory's theorem on approximation by inner functions are two well-known classical results in the theory of holomorphic functions on the unit disc. We show that they are equivalent.
  On a multi-connected domain $\Omega$, a version of Heglotz's representation is known. Carath\'eodory's approximation was not known. We formulate and prove it and then show that it is equivalent to the known form of Herglotz's representation. Additionally, it also enables us to prove a new Heglotz's representation in the style of Koranyi and Pukanszky. Of particular interest is the fact that the scaling technique of the disc is replaced by Carath\'eodory's approximation theorem while proving this new form of Herglotz's representation.
  Carath\'eodory's approximation theorem is also proved for matrix-valued functions on a multi-connected domain.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz Estimates and an application to trace formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we provide an elementary proof for the expression of $f(U)-f(V)$ in the form of a double operator integral for every Lipschitz function $f$ on the unit circle $\cir$ and for a pair of unitary operators $(U,V)$ with $U-V\in\mathcal{S}_{2}(\hilh)$ (the Hilbert-Schmidt class). As a consequence, we obtain the Schatten $2$-Lipschitz estimate $\|f(U)-f(V)\|_2\leq \|f\|_{\lip(\cir)}\|U-V\|_2$ for all Lipschitz functions $f:\cir\to\C$. Moreover, we develop an approach to the operator Lipschitz estimate for a pair of contractions with the assumption that one of them is a strict contraction, which significantly extends the class of functions from results known earlier. More specifically, for each $p\in(1,\infty)$ and for every pair of contractions $(T_0,T_1)$ with $\|T_0\|&lt;1$, there exists a constant $d_{f, p,T_0}&gt;0$ such that $\|f(T_1)-f(T_0)\|_p\leq d_{f,p, T_0}\|T_1-T_0\|_p$ for all Lipschitz functions on $\cir$. Using our Lipschitz estimates, we establish a modified Krein trace formula applicable to a specific category of pairs of contractions featuring Hilbert-Schmidt perturbations.</description>

Abstract: Roughly spoken, Functionalanalysis means the study of the category of infinite-dimensional vectorspaces over the field of real or complex numbers, together with their linear maps. In most cases, one further needs a topological structure on such a vectorspace, because then, you can consider the continuous linear maps between such spaces. The name Functionalanalysis is due to the fact, that in the beginning of the theory, the authors wanted to expand Calculus onto functionals of spaces of functions. Functionalanalytical results give the possibility to solve problems in the Theory of (Partial) Differential Equations, in Complex Analysis or in Quantum Mechanics. But the aim of this lines is not to explain the applications. We will discuss the mathematical theory of almost metric spaces, normed vector spaces and algebras, spaces of continuous resp. $p$-integrable functions as well as reflexive and uniformly convex spaces.
  ad v2: We added that, in the case $p \in {]}0,1{[}$, $L^p$ is the completion of the compactly supported continuous functions (with the obvious metric), too. Actually, the proof is the same as in the case $p \in {[}1, \infty{[}$.</description>

      <title>Noncompact uniform universal approximation</title>

Abstract: The universal approximation theorem is generalised to uniform convergence on the (noncompact) input space $\mathbb{R}^n$. All continuous functions that vanish at infinity can be uniformly approximated by neural networks with one hidden layer, for all activation functions $\varphi$ that are continuous, nonpolynomial, and asymptotically polynomial at $\pm\infty$. When $\varphi$ is moreover bounded, we exactly determine which functions can be uniformly approximated by neural networks, with the following unexpected results. Let $\overline{\mathcal{N}_\varphi^l(\mathbb{R}^n)}$ denote the vector space of functions that are uniformly approximable by neural networks with $l$ hidden layers and $n$ inputs. For all $n$ and all $l\geq2$, $\overline{\mathcal{N}_\varphi^l(\mathbb{R}^n)}$ turns out to be an algebra under the pointwise product. If the left limit of $\varphi$ differs from its right limit (for instance, when $\varphi$ is sigmoidal) the algebra $\overline{\mathcal{N}_\varphi^l(\mathbb{R}^n)}$ ($l\geq2$) is independent of $\varphi$ and $l$, and equals the closed span of products of sigmoids composed with one-dimensional projections. If the left limit of $\varphi$ equals its right limit, $\overline{\mathcal{N}_\varphi^l(\mathbb{R}^n)}$ ($l\geq1$) equals the (real part of the) commutative resolvent algebra, a C*-algebra which is used in mathematical approaches to quantum theory. In the latter case, the algebra is independent of $l\geq1$, whereas in the former case $\overline{\mathcal{N}_\varphi^2(\mathbb{R}^n)}$ is strictly bigger than $\overline{\mathcal{N}_\varphi^1(\mathbb{R}^n)}$.</description>

      <title>Weighted norm inequalities for integral transforms with splitting kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on weights for a wide class of integral transforms to be bounded between weighted $L^p-L^q$ spaces, with $1\leq p\leq q\leq \infty$. The kernels $K(x,y)$ of such transforms are only assumed to satisfy upper bounds given by products of two functions, one in each variable.
  The obtained results are applicable to a number of transforms, some of which are included here as particular examples. Some of the new results derived here are the characterization of weights for the boundedness of the $\mathscr{H}_\alpha$ (or Struve) transform in the case $\alpha&gt;\frac{1}{2}$, or the characterization of power weights for which the Laplace transform is bounded in the limiting cases $p=1$ or $q=\infty$.</description>

      <title>The Fefferman-Phong uncertainty principle for representations of Lie groups and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a new uncertainty principle for square-integrable irreducible unitary representations of connected Lie groups. The concentration of the matrix coefficients is measured in terms of weighted $L^p$ norms, with weights in the local Muckenhoupt class $A_{\infty,{\rm loc}}$ associated with a subRiemannian left-invariant metric and a relatively invariant measure. The result is reminiscent of the Fefferman-Phong uncertainty principle, and is new even for the Schr\"odinger representation of the reduced Heisenberg group, which corresponds to the short-time Fourier transform. As an application, we give an optimal estimate of the order of magnitude of the bottom of the spectrum and of the essential spectrum of semiclassical anti-Wick operators in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with a nonnegative symbol $a$ in the class $A_{\infty}$ (in particular, for polynomial symbols). Precisely, we show that the infimum $\inf _{(x_0,\omega_0)\in{\mathbb{R}^{2d}}} -\!\!\!\!\!\int_{B((x_0,\omega_0),\sqrt{h})} a(x,\omega)\, dx\,d\omega$ represents (up to multiplicative constants) both a lower bound and an upper bound for the bottom of the spectrum, uniformly with respect to $h&gt;0$. Similarly the quantity $$\liminf_{(x_0,\omega_0)\to\infty} -\!\!\!\!\!\!\int_{B((x_0,\omega_0),\sqrt{h})} a(x,\omega)\, dx\,d\omega$$ represents both a lower bound and an upper bound for the bottom of the essential spectrum, uniformly with respect to $h&gt;0$. Similar results are proved for semiclassical symbol classes.</description>

      <title>Extended Flow Matching: a Method of Conditional Generation with Generalized Continuity Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of conditional generation is one of the most important applications of generative models, and numerous methods have been developed to date based on the celebrated diffusion models, with the guidance-based classifier-free method taking the lead. However, the theory of the guidance-based method not only requires the user to fine-tune the "guidance strength," but its target vector field does not necessarily correspond to the conditional distribution used in training. In this paper, we develop the theory of conditional generation based on Flow Matching, a current strong contender of diffusion methods. Motivated by the interpretation of a probability path as a distribution on path space, we establish a novel theory of flow-based generation of conditional distribution by employing the mathematical framework of generalized continuity equation instead of the continuity equation in flow matching. This theory naturally derives a method that aims to match the matrix field as opposed to the vector field. Our framework ensures the continuity of the generated conditional distribution through the existence of flow between conditional distributions. We will present our theory through experiments and mathematical results.</description>
