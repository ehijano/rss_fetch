      <title>A characterisation of probabilistic metrizability for approach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterisations of metrizable topological spaces or metrizable uniform spaces are well known. A natural counterpart to being metrizable for topological spaces can be expressed in terms of probabilistic metrizability for approach spaces. The notion of a probabilistic metrizable approach space is based on a well known concrete functor $\Gamma$, as introduced in [9], from the category of probabilistic metric spaces with respect to a continuous arbitrary t-norm to the category of approach spaces. A characterization of those probabilistic metrizable approach spaces is still missing and in the first part of this paper we solve this problem. A natural counterpart to being metrizable for uniform spaces can be expressed in terms of probabilistic metrizability for uniform gauge spaces. In the second part of the paper we start from another concrete functor $\Lambda$, as described in [7], on the category of probabilistic metric spaces with respect to a continuous t-norm to the category of uniform gauge spaces. In a similar way as for the functor $\Gamma$ we obtain a characterisation of probabilistic metrizability of uniform gauge spaces. The last section of the paper is devoted to an isomorphic description of the category of probabilistic metric spaces. This problem is not new. Previous attempts in providing isomorphic descriptions of the category of probabilistic metric spaces worked with collections of (pseudo)metrics. These attempts were only formulated in restricted cases. Our isomorphic description is in terms of objects that are sets endowed with a collection of distances, where the distances involved do not satisfy the triangle inequality but fulfil a mixed triangle condition instead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of compact Hausdorff spaces $X$ that are minimum with respect to $cX=K$ for some fixed covering operator $c$ and compact Hausdorff space $K$ with $cK=K$. Then, using the Yosida representation theorem, we show how that situation relates to the existence of Archimedean vector lattices $A$ with distinguished strong unit that are minimum with respect to $hA=H$ for some fixed hull operator $h$ and vector lattice $H$ with $hH=H$. Among others, we obtain answers for $c=g$ (the Gleason covering operator), $c=qF$ (the quasi-$F$ covering operator), $h = u$ (the uniform completion operator), and $h=e$ (the essential completion operator).</description>

      <title>Regions surrounded by cylinders of real algebraic manifolds and natural decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The author has been interested in regions surrounded by cylinders of real algebraic hypersurfaces and their shapes and polynomials associated to them. Here, we formulate and investigate natural decompositions into such cylinders of real algebraic hypersurfaces. Especially, intersections of these cylinders of real algebraic hypersurfaces, which give important information on regions, are investigated via singularity theory.
  This is a kind of natural problems on real geometry. This also comes from construction of explicit real algebraic maps onto explicit regions in real affine spaces on real algebraic manifolds. More generally, we are interested in difficulty in explicit construction of real algebraic objects, where existence and approximation has been well-known, since pioneering studies by Nash and Tognoli, in the latter half of 20th century. This also comes from interest in singularity theory of differentiable, smooth or real algebraic functions and maps, especially, explicit construction.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove that, for a compact group $G$, a metrizable $G$-space is a $G$-ANR under the following asumptions: (1) if it dominates a $G$-ANR space through a fine $G$-homotopy equivalence; (2) if it is $G$-homotopy dense in a $G$-ANR; (3) if it contains a $G$-ANR as a $G$-homotopy dense subset; (4) if it is the inverse limit of an inverse sequence of $G$-ANR spaces with bonding maps that are fine $G$-homotopy equivalences.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of generalised Koch snowflakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the geometry of a class of fractal sets in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ that generalise the famous Koch curve and Koch snowflake. While the classical Koch curve is defined by an iterative process that divides a line segment into three parts and replaces the middle part by the legs of an isosceles triangle 'above' the line segment, in this more general setting, a choice can be made at each iteration as to whether to place this triangle 'above' or 'below' the line segment. The resulting fractals bear a striking visual resemblance to curves appearing in nature, such as coastlines and snowflakes. While these fractals can be generated by a random process that flips a coin each time to decide the orientation of the triangle, leading to 'almost sure' results for their geometrical properties, we define and study them deterministically to provide exact results. In particular, we show, using the theory of non-integer expansions, that the set of all possible values for the area enclosed by these generalised Koch curves is a closed interval. Moreover, we prove that the union of all these generalised snowflakes does not contain an open set, and has zero $2$-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Complementing these results, using arguments from calculus and fractal geometry, namely properties of geometric series and Frostman's Lemma, we show that each generalised Koch curve has infinite length and the same Hausdorff dimension as its classical counterpart. Further, we also give a classification for when a generalised Koch curve is a quasicircle.</description>

      <title>A categorical perspective on extended metric-topological spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the analysis and geometry of metric-measure structures in infinite dimensions, we study the category of extended metric-topological spaces, along with many of its distinguished subcategories (such as the one of compact spaces). One of the main achievements is the proof of the bicompleteness (i.e. of the existence of all small limits and colimits) of the aforementioned categories.</description>

      <title>Foundations of local iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a systematic study of continuous local iterated function systems. We prove local iterated function systems admit compact attractors and, under a contractivity assumption, construct their code space and present an extended shift that describes admissible compositions. In particular, the possible combinatorial structure of a local iterated function system is in bijection with the space of invariant subsets of the full shift. Nevertheless, these objects reveal a degree of unexpectedness relative to the classical framework, as we build examples of local iterated function systems which are not modeled by subshifts of finite type and give rise to non self-similar attractors. We also prove that all attractors of graph-directed IFSs are obtained from local IFSs on an enriched compact metric space.
  We provide several classes of examples illustrating the scope of our results, emphasizing both their contrasts and connections with the classical theory of iterated function systems.</description>

      <title>Hereditarily indecomposable continua as generic mathematical structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06886v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the pseudo-arc as well as P-adic pseudo-solenoids (for a set of primes P) as generic structures, arising from a natural game in which two players alternate in building an inverse sequence of surjections. The second player wins if the limit of this sequence is homeomorphic to a concrete (fixed in advance) space, called generic whenever the second player has a winning strategy.
  For this purpose, we develop a new robust approximate Fra\"iss\'e theory in the context of MU-categories, a generalization of metric-enriched categories, suitable for working directly with continuous maps between metrizable compacta. Our framework extends both the classical and projective Fra\"iss\'e theories.
  We reprove the Fra\"iss\'e-theoretic characterization of the pseudo-arc and we realize every P-adic pseudo-solenoid as a Fra\"iss\'e limit of a suitable category of continuous surjections on the circle. Moreover, we show that, when playing the game with continuous surjections between non-degenerate Peano continua, the pseudo-arc is always generic, while the universal pseudo-solenoid is generic over all surjections between circle-like continua. This gives a complete classification of generic continua over full non-trivial subcategories of connected polyhedra with continuous surjections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first prove that for every metrizable space $X$, for every closed subset $F$ whose complement is zero-dimensional, the space $X$ can be embedded into a product space of the closed subset $F$ and a metrizable zero-dimensional space as a closed subset. Using this theorem, we next show the existence of extensors of metrics and ultrametrics, which preserve properties of metrics such as the completeness, the properness, being an ultrametrics, its fractal dimensions, and large scale structures. This result contains some of the author's extension theorems of ultrametrics.</description>

      <title>Completeness and reflexivity type properties of $B_1(X)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a Tychonoff space $X$, $B_1(X)$ denotes the space of all Baire-one functions on $X$ endowed with the pointwise topology. We prove that the following assertions are equivalent: (1) $B_1(X)$ is a (semi-)Montel space, (2) $B_1(X)$ is a (semi-)reflexive space, (3) $B_1(X)$ is a (quasi-)complete space, (4) $B_1(X)=\mathbb{R}^X$, (5) $X$ is a $Q_f$-space. It is proved that $B_1(X)$ is sequentially complete iff $B_1(X)$ is locally complete iff $X$ is a $CZ$-space. In the case when $K$ is a compact space, we show that $B_1(K)$ is locally complete iff $K$ is scattered. We thoroughly study the case when $X$ is a separable metrizable space. Numerous distinguished examples are given.</description>

      <title>Strongly rigid metrics in spaces of metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02170v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A metric space is said to be strongly rigid if no positive distance is taken twice by the metric. In 1972, Janos proved that a separable metrizable space has a strongly rigid metric if and only if it is zero-dimensional. In this paper, we shall develop this result for the theory of space of metrics. For a strongly zero-dimensional metrizable space, we prove that the set of all strongly rigid metrics is dense in the space of metics. Moreover, if the space is the union of countable compact subspaces, then that set is comeager. As its consequence, we show that for a strongly zero-dimensional metrizable space, the set of all metrics possessing no nontrivial (bijective) self-isometry is comeager in the space of metrics.</description>

      <title>Injective envelopes of $C^*$-algebras as maximal rigid multiplier covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a non-commutative analogue of B{\l}aszczyk's elegant two-step construction of the Gleason cover: first maximise irreducibility, then compactify. The key insight is that extremal disconnectedness (respectively, injectivity) emerges naturally from a maximality principle rather than being imposed by hand.
  We work with $A$-multiplier covers: non-unital $C^*$-algebras $E$ equipped with a faithful, non-degenerate $*$-homomorphism $\iota:A\to M(E)$. Covers are ordered by $A$-preserving ucp maps between multiplier algebras in the forward direction. A cover is rigid if every ucp endomorphism of $M(E)$ fixing $A$ pointwise is the identity. We prove that if $(E_{\max},\iota_{\max})$ is maximal among rigid covers, then the inclusion $A\hookrightarrow M(E_{\max})$ is rigid and essential; consequently, \[ I(A)\ \cong\ M(E_{\max}) \] canonically over $A$ by Hamana's characterisation. In the commutative case $A=C(X)$, we recover B{\l}aszczyk's picture: for a maximal regular refinement $(X,T^\ast)$ with irreducible identity, $G(X)=\beta(X,T^\ast)$ and $I(C(X))\cong C(G(X))\cong M(C_0(U))$ for any dense cozero set $U\subseteq G(X)$ (in particular, for any dense open $F_\sigma$ set, e.g., an increasing union of clopen sets). Thus the paradigm \emph{maximise first, then compactify} provides a unified conceptual framework on both sides of Gelfand duality.</description>
