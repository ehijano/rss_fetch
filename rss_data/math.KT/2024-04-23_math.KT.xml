      <title>Equivariant $K$-theory of cellular toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we describe the $T_{comp}$-equivariant topological
  $K$-ring of a $T$-{\it cellular} simplicial toric variety. We
  further show that $K_{T_{comp}}^0(X)$ is isomorphic as an
  $R(T_{comp})$-algebra to the ring of piecewise Laurent polynomial
  functions on the associated fan denoted $PLP(\Delta)$. Furthermore,
  we compute a basis for $K_{T_{comp}}^0(X)$ as a
  $R(T_{comp})$-module and multiplicative structure constants with
  respect to this basis.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Algebraic K-Theory and Derived completions II: the case of Equivariant Homotopy K-Theory and Equivariant K-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the mid 1980s, while working on establishing completion theorems for equivariant Algebraic K-Theory similar to the well-known Atiyah-Segal completion theorem for equivariant topological K-theory, the late Robert Thomason found the strong finiteness conditions that are required in such theorems to be too restrictive. Then he made a conjecture on the existence of a completion theorem in the sense of Atiyah and Segal for equivariant Algebraic G-theory, for actions of linear algebraic groups on schemes that holds without any of the strong finiteness conditions that are required in such theorems proven by him, and also appearing in the original Atiyah-Segal theorem. In an earlier work by the first two authors, we solved this conjecture by providing a derived completion theorem for equivariant G-theory. In the present paper, we provide a similar derived completion theorem for the homotopy Algebraic K-theory of equivariant perfect complexes, on schemes that need not be regular.
  Our solution is broad enough to allow actions by all linear algebraic groups, irrespective of whether they are connected or not, and acting on any normal quasi-projective scheme of finite type over a field, irrespective of whether they are regular or projective. This allows us therefore to consider the Equivariant Homotopy Algebraic K-Theory of large classes of varieties like all toric varieties (for the action of a torus) and all spherical varieties (for the action of a reductive group). With finite coefficients invertible in the base fields, we are also able to obtain such derived completion theorems for equivariant algebraic K-theory but with respect to actions of diagonalizable group schemes. These enable us to obtain a wide range of applications, several of which are also explored.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Algebraic K-Theory and Derived completions III: Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we discuss applications of the derived completion theorems proven in our previous two papers. One of the main applications is to Riemann-Roch problems for forms of higher equivariant K-theory, which we are able to establish in great generality both for equivariant G-theory and equivariant homotopy K-theory with respect to actions of linear algebraic groups on normal quasi-projective schemes over a given field. We show such Riemann-Roch theorems apply to all toric and spherical varieties.
  We also obtain Lefschetz-Riemann-Roch theorems involving the fixed point schemes with respect to actions of diagonalizable group schemes. We also show the existence of certain spectral sequences that compute the homotopy groups of the derived completions of equivariant G-theory starting with equivariant Borel-Moore motivic cohomology.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebras, Steinberg modules, and the unstable cohomology of $SL_n(\mathbb Z)$ and $GL_n(\mathbb Z)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the direct sum of all homology groups of the integral general linear groups with Steinberg module coefficients form a commutative Hopf algebra, in particular a free graded commutative algebra. We use this to construct new infinite families of unstable cohomology classes of $SL_n(\mathbb Z)$.</description>

      <title>Transfinite version of the Mittag-Leffler condition for the vanishing of the derived limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a necessary and sufficient condition for an inverse sequence $S_0 \leftarrow S_1 \leftarrow \dots$ indexed by natural numbers to have ${\rm lim}^1S=0$. This condition can be treated as a transfinite version of the Mittag-Leffler condition. We consider inverse sequences in an arbitrary abelian category having a generator and satisfying Grothendieck axioms ${\rm (AB3)}$ and ${\rm (AB4^*)}.$ We also show that the class of inverse sequences $S$ such that ${\rm lim}\: S={\rm lim}^1 S=0$ is the least class of inverse sequences containing the trivial inverse sequence and closed with respect to small limits and a certain type of extensions.</description>
