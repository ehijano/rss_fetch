      <title>Solar GES-structure modified with EiBI gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the post-Newtonian era, the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory, considered as an improved modification of the Einsteinian general relativity formalism in the weak field regime (non-relativistic), has enabled us to study the dynamics of dense astroobjects in light of the modified gravitational effects. This EiBI theory imparts a new shape to the usual gravitational Poisson equation through the addition of a cosmological correction factor, termed as the EiBI gravity parameter. A systematic inclusion of this gravity in the basic structure equation could lead to a realistic picture of the existing solar models free from any end-stage singularity. A theoretic model is accordingly proposed to investigate the effect of the EiBI gravity on the Gravito-Electrostatic Sheath (GES) formalism of the equilibrium solar plasma structure. This study shows that the GES-based solar plasma dynamics is noticeably modified against the previously reported Newtonian GES-model studies. An equilibrium bounded solution for the solar self-gravity shows the EiBI-modified solar surface boundary (SSB) to exist at a new helio-centric radial location $\xi = 4$ (on the Jeansean scale). It is found that the EiBI gravity shifts the present SSB outwards by 14.28% relative to the original Newtonian SSB. The EiBI-modified gravity effects on diverse relevant solar parameters, such as the gravito-electrostatic potentials, fields, and Mach numbers, are illustratively analyzed. It is anticipated that our analyses could be applied further to see the solar plasma equilibrium and fluctuation dynamics in realistically modified post-Newtonian gravity environments on both the bounded (interior) and unbounded (exterior) solar plasma scales.</description>

      <title>The hidden magnetic structures of a solar intermediate filament revealed by the injected flare material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar filaments are spectacular objects in the solar atmosphere, consisting of accumulations of cool, dense, and partially ionized plasma suspended in the hot solar corona against gravity. The magnetic structures that support the filament material remain elusive, partly due to the lack of high resolution magnetic field measurements in the chromosphere and corona. In this study, we reconstruct the magnetic structures of a solar intermediate filament using EUV observations and two different methods, to follow the injection of hot material from a B-class solar flare. Our analysis reveals the fine-scale magnetic structures of the filament, including a compact set of mutually wrapped magnetic fields encasing the cool filament material, two groups of helical magnetic structures intertwining with the main filament, and a series of arched magnetic loops positioned along the filament. Additionally, we also find that the northern footpoints of the helical structures are rooted in the same location, while their southern footpoints are rooted in different areas. The results obtained in this study offer new insights into the formation and eruption mechanisms of solar filaments.</description>

      <title>A study of particle acceleration, heating, power deposition, and the damping length of kinetic Alfv\'en waves in non-Maxwellian coronal plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19061</link>

Abstract: The heating of the solar corona and solar wind, through suprathermal particles and kinetic Alfv\'en waves within the 0 - 10 $R_{\rm Sun}$ range, has been a subject of great interest for many decades. This study investigates the acceleration and heating of charged particles and the role of KAWs in the solar corona. We investigate how KAWs transport energy and accelerate/heat the charged particles, focusing on the behavior of perturbed EM fields, Poynting flux vectors, net power transfer, resonant particle speed, group speed, and the damping length of KAWs. The study examines how these elements are influenced by suprathermal particles \kappa and the electron-to-ion temperature $T_e/T_i$. We use kinetic plasma theory coupled with the Vlasov-Maxwell model to investigate the dynamics of KAWs and particles. We assume a collisionless, homogeneous, and low-beta electron-ion plasma in which Alfv\'en waves travel in the kinetic limits. The results show the perturbed EM fields are significantly influenced by $\kappa$ and $T_e/T_i$. We evaluate both the parallel and perpendicular Poynting fluxes and find that the parallel Poynting flux dissipates gradually for lower \kappa values. The perpendicular flux dissipates quickly over shorter distances. Power deposition in solar flux tubes is significantly influenced by \kappa and Te/Ti. We find that particles can heat the solar corona over long distances in the parallel direction and short distances in the perpendicular direction. The group velocity of KAWs increases for lower \kappa values, and the damping length is enhanced under lower \kappa, suggesting longer energy transport distances. These findings offer a comprehensive understanding of particle-wave interactions in the solar corona and wind, with potential applications for missions such as the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), and can also apply to other environments.</description>
