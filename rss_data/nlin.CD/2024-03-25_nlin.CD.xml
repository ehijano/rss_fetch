      <title>Evolution beats random chance: Performance-dependent network evolution for enhanced computational capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest to understand structure-function relationships in networks across scientific disciplines has intensified. However, the optimal network architecture remains elusive, particularly for complex information processing. Therefore, we investigate how optimal and specific network structures form to efficiently solve distinct tasks using a novel framework of performance-dependent network evolution, leveraging reservoir computing principles. Our study demonstrates that task-specific minimal network structures obtained through this framework consistently outperform networks generated by alternative growth strategies and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random networks. Evolved networks exhibit unexpected sparsity and adhere to scaling laws in node-density space while showcasing a distinctive asymmetry in input and information readout nodes distribution. Consequently, we propose a heuristic for quantifying task complexity from performance-dependently evolved networks, offering valuable insights into the evolutionary dynamics of network structure-function relationships. Our findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of process-specific network evolution but also shed light on the design and optimization of complex information processing mechanisms, notably in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent autocorrelation of a disordered Kuramoto model in the asynchronous state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model has provided deep insights into synchronization phenomena and remains an important paradigm to study the dynamics of coupled oscillators. Yet, despite its success, the asynchronous regime in the Kuramoto model has received limited attention. Here, we adapt and enhance the mean-field approach originally proposed by Stiller and Radons [Phys. Rev. E 58 (1998)] to study the asynchronous state in the Kuramoto model with a finite number of oscillators and with disordered connectivity. By employing an iterative stochastic mean field (IMF) approximation, the complex N-oscillator system can effectively be reduced to a one-dimensional dynamics, both for homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. This method allows us to investigate the power spectra of individual oscillators as well as of the multiplicative "network noise" in the Kuramoto model in the asynchronous regime. By taking into account the finite system size and disorder in the connectivity, our findings become relevant for the dynamics of coupled oscillators that appear in the context of biological or technical systems.</description>

      <title>A transformer-based neural operator for large-eddy simulation of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the large-scale dynamics of three-dimensional (3D) turbulence is challenging for machine learning approaches. This paper introduces a transformer-based neural operator (TNO) to achieve precise and efficient predictions in the large-eddy simulation (LES) of 3D turbulence. The performance of the proposed TNO model is systematically tested and compared with classical sub-grid scale (SGS) models, including the dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) and the dynamic mixed model(DMM), as well as the original Fourier neural operator (FNO) model, in homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) and free-shear turbulent mixing layer. The numerical simulations comprehensively evaluate the performance of these models on a variety of flow statistics, including the velocity spectrum, the probability density functions (PDFs) of vorticity, the PDFs of velocity increments, the evolution of turbulent kinetic energy, and the iso-surface of the Q-criterion. The results demonstrate that the TNO model exhibits better accuracy than the DSM, DMM, and FNO models in both HIT and the turbulent mixing layer. Moreover, the TNO model has fewer parameters than the FNO model and enables long-term stable predictions, which the FNO model cannot achieve. Besides, the proposed TNO model is much faster than traditional LES with DSM and DMM models, showing great potential in tackling 3D nonlinear engineering problems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaker governs synchrony patterns in neuronal inspired networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments in the human brain reveal switching between different activity patterns and functional network organization over time. Recently, multilayer modeling has been employed across multiple neurobiological levels (from spiking networks to brain regions) to unveil novel insights into the emergence and time evolution of synchrony patterns. We consider two layers with the top layer directly coupled to the bottom layer. When isolated, the bottom layer would remain in a specific stable pattern. However, in the presence of the top layer, the network exhibits spatiotemporal switching. The top layer in combination with the inter-layer coupling acts as a symmetry breaker, governing the bottom layer and restricting the number of allowed symmetry-induced patterns. This structure allows us to demonstrate the existence and stability of pattern states on the bottom layer, but most remarkably, it enables a simple mechanism for switching between patterns based on the unique symmetry-breaking role of the governing layer. We demonstrate that the symmetry breaker prevents complete synchronization in the bottom layer, a situation that would not be desirable in a normal functioning brain. We illustrate our findings using two layers of Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) oscillators, employing the Master Stability function approach in small networks to investigate the switching between patterns.</description>

      <title>Cauchy universality and random billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion in bounded domains represents a paradigm in several settings: from billiard dynamics, to random walks in a finite lattice, with applications to relevant physical, ecological and biological problems. A remarkable universal property, involving the average of return times to the boundary, has been theoretically proposed, and experimentally verified in quite different contexts. We discuss here mechanisms that lead to violations of universality, induced by boundary effects. We suggest that our analysis should be relevant where non homogeneity appears in the stationary probability distribution in bounded domain.</description>

      <title>Feynman rules for forced wave turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.08168v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has long been known that weakly nonlinear field theories can have a late-time stationary state that is not the thermal state, but a wave turbulent state with a far-from-equilibrium cascade of energy. We go beyond the existence of the wave turbulent state, studying fluctuations about the wave turbulent state. Specifically, we take a classical field theory with an arbitrary quartic interaction and add dissipation and Gaussian-random forcing. Employing the path integral relation between stochastic classical field theories and quantum field theories, we give a prescription, in terms of Feynman diagrams, for computing correlation functions in this system. We explicitly compute the two-point and four-point functions of the field to next-to-leading order in the coupling. Through an appropriate choice of forcing and dissipation, these correspond to correlation functions in the wave turbulent state. In particular, we derive the kinetic equation to next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>An adjoint-free algorithm for conditional nonlinear optimal perturbations (CNOPs) via sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00956v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sampling algorithm based on state-of-the-art statistical machine learning techniques to obtain conditional nonlinear optimal perturbations (CNOPs), which is different from traditional (deterministic) optimization methods.1 Specifically, the traditional approach is unavailable in practice, which requires numerically computing the gradient (first-order information) such that the computation cost is expensive, since it needs a large number of times to run numerical models. However, the sampling approach directly reduces the gradient to the objective function value (zeroth-order information), which also avoids using the adjoint technique that is unusable for many atmosphere and ocean models and requires large amounts of storage. We show an intuitive analysis for the sampling algorithm from the law of large numbers and further present a Chernoff-type concentration inequality to rigorously characterize the degree to which the sample average probabilistically approximates the exact gradient. The experiments are implemented to obtain the CNOPs for two numerical models, the Burgers equation with small viscosity and the Lorenz-96 model. We demonstrate the CNOPs obtained with their spatial patterns, objective values, computation times, and nonlinear error growth. Compared with the performance of the three approaches, all the characters for quantifying the CNOPs are nearly consistent, while the computation time using the sampling approach with fewer samples is much shorter. In other words, the new sampling algorithm shortens the computation time to the utmost at the cost of losing little accuracy.</description>

      <title>Wave turbulence and the kinetic equation beyond leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a scheme by which to solve the Liouville equation perturbatively in the nonlinearity, which we apply to weakly nonlinear classical field theories. Our solution is a variant of the Prigogine diagrammatic method, and is based on an analogy between the Liouville equation in infinite volume and scattering in quantum mechanics, described by the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The motivation for our work is wave turbulence: a broad class of nonlinear classical field theories are believed to have a stationary turbulent state -- a far-from-equilibrium state, even at weak coupling. Our method provides an efficient way to derive properties of the weak wave turbulent state. A central object in these studies, which is a reduction of the Liouville equation, is the kinetic equation, which governs the occupation numbers of the modes. All properties of wave turbulence to date are based on the kinetic equation found at leading order in the weak nonlinearity. We explicitly obtain the kinetic equation to next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic formalism and anomalous transport in 1D semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the time-dependent free energy functionals of the semiclassical one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard chain. We first review the weakly chaotic dynamics and the consequent early-time anomalous diffusion in the system. The anomalous diffusion is robust, appears with strictly quantized coefficients, and persists even for very long chains (more than hundred sites), crossing over to normal diffusion at late times. We identify fast (angle) and slow (action) variables and thus consider annealed and quenched partition functions, corresponding to fixing the actions and integrating over the actions, respectively. We observe the leading quantum effects in the annealed free energy, whereas the quenched energy is undefined in the thermodynamic limit, signaling the absence of thermodynamic equilibrium in the quenched regime. But already the leading correction away from the quenched regime reproduces the annealed partition function exactly. This encapsulates the fact that in both slow- and fast-chaos regime both the anomalous and the normal diffusion can be seen (though at different times).</description>
