      <title>Comment on: "Investigating the time dependence of neutron-proton equilibration using molecular dynamics simulations" by A.Jedele et al: Phys Rev C 107, 024601 (2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the authors discuss neutron-proton equilibration process induced on the 70Zn + 70Zn system at 35 MeV/nucleon, comparing experimental results with the Anti-symmetrized Molecular Dynamics and the Constrained Molecular Dynamics model simulations (COMD). The comment contains observations on the improper use of the COMD model, including some misinterpretations of the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for radiative corrections to charged-current processes II: Axial-vector coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the hadronic structure-dependent radiative corrections to the axial-vector coupling that controls single-nucleon weak charged-current processes -- commonly denoted by $g_A$. We match the Standard Model at the GeV scale onto chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order in the one-nucleon sector, in the presence of electromagnetic and weak interactions. As a result, we provide a representation for the corrections to $g_A$ in terms of infrared finite convolutions of simple kernels with the single-nucleon matrix elements of time-ordered products of two and three quark bilinears (vector, axial-vector, and pseudoscalar). We discuss strategies to determine the required non-perturbative input from data, lattice-QCD (+QED), and possibly hadronic models. This work paves the way for a precise comparison of the values of the ratio $g_A/g_V$ extracted from experiment and from lattice-QCD, which constrain physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Microscopic optical potentials from a Greens function approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical potentials are a standard tool in the study of nuclear reactions, as they describe the effective interaction between a target nucleus and a projectile. The use of phenomenological optical potentials built using experimental data on stable isotopes is widespread. Although successful in their dedicated domain, it is unclear whether these phenomenological potentials can provide reliable predictions for unstable isotopes. To address this problem, optical potentials based on microscopic nuclear structure input calculations prove to be crucial, and are an important current line of research. In this work, we present a new approach for the systematic derivation of optical potentials using input from nuclear structure models. We provide an application addressing the n+24Mg elastic scattering reaction based on the valence shell model.</description>

      <title>Probing nuclear liquid-gas phase transition with isospin correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuations of the net-baryon number near the critical point of the liquid-gas phase transition. We use the parity doublet model in the mean-field approximation fixed to the zero-temperature properties of nuclear matter to account for critical behavior. We explicitly calculate the fluctuations of the net-proton and net-neutron numbers as well as their correlations in the isospin-symmetric matter. We focus on the qualitative properties and systematics of the first- to fourth-order susceptibilities and their ratios. We demonstrate that the fluctuations of net-proton number do not reflect the total net-baryon number fluctuations in the vicinity of the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition. We point to the importance of the non-trivial correlations between protons and neutrons.</description>

      <title>Volume fluctuations affect on transport and thermodynamic coefficients in p-Pb systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model to simulate the event-by-event p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=5.02 TeV. To study the space-time volume fluctuations, two different definitions of radius have been introduced in the calculation: One is weigh of event-by-event charged multiplicity (noted as set I), and the other one is weigh of energy density in a single event (notes as set II). Based on calculations of sets I and II, the transport and thermodynamic coefficients, such as the speed of sound squared, shear viscosity, bulk viscosity, and mean free path are both dependent on the radius and local temperature. By comparing results of sets I and II, we found that these transport and thermodynamic coefficients differed significantly in the results. These results imply that the transport and thermodynamic properties of the medium in small collisions significantly depend on the space-time volume fluctuations.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian Process Generative Model for QCD Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a generative model for the nuclear matter equation of state at zero net baryon density using the Gaussian Process Regression method. We impose first-principles theoretical constraints from lattice QCD and hadron resonance gas at high- and low-temperature regions, respectively. By allowing the trained Gaussian Process Regression model to vary freely near the phase transition region, we generate random smooth cross-over equations of state with different speeds of sound that do not rely on specific parameterizations. We explore a collection of experimental observable dependencies on the generated equations of state, which paves the groundwork for future Bayesian inference studies to use experimental measurements from relativistic heavy-ion collisions to constrain the nuclear matter equation of state.</description>

      <title>Determination of the strong coupling constant and the Collins-Soper kernel from the energy-energy correlator in $e^+e^-$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform, for the first time, a simultaneous global fit of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ and the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel in the back-to-back limit of energy-energy correlators in $e^+ e^-$ collisions at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N$^3$LL) accuracy. Our extracted value of $\alpha_s$ is consistent with the world average and has comparable accuracy. For the nonperturbative part of the CS kernel, we consider two different parameterizations, and the results align with those obtained from phenomenological fits of the transverse-momentum-dependent differential cross section in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and Drell-Yan production.</description>

      <title>Pi in the Sky: Neutron Stars with Exceptionally Light QCD Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of axion condensed neutron stars that arise in models of an exceptionally light axion that couples to quantum chromodynamics (QCD). These axions solve the strong-charge-parity (CP) problem, but have a mass-squared lighter than that due to QCD by a factor of $\varepsilon&lt;1$. Inside dense matter, the axion potential is altered, and much of the matter in neutron stars resides in the axion condensed phase where the strong-CP parameter $\theta =\pi$ and CP remains a good symmetry. In these regions, masses and interactions of nuclei are modified, in turn changing the equation of state (EOS), structure and phenomenology of the neutron stars. We take first steps toward the study of the EOS of neutron star matter at $\theta =\pi$ within chiral effective field theory and use relativistic mean field theory to deduce the resulting changes to nuclear matter and the neutron star low-density EOS. We derive constraints on the exceptionally light axion parameter space based on observations of the thermal relaxation of accreting neutron stars, isolated neutron star cooling, and pulsar glitches, excluding the region up to $5 \times 10^{-7} \lesssim \varepsilon \lesssim 0.2$ for $ m_a \gtrsim 2\times 10^{-9}\,{\rm eV} $. We comment on potential changes to the neutron star mass-radius relationship, and discuss the possibility of novel, nuclear-density compact objects with $\theta =\pi$ that are stabilized not by gravity but by the axion potential.</description>

      <title>Transverse Orbital Angular Momentum in the Proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the equations of motion of QCD and Lorentz invariance relations, we show a new, more direct way of obtaining the decomposition of the proton's quark transverse angular momentum into its spin and orbital components. The new decomposition can be understood as a twist-three relation, with the quark transverse spin described by the parton distribution $g_T$. We find that the orbital component can be expressed in terms of a moment in the quark transverse momentum, $k_T$, of the generalized transverse momentum-dependent distribution $F_{12}$, or alternatively in terms of the twist-three generalized parton distributions $H_{2T}$ and $\widetilde{E}_{2T}$.</description>

      <title>Probing the mass effect of heavy quark jets in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production of heavy quark (HQ) jets provides a new arena to address the mass effect of jet quenching in heavy-ion physics. This paper presents a theoretical study of HQ jet yield suppression in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC and focuses on the energy loss of HQ jets produced by different mechanisms. The p+p baseline is carried out by the SHERPA generator, and the jet-medium interactions are described by the SHELL transport model, which considers the elastic and inelastic partonic energy loss in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In p+p collisions, our numerical results indicate that the HQ jets from gluon splitting ($g \rightarrow Q$-jet) give the dominant contribution at high $p_T$, and it shows more dispersive structures than the HQ-initiated one ($Q \rightarrow Q$-jet). In nucleus-nucleus collisions, our calculations are consistent with the inclusive and b-jet $R_{AA}$ recently measured by the ATLAS collaboration, which suggests a remarkable manifestation of the mass effect of jet energy loss. As a result of the dispersive substructure, the $g \rightarrow Q$-jet will lose more energy than the $Q \rightarrow Q$-jet in the QGP. Due to the significant contribution of $g \rightarrow c$-jet, the $R_{AA}$ of c-jet will be comparable or even smaller than that of inclusive jet. To experimentally distinguish the $g \rightarrow Q$-jet and $Q \rightarrow Q$-jet, we propose the event selection strategies based on their topological features and test the performances. By isolating the $c \rightarrow c$-jet and $b \rightarrow b$-jet, the jets initiated by heavy quarks, we predict that the order of their $R_{AA}$ are in line with the mass hierarchy of energy loss. Future measurements on the $R_{AA}$ of $Q \rightarrow Q$-jet and $g \rightarrow Q$-jet will provide a unique chance to test the flavour/mass dependence of energy loss at the jet level.</description>

      <title>On the scalar $\pi K$ form factor beyond the elastic region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pion-kaon ($\pi K$) final states, often appearing in heavy-particle decays at the precision frontier, are important for Standard-Model tests, to describe crossed channels with exotic states, and for spectroscopy of excited kaon resonances. We construct a representation of the $\pi K$ $S$-wave form factor using the elastic $\pi K$ scattering phase shift via dispersion relations in the elastic region and extend this model into the inelastic region using resonance exchange, while maintaining unitarity and the correct analytic structure. As a first application, we successfully described the $\tau \to K_S \pi \nu_\tau$ spectrum to not only achieve a better distinction between $S$- and $P$-wave contributions, but also to provide an improved estimate of the $CP$ asymmetry produced by a tensor operator as well as the forward-backward asymmetry, both of which can be confronted with future data at Belle II.</description>

      <title>Constraining the hidden-charm pentaquark predictions and discriminating the $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ spins through the effective range expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Weinberg compositeness criterion dictates that a pure shallow bound state is characterized by a large scattering length $a_0\gg\mathcal{O}(1/\beta)$ and a positive effective range $r_0$ that naturally scales to the size of $\mathcal{O}(1/\beta)$, where $1/\beta$ signifies the interaction range. In constructing the contact-range effective field theory (EFT) up to the next-to-leading order to describe the pentaquarks $P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4440)$, and $P_c(4457)$ observed by the LHCb collaboration in 2019, we match the effective range $r_0$ for these pentaquarks with the low-energy couplings within the EFT framework. Three different schemes are used to connect the couplings with the effective range. We find positive effective ranges $r_0$ of the natural size of $\mathcal{O}(1/\beta)$ for the spin configurations $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$ for $P_c(4440)$ and $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^-$ for $P_c(4457)$ within the molecular $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c$ description. Additionally, predictions from the power counting for low-energy couplings or Wilsonian coefficients suggest that, under heavy quark spin symmetry, the broad $P_c(4380)$ resonance, discovered by the LHCb collaboration in 2015, when considered as part of the single-channel $\bar{D}^{(*)} \Sigma_c^{(*)}$ molecular system alongside $P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4440)$, and $P_c(4457)$, has a mass of approximately $4376$ $\rm{MeV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the limit of vanishing up, down and strange quark masses, QCD exhibits a chiral symmetry. This symmetry is broken spontaneously to its vector subgroup, giving rise to Goldstone bosons. These acquire a small mass through the explicit chiral symmetry breaking for non-vanishing quark masses. The consequences of these broken symmetries can be investigated in a suitably tailored effective field theory called chiral pertubation theory. It admits a perturbative expansion in the external momenta and the Goldstone boson masses and can be systematically analyzed in terms of a loop expansion. The appearing ultraviolet divergences in loop diagrams can be dealt with order-by-order through the Goldstone boson contact interactions. Matter fields like the lowest-lying baryons can also included, leading to a rich and testable phenomenology of low-energy QCD.</description>

      <title>Rapid cooling of the Cassiopeia A neutron star due to superfluid quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid cooling of the neutron star in Cassiopeia A is speculated to arise from an enhanced neutrino emission caused by the onset of $^3P_2$-wave neutron superfluidity in the core. However, the neutrino emissivity due to Cooper-pair breaking and formation is too small to yield the observed cooling rate. Here, we show that such a rapid cooling can be explained once the non-Fermi liquid behavior of the non-superfluid neutron liquid induced by superfluid quantum criticality is included into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling, without assuming the existence of additional energy loss processes. Our results indicate that the neutron star in Cassiopeia A remains in the thermal relaxation stage, which is greatly prolonged by the non-Fermi liquid behavior. The good agreement between our theoretical results and recent observational cooling data points to the pivotal role played by superfluid quantum criticality in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Entanglement as a probe of hadronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was discovered that the proton structure at high energies exhibits maximal entanglement. This leads to a simple relation between the proton's parton distributions and the entropy of hadrons produced in high-energy inelastic interactions that has been experimentally confirmed. In this letter, we extend this approach to the production of jets. Here, the maximal entanglement predicts a relation between the jet fragmentation function and the entropy of hadrons produced in jet fragmentation. We test this relation using the ATLAS Collaboration data on jet production at the Large Hadron Collider and find good agreement between the prediction based on maximal entanglement within the jet and the data. This study represents the first use of the quantum entanglement framework in the experimental study of the hadronization process, offering a new perspective on the transition from perturbative to non-perturbative QCD. Our results open the door to a more comprehensive understanding of the quantum nature of hadronization.</description>

      <title>An approximation of the $S$ matrix for solving the Marchenko equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present a new approximation of the $S$-matrix dependence on momentum $q$, formulated as a sum of a rational function and a truncated Sinc series. This approach enables pointwise determination of the $S$ matrix with specified resolution, capturing essential features such as resonance behavior with high accuracy. The resulting approximation provides a separable kernel for the Marchenko equation (fixed-$l$ inversion), reducing it to a system of linear equations for the expansion coefficients of the output kernel. Numerical results demonstrate good convergence of this method, applicable to both unitary and non-unitary $S$ matrices. Convergence is further validated through comparisons with an exactly solvable square-well potential model. The method is applied to analyze $S_{31}$ $\pi N$ scattering data.</description>

      <title>The $\phi^n$ trajectory bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform an extensive bootstrap study of Hermitian and non-Hermitian theories based on the novel analytic continuation of $\langle\phi^n\rangle$ or $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ in $n$. We first use the quantum harmonic oscillator to illustrate various aspects of the $\phi^n$ trajectory bootstrap method, such as the large $n$ expansion, matching conditions, exact quantization condition, and high energy asymptotic behavior. Then we derive highly accurate solutions for the anharmonic oscillators with the parity invariant potential $V(\phi)=\phi^2+\phi^{m}$ and the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant potential $V(\phi)=-(i\phi)^{m}$ for a large range of integral $m$, showing the high efficiency and general applicability of this new bootstrap approach. For the Hermitian quartic and non-Hermitian cubic oscillators, we further verify that the non-integer $n$ results for $\langle\phi^n\rangle$ or $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ are consistent with those from the wave function approach. In the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant case, the existence of $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ with non-integer $n$ allows us to bootstrap the non-Hermitian theories with non-integer powers, such as fractional and irrational $m$.</description>

      <title>Anomalous thermal relaxation in warm ion plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform microscopic simulations of the thermal relaxation of warm neutral plasmas of astrophysical importance. Using Molecular Dynamics we study the thermal relaxation of a hot neutral fluid of finite-size neutron-rich ions kept in a fixed-wall cool box. We show how the interplay among particle size, Yukawa interaction range and density are key to understand the features of the time-dependent thermal relaxation curve $T(t)$. We show that, under certain conditions, these systems exhibit faster cooling from increasingly larger initial temperature values. They also display non-Newtonian thermal behavior, including oscillations, that can be {\it effectively} interpreted as the consequence of the existence of a non-trivial system memory function. Finally, we consider the impact of multicomponent admixtures in the simulated system. We discuss these results and their possible extensions to astrophysical scenarios, where screened plasmas with Yukawa-like electrostatic potentials are usually involved.</description>

      <title>Net-Proton Number Cumulants in Strongly and Weakly Coupled QGP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a description of the QCD phase diagram across different energy regimes. Without any adjustable free parameters fitted to lattice or experimental data, we demonstrate that the net-proton number cumulant ratios from the Beam Energy Scan-I (BES-I) central ($0-5\%$) Au+Au collision experiments at RHIC, for center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s} \geq 39\,\text{GeV}$, are well described by the $\textit{dynamical soft-wall}$ AdS black hole model, indicating the formation of a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) dominated by gluons in the large $N_c$ limit. We identify a critical point at $\mu_B = 247\,\text{MeV}$ or $\sqrt{s}=16\,\text{GeV}$ in this model, where net-proton cumulant ratios show non-monotonic variation. However, for $\sqrt{s} &lt; 39\,\text{GeV}$, the recent BES-II data does not exhibit the expected variation due to the critical point, suggesting instead a transition to a nearly-cold ($\mu_B \gg T$) weakly coupled QGP (wQGP), for $\sqrt{s} &lt; 7.7\,\text{GeV}$, dominated by valence quarks. This prediction can be tested by the upcoming STAR Fixed-Target experimental data.</description>

      <title>Vortex Avalanches and Collective Motion in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate the dynamics of about 600 quantum vortices in a spinning-down cylindrical container using a Gross--Pitaevskii model. For the first time, we find convincing spatial-temporal evidence of avalanching behaviour resulting from vortex depinning and collective motion. During a typical avalanche, about 10 to 20 vortices exit the container in a short period, producing a glitch in the superfluid angular momentum and a localised void in the vorticity. After the glitch, vortices continue to depin and circulate around the vorticity void in a similar manner to that seen in previous point-vortex simulations. We present evidence of collective vortex motion throughout this avalanche process. We also show that the effective Magnus force can be used to predict when and where avalanches will occur. Lastly, we comment on the challenge of extrapolating these results to conditions in real neutron stars, which contain many orders of magnitude more vortices.</description>
