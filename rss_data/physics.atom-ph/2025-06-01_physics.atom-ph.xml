      <title>Diffraction phase-free Bragg atom interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bragg diffraction is a fundamental technique used to enhance the sensitivity of atom interferometers through large momentum transfer, making these devices among the most precise quantum sensors available today. To further improve their accuracy, it is necessary to achieve control over multiple interferometer paths and increase robustness against velocity spread. Optimal control theory has recently led to advancements in sensitivity and robustness under specific conditions, such as vibrations, accelerations, and other experimental challenges. In this work, we employ this tool to focus on improving the accuracy of the interferometer by minimizing the diffraction phase. We consider the finite temperature of the incoming wavepacket and the multi-path nature of high-order Bragg diffraction as showcased in a Mach-Zehnder(MZ) geometry. Our approach can achieve diffraction phases on the order of microradians or even below a microradian for a momentum width of the incoming wavepacket $\sigma_p = 0.01\hbar k$, below a milliradian for $\sigma_p= 0.1 \hbar k$ and milliradians for $\sigma_p = 0.3 \hbar k$.</description>

      <title>Heterodyne detection of low-frequency fields via Rydberg EIT with phase demodulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the rapid progress of quantum sensing research reveals that the Rydberg atoms have great potentials in becoming high-precision centimeter-scale antenna of low-frequency fields. In order to facilitate efficient and reliable detection of low-frequency fields via Rydberg atoms, we design, implement and analyze a special but low-cost and scalable method based on heterodyning processes under the condition of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) embedded in typical two-photon ground-Rydberg transition. Instead of relying on observing changes in absorption of light by Rydberg atoms, our method focuses on the phase modulation effect on the probe laser induced by the low-frequency fields via the Rydberg EIT mechanism and utilizes a demodulation process to accurately retrieve the signal. The general principles of our method apply to both electric and magnetic fields and it is even possible to realize the combination of both functionalities in the same apparatus. In particular, we experimentally demonstrate the full cycle of operations with respect to both cases. In the measurement of low-frequency electric fields, we discover that the Rydberg dipole-dipole interaction among atoms induce linear superposition of Rydberg states with different angular momentum that generates a first-order response corresponding to the signature of linear Stark effect. As the Rydberg atoms have excellent coupling strengths with electric fields, our results indicate that our method can hopefully reach high-precision performance for practical tasks in the future.</description>

      <title>$g$ Factor of Boron-like Tin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ALPHATRAP experiment, the $g$ factor of boron-like $^{118}\mathrm{Sn}^{45+}$ has been measured with a $0.5$ parts-per-billion uncertainty. This is the first high-precision measurement of a heavy boron-like $g$ factor. The measured value of $0.644\,703\,826\,5(4)$ is consistent with the presented \textit{ab initio} state-of-the-art theory calculations, which predict a value of $0.644\,702\,9(8)$. So far, the only boron-like $g$ factor measured with high precision has been $^{40}\mathrm{Ar}^{13+}$. The measurement presented here therefore tests quantum electrodynamics as well as many-electron interactions at much higher $Z$. Furthermore, we discuss the potential for an independent determination of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$, which can be achieved with a specific difference of $g$ factors, combining the presented results with the recent electron $g$-factor measurement of hydrogen-like tin.</description>

      <title>Testing inter-electronic interaction in lithium-like tin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic moments of bound-electron systems are a sensitive tool for testing fundamental interactions. $g$ factors of lithium-like ions have been rigorously studied in recent years, enabling insights into the relativistic inter-electronic effects. Here, we present the $g$-factor measurement of lithium-like tin, accurate to 0.5 parts per billion, as well as \textit{ab initio} theoretical calculations that include an advanced treatment of the inter-electronic interaction. We further improve the prediction by using the experimental result for the hydrogen-like tin $g$ factor, inferring from it the unknown higher-order QED effects. The observed agreement independently confirms the revised theory at a previously inaccessible high nuclear charge $Z$ of 50, where QED effects are significantly larger.</description>

      <title>Relative-phase dependence of dynamically assisted electron-positron pair creation in the superposition of strong oscillating electric-field pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Production of electron-positron pairs in the superposition of oscillating electric-field pulses with largely different frequencies is studied, focussing on the impact of relative phases between the pulses. Various field configurations are considered: superpositions of either two or three pulses of equal duration as well as combinations of a long low-frequency and a short high-frequency pulse. We show that the relative phase of superimposed high-frequency modes can exert a sizeable effect on the total numbers of produced pairs, enhancing them by about 10-30% for the considered field parameters.</description>

      <title>Practical primary thermometry via alkali-metal-vapour Doppler broadening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doppler-broadening thermometry (DBT) can be used as a calibration-free primary reference suitable for practical applications, e.g. reliably measuring temperatures over long periods of time in environments where sensor retrieval is impractical. We report on our proof-of-concept investigations into DBT with alkali metal vapour cells, with a particular focus on both absorption and frequency accuracy during scans. We reach sub-kelvin temperature accuracy, and experimental absorption fit residuals below $0.05\,\%$, in a simple setup. The outlook for portable, practical devices is bright, with clear prospects for future improvement.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic Traps for Quasi-Continuous Operation of Optical Nanofiber Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20734v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A soft ferromagnetic foil uniformizes Tesla-level fields generated by attached permanent magnets, producing a smooth and electronically tunable surface field on the opposite side. By arranging n precisely fabricated rectangular foils, a nearly ideal magnetic quadrupole field with a substantial gradient can be created at center. This robust and rapidly tunable field configuration is well suited for two-dimensional magneto-optical trapping (2D-MOT) and magnetic guiding of cold atoms. By aligning an optical nanofiber (ONF) along the zero-field line of a planar 2D-MOT in a 2-foil assembly, we demonstrate quasi-continuous, field-free operation of the quantum optical interface without switching off the magnetic field. Transient transmission spectroscopy with nanosecond laser pulses is performed on the Rb-87 D2 line at a measurement repetition rate as high as 250 kHz. The observed line broadening, while not yet fully understood, is partially attributed to residual magnetic fields in the n=2 assembly. Through additional measurements and simulations, we verify that these residual fields can be fully eliminated in an n=4 assembly, resulting in an ultra-straight 2D trap that supports uniform light-atom interaction over exceptionally long, field-free distances. We extend our discussion to n=6, n=8 designs with similar uniformity but multiple zero-field lines. With its strong gradient for magnetic trapping, the ferromagnetic devices also enable new quantum optical scenarios featuring interactions between co-guided atoms and photons at ONF interfaces.</description>

      <title>Testing quantum theory on curved space-time with quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies present new opportunities for fundamental tests of nature. One potential application is to probe the interplay between quantum physics and general relativity - a field of physics with no empirical evidence yet. Here we show that quantum networks open a new window to test this interface. We demonstrate how photon mediated entanglement between atomic or atom-like systems can be used to probe time-dilation induced entanglement and interference modulation. Key are non-local measurements between clocks in a gravitational field, which can be achieved either through direct photon interference or by using auxiliary entanglement. The resulting observable depends on the interference between different proper times, and can only be explained if both quantum theory and general relativity are taken into account. The proposed protocol enables clock interferometry on km-scale separations and beyond. Our work thus shows a realistic experimental route for a first test of quantum theory on curved space-time, opening up new scientific opportunities for quantum networks.</description>
