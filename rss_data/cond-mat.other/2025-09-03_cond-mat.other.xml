      <title>First-Order PT Phase Transition in Non-Hermitian Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between superconductivity and environmental dissipation, effectively captured by non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, is a new frontier for exotic quantum phases. We explore a PT-symmetric non-Hermitian superconductor with balanced gain and loss. To ensure experimental relevance, we develop a right-eigenstate-based non-Hermitian mean-field theory. We uncover a novel first-order phase transition that coincides exactly with the PT symmetry breaking point, driven by the interplay between superconducting pairing interactions and non-Hermitian dissipation. In the PT-symmetric phase, moderate NH dissipation enhances superconductivity, while in the PT-broken phase, intensified dissipation significantly suppresses it. These phenomena, characterized by abrupt jumps in observables, can be probed through localized spectral measurements and macroscopic superfluid density analysis. Additionally, the stability analysis offers robust theoretical insights to support experimental investigations of this unique transition.</description>

      <title>Controlled Buildup of Half-Quantized Thermal Conductance in an Engineered Chiral Spin Liquid Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study thermal transport along the edge of a small chiral-spin-liquid device coupled to two Ising-chain reservoirs, a platform suitable for quantum-engineered systems. Adiabatically switching on the tunnel couplings to the reservoirs generates a thermal current that dynamically builds up and reaches a quasi-steady-state regime. In this time window, the two-terminal thermal conductance can approach half-quantized values -- a hallmark of Majorana-mediated transport -- under finely tuned conditions. The results agree with a steady-state Landauer-B\"uttiker description for sufficiently large reservoirs, where energy-resolved transmission rates help identify the optimal parameters to achieve the half-quantized conductance. This work provides a controllable platform to investigate topological thermal transport in engineered spin systems, such as realized in cold-atom and Rydberg-atom settings.</description>

      <title>Detection of noise correlations in two qubit systems by Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and validate a machine-learning assisted quantum sensing protocol to classify spatial and temporal correlations of classical noise affecting two ultrastrongly coupled qubits. We consider six distinct classes of Markovian and non-Markovian noise. Leveraging the sensitivity of a coherent population transfer protocol under three distinct driving conditions, the various forms of noise are discriminated by only measuring the final transfer efficiencies. Our approach achieves $\gtrsim 86\%$ accuracy in classification providing a near-perfect discrimination between Markovian and non-Markovian noise. The method requires minimal experimental resources, relying on a simple driving scheme providing three inputs to a shallow neural network with no need of measuring time-series data or real-time monitoring. The machine-learning data analysis acquires information from non-idealities of the coherent protocol highlighting how combining these techniques may significantly improve the characterization of quantum-hardware.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Terahertz Thermoelectricity via Engineered van Hove Singularities and Nernst Effect in Moir\'e Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials, long explored for energy harvesting and thermal sensing, convert heat directly into electrical signals. Extending their application to the terahertz (THz) frequency range opens opportunities for low-noise, bias-free THz detection, yet conventional thermoelectrics lack the sensitivity required for practical devices. Thermoelectric coefficients can be strongly enhanced near van Hove singularities (VHS), though these are usually difficult to access in conventional materials. Here we show that moir\'e band engineering unlocks these singularities for THz optoelectronics. Using 2D moir\'e structures as a model system, we observe strong enhancement of the THz photothermoelectric response in monolayer and bilayer graphene superlattices when the Fermi level is tuned to band singularities. Applying a relatively small magnetic field further boosts the response through the THz-driven Nernst effect, a transverse thermoelectric current driven by the THz-induced temperature gradient. Our results establish moir\'e superlattices as a versatile platform for THz thermoelectricity and highlight engineered band structures as a route to high-performance THz optoelectronic devices.</description>
