      <title>Theory and numerics of subspace approximation of eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale eigenvalue problems arise in various fields of science and engineering and demand computationally efficient solutions. In this study, we investigate the subspace approximation for parametric linear eigenvalue problems, aiming to mitigate the computational burden associated with high-fidelity systems. We provide general error estimates under non-simple eigenvalue conditions, establishing the theoretical foundations for our methodology. Numerical examples, ranging from one-dimensional to three-dimensional setups, are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of reduced basis method in handling parametric variations in boundary conditions and coefficient fields to achieve significant computational savings while maintaining high accuracy, making them promising tools for practical applications in large-scale eigenvalue computations.</description>

      <title>A non-nested unstructured mesh perspective on highly parallel multilevel smoothed Schwarz preconditioner for linear parametric PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multilevel Schwarz preconditioner is one of the most popular parallel preconditioners for enhancing convergence and improving parallel efficiency. However, its parallel implementation on arbitrary unstructured triangular/tetrahedral meshes remains challenging. The challenges mainly arise from the inability to ensure that mesh hierarchies are nested, which complicates parallelization efforts. This paper systematically investigates the non-nested unstructured case of parallel multilevel algorithms and develops a highly parallel non-nested multilevel smoothed Schwarz preconditioner. The proposed multilevel preconditioner incorporates two key techniques. The first is a new parallel coarsening algorithm that preserves the geometric features of the computational domain. The second is a corresponding parallel non-nested interpolation method designed for non-nested mesh hierarchies. This new preconditioner is applied to a broad range of linear parametric problems, benefiting from the reusability of the same coarse mesh hierarchy for problems with different parameters. Several numerical experiments validate the outstanding convergence and parallel efficiency of the proposed preconditioner, demonstrating effective scalability up to 1,000 processors.</description>

      <title>Combined DG-CG finite element method for the Westervelt equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a space--time finite element method for Westervelt's quasilinear model of ultrasound waves in second-order formulation. The method combines conforming finite element spatial discretizations with a discontinuous-continuous Galerkin time stepping. Its analysis is challenged by the fact that standard Galerkin testing approaches for wave problems do not allow for bounding the discrete energy at all times. By means of redesigned energy arguments for a linearized problem combined with Banach's fixed-point argument, we show the well-posedness of the scheme, a priori error estimates, and robustness with respect to the strong damping parameter $\delta$. Moreover, the scheme preserves the asymptotic preserving property of the continuous problem; more precisely, we prove that the discrete solutions corresponding to $\delta&gt;0$ converge, in the singular vanishing dissipation limit, to the solution of the discrete inviscid problem. We use several numerical experiments in $(2 + 1)$-dimensions to validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Temporal-Assisted Beamforming and Trajectory Prediction in Sensing-Enabled UAV Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of high-speed communication, the shift from traditional pilot-based methods to a Sensing-Oriented Approach (SOA) is anticipated to gain momentum. This paper delves into the development of an innovative Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) framework, specifically tailored for beamforming and trajectory prediction processes. Central to this research is the exploration of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication system, which seamlessly integrates ISAC technology. This integration underscores the synergistic interplay between sensing and communication capabilities. The proposed system initially deploys omnidirectional beams for the sensing-focused phase, subsequently transitioning to directional beams for precise object tracking. This process incorporates an Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) methodology for the accurate estimation and prediction of object states. A novel frame structure is introduced, employing historical sensing data to optimize beamforming in real-time for subsequent time slots, a strategy we refer to as 'temporal-assisted' beamforming. To refine the temporal-assisted beamforming technique, we employ Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) in tandem with Iterative Rank Minimization (IRM), yielding high-quality suboptimal solutions. Comparative analysis with conventional pilot-based systems reveals that our approach yields a substantial improvement of 156\% in multi-object scenarios and 136\% in single-object scenarios.</description>

      <title>Point-set registration in bounded domains via the Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a point set registration method in bounded domains based on the solution to the Fokker Planck equation. Our approach leverages (i) density estimation based on Gaussian mixture models; (ii) a stabilized finite element discretization of the Fokker Planck equation; (iii) a specialized method for the integration of the particles. We review relevant properties of the Fokker Planck equation that provide the foundations for the numerical method. We discuss two strategies for the integration of the particles and we propose a regularization technique to control the distance of the particles from the boundary of the domain. We perform extensive numerical experiments for two two-dimensional model problems to illustrate the many features of the method.</description>

      <title>Accuracy Improvements for Convolutional and Differential Distance Function Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a bounded domain, we deal with the problem of estimating the distance function from the internal points of the domain to the boundary of the domain. Convolutional and differential distance estimation schemes are considered and, for both the schemes, accuracy improvements are proposed and evaluated. Asymptotics of Laplace integrals and Taylor series extrapolations are used to achieve the improvements.</description>

      <title>The Relation Between the EVD or SVD of Summands and the EVD or SVD of the Sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show how the eigenstructures of summands are related to that of the sum. In particular, we show that the sum of two positive semidefinite matrices can be written as the inner product of two block matrices $\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{PD}^2\mathbf{P}^T + \mathbf{QE}^2\mathbf{Q}^T = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{PD} &amp; \mathbf{QE} \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{PD} &amp; \mathbf{QE} \end{pmatrix}^T = \mathbf{Z}^T\mathbf{Z}$, such that the eigenvector decomposition of $\mathbf{C}$ can be obtained by projecting the eigenvectors from the block matrix product $\mathbf{ZZ}^T$ onto the block matrix $\mathbf{Z}^T = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{PD} &amp; \mathbf{QE} \end{pmatrix}$. Next, it is shown that the result can be used to rewrite the SVD of a matrix inner product $\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{Y}$, utilizing the eigenstructures of $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$. Finally, it is shown how this can be generalized to express the SVD of a sum of arbitrary matrices $\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{F} + \mathbf{G}$ in terms of the SVDs of the summands. The results may be useful in algorithms for eigendecomposition, specifically if the eigenproblem can be expressed in terms of a sum of matrices with simple eigenstructures as, e.g., in multi-omics research and generalized Procrustes analysis.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Regularized Optimal Transport in Information Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a scenario where a sender provides an information policy and a receiver, upon observing a realization of this policy, decides whether to take a particular action, such as making a purchase. The sender's objective is to maximize her utility derived from the receiver's action, and she achieves this by careful selection of the information policy. Building on the work of Kleiner et al., our focus lies specifically on information policies that are associated with power diagram partitions of the underlying domain. To address this problem, we employ entropy-regularized optimal transport, which enables us to develop an efficient algorithm for finding the optimal solution. We present experimental numerical results that highlight the qualitative properties of the optimal configurations, providing valuable insights into their structure. Furthermore, we extend our numerical investigation to derive optimal information policies for monopolists dealing with multiple products, where the sender discloses information about product qualities.</description>

      <title>High-Order Implicit Low-Rank Method with Spectral Deferred Correction for Matrix Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a low-rank method with high-order temporal accuracy using spectral deferred correction (SDC) to compute linear matrix differential equations. In [1], a low rank numerical method is proposed to correct the modeling error of the basis update and the Galerkin (BUG) method, which is a computational approach for DLRA. This method (merge-BUG/mBUG method) has been demonstrated to be first order convergent for general advection-diffusion problems.
  In this paper, we explore using SDC to elevate the convergence order of the mBUG method. In SDC, we start by computing a first-order solution by mBUG, and then perform successive updates by computing low-rank solutions to the Picard integral equation. Rather than a straightforward application of SDC with mBUG, we propose two aspects to improve computational efficiency. The first is to reduce the intermediate numerical rank by detailed analysis of dependence of truncation parameter on the correction levels. The second aspect is a careful choice of subspaces in the successive correction to avoid inverting large linear systems (from the K- and L-steps in BUG). We prove that the resulting scheme is high-order accurate for the Lipschitz continuous and bounded dynamical system. We consider numerical rank control in our framework by comparing two low-rank truncation strategies: the hard truncation strategy by truncated singular value decomposition and the soft truncation strategy by soft thresholding. We demonstrate numerically that soft thresholding offers better rank control in particular for higher-order schemes for weakly (or non-)dissipative problems.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic Dynamical Low-rank Approach for Charged Particle Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministically solving charged particle transport problems at a sufficient spatial and angular resolution is often prohibitively expensive, especially due to their highly forward peaked scattering. We propose a model order reduction approach which evolves the solution on a low-rank manifold in time, making computations feasible at much higher resolutions and reducing the overall run-time and memory footprint.
  For this, we use a hybrid dynamical low-rank approach based on a collided-uncollided split, i.e., the transport equation is split through a collision source method. Uncollided particles are described using a ray tracer, facilitating the inclusion of boundary conditions and straggling, whereas collided particles are represented using a moment method combined with the dynamical low-rank approximation. Here the energy is treated as a pseudo-time and a rank adaptive integrator is chosen to dynamically adapt the rank in energy. We can reproduce the results of a full-rank reference code at a much lower rank and thus computational cost and memory usage. The solution further achieves comparable accuracy with respect to TOPAS MC as previous deterministic approaches.</description>

      <title>A Practical Approach to Causal Inference over Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on estimating the causal effect of an intervention over time on a dynamical system. To that end, we formally define causal interventions and their effects over time on discrete-time stochastic processes (DSPs). Then, we show under which conditions the equilibrium states of a DSP, both before and after a causal intervention, can be captured by a structural causal model (SCM). With such an equivalence at hand, we provide an explicit mapping from vector autoregressive models (VARs), broadly applied in econometrics, to linear, but potentially cyclic and/or affected by unmeasured confounders, SCMs. The resulting causal VAR framework allows us to perform causal inference over time from observational time series data. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves strong performance in terms of observational forecasting while enabling accurate estimation of the causal effect of interventions on dynamical systems. We demonstrate, through a case study, the potential practical questions that can be addressed using the proposed causal VAR framework.</description>

      <title>Precision and Cholesky Factor Estimation for Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the estimation of large precision matrices and Cholesky factors obtained by observing a Gaussian process at many locations. Under general assumptions on the precision and the observations, we show that the sample complexity scales poly-logarithmically with the size of the precision matrix and its Cholesky factor. The key challenge in these estimation tasks is the polynomial growth of the condition number of the target matrices with their size. For precision estimation, our theory hinges on an intuitive local regression technique on the lattice graph which exploits the approximate sparsity implied by the screening effect. For Cholesky factor estimation, we leverage a block-Cholesky decomposition recently used to establish complexity bounds for sparse Cholesky factorization.</description>

      <title>Isogeometric Analysis for the Pricing of Financial Derivatives with Nonlinear Models: Convertible Bonds and Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational efficiency is essential for enhancing the accuracy and practicality of pricing complex financial derivatives. In this paper, we discuss Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) for valuing financial derivatives, modeled by two nonlinear Black-Scholes PDEs: the Leland model for European call with transaction costs and the AFV model for convertible bonds with default options. We compare the solutions of IGA with finite difference methods (FDM) and finite element methods (FEM). In particular, very accurate solutions can be numerically calculated on far less mesh (knots) than FDM or FEM, by using non-uniform knots and weighted cubic NURBS, which in turn reduces the computational time significantly.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality Reduction Techniques for Global Bayesian Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a state-of-the-art global optimisation technique for black-box problems where derivative information is unavailable, and sample efficiency is crucial. However, improving the general scalability of BO has proved challenging. Here, we explore Latent Space Bayesian Optimisation (LSBO), that applies dimensionality reduction to perform BO in a reduced-dimensional subspace. While early LSBO methods used (linear) random projections (Wang et al., 2013), we employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to manage more complex data structures and general DR tasks. Building on Grosnit et. al. (2021), we analyse the VAE-based LSBO framework, focusing on VAE retraining and deep metric loss. We suggest a few key corrections in their implementation, originally designed for tasks such as molecule generation, and reformulate the algorithm for broader optimisation purposes. Our numerical results show that structured latent manifolds improve BO performance. Additionally, we examine the use of the Mat\'{e}rn-$\frac{5}{2}$ kernel for Gaussian Processes in this LSBO context. We also integrate Sequential Domain Reduction (SDR), a standard global optimization efficiency strategy, into BO. SDR is included in a GPU-based environment using \textit{BoTorch}, both in the original and VAE-generated latent spaces, marking the first application of SDR within LSBO.</description>

Abstract: Polynomials known as Multiple Orthogonal Polynomials in a single variable are polynomials that satisfy orthogonality conditions concerning multiple measures and play a significant role in several applications such as Hermite-Pad\'e approximation, random matrix theory or integrable systems. However, this theory has only been studied in the univariate case. We give a generalization of Multiple Orthogonal Polynomials for two variables. Moreover, an extended version of some of the main properties are given. Additionally, some examples are given along the paper.</description>

      <title>Randomized matrix-free quadrature: unified and uniform bounds for stochastic Lanczos quadrature and the kernel polynomial method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze randomized matrix-free quadrature algorithms for spectrum and spectral sum approximation. The algorithms studied include the kernel polynomial method and stochastic Lanczos quadrature, two widely used methods for these tasks. Our analysis of spectrum approximation unifies and simplifies several one-off analyses for these algorithms which have appeared over the past decade. In addition, we derive bounds for spectral sum approximation which guarantee that, with high probability, the algorithms are simultaneously accurate on all bounded analytic functions. Finally, we provide comprehensive and complimentary numerical examples. These examples illustrate some of the qualitative similarities and differences between the algorithms, as well as relative drawbacks and benefits to their use on different types of problems.</description>

      <title>On single distribution lattice Boltzmann schemes for the approximation of Navier Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.13261v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution we study the formal ability of a multi-resolution-times lattice Boltzmann scheme to approximate isothermal and thermal compressible Navier Stokes equations with a single particle distribution. More precisely, we consider a total of 12 classical square lattice Boltzmann schemes with prescribed sets of conserved and nonconserved moments. The question is to determine the algebraic expressions of the equilibrium functions for the nonconserved moments and the relaxation parameters associated to each scheme. We compare the fluid equations and the result of the Taylor expansion method at second order accuracy for bidimensional examples with a maximum of 17 velocities and three-dimensional schemes with at most 33 velocities. In some cases, it is not possible to fit exactly the physical model. For several examples, we adjust the Navier Stokes equations and propose nontrivial expressions for the equilibria.</description>

      <title>Greedy construction of quadratic manifolds for nonlinear dimensionality reduction and nonlinear model reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction on quadratic manifolds augments linear approximations with quadratic correction terms. Previous works rely on linear approximations given by projections onto the first few leading principal components of the training data; however, linear approximations in subspaces spanned by the leading principal components alone can miss information that are necessary for the quadratic correction terms to be efficient. In this work, we propose a greedy method that constructs subspaces from leading as well as later principal components so that the corresponding linear approximations can be corrected most efficiently with quadratic terms.
  Properties of the greedily constructed manifolds allow applying linear algebra reformulations so that the greedy method scales to data points with millions of dimensions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that an orders of magnitude higher accuracy is achieved with the greedily constructed quadratic manifolds compared to manifolds that are based on the leading principal components alone.</description>

      <title>Locking-free hybrid high-order method for linear elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hybrid-high order (HHO) scheme has many successful applications including linear elasticity as the first step towards computational solid mechanics. The striking advantage is the simplicity among other higher-order nonconforming schemes and its geometric flexibility as a polytopal method on the expanse of a parameter-free refined stabilization. This paper utilizes just one reconstruction operator for the linear Green strain and therefore does not rely on a split in deviatoric and spherical behaviour as in the classical HHO discretization. The a priori error analysis provides quasi-best approximation with $\lambda$-independent equivalence constants. The reliable and (up to data oscillations) efficient a posteriori error estimates are stabilization-free and $\lambda$-robust. The error analysis is carried out on simplicial meshes to allow conforming piecewise polynomials finite elements in the kernel of the stabilization terms. Numerical benchmarks provide empirical evidence for optimal convergence rates of the a posteriori error estimator in some associated adaptive mesh-refining algorithm also in the incompressible limit, where this paper provides corresponding assertions for the Stokes problem.</description>

      <title>Nehari manifold optimization and its application for finding unstable solutions of semilinear elliptic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Nehari manifold optimization method (NMOM) is introduced for finding 1-saddles, i.e., saddle points with the Morse index equal to one, of a generic nonlinear functional in Hilbert spaces. Actually, it is based on the variational characterization that 1-saddles of this functional are local minimizers of the same functional restricted on the associated Nehari manifold. The framework contains two important ingredients: one is the retraction mapping to make the iterative points always lie on the Nehari manifold; the other is the tangential search direction to decrease the functional with suitable step-size search rules. Particularly, the global convergence is rigorously established by virtue of some crucial analysis techniques (including a weak convergence method) that overcome difficulties in the infinite-dimensional setting. In practice, combining with an easy-to-implement Nehari retraction and the negative Riemannian gradient direction, the NMOM is successfully applied to compute the unstable ground-state solutions of a class of typical semilinear elliptic PDEs, such as the H\'enon equation and the stationary nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. In particular, the symmetry-breaking phenomenon of the ground states of the H\'enon equation is explored numerically in 1D and 2D with interesting numerical findings on the critical value of the symmetry-breaking reported.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Runge-Kutta methods have an irreplaceable position among numerical methods designed to solve ordinary differential equations. Especially, implicit ones are suitable for approximating solutions of stiff initial value problems. We propose a new way of deriving coefficients of implicit Runge-Kutta methods. This approach based on repeated integrals yields both new and well-known Butcher's tableaux. We discuss the properties of newly derived methods and compare them with standard collocation implicit Runge-Kutta methods in a series of numerical experiments, including the Prothero-Robinson problem.</description>

      <title>A priori and a posteriori error estimates for discontinuous Galerkin time-discrete methods via maximal regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The maximal regularity property of discontinuous Galerkin methods for linear parabolic equations is used together with variational techniques to establish a priori and a posteriori error estimates of optimal order under optimal regularity assumptions. The analysis is set in the maximal regularity framework of UMD Banach spaces. Similar results were proved in an earlier work, based on the consistency analysis of Radau IIA methods. The present error analysis, which is based on variational techniques, is of independent interest, but the main motivation is that it extends to nonlinear parabolic equations; in contrast to the earlier work. Both autonomous and nonautonomous linear equations are considered.</description>

      <title>A Semidiscrete Lagrangian-Eulerian scheme for the LWR traffic model with discontinuous flux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a semi-discrete scheme to approximate solutions to the scalar LWR traffic model with spatially discontinuous flux, described by the equation $u_t + (k(x)u(1-u))_x = 0$. This approach is based on the Lagrangian-Eulerian method proposed by E. Abreu, J. Francois, W. Lambert, and J. Perez [J. Comp. Appl. Math. 406 (2022) 114011] for scalar conservation laws. We derive a non-uniform bound on the growth rate of the total variation for approximate solutions. Since the total variation can explode only at $x=0$, we can provide a convergence proof for our scheme in $BV_{loc}(\mathbb{R}\setminus \lbrace 0 \rbrace)$ by using Helly's compactness theorem.</description>

      <title>Parameter optimization for restarted mixed precision iterative sparse solver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing the parameter of a two-stage algorithm for approximate solution of a system of linear algebraic equations with a sparse $n\times n$-matrix, i.e., with one in which the number of nonzero elements is $m\!=\!O(n)$. The two-stage algorithm uses conjugate gradient method at its stages. At the 1st stage, an approximate solution with accuracy $\varepsilon_1$ is found for zero initial vector. All numerical values used at this stage are represented as single-precision numbers. The obtained solution is used as initial approximation for an approximate solution with a given accuracy $\varepsilon_2$ that we obtain at the 2nd stage, where double-precision numbers are used. Based on the values of some matrix parameters, computed in a time not exceeding $O(m)$, we need to determine the value $\varepsilon_1$ which minimizes the total computation time at two stages.
  Using single-precision numbers for computations at the 1st stage is advantageous, since the execution time of one iteration will be approximately half that of one iteration at the 2nd stage. At the same time, using machine numbers with half the mantissa length accelerates the growth of the rounding error per iteration of the conjugate gradient method at the 1st stage, which entails an increase in the number of iterations performed at 2nd stage.
  As parameters that allow us to determine $\varepsilon_1$ for the input matrix, we use $n$, $m$, an estimate of the diameter of the graph associated with the matrix, an estimate of the spread of the matrix' eigenvalues, and estimates of its maximum eigenvalue. The optimal or close to the optimal value of $\varepsilon_1$ can be determined for matrix with such a vector of parameters using the nearest neighbor regression or some other type of regression.</description>

      <title>On action ground states of defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the action ground states of the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with and without rotation. Our primary focus is on characterizing the relationship between the action ground states and the energy ground states. Theoretically, we prove a complete equivalence of the two in the non-rotating case and a conditional equivalence in the rotating case. Our theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical experiments. Notably, in the rotating case, we provide numerical examples of non-equivalence showing that non-equivalence typically occurs at the transition points where the number of vortices in the action ground state is increasing. Additionally, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the action ground states and the associated physical quantities in certain limiting parameter regimes, with numerical results validating and complementing our analysis. Furthermore, we explore the formation and change of the vortex pattern in the action ground states numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00686v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a Bayesian approach to testing hypotheses in statistical inverse problems. Based on the posterior distribution $\Pi \left(\cdot |Y = y\right)$, we want to infer whether a feature $\langle\varphi, u^\dagger\rangle$ of the unknown quantity of interest $u^\dagger$ is positive. This can be done by the so-called maximum a posteriori test. We provide a frequentistic analysis of this test's properties such as level and power, and prove that it is a regularized test in the sense of Kretschmann et al. (2024). Furthermore we provide lower bounds for its power under classical spectral source conditions in case of Gaussian priors. Numerical simulations illustrate its superior performance both in moderately and severely ill-posed situations.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the SiMPL method for density-based topology optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous convergence analysis of a new method for density-based topology optimization: Sigmoidal Mirror descent with a Projected Latent variable. SiMPL, pronounced like "simple," provides point-wise bound preserving design updates and faster convergence than other popular first-order topology optimization methods. Due to its strong bound preservation, the method is exceptionally robust, as demonstrated in numerous examples here and in the companion article. Furthermore, it is easy to implement with clear structure and analytical expressions for the updates. Our analysis covers two versions of the method, characterized by the employed line search strategies. We consider a modified Armijo backtracking line search and a Bregman backtracking line search. For both line search algorithms, SiMPL delivers a strict monotone decrease in the objective function and further intuitive convergence properties, e.g., strong and pointwise convergence of the density variables on the active sets, norm convergence to zero of the increments, convergence of the Lagrange multipliers, and more. In addition, the numerical experiments demonstrate apparent mesh-independent convergence of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Simulating incompressible flows over complex geometries using the shifted boundary method with incomplete adaptive octree meshes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the shifted boundary method (SBM) to the simulation of incompressible fluid flow using immersed octree meshes. Previous work on SBM for fluid flow primarily utilized two- or three-dimensional unstructured tetrahedral grids. Recently, octree grids have become an essential component of immersed CFD solvers, and this work addresses this gap and the associated computational challenges. We leverage an optimal (approximate) surrogate boundary constructed efficiently on incomplete and adaptive octree meshes. The resulting framework enables the simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in complex geometries without requiring boundary-fitted grids. Simulations of benchmark tests in two and three dimensions demonstrate that the Octree-SBM framework is a robust, accurate, and efficient approach to simulating fluid dynamics problems with complex geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in proving discretization bounds for sampling under isoperimetry and for diffusion models. As data size grows, reducing the iteration cost becomes an important goal. Inspired by the great success of the parallel simulation of the initial value problem in scientific computation, we propose parallel Picard methods for sampling tasks. Rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that our algorithm achieves better dependence on dimension $d$ than prior works in iteration complexity (i.e., reduced from $\widetilde{O}(\log^2 d)$ to $\widetilde{O}(\log d)$), which is even optimal for sampling under isoperimetry with specific iteration complexity. Our work highlights the potential advantages of simulation methods in scientific computation for dynamics-based sampling and diffusion models.</description>
