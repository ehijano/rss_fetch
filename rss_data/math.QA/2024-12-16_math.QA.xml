      <title>Formal Languages and TQFTs with Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A construction that assigns a Boolean 1D TQFT with defects to a finite state automaton was recently developed by Gustafson, Im, Kaldawy, Khovanov, and Lihn. We show that the construction is functorial with respect to the category of finite state automata with transducers as morphisms. Certain classes of subregular languages correspond to additional cohomological structures on the associated TQFTs. We also show that the construction generalizes to context-free grammars through a categorical version of the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger representation theorem, due to Melli\`es and Zeilberger. The corresponding TQFTs are then described as morphisms of colored operads on an operad of cobordisms with defects.</description>

      <title>Codes in algebras of direct products of groups and associated quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain the Wedderburn-Artin decomposition of a semisimple group algebra associated to a direct product of finite groups. We also provide formulae for the number of all possible group codes, and their dimensions, that can be constructed in a group algebra. As particular cases, we present the complete algebraic description of the group algebra of any direct product of groups whose direct factors are cyclic, dihedral, or generalised quaternion groups. Finally, in the specific case of semisimple dihedral group algebras, we give a method to build quantum error-correcting codes, based on the CSS construction.</description>

      <title>Solutions of tetrahedron equation from quantum cluster algebra associated with symmetric butterfly quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new solution to the tetrahedron equation by further pursuing the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum $Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four products of quantum dilogarithms, incorporating a total of seven parameters. By exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by Kapranov-Voevodsky ('94) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring, Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev ('10) from a quantum geometry perspective, Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama ('23) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima ('23) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D $R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster algebra.</description>

      <title>Operator algebra and algorithmic construction of boundaries and defects in (2+1)D topological Pauli stabilizer codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computational algorithm for constructing all boundaries and defects of topological generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two spatial dimensions. Utilizing the operator algebra formalism, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the topological data-such as anyon types, fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics-of (2+1)D bulk stabilizer codes and (1+1)D boundary anomalous subsystem codes. To make the operator algebra computationally accessible, we adapt Laurent polynomials and convert the tasks into matrix operations, e.g., the Hermite normal form for obtaining boundary anyons and the Smith normal form for determining fusion rules. This approach enables computers to automatically generate all possible gapped boundaries and defects for topological Pauli stabilizer codes through boundary anyon condensation and topological order completion. This streamlines the analysis of surface codes and associated logical operations for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our algorithm applies to $Z_d$ qudits, including both prime and nonprime $d$, thus enabling the exploration of topological quantum codes beyond toric codes. We have applied the algorithm and explicitly demonstrated the lattice constructions of 2 boundaries and 6 defects in the $Z_2$ toric code, 3 boundaries and 22 defects in the $Z_4$ toric code, 1 boundary and 2 defects in the double semion code, 1 boundary and 22 defects in the six-semion code, 6 boundaries and 270 defects in the color code, and 6 defects in the anomalous three-fermion code. In addition, we investigate the boundaries of two specific bivariate bicycle codes within a family of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We demonstrate that their topological orders are equivalent to 8 and 10 copies of $Z_2$ toric codes, with anyons restricted to move by 12 and 1023 lattice sites in the square lattice, respectively.</description>
