      <title>Electromechanical Coupling Coefficient: New Approach to Study Auxetic Piezoelectric Harvesters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel methodology to assess the performance of Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters (PEHs) in order to study auxetic enhancement possibilities. For this purpose, a new approach for evaluating the intrinsic effective Electromechanical Coupling Coefficient (EMCC) of piezoelectric layers is presented. As the current assessment methods are questioned under resonance exposures, theoretical models are presented to suggest what characteristics the harvested power will depend on. A two axis graph is introduced to enable the comparison of different PEHs. The method is finally applied to PEHs with different types of substrates: filled, hollow and auxetic. First results show that, generally, auxetic structures might not increase the intrinsic EMCC but only improve the elastic energy ratio in the piezoelectric layers.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear phononics in Bi$_2$Te$_3$ from first-principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations not only allow to predict the vibrational and optical properties of solids but also to understand and disentangle the mechanisms playing a key role in the generation of coherent optical phonons. Recent experiments performed on a Bi$_2$Te$_3$ nanofilm have shown that a THz pulse launches at least a coherent $A_{1g}^1$ phonon as the transient transmittance measured using an isotropic detection scheme displays oscillations with a frequency matching the frequency of the $A_{1g}^1$ mode measured in Raman experiments. Such an observation can be explained by invoking either a sum frequency process or cubic/quartic phonon-phonon couplings as considered for Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a parent compound of Bi$_2$Te$_3$. By resorting to group theory and calculating energy surfaces from first-principles, the main phonon-phonon couplings can be identified. Furthermore, a minimal model can be built to compute the dynamics of the Raman active modes coupled to the infrared active mode driven by the experimental THz pulse. Our model firmly establishes that cubic phonon-phonon interactions are relevant as the agreement between the computed and experimental transmittance is noteworthy.</description>

      <title>Capturing spin-torque effects with a semilocal exchange-correlation functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We cure the lack of spin torque in semilocal exchange-correlation (XC) functionals by treating XC effects in the framework of spin-current-density-functional theory (SCDFT), and present the implementation of the first kind of this novel family of XC functionals in the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP): An SCDFT functional featuring a U(1)$\times$SU(2) gauge-invariant $2\times 2$ XC potential. While the framework can be applied to other XC functionals, the presented flavor of the SCDFT functional is based on Becke-Roussel exchange and Colle-Salvetti correlation. In addition to the $2\times 2$ spin density and kinetic-energy density, the XC functional depends on the $2\times 2$ spin-current density. The implementation requires the computation of the spin-current density within the projector-augmented-wave method and the variation of the XC energy with respect to it. The application to a Cr$_3$ molecule and bulk MnO reveals (i) spin torque of the same order as obtained by methods including exact exchange, (ii) a counterintuitive contribution to the energy even in collinear ferromagnetic systems without spin-orbit coupling due to the gradient of the magnetization, and (iii) a similar computational cost per electronic step as calculations that depend on, inter alia, the kinetic-energy density, but convergence within fewer electronic steps.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Identifying Grain Boundaries in Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) Images of Nanoparticle Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoparticle superlattices consisting of ordered arrangements of nanoparticles exhibit unique optical, magnetic, and electronic properties arising from nanoparticle characteristics as well as their collective behaviors. Understanding how processing conditions influence the nanoscale arrangement and microstructure is critical for engineering materials with desired macroscopic properties. Microstructural features such as grain boundaries, lattice defects, and pores significantly affect these properties but are challenging to quantify using traditional manual analyses as they are labor-intensive and prone to errors. In this work, we present a machine learning workflow for automating grain segmentation in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of nanoparticle superlattices. This workflow integrates signal processing techniques, such as Radon transforms, with unsupervised learning methods like agglomerative hierarchical clustering to identify and segment grains without requiring manually annotated data. In the workflow we transform the raw pixel data into explainable numerical representation of superlattice orientations for clustering. Benchmarking results demonstrate the workflow's robustness against noisy images and edge cases, with a processing speed of four images per minute on standard computational hardware. This efficiency makes the workflow scalable to large datasets and makes it a valuable tool for integrating data-driven models into decision-making processes for material design and analysis. For example, one can use this workflow to quantify grain size distributions at varying processing conditions like temperature and pressure and using that knowledge adjust processing conditions to achieve desired superlattice orientations and grain sizes.</description>

      <title>Novel magnetic-field-free switching behavior in vdW-magnet/oxide heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetization switching by charge current without a magnetic field is essential for device applications and information technology. It generally requires a current-induced out-of-plane spin polarization beyond the capability of conventional ferromagnet/heavy-metal systems, where the current-induced spin polarization aligns in-plane orthogonal to the in-plane charge current and out-of-plane spin current. Here, we demonstrate a new approach for magnetic-field-free switching by fabricating a van-der-Waals magnet and oxide Fe3GeTe2/SrTiO3 heterostructure. This new magnetic-field-free switching is possible because the current-driven accumulated spins at the Rashba interface precess around an emergent interface magnetism, eventually producing an ultimate out-of-plane spin polarization. This interpretation is further confirmed by the switching polarity change controlled by the in-plane initialization magnetic fields with clear hysteresis. We successfully combined van-der-Waals magnet and oxide for the first time, especially taking advantage of spin-orbit torque on the SrTiO3 oxide. This allows us to establish a new way of magnetic field-free switching. Our work demonstrates an unusual perpendicular switching application of large spin Hall angle materials and precession of accumulated spins, and in doing so, opens up a new field and opportunities for van-der-Waals magnets and oxide spintronics.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Studies of Novel Magnetic Materials in Borides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Borides are a versatile material family with various properties for valuable applications. Conventional magnetism, such as ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism in borides, have been extensively studied. However, research on unconventional magnetism in borides where quantum effects are dominant is scarce. Here, we implement a high-throughput workflow combining first-principles calculations, materials prediction, and magnetic properties calculations to discover novel magnetism and magnetic materials in borides. Successfully applying the workflow, we report three families of novel magnetic borides, including two families of borides exhibiting quantum magnetism. One is a family of dimerized quantum magnets among YCrB$_4$-type borides, which provides a rare platform for studying the spin-gap quantum critical point. The other is a family of altermagnets among FeMo$_2$B$_2$-type borides, extending the magnetic orderings exhibited by borides beyond conventional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. We also predict a family of magnetic laminate transition metal borides, known as the MAB phases, in the AlFe$_2$B$_2$-type family, which provide pure-phase or alloying candidates for studying magnetocaloric materials and the associated magnetic transitions. The workflow is expected to be used in further studies of novel magnetism and magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>The electronic structure, crystal fields, and magnetic anisotropy in RECo$_5$ magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current progress in the description of the electronic structure and magnetic properties of rare-earth-based magnets is discussed. We show the typical values of critical parameters that define the physics of these materials for RECo$_5$ (RE = rare earth atom) using several currently popular electronic structure methods. The magnetic moments and magnetic anisotropy of 4\textit{f} atoms are obtained using several different approaches, including the total energy in constrained DFT and crystal field theory in DFT+HI methods. We also propose a Hund's rule constrained density functional method for the studies of the ground and excited states of magnets containing rare earth atoms. The method is applied to the RECo$_5$ family of magnets. The applicability and future extensions are discussed. The technique is suitable for high-throughput computational searches of new rare-earth-containing magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Defect Phonon Renormalization during Nonradiative Multiphonon Transitions in Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a typical nonradiative multiphonon transition in semiconductors, carrier capture at defects is critical to the performance of semiconductor devices. Its transition rate is usually calculated using the equal-mode approximation, which assumes that phonon modes and frequencies remain unchanged before and after the transition. Using the carbon substitutional defect ($\text{C}_\text{N}$) in GaN as a benchmark, here we demonstrate that the phonon renormalization can be significant during defect relaxation, which causes errors as large as orders of magnitude in the approximation. To address this issue, we consider (i) Duschinsky matrix connecting the initial-state and final-state phonons, which accounts for the changes in phonon modes and frequencies; and (ii) the off-diagonal contributions in total transition matrix element, which incorporates the cross terms of electron-phonon interactions between different modes. With this improvement, the calculated transition rates show agreements with experimental results within an order of magnitude. We believe the present method makes one step forward for the accurate calculation of multiphonon transition rate, especially in cases with large defect relaxations.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous MOKE imaging and measurement of magneto-resistance with vector magnet: a low noise customized setup for low field magnetic devices and thin films characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report a custom design setup for the simultaneous measurement of magneto-resistance and MOKE imaging in longitudinal configuration for characterization of magnetic thin-films and sensors. The setup is designed so as to cope with a small signal to noise ratio of initial images and to allow sensitive magnetoresistance (MR) measurement at low field. An improved differential algorithm is used to get a good enough contrast of the magnetic images and get rid of beam illumination or small camera gain fluctuations. Home made power supply and pre-amplifier stage were designed so as to reduce the low frequency noise as well as the thermal electrical noise. A vector magnet is used to produce rotational magnetic field so as to study the magnetic anisotropy and calculate the anisotropic constants in magnetic thin films. Magnetoresistive sensors patterned on epitaxial La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) thin film have been characterized with this setup. The Images of the magnetization reversal process as well as the local magnetization loops deduced from these images provided evidence of a magnetic uniaxial anisotropy induced by the vicinal substrate. The magnetic anistropic constant of the films was then inferred from the MR measurements.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Reversal of Stability in Mo-containing Oxides: A Difficult Case Exhibiting Sensitivity to DFT+U and Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate predictions of the properties of transition metal oxides using density functional theory (DFT) calculations are essential for the computational design of energy materials. In this work, we investigate the anomalous reversal of the stability of structural distortions (where distorted structures go from being energetically favorable to sharply unfavorable relative to undistorted ones) induced by DFT+U on Mo d-orbitals in layered AMoO$_2$ (A = Li, Na, K) and rutile-like MoO$_2$. We highlight the significant impact of varying U$_{\text{eff}}$ values on the structural stability, convex hull, and thermodynamic stability predictions, noting that deviations can reach up to the order of 100 meV/atom across these energetic quantities. We find the transitions in stability are coincident with changes in the electron localization and magnetic behavior. The anomalous reversal persists across PBE, r$^2$SCAN functionals, and also with vdW-dispersion energy corrections (PBE+D3). In Mo-containing oxide systems, high U$_{\text{eff}}$ leads to inaccurate descriptions of physical quantities and structural relaxations under artificial symmetry constraints, as demonstrated by the phonon band structures, the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional results, and comparisons with experimental structural data. We conclude that high U$_{\text{eff}}$ values (around 4 eV and above, depending on the specific structures and compositions) might be unsuitable for energetic predictions in A-Mo-O chemical spaces. Our results suggest that the common practice of applying DFT+U to convex hull constructions, especially with high U$_{\text{eff}}$ values derived from fittings, should be carefully evaluated to ensure that ground states are correctly reproduced, with careful consideration of dynamic stability and possible energetically favorable distortions.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy of amorphous ternary phase diagrams: the importance of interaction parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase diagrams offer a comprehensive representation of the thermodynamics of multi-component systems. However, for ternary amorphous systems, the different possible phase diagram types and their existence conditions are still unclear. Based on the systematic screening of the parameter space for three amorphous ternary material systems representative of polymer, small molecule, and solvent materials, we report identifying twenty-one phase diagram types generated using Flory-Huggins theory. The proposed classification relies on the number of immiscible material pairs, distinct miscibility gaps, and three-phase regions. We infer existence rules by mapping the type of phase diagram to the range of interaction parameters in the three-dimensional parameter space. Depending on the number of immiscible pairs (0, 1, 2, or 3), four well-known phase-diagram types are found to be very likely. However, numerous uncommon phase diagrams are observed within a small parameter window around the critical interaction parameter values. Regarding the processability window, the size of the miscible region becomes sensitive to interaction parameter variations, mainly when they are close to critical values. The sensitivity decreases for materials with increasing molar size. Finally, the paper includes a successful comparison of simulated phase diagrams with experimental data, showcasing the real-world relevance of this theoretical analysis and its applicability for optimizing solution processing methods efficiently.</description>

      <title>Catalytic activity of Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr high entropy alloy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is a promising material for hydrogen storage because of its abundance and beneficial properties, such as high storage capacity and cost-effectiveness under mild conditions. Despite of these benefits, MgH2 unfavorable thermodynamics and kinetics make it difficult to use in real applications. In this work, the hydrogen storage properties of MgH2have been improved using Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr high entropy alloy (HEA) based catalysts, which has been synthesized via mechanical alloying. The experimental findings show that the beginning desorption temperature of MgH2significantly lowered from 425{\deg}C to 180{\deg}C by adding 5 wt. % Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr HEA in MgH2. Moreover, the catalyst shows enhanced kinetics, attaining 7.3 wt. % hydrogen absorption in 3 minutes at 320{\deg}C with 15 atm hydrogen pressure, and ~5 wt. % desorption in 6 minutes at 320{\deg}C. These results highlight, how much lower its desorption temperature is than those of other well-known catalysts. Over a span of 25 cycles, MgH2 catalyzed by Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr HEA exhibits remarkable cyclic stability with negligible fluctuations (~ 0.05 wt. %).After a thorough characterization of the materials, a workable catalytic mechanism for HEA was proposed in light of the results.</description>

      <title>Single-Atom Catalysis: An Opportunity For Surface Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, extensive research into single-atom catalysts (SACs) has revealed that the catalytic behavior of metal adatoms is highly dependent on how they interact with their support. A strong dependence on the local coordination environment has led to comparisons with metal-organic complexes, and there is growing excitement about the potential to fine-tune SACs by controlling the adsorption geometry. The rise of computational screening to identify the optimal support-metal combinations underscores the need for rigorous benchmarking of theoretical methods, to validate realistic geometries, mechanisms, and the impact of adsorption on stability and catalytic activity. The surface science approach is particularly well-suited for this task because it allows to precisely determine the geometry of the metal atom and interpret its catalytic behavior. Moreover, the effects of temperature and molecular adsorption on the model catalysts stability can be studied in isolation, and conclusions drawn from UHV studies tested in increasingly common near-ambient pressure and electrochemical setups. This perspective highlights recent breakthroughs and specific systems, including metal oxides, metal-organic frameworks, and carbon nitrides, where insights from surface science experiments can significantly advance understanding in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Designing Guidance for Multiple Valley-based Topological States Driven by Magnetic Substrates: Potential Applications at High Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Valley-based topological phases offer a wealth of exotic quantum states with tunable functionalities, driven by the valley degree of freedom. In this work, by constructing heterostructures of germanene (silicene, stanene) on various magnetic substrates, we address key tuning factors such as the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength of the substrate, magnetic orientations, and stacking orders, all of which govern multiple valley-based topological features. We present a comprehensive guiding principle for the efficient manipulation of these features, achieved simply by designing and modulating the magnetic properties of the underlying substrates. Specifically, increasing the SOC strength of the magnetic substrate acilitates a range of topological phase transitions characterized by different Chern numbers, with many systems exhibiting a transition from quantum valley Hall to quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. Additionally, rotating the in-plane magnetic orientation of the substrate enables tunability of the Chern number and chirality, within a moderate range of SOC strength. Furthermore, the antiferromagnetic coupling of the magnetic substrate can induce valley-based QAH states with substantial valley gaps, leveraging its high Curie temperature (TC) to enable the realization of multiple tunable magnetic topologies at elevated temperatures. Our findings provide a straightforward strategy for the design and manipulation of spintronic and valleytronic devices that can potentially operate under high-temperature conditions.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Discovery of Vanadium Oxide Compositions: A WGAN-VAE Framework for Materials Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of novel materials with tailored electronic properties is crucial for advancing modern device technologies, yet traditional approaches rely on time-consuming empirical methods. We present an inverse design framework combining enhanced Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with specialized Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to accelerate stable vanadium oxide (V-O) discovery for electronic applications. Our framework introduces a WGAN architecture with integrated stability constraints and formation energy predictions, plus a refined VAE utilizing voxel-based representation that captures atomic positions and lattice parameters while maintaining chemical validity. Applying this framework, we generated 451 unique V-O compositions, with 91 structures identified as stable and 44 as metastable under rigorous thermodynamic criteria, including novel V2O3 configurations below the Materials Project convex hull. Electronic structure analysis using spin-polarized DFT+U calculations revealed distinct electronic behaviors, including promising half-metallic characteristics for spintronics and quantum computing applications. Our approach achieves approximately 20% stability rate under strict criteria compared to previous benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness for accelerated materials discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence into various domains is rapidly increasing, with Large Language Models (LLMs) becoming more prevalent in numerous applications. This work is included in an overall project which aims to train an LLM specifically in the field of materials science. To assess the impact of this specialized training, it is essential to establish the baseline performance of existing LLMs in materials science. In this study, we evaluated 15 different LLMs using the MaScQA question answering (Q&amp;A) benchmark. This benchmark comprises questions from the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE), tailored to test models' capabilities in answering questions related to materials science and metallurgical engineering. Our results indicate that closed-source LLMs, such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4, perform the best with an overall accuracy of ~84%, while the open-source models, Llama3-70b and Phi3-14b, top at ~56% and ~43%, respectively. These findings provide a baseline for the raw capabilities of LLMs on Q&amp;A tasks applied to materials science, and emphasize the substantial improvement that could be brought to open-source models via prompt engineering and fine-tuning strategies. We anticipate that this work could push the adoption of LLMs as valuable assistants in materials science, demonstrating their utility in this specialized domain and related sub-domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic memories, with small dimension, fast speed and long retention features, are considered as promising candidates for massive data archiving. In order to satisfy the re-quirements for ultra-low power and high-security information storage, we design a concep-tual molecular hard-disk (HDD) logic scheme that is capable to execute in-situ encryption of massive data in pW/bit power-consumption range. Beneficial from the coupled mechanism of counter-balanced redox reaction and local ion drifting, the basic HDD unit consisting of ~ 200 self-assembled RuXLPH molecules in a monolayer (SAM) configuration undergoes unique conductance modulation with continuous, symmetric and low-power switching char-acteristics. 96-state memory performance, which allows 6-bit data storage and single-unit one-step XOR operation, is realized in the RuXLPH SAM sample. Through single-unit XOR manipulation of the pixel information, in-situ bitwise encryption of the Mogao Grottoes mural images stored in the molecular HDD is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Greedy Algorithm Solver Using Magnetic Tunneling Junctions for Traveling Salesman Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are foundational challenges in fields such as artificial intelligence, logistics, and network design. Traditional algorithms, including greedy methods and dynamic programming, often struggle to balance computational efficiency and solution quality, particularly as problem complexity scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel and efficient probabilistic optimization framework that integrates true random number generators (TRNGs) based on spin-transfer torque magnetic tunneling junctions (STT-MTJs). The inherent stochastic switching behavior of STT-MTJs enables dynamic configurability of random number distributions, which we leverage to introduce controlled randomness into a probabilistic greedy algorithm. By tuning a temperature parameter, our algorithm seamlessly transitions between deterministic and stochastic strategies, effectively balancing exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, we apply this framework to the traveling salesman problem (TSP), showcasing its ability to consistently produce high-quality solutions across diverse problem scales. Our algorithm demonstrates superior performance in both solution quality and convergence speed compared to classical approaches, such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. Specifically, in larger TSP instances involving up to 70 cities, it retains its performance advantage, achieving near-optimal solutions with fewer iterations and reduced computational costs. This work highlights the potential of integrating MTJ-based TRNGs into optimization algorithms, paving the way for future applications in probabilistic computing and hardware-accelerated optimization.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate quantum magnet based on 4f-electron in a zigzag spin-1/2 chain of YbCuS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed high-resolution powder neutron diffraction experiments and discovered an elliptic helical incommensurate magnetic structure in the semiconducting rare-earth magnet YbCuS2, featuring effective spin-1/2 Yb$^{3+}$ ions that form a zigzag chain. Upon cooling the sample to 0.2 K, we observed very weak magnetic peaks indexed with an incommensurate propagation vector k = [0, 0.305, 0] along the zigzag chain. The magnitude of the magnetic moment is at least one-third smaller than the expected value for the Yb$^{3+}$ Kramers doublet ground state. In an applied magnetic field, up-up-down magnetic order was observed at 7.5 T, characterized by diffraction peaks indexed with k = [0, 1/3, 0] and substantial uniform magnetic components. These observations agree well with theoretical calculations based on the density matrix renormalization group for a zigzag spin-1/2 model with isotropic Heisenberg interactions and off-diagonal symmetric $\Gamma$-type exchange interactions derived from material parameters. The theory elucidates the quantum mechanical nature of the incommensurate magnetism as remnant off-diagonal spin correlations in a nematic dimer-singlet state.</description>

Abstract: Three-dimensional quantum spin liquids have remained elusive, hindered by reduced quantum fluctuations from larger lattice connectivity inherent to high-dimensional systems. Here, we investigate the remarkable persistence of dynamical short-range magnetic correlations in the nearly body-centered cubic garnet NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$ down to $T = 50$ mK, two orders of magnitude below its Curie-Weiss temperature. Using a combination of neutron and muon spectroscopies plus numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a spin-liquid phase emerges from the interplay of strongly frustrated exchange interactions and subtle temperature-dependent Jahn-Teller spin-lattice effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth spin ensembles are a promising platform for microwave quantum memory applications due to their hyperfine transitions, which can exhibit exceptionally long coherence times when using an operation point with zero first-order Zeeman (ZEFOZ) shift. In this work, we use broadband electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy on $^{167}$Er:$^{7}$LiYF$_4$ single crystals at sub-Kelvin temperatures. By fitting the spin Hamiltonian to the zero-field spectrum, we obtain refined parameters of the magnetic field-independent interactions, such as the hyperfine and quadrupole interaction. We also study the influence of the quadrupole interaction on the hyperfine splitting in the zero and low magnetic field range by analyzing EPR-spectra between \SI{0}{\milli\tesla} and \SI{50}{\milli\tesla}. %We further analyze the linewidth narrowing of a hyperfine transition around its ZEFOZ point. Our findings highlight the broadband EPR spectroscopy approach as a powerful tool for the precise determination of the spin Hamiltonian parameters and for the characterization of hyperfine transitions in terms of their selection rules and linewidth.</description>

      <title>Magnetization nutation in magnetic semiconductors: Effective spin model with anisotropic RKKY exchange interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03098v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the magnetization in magnetic semiconductors exhibits nutational motion when subjected to an external magnetic field. This behavior originates from the splitting of the conduction-electron band which induces anisotropic, distance-dependent exchange coupling between localized spins.
  To investigate this phenomenon, we examine a general system that includes both charge and spin degrees of freedom, characteristic of a magnetic semiconductor. This system is composed of two subsystems: (1) a gas of noninteracting conduction electrons and (2) a ferromagnetic array of localized spins, coupled through the Vonsovskii (\textit{sd}) local interaction. The entire system is subject to external electrical and magnetic disturbances. Through the Feynman-Schwinger formalism, we integrate out the faster (Grassmann) charge degrees of freedom associated with the conduction electrons to obtain the effective Hamiltonian for the localized spins in the form of an XXZ spin model. We then provide general analytical formulas for the corresponding anisotropic exchange couplings, expressed in Fourier and direct spaces, as functions of the effective field that induces conduction-band splitting.
  ....
  We hope this study will motivate further research into nutational phenomena in magnetic semiconductors, possibly resulting in improvements in the accurate control of magnetization dynamics within spin-based electronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ferroelectric domain structure of a freestanding BiFeO$_3$ film was visualized by ptychographic dichroic imaging with linearly polarized X-rays at the O K-edge around 530 eV. The dichroic contrast is maximized at the energy of the hybridization of the O 2p state and the Fe 3d orbitals, which is split by the octahedral crystal field of the perovskite structure. The microscopy images thus obtained complement the ptychographic imaging of the antiferromagnetic contribution at the Fe L$_3$-edge. The approach can be extended to the separation of different ferroic contributions in other multiferroic oxides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we use multislice electron ptychography to quantify damage introduced by ion implantation of Er into 4H-SiC. Comparing reconstructed volumes from experiment (each 2,000 nm$^{3}$) along the implantation direction, the crystal damage is quantified and compared to pristine SiC. Using simulations, we establish that the implantation-induced static displacements limit both Er dopant and silicon vacancy detection. The corresponding damage in the experiment is found to occur up a depth of 100 nm and significantly deeper than expected from implantation simulations, ignoring crystallography. Beyond this depth, we show that silicon vacancies can be identified within the sampled volume and used to measure their local strain. Overall, these results underscore the power of multislice electron ptychography to quantify the impacts of implantation and as a tool to help guide electronic device process optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental aspect of physics of ferroelectric materials is the screening of uncompensated bound charges by the dissociative adsorption of ionic charges from the environment. The adsorption of ions can be especially strong when the ferroelectric undergoes the temperature-induced transition from the paraelectric phase to the ferroelectric state. Here we demonstrate that the adsorption of ions and free radicals by the polar surface of ferroelectric nanoparticles can be very efficient in aqueous solutions due to the strong ferro-ionic coupling in the nanoparticles. Obtained results can be useful for the elaboration of alternative methods and tools for adsorption of the cations (Li+, K+, Na+, etc.), anions (Cl-, Br-, J-), and/or free radicals (CO-, NH4+, etc.) from aqueous solutions by the lead-free uniaxial ferroelectric nanoparticles. The results may become an alternative way for the environment-friendly laboratory-scale purification of different aqueous solutions from ionic contamination using controllable cyclic temperature variations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based generative models have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex data distributions and generating high-fidelity samples, offering a transformative approach to efficiently explore the configuration space of crystalline materials. In this work, we present CrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model specifically developed for the generation of crystalline materials. CrystalFlow constructs Continuous Normalizing Flows to model lattice parameters, atomic coordinates, and/or atom types, which are trained using Conditional Flow Matching techniques. Through an appropriate choice of data representation and the integration of a graph-based equivariant neural network, the model effectively captures the fundamental symmetries of crystalline materials, which ensures data-efficient learning and enables high-quality sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that CrystalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard generation benchmarks, and exhibits versatile conditional generation capabilities including producing structures optimized for specific external pressures or desired material properties. These features highlight the model's potential to address realistic crystal structure prediction challenges, offering a robust and efficient framework for advancing data-driven research in condensed matter physics and material science.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnetism is a recently proposed class of collinear magnetism that combines the characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Altermagnets are predicted to exhibit anomalous transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, as observed in ferromagnets but with a vanishing net magnetic moment, akin to antiferromagnets. Despite the promising potential of altermagnetic materials for realizing these unique transport properties, progress has been limited due to the scarcity of metallic altermagnets. Motivated by the recent discovery of the altermagnetic metal CrSb, we conducted a systematic study of its electrical and thermoelectric transport properties, including the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, using first-principles calculations. Our findings indicate that CrSb exhibits low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, allowing for the manipulation of the N\'eel vector through an external electric field. We explored the anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities as functions of the N\'eel vector orientation, finding that both effects reach their maximum when the N\'eel vector is aligned along $\frac{1}{2}$\textbf{\textit{a}}+\textbf{\textit{b}}. The origins of both conductivities were analyzed in terms of Berry curvature distribution in the Brillouin zone. Our results illustrate the N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in an altermagnetic metal, offering an additional metallic altermagnetic platform to investigate anomalous transport properties, thereby complementing the widely studied RuO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Reducing disorder in PbTe nanowires for Majorana research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02132</link>

Abstract: Material challenges are the key issue in Majorana research where surface disorder constrains device performance. Here, we tackle this challenge by embedding PbTe nanowires within a lattice-constant-matched crystal. The wire edges are shaped by self-organized growth instead of lithography, resulting in nearly-atomic-flat facets along both cross-sectional and longitudinal directions. Quantized conductance is observed at zero magnetic field with channel lengths maximally reaching 1.7 $\mu$m, significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art of III-V nanowires (an order-of-magnitude improvement compared to InSb). Coupling PbTe to a Pb film unveils a flat interface spanning microns and a large superconducting gap of 1 meV. Our result not only represents a stride toward meeting the stringent low-disorder requirement for Majoranas, but may also open the door to various hybrid quantum devices requiring a low level of disorder.</description>

      <title>Origins of suppressed self-diffusion of nanoscale constituents of a complex liquid</title>

Abstract: The ability to understand and ultimately control the transformations and properties of various nanoscale systems, from proteins to synthetic nanomaterial assemblies, hinges on the ability to uncover their dynamics on their characteristic length and time scales. Here, we use MHz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to directly elucidate the characteristic microsecond-dynamics of density fluctuations of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), not only in a colloidal dispersion but also in a liquid phase consisting of densely packed, yet mobile, NCs with no long-range order. We find the wavevector-dependent fluctuation rates in the liquid phase are suppressed relative to those in the colloidal phase and relative to observations of densely packed repulsive particles. We show that the suppressed rates are due to a substantial decrease in the self-diffusion of NCs in the liquid phase, which we attribute to explicit attractive interactions. Using coarse-grained simulations, we find that the extracted shape and strength of the interparticle potential explains the stability of the liquid phase, in contrast to the gelation observed via XPCS in many other charged colloidal systems. This work opens the door to elucidating fast, condensed phase dynamics in complex fluids and other nanoscale soft matter, such as densely packed proteins and non-equilibrium self-assembly processes, in addition to designing microscopic strategies to avert gelation.</description>

      <title>Frustrated S = 1/2 Chains in One-Dimensional Correlated Metal Ti4MnBi2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic correlations lead to heavy quasiparticles in three-dimensional (3D) metals, and their collapse can destabilize magnetic moments. It is an open question whether there is an analogous instability in one-dimensional (1D) systems, unanswered due to the lack of metallic spin chain materials. We report neutron scattering measurements and Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations establishing spinons in the correlated metal Ti4MnBi2, confirming that its magnetism is 1D. Ti4MnBi2 is inherently frustrated, forming near a quantum critical point (QCP) separating different temperature T = 0 phases of the J1-J2 XXZ model. 1D magnetism dominates to the lowest T, and is barely affected by weak interchain coupling. Ti4MnBi2 is the first metallic spin chain where 3D conduction electrons become strongly correlated due to their coupling to 1D magnetic moments.</description>

      <title>Non-Majorana-origin of the half-integer conductance quantization elucidated by multi-terminal superconductor-quantum anomalous Hall insulator heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral one-dimensional transport can be realized in thin films of a surface-insulating ferromagnetic topological insulator called quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI). When superconducting (SC) pairing correlations are induced in the surface of such a material by putting an $s$-wave superconductor on the top, the resulting topological superconductivity gives rise to chiral Majorana edge-modes. A quantized two-terminal conductance of $\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$ was proposed as a smoking-gun evidence for the topological SC phase associated with a single chiral Majorana edge-mode. There have been experiments to address this proposal, but the conclusion remains unclear. Here, we formulate the edge transport in a multi-terminal superconductor-QAHI heterostructure using the Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism. Compared to the original proposal for the $\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$-quantization based on a simple two-terminal model, our formalism allows for deeper understanding of the origin of the quantization. The analysis of our experiments on multi-terminal devices unambiguously shows that the half-integer conductance quantization arises from the equilibration of the potentials of the incoming edge states at the SC electrode, and hence it is not of Majorana origin.</description>

      <title>Deep learning optimal molecular scintillators for dark matter direct detection</title>

Abstract: Direct searches for sub-GeV dark matter are limited by the intrinsic quantum properties of the target material. In this proof-of-concept study, we argue that this problem is particularly well suited for machine learning. We demonstrate that a simple neural architecture consisting of a variational autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron can efficiently generate unique molecules with desired properties. In specific, the energy threshold and signal (quantum) efficiency determine the minimum mass and cross section to which a detector can be sensitive. Organic molecules present a particularly interesting class of materials with intrinsically anisotropic electronic responses and $\mathcal{O}$(few) eV excitation energies. However, the space of possible organic compounds is intractably large, which makes traditional database screening challenging. We adopt excitation energies and proxy transition matrix elements as target properties learned by our network. Our model is able to generate molecules that are not in even the most expansive quantum chemistry databases and predict their relevant properties for high-throughput and efficient screening. Following a massive generation of novel molecules, we use clustering analysis to identify some of the most promising molecular structures that optimise the desired molecular properties for dark matter detection.</description>

      <title>Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention for Adaptive Dynamics in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02393</link>

Abstract: We present an approach to modifying Transformer architectures by integrating graph-aware relational reasoning into the attention mechanism, merging concepts from graph neural networks and language modeling. Building on the inherent connection between attention and graph theory, we reformulate the Transformer's attention mechanism as a graph operation and propose Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention. This method leverages advanced graph modeling strategies, including Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) and Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA), to enrich the representation of relational structures. Our approach captures complex dependencies and generalizes across tasks, as evidenced by a reduced generalization gap and improved learning performance. Additionally, we expand the concept of graph-aware attention to introduce Sparse GIN-Attention, a fine-tuning approach that employs sparse GINs. By interpreting attention matrices as sparse adjacency graphs, this technique enhances the adaptability of pre-trained foundational models with minimal computational overhead, endowing them with graph-aware capabilities. Sparse GIN-Attention fine-tuning achieves improved training dynamics and better generalization compared to alternative methods like low-rank adaption (LoRA). We discuss latent graph-like structures within traditional attention mechanisms, offering a new lens through which Transformers can be understood. By evolving Transformers as hierarchical GIN models for relational reasoning. This perspective suggests profound implications for foundational model development, enabling the design of architectures that dynamically adapt to both local and global dependencies. Applications in bioinformatics, materials science, language modeling, and beyond could benefit from this synthesis of relational and sequential data modeling, setting the stage for interpretable and generalizable modeling strategies.</description>

      <title>Comparing the Extrinsic Orbital Hall Effect in Centrosymmetric and Noncentrosymmetric Systems: Insights from Bilayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Both intrinsic and extrinsic orbital Hall effects (OHE) in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are investigated in the presence of short-range disorder using quantum kinetic theory. Bilayer TMDs provide an ideal platform to study the effects of inversion symmetry breaking on transport properties due to their unique structural and electronic characteristics. While bilayer TMDs are naturally inversion symmetric, applying a finite gate voltage to create a bias between the layers effectively breaks this symmetry. Our findings reveal that slightly away from the band edges, the extrinsic OHE becomes the dominant contribution in both inversion-symmetric and asymmetric cases, with its prominence increasing significantly as the Fermi energy rises. Furthermore, we demonstrate that breaking inversion symmetry greatly enhances the extrinsic OHE. This enhancement arises from the fundamentally distinct behavior of orbital angular momentum (OAM) in centrosymmetric systems, where intraband components vanish due to symmetry constraints. As a result, in centrosymmetric systems, only the off-diagonal components of the density matrix contribute to the extrinsic OHE. In contrast, in noncentrosymmetric systems, both diagonal and off-diagonal components play a role. Our study suggests that in experimentally relevant, highly doped systems, the OHE is predominantly extrinsic in nature, regardless of whether the system is centrosymmetric or noncentrosymmetric. Importantly, we infer that even a weakly breaking of inversion symmetry can lead to a dramatic enhancement of the OHE, a finding with significant implications for experimental investigations.</description>
