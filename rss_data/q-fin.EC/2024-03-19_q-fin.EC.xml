      <title>Scenarios for the Transition to AGI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze how output and wages behave under different scenarios for technological progress that may culminate in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), defined as the ability of AI systems to perform all tasks that humans can perform. We assume that human work can be decomposed into atomistic tasks that differ in their complexity. Advances in technology make ever more complex tasks amenable to automation. The effects on wages depend on a race between automation and capital accumulation. If the distribution of task complexity exhibits a sufficiently thick infinite tail, then there is always enough work for humans, and wages may rise forever. By contrast, if the complexity of tasks that humans can perform is bounded and full automation is reached, then wages collapse. But declines may occur even before if large-scale automation outpaces capital accumulation and makes labor too abundant. Automating productivity growth may lead to broad-based gains in the returns to all factors. By contrast, bottlenecks to growth from irreproducible scarce factors may exacerbate the decline in wages.</description>

      <title>Performance, Knowledge Acquisition and Satisfaction in Self-selected Groups: Evidence from a Classroom Field Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how to efficiently set up work groups to boost group productivity, individual satisfaction, and learning. Therefore, we conduct a natural field experiment in a compulsory undergraduate course and study differences between self-selected and randomly assigned groups. We find that self-selected groups perform significantly worse on group assignments. Yet, students in self-selected groups learn more and are more satisfied than those in randomly assigned groups. The effect of allowing students to pick group members dominates the effect of different group compositions in self-selected groups: When controlling for the skill, gender, and home region composition of groups, the differences between self-selected and randomly formed groups persist almost unaltered. The distribution of GitHub commits per group reveals that the better average performance of randomly assigned groups is mainly driven by highly skilled individuals distributed over more groups due to the assignment mechanism. Moreover, these highly skilled individuals contribute more to the group in randomly formed groups. We argue that this mechanism explains why self-selected groups perform worse on the projects but acquire more knowledge than randomly formed groups. These findings are relevant for setting up workgroups in academic, business, and governmental organizations when tasks are not constrained to the skill set of specific individuals.</description>

      <title>Does AI help humans make better decisions? A methodological framework for experimental evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on data-driven algorithms has become ubiquitous in today's society. Yet, in many cases and especially when stakes are high, humans still make final decisions. The critical question, therefore, is whether AI helps humans make better decisions as compared to a human alone or AI an alone. We introduce a new methodological framework that can be used to answer experimentally this question with no additional assumptions. We measure a decision maker's ability to make correct decisions using standard classification metrics based on the baseline potential outcome. We consider a single-blinded experimental design, in which the provision of AI-generated recommendations is randomized across cases with a human making final decisions. Under this experimental design, we show how to compare the performance of three alternative decision-making systems--human-alone, human-with-AI, and AI-alone. We apply the proposed methodology to the data from our own randomized controlled trial of a pretrial risk assessment instrument. We find that AI recommendations do not improve the classification accuracy of a judge's decision to impose cash bail. Our analysis also shows that AI-alone decisions generally perform worse than human decisions with or without AI assistance. Finally, AI recommendations tend to impose cash bail on non-white arrestees more often than necessary when compared to white arrestees.</description>

      <title>Investigating Changes of Water Quality in Reservoirs based on Flood and Inflow Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Water temperature and dissolved oxygen are essential indicators of water quality and ecosystem sustainability. Lately, heavy rainfalls are happening frequently and forcefully affecting the thermal structure and mixing layers in depth by sharply increasing the volume of inflow entitled flash flood. It can occur by sudden intense precipitation and develop within minutes or hours. Because of heavy debris load and speedy water, this phenomenon has remarkable effects on water quality. A higher flow during floods may worsens water quality at lakes and reservoirs that are thermally stratified (with separate density layers) and decrease dissolved oxygen content. However, it is unclear how well these parameters represent the response of lakes to changes in volume discharge. To address this question, researchers simulate the thermal structure in two stratified reservoirs, considering the Rajae reservoir as a representative reservoir in the north of Iran and Minab reservoir in the south. In this study, the model realistically represented variations of dissolved oxygen and temperature of dams Lake response to flash floods. The model performance was evaluated using observed data from stations on the dams lake. In this case, the inflow charge considered in a 10-day flash flood from April 6th to April 16th during the yearly normal flow. The complete mixture in a part of the thermal structure has been proved in Rajaee reservoir. The nonpermanent impact of the massive inflow of storm runoff caused an increase in oxygen-consuming, leading to a severe decrease in dissolved oxygen on epilimnion and metalimnion. The situation in Minab reservoir was relatively different from Rajae reservoir. The inflow changes not only cause mixture but also help expanding stratification.</description>
