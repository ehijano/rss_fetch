      <title>On Bell's dynamical route to special relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops the approach to special relativity put forward by John S. Bell. The classical dynamics of an electron orbiting a nucleus in uniform motion is solved analytically and compared to numerical simulations for an accelerated nucleus. The relativistic phenomena of length contraction and time dilation are shown to result from the electric and magnetic forces on the electron when its motion is analyzed in a single frame of reference. The relevance of these results for understanding the theory of special relativity is discussed.</description>

      <title>Peer Review as Structured Commentary: Immutable Identity, Public Dialogue, and Reproducible Scholarship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reconceptualises peer review as structured public commentary. Traditional academic validation is hindered by anonymity, latency, and gatekeeping. We propose a transparent, identity-linked, and reproducible system of scholarly evaluation anchored in open commentary. Leveraging blockchain for immutable audit trails and AI for iterative synthesis, we design a framework that incentivises intellectual contribution, captures epistemic evolution, and enables traceable reputational dynamics. This model empowers fields from computational science to the humanities, reframing academic knowledge as a living process rather than a static credential.</description>

      <title>Towards a Generalized Theory of Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formal framework for understanding and unifying the concept of observers across physics, computer science, philosophy, and related fields. Building on cybernetic feedback models, we introduce an operational definition of minimal observers, explore their role in shaping foundational concepts, and identify what remains unspecified in their absence. Drawing upon insights from quantum gravity, digital physics, second-order cybernetics, and recent ruliological and pregeometric approaches, we argue that observers serve as indispensable reference points for measurement, reference frames, and the emergence of meaning. We show how this formalism sheds new light on debates related to consciousness, quantum measurement, and computational boundaries; by way of theorems on observer equivalences and complexity measures. This perspective opens new avenues for investigating how complexity and structure arise in both natural and artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Extended Structural Dynamics -- Emergent Irreversibility from Reversible Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of irreversibility in isolated, deterministic systems remains a central problem in the foundations of statistical mechanics. Traditional approaches, such as Boltzmann's H-theorem and Lanford's derivation of the Boltzmann equation, rely on probabilistic assumptions and are constrained to dilute gases and short timescales. In this work, we introduce Extended Structural Dynamics (ESD), a deterministic framework in which irreversibility arises from the internal geometry of structured particles. In ESD, particles possess finite size and internal degrees of freedom, such as rotation and vibration, that are dynamically coupled to translational motion. This coupling induces instability, nonlinear feedback, and chaotic mixing in the extended phase space, even under time-reversal symmetric laws. We show that equilibrium states exponentially dominate the accessible volume of phase space, while constrained configurations (e.g., pure rotation) form measure-zero subsets. This yields a geometric derivation of entropy growth, with reversal probabilities suppressed as Prev and recurrence times scaling as Trec. These results address the Loschmidt and Zermelo paradoxes without coarse-graining, randomness, or fine-tuning. We further extend the model to charged systems (cESD), where long-range electromagnetic interactions drive continuous structural coupling. ESD thus provides a deterministic and testable mechanism for emergent thermodynamic behavior, with applications ranging from mesoscopic systems to the cosmological arrow of time.</description>

      <title>Old Quantum Mechanics by Bohr and Sommerfeld from a Modern Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00408v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review Bohr's atomic model and its extension by Sommerfeld from a mathematical perspective of wave mechanics. The derivation of quantization rules and energy levels is revisited using semiclassical methods. Sommerfeld-type integrals are evaluated by elementary techniques, and connections with the Schr\"{o}dinger and Dirac equations are established. Historical developments and key transitions from classical to quantum theory are discussed to clarify the structure and significance of the old quantum mechanics.</description>
