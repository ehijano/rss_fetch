      <title>Multimodal Graph-Based Variational Mixture of Experts Network for Zero-Shot Multimodal Information Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal information extraction on social media is a series of fundamental tasks to construct the multimodal knowledge graph. The tasks aim to extract the structural information in free texts with the incorporate images, including: multimodal named entity typing and multimodal relation extraction. However, the growing number of multimodal data implies a growing category set and the newly emerged entity types or relations should be recognized without additional training. To address the aforementioned challenges, we focus on the zero-shot multimodal information extraction tasks which require using textual and visual modalities for recognizing unseen categories. Compared with text-based zero-shot information extraction models, the existing multimodal ones make the textual and visual modalities aligned directly and exploit various fusion strategies to improve their performances. But the existing methods ignore the fine-grained semantic correlation of text-image pairs and samples. Therefore, we propose the multimodal graph-based variational mixture of experts network (MG-VMoE) which takes the MoE network as the backbone and exploits it for aligning multimodal representations in a fine-grained way. Considering to learn informative representations of multimodal data, we design each expert network as a variational information bottleneck to process two modalities in a uni-backbone. Moreover, we also propose the multimodal graph-based virtual adversarial training to learn the semantic correlation between the samples. The experimental results on the two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of MG-VMoE over the baselines.</description>

      <title>Steganographic Embeddings as an Effective Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image Steganography is a cryptographic technique that embeds secret information into an image, ensuring the hidden data remains undetectable to the human eye while preserving the image's original visual integrity. Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography achieves this by replacing the k least significant bits of an image with the k most significant bits of a secret image, maintaining the appearance of the original image while simultaneously encoding the essential elements of the hidden data. In this work, we shift away from conventional applications of steganography in deep learning and explore its potential from a new angle. We present experimental results on CIFAR-10 showing that LSB Steganography, when used as a data augmentation strategy for downstream computer vision tasks such as image classification, can significantly improve the training efficiency of deep neural networks. It can also act as an implicit, uniformly discretized piecewise linear approximation of color augmentations such as (brightness, contrast, hue, and saturation), without introducing additional training overhead through a new joint image training regime that disregards the need for tuning sensitive augmentation hyperparameters.</description>

      <title>LightThinker: Thinking Step-by-Step Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is hindered by the substantial memory and computational costs associated with generating lengthy tokens. In this paper, we propose LightThinker, a novel method that enables LLMs to dynamically compress intermediate thoughts during reasoning. Inspired by human cognitive processes, LightThinker compresses verbose thought steps into compact representations and discards the original reasoning chains, thereby significantly reducing the number of tokens stored in the context window. This is achieved by training the model on when and how to perform compression through data construction, mapping hidden states to condensed gist tokens, and creating specialized attention masks. Additionally, we introduce the Dependency (Dep) metric to quantify the degree of compression by measuring the reliance on historical tokens during generation. Extensive experiments on four datasets and two models show that LightThinker reduces peak memory usage and inference time, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our work provides a new direction for improving the efficiency of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks without sacrificing performance. Code will be released at https://github.com/zjunlp/LightThinker.</description>

      <title>Multi-view Hypergraph-based Contrastive Learning Model for Cold-Start Micro-video Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the widespread use of mobile devices and the rapid growth of micro-video platforms such as TikTok and Kwai, the demand for personalized micro-video recommendation systems has significantly increased. Micro-videos typically contain diverse information, such as textual metadata, visual cues (e.g., cover images), and dynamic video content, significantly affecting user interaction and engagement patterns. However, most existing approaches often suffer from the problem of over-smoothing, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive interaction information effectively. Additionally, cold-start scenarios present ongoing challenges due to sparse interaction data and the underutilization of available interaction signals. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-view Hypergraph-based Contrastive learning model for cold-start micro-video Recommendation (MHCR). MHCR introduces a multi-view multimodal feature extraction layer to capture interaction signals from various perspectives and incorporates multi-view self-supervised learning tasks to provide additional supervisory signals. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, we show that MHCR significantly outperforms existing video recommendation models and effectively mitigates cold-start challenges. Our code is available at https://github.com/sisuolv/MHCR.</description>

      <title>Sandwiched Compression: Repurposing Standard Codecs with Neural Network Wrappers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose sandwiching standard image and video codecs between pre- and post-processing neural networks. The networks are jointly trained through a differentiable codec proxy to minimize a given rate-distortion loss. This sandwich architecture not only improves the standard codec's performance on its intended content, but more importantly, adapts the codec to other types of image/video content and to other distortion measures. The sandwich learns to transmit ``neural code images'' that optimize and improve overall rate-distortion performance, with the improvements becoming significant especially when the overall problem is well outside of the scope of the codec's design. We apply the sandwich architecture to standard codecs with mismatched sources transporting different numbers of channels, higher resolution, higher dynamic range, computer graphics, and with perceptual distortion measures. The results demonstrate substantial improvements (up to 9 dB gains or up to 30\% bitrate reductions) compared to alternative adaptations. We establish optimality properties for sandwiched compression and design differentiable codec proxies approximating current standard codecs. We further analyze model complexity, visual quality under perceptual metrics, as well as sandwich configurations that offer interesting potentials in video compression and streaming.</description>

      <title>ESIQA: Perceptual Quality Assessment of Vision-Pro-based Egocentric Spatial Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the development of eXtended Reality (XR), photo capturing and display technology based on head-mounted displays (HMDs) have experienced significant advancements and gained considerable attention. Egocentric spatial images and videos are emerging as a compelling form of stereoscopic XR content. The assessment for the Quality of Experience (QoE) of XR content is important to ensure a high-quality viewing experience. Different from traditional 2D images, egocentric spatial images present challenges for perceptual quality assessment due to their special shooting, processing methods, and stereoscopic characteristics. However, the corresponding image quality assessment (IQA) research for egocentric spatial images is still lacking. In this paper, we establish the Egocentric Spatial Images Quality Assessment Database (ESIQAD), the first IQA database dedicated for egocentric spatial images as far as we know. Our ESIQAD includes 500 egocentric spatial images and the corresponding mean opinion scores (MOSs) under three display modes, including 2D display, 3D-window display, and 3D-immersive display. Based on our ESIQAD, we propose a novel mamba2-based multi-stage feature fusion model, termed ESIQAnet, which predicts the perceptual quality of egocentric spatial images under the three display modes. Specifically, we first extract features from multiple visual state space duality (VSSD) blocks, then apply cross attention to fuse binocular view information and use transposed attention to further refine the features. The multi-stage features are finally concatenated and fed into a quality regression network to predict the quality score. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ESIQAnet outperforms 22 state-of-the-art IQA models on the ESIQAD under all three display modes. The database and code are available at https://github.com/IntMeGroup/ESIQA.</description>

      <title>Magnifier Prompt: Tackling Multimodal Hallucination via Extremely Simple Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hinder their practical applications. To address this, we propose a Magnifier Prompt (MagPrompt), a simple yet effective method to tackle hallucinations in MLLMs via extremely simple instructions. MagPrompt is based on the following two key principles, which guide the design of various effective prompts, demonstrating robustness: (1) MLLMs should focus more on the image. (2) When there are conflicts between the image and the model's inner knowledge, MLLMs should prioritize the image. MagPrompt is training-free and can be applied to open-source and closed-source models, such as GPT-4o and Gemini-pro. It performs well across many datasets and its effectiveness is comparable or even better than more complex methods like VCD. Furthermore, our prompt design principles and experimental analyses provide valuable insights into multimodal hallucination.</description>

      <title>Do Audio-Visual Segmentation Models Truly Segment Sounding Objects?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike traditional visual segmentation, audio-visual segmentation (AVS) requires the model not only to identify and segment objects but also to determine whether they are sound sources. Recent AVS approaches, leveraging transformer architectures and powerful foundation models like SAM, have achieved impressive performance on standard benchmarks. Yet, an important question remains: Do these models genuinely integrate audio-visual cues to segment sounding objects? In this paper, we systematically investigate this issue in the context of robust AVS. Our study reveals a fundamental bias in current methods: they tend to generate segmentation masks based predominantly on visual salience, irrespective of the audio context. This bias results in unreliable predictions when sounds are absent or irrelevant. To address this challenge, we introduce AVSBench-Robust, a comprehensive benchmark incorporating diverse negative audio scenarios including silence, ambient noise, and off-screen sounds. We also propose a simple yet effective approach combining balanced training with negative samples and classifier-guided similarity learning. Our extensive experiments show that state-of-theart AVS methods consistently fail under negative audio conditions, demonstrating the prevalence of visual bias. In contrast, our approach achieves remarkable improvements in both standard metrics and robustness measures, maintaining near-perfect false positive rates while preserving highquality segmentation performance.</description>
