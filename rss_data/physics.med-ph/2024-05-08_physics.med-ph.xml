      <title>Efficient Radiation Treatment Planning based on Voxel Importance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization is a time-consuming part of radiation treatment planning. We propose to reduce the optimization problem by only using a representative subset of informative voxels. This way, we improve planning efficiency while maintaining or enhancing the plan quality. To reduce the computational complexity of the optimization problem, we propose to subsample the set of voxels via importance sampling. We derive a sampling distribution based on an importance score that we obtain from pre-solving an easy optimization problem involving a simplified probing objective. By solving a reduced version of the original optimization problem using this subset, we effectively reduce the problem's size and computational demands while accounting for regions in which satisfactory dose deliveries are challenging. In contrast to other stochastic (sub-)sampling methods, our technique only requires a single sampling step to define a reduced optimization problem. This problem can be efficiently solved using established solvers. Empirical experiments on open benchmark data highlight substantially reduced optimization times, up to 50 times faster than the original ones, for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), all while upholding plan quality comparable to traditional methods. Our approach has the potential to significantly accelerate radiation treatment planning by addressing its inherent computational challenges. We reduce the treatment planning time by reducing the size of the optimization problem rather than improving the optimization method. Our efforts are thus complementary to much of the previous developments.</description>

      <title>Robust Optimization for Spot Scanning Proton Therapy based on Dose-Linear Energy Transfer (LET) Volume Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Historically, spot scanning proton therapy (SSPT) treatment planning utilizes dose volume constraints and linear-energy-transfer (LET) volume constraints separately to balance tumor control and organs-at-risk (OARs) protection. We propose a novel dose-LET volume constraint (DLVC)-based robust optimization (DLVCRO) method for SSPT in treating prostate cancer to obtain a desirable joint dose and LET distribution to minimize adverse events (AEs).
  Methods: DLVCRO treats DLVC as soft constraints controlling the joint distribution of dose and LET. Ten prostate cancer patients were included with rectum and bladder as OARs. DLVCRO was compared with the conventional robust optimization (RO) method using the worst-case analysis method. Besides the dose-volume histogram (DVH) indices, the analogous LETVH and extra-biological-dose (xBD)-volume histogram indices were also used. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to measure statistical significance.
  Results: In nominal scenario, DLVCRO significantly improved dose, LET and xBD distributions to protect OARs (rectum: V70Gy: 3.07\% vs. 2.90\%, p = .0063, RO vs. DLVCRO; $\text{LET}_{\max}$ (keV/um): 11.53 vs. 9.44, p = .0101; $\text{xBD}_{\max}$ (Gy$\cdot$keV/um): 420.55 vs. 398.79, p = .0086; bladder: V65Gy: 4.82\% vs. 4.61\%, p = .0032; $\text{LET}_{\max}$ 8.97 vs. 7.51, p = .0047; $\text{xBD}_{\max}$ 490.11 vs. 476.71, p = .0641). The physical dose distributions in targets are comparable (D2%: 98.57\% vs. 98.39\%; p = .0805; CTV D2% - D98%: 7.10\% vs. 7.75\%, p = .4624). In the worst-case scenario, DLVCRO robustly enhanced OAR while maintaining the similar plan robustness in target dose coverage and homogeneity.
  Conclusion: DLVCRO upgrades 2D DVH-based to 3D DLVH-based treatment planning to adjust dose/LET distributions simultaneously and robustly. DLVCRO is potentially a powerful tool to improve patient outcomes in SSPT.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling of $^{18}$F-Fluoromisonidazole ($^{18}$F-FMISO) Radiopharmaceutical Transport in Vascularized Solid Tumors</title>

Abstract: $^{18}$F-Fluoromisonidazole ($^{18}$F-FMISO) is a highly promising positron emission tomography radiopharmaceutical for identifying hypoxic regions in solid tumors. This research employs spatiotemporal multi-scale mathematical modeling to explore how different levels of angiogenesis influence the transport of radiopharmaceuticals within tumors. In this study, two tumor geometries with heterogeneous and uniform distributions of capillary networks were employed to incorporate varying degrees of microvascular density. The synthetic image of the heterogeneous and vascularized tumor was generated by simulating the angiogenesis process. The proposed multi-scale spatiotemporal model accounts for intricate physiological and biochemical factors within the tumor microenvironment, such as the transvascular transport of the radiopharmaceutical agent, its movement into the interstitial space by diffusion and convection mechanisms, and ultimately its uptake by tumor cells. Results showed that both quantitative and semi-quantitative metrics of $^{18}$F-FMISO uptake differ spatially and temporally at different stages during tumor growth. The presence of a high microvascular density in uniformly vascularized tumor increases cellular uptake, as it allows for more efficient release and rapid distribution of radiopharmaceutical molecules. This results in enhanced uptake compared to the heterogeneous vascularized tumor. In both heterogeneous and uniform distribution of microvessels in tumors, the diffusion transport mechanism has a more pronounced than convection. The findings of this study shed light on the transport phenomena behind $^{18}$F-FMISO radiopharmaceutical distribution and its delivery in the tumor microenvironment, aiding oncologists in their routine decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>PINQI: An End-to-End Physics-Informed Approach to Learned Quantitative MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (qMRI) enables the reproducible measurement of biophysical parameters in tissue. The challenge lies in solving a nonlinear, ill-posed inverse problem to obtain the desired tissue parameter maps from acquired raw data. While various learned and non-learned approaches have been proposed, the existing learned methods fail to fully exploit the prior knowledge about the underlying MR physics, i.e. the signal model and the acquisition model. In this paper, we propose PINQI, a novel qMRI reconstruction method that integrates the knowledge about the signal, acquisition model, and learned regularization into a single end-to-end trainable neural network. Our approach is based on unrolled alternating optimization, utilizing differentiable optimization blocks to solve inner linear and non-linear optimization tasks, as well as convolutional layers for regularization of the intermediate qualitative images and parameter maps. This design enables PINQI to leverage the advantages of both the signal model and learned regularization. We evaluate the performance of our proposed network by comparing it with recently published approaches in the context of highly undersampled $T_1$-mapping, using both a simulated brain dataset, as well as real scanner data acquired from a physical phantom and in-vivo data from healthy volunteers. The results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed solution over existing methods and highlight the effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Automatic Ultrasound Curve Angle Measurement via Affinity Clustering for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current clinical gold standard for evaluating adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is X-ray radiography, using Cobb angle measurement. However, the frequent monitoring of the AIS progression using X-rays poses a challenge due to the cumulative radiation exposure. Although 3D ultrasound has been validated as a reliable and radiation-free alternative for scoliosis assessment, the process of measuring spinal curvature is still carried out manually. Consequently, there is a considerable demand for a fully automatic system that can locate bony landmarks and perform angle measurements. To this end, we introduce an estimation model for automatic ultrasound curve angle (UCA) measurement. The model employs a dual-branch network to detect candidate landmarks and perform vertebra segmentation on ultrasound coronal images. An affinity clustering strategy is utilized within the vertebral segmentation area to illustrate the affinity relationship between candidate landmarks. Subsequently, we can efficiently perform line delineation from a clustered affinity map for UCA measurement. As our method is specifically designed for UCA calculation, this method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for landmark and line detection tasks. The high correlation between the automatic UCA and Cobb angle (R$^2$=0.858) suggests that our proposed method can potentially replace manual UCA measurement in ultrasound scoliosis assessment.</description>
