      <title>Decentralized Signaling Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system composed of multiple distinct service locations that aims to convince customers to join the system by providing information to customers. We cast the system's information design problem in the framework of Bayesian persuasion and describe centralized and decentralized signaling. We provide efficient methods for computing the system's optimal centralized and decentralized signaling mechanisms and derive a performance guarantee for decentralized signaling when the locations' states are independent. The guarantee states that the probability that a customer joins under optimal decentralized signaling is bounded below by the product of a strictly positive constant and the probability that a customer joins under optimal centralized signaling. The constant depends only on the number of service locations. We provide an example that shows that the constant cannot be improved. We consider an extension to more-general objectives for the system and establish that the same guarantee continues to hold. We also extend our analysis to systems where the locations' states are correlated, and again derive a performance guarantee for decentralized signaling in that setting. For the correlated setting, we prove that the guarantee's asymptotic dependence upon the number of locations cannot be substantially improved. A comparison of our guarantees for independent locations and for correlated locations reveals the influence of dependence on the performance of decentralized signaling.</description>

      <title>The River Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce River, a novel Condorcet-consistent voting method that is based on pairwise majority margins and can be seen as a simplified variation of Tideman's Ranked Pairs method. River is simple to explain, simple to compute even 'by hand', and gives rise to an easy-to-interpret certificate in the form of a directed tree. Like Ranked Pairs and Schulze's Beat Path method, River is a refinement of the Split Cycle method and shares with those many desirable properties, including independence of clones. Unlike the other three methods, River satisfies a strong form of resistance to agenda-manipulation that is known as independence of Pareto-dominated alternatives.</description>

      <title>Price Stability and Improved Buyer Utility with Presentation Design: A Theoretical Study of the Amazon Buy Box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Platforms design the form of presentation by which sellers are shown to the buyers. This design not only shapes the buyers' experience but also leads to different market equilibria or dynamics. One component in this design is through the platform's mediation of the search frictions experienced by the buyers for different sellers. We take a model of monopolistic competition and show that, on one hand, when all sellers have the same inspection costs, the market sees no stable price since the sellers always have incentives to undercut each other, and, on the other hand, the platform may stabilize the price by giving prominence to one seller chosen by a carefully designed mechanism. This calls to mind Amazon's Buy Box. We study natural mechanisms for choosing the prominent seller, characterize the range of equilibrium prices implementable by them, and find that in certain scenarios the buyers' surplus improves as the search friction increases.</description>

      <title>Optimal Repurchasing Contract Design for Efficient Utilization of Computing Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI and other emerging technologies has triggered exponential growth in computing resources demand. Faced with prohibitive infrastructure costs for large-scale computing clusters, users are increasingly resorting to leased computing resources from third-party providers. However, prevalent overestimation of operational requirements frequently leads to substantial underutilization of the computing resources. To mitigate such inefficiency, we propose a contract-based incentive framework for computing resources repurchasing. Comparing to auction mechanisms, our design enables providers to reclaim and reallocate surplus computing resources through market-driven incentives. Our framework operates in a multi-parameter environment where both clients' idle resource capacities and their unit valuations of retained resources are private information, posing a significant challenge to contract design. Two scenarios are considered based on whether all clients possess the same amount of idle resource capacity. By transforming the contract design problem into solving a mathematical program, we obtain the optimal contracts for each scenario, which can maximize the utility of computing resources providers while ensuring the requirements of incentive compatibility (IC) and individual rationality (IR). This innovative design not only provides an effective approach to reduce the inefficient utilization of computing resources, but also establishes a market-oriented paradigm for sustainable computing ecosystems.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced Dual-Currency VCG Auction Mechanism for Resource Allocation in IoV: A Value of Information Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is undergoing a transformative evolution, enabled by advancements in future 6G network technologies, to support intelligent, highly reliable, and low-latency vehicular services. However, the enhanced capabilities of loV have heightened the demands for efficient network resource allocation while simultaneously giving rise to diverse vehicular service requirements. For network service providers (NSPs), meeting the customized resource-slicing requirements of vehicle service providers (VSPs) while maximizing social welfare has become a significant challenge. This paper proposes an innovative solution by integrating a mean-field multi-agent reinforcement learning (MFMARL) framework with an enhanced Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction mechanism to address the problem of social welfare maximization under the condition of unknown VSP utility functions. The core of this solution is introducing the ``value of information" as a novel monetary metric to estimate the expected benefits of VSPs, thereby ensuring the effective execution of the VCG auction mechanism. MFMARL is employed to optimize resource allocation for social welfare maximization while adapting to the intelligent and dynamic requirements of IoV. The proposed enhanced VCG auction mechanism not only protects the privacy of VSPs but also reduces the likelihood of collusion among VSPs, and it is theoretically proven to be dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC). The simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the VCG mechanism implemented using quantization methods, the proposed mechanism exhibits significant advantages in convergence speed, social welfare maximization, and resistance to collusion, providing new insights into resource allocation in intelligent 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Design for Auctions with Externalities on Budgets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies mechanism design for auctions with externalities on budgets, a novel setting where the budgets that bidders commit are adjusted due to the externality of the competitors' allocation outcomes-a departure from traditional auctions with fixed budgets. This setting is motivated by real-world scenarios, for example, participants may increase their budgets in response to competitors' obtained items. We initially propose a general framework with homogeneous externalities to capture the interdependence between budget updates and allocation, formalized through a budget response function that links each bidder's effective budget to the amount of items won by others.
  The main contribution of this paper is to propose a truthful and individual rational auction mechanism for this novel auction setting, which achieves an approximation ratio of $1/3$ with respect to the liquid welfare. This mechanism is inspired by the uniform-price auction, in which an appropriate uniform price is selected to allocate items, ensuring the monotonicity of the allocation rule while accounting for budget adjustments. Additionally, this mechanism guarantees a constant approximation ratio by setting a purchase limit. Complementing this result, we establish an upper bound: no truthful mechanism can achieve an approximation ratio better than $1/2$. This work offers a new perspective to study the impact of externalities on auctions, providing an approach to handle budget externalities in multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguring Proportional Committees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important desideratum in approval-based multiwinner voting is proportionality. We study the problem of reconfiguring proportional committees: given two proportional committees, is there a transition path that consists only of proportional committees, where each transition involves replacing one candidate with another candidate? We show that the set of committees satisfying the proportionality axiom of justified representation (JR) is not always connected, and it is PSPACE-complete to decide whether two such committees are connected. On the other hand, we prove that any two JR committees can be connected by committees satisfying a $2$-approximation of JR. We also obtain similar results for the stronger axiom of extended justified representation (EJR). In addition, we demonstrate that the committees produced by several well-known voting rules are connected or at least not isolated, and investigate the reconfiguration problem in restricted preference domains.</description>

      <title>How competitive are pay-as-bid auction games?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13920v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the pay-as-bid auction game, a supply function model with discriminatory pricing and asymmetric firms. In this game, strategies are non-decreasing supply functions relating pric to quantity and the exact choice of the strategy space turns out to be a crucial issue: when it includes all non-decreasing continuous functions, pure-strategy Nash equilibria often fail to exist. To overcome this, we restrict the strategy space to the set of Lipschitz-continuous functions and we prove that Nash equilibria always exist (under standard concavity assumptions) and consist of functions that are affine on their own support and have slope equal to the maximum allowed Lipschitz constant. We further show that the Nash equilibrium is unique up to the market-clearing price when the demand is affine and the asymmetric marginal production costs are homogeneous in zero. For quadratic production costs, we derive a closed-form expression and we compute the limit as the allowed Lipschitz constant grows to infinity. Our results show that in the limit the pay-as-bid auction game achieves perfect competition with efficient allocation and induces a lower market-clearing price compared to supply function models based on uniform price auctions.</description>

      <title>Sensor Scheduling in Intrusion Detection Games with Uncertain Payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of sensor scheduling for an intrusion detection task. We model this as a two-player zero-sum game over a graph, where the defender (Player 1) seeks to identify the optimal strategy for scheduling sensor orientations to minimize the probability of missed detection at minimal cost, while the intruder (Player 2) aims to identify the optimal path selection strategy to maximize missed detection probability at minimal cost. The defender's strategy space grows exponentially with the number of sensors, making direct computation of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) strategies computationally expensive. To tackle this, we propose a distributed variant of the Weighted Majority algorithm that exploits the structure of the game's payoff matrix, enabling efficient computation of the NE strategies with provable convergence guarantees. Next, we consider a more challenging scenario where the defender lacks knowledge of the true sensor models and, consequently, the game's payoff matrix. For this setting, we develop online learning algorithms that leverage bandit feedback from sensors to estimate the NE strategies. By building on existing results from perturbation theory and online learning in matrix games, we derive high-probability order-optimal regret bounds for our algorithms. Finally, through simulations, we demonstrate the empirical performance of our proposed algorithms in both known and unknown payoff scenarios.</description>

      <title>On Tractable $\Phi$-Equilibria in Non-Concave Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08171v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Online Gradient Descent and other no-regret learning procedures are known to efficiently converge to a coarse correlated equilibrium in games where each agent's utility is concave in their own strategy, this is not the case when utilities are non-concave -- a common scenario in machine learning applications involving strategies parameterized by deep neural networks, or when agents' utilities are computed by neural networks, or both. Non-concave games introduce significant game-theoretic and optimization challenges: (i) Nash equilibria may not exist; (ii) local Nash equilibria, though they exist, are intractable; and (iii) mixed Nash, correlated, and coarse correlated equilibria generally have infinite support and are intractable. To sidestep these challenges, we revisit the classical solution concept of $\Phi$-equilibria introduced by Greenwald and Jafari [2003], which is guaranteed to exist for an arbitrary set of strategy modifications $\Phi$ even in non-concave games [Stolz and Lugosi, 2007]. However, the tractability of $\Phi$-equilibria in such games remains elusive.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of tractable $\Phi$-equilibria in non-concave games and examine several natural families of strategy modifications. We show that when $\Phi$ is finite, there exists an efficient uncoupled learning algorithm that converges to the corresponding $\Phi$-equilibria. Additionally, we explore cases where $\Phi$ is infinite but consists of local modifications. We show that approximating local $\Phi$-equilibria beyond the first-order stationary regime is computationally intractable. In contrast, within this regime, we show Online Gradient Descent efficiently converges to $\Phi$-equilibria for several natural infinite families of modifications, including a new structural family of modifications inspired by the well-studied proximal operator.</description>

      <title>Contract Design for Sequential Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel model of contracts with combinatorial actions that accounts for sequential and adaptive agent behavior. As in the standard model, a principal delegates the execution of a costly project to an agent. There are $n$ actions, each one incurring a cost to the agent and inducing a probability distribution over $m$ outcomes; each outcome generates some reward for the principal. The principal incentivizes the agent through a contract that specifies a payment for each potential outcome. Unlike the standard model, the agent chooses actions sequentially. Following each action, the agent observes the realized outcome, and decides whether to stop or continue with another action. Upon halting, the agent chooses one of the realized outcomes, which determines both his payment and the principal's reward. This model captures common scenarios where the agent can make multiple attempts in the course of executing a project.
  We study the optimal contract problem in this new setting, namely the contract that maximizes the principal's utility. We first observe that the agent's problem - (adaptively) finding the sequence of actions that maximizes his utility for a given contract - is equivalent to the well-known Pandora's Box problem. Using this insight, we provide algorithms and hardness results for the optimal contract problem, under both independent and correlated actions, and for both linear and general contracts. For independent actions, we provide a poly-time algorithm for the optimal linear contract, and establish that finding the optimal general contract is NP-hard. In cases where the number of outcomes is constant, we devise a poly-time algorithm even for the optimal general contract. For correlated actions, we find that, for both linear and general contracts, approximating the optimal contract within any constant ratio is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Contextual Market Equilibrium Computation through Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Market equilibrium is one of the most fundamental solution concepts in economics and social optimization analysis. Existing works on market equilibrium computation primarily focus on settings with relatively few buyers. Motivated by this, our paper investigates the computation of market equilibrium in scenarios with a large-scale buyer population, where buyers and goods are represented by their contexts. Building on this realistic and generalized contextual market model, we introduce MarketFCNet, a deep learning-based method for approximating market equilibrium. We start by parameterizing the allocation of each good to each buyer using a neural network, which depends solely on the context of the buyer and the good. Next, we propose an efficient method to unbiasedly estimate the loss function of the training algorithm, enabling us to optimize the network parameters through gradient. To evaluate the approximated solution, we propose a metric called Nash Gap, which quantifies the deviation of the given allocation and price pair from the market equilibrium. Experimental results indicate that MarketFCNet delivers competitive performance and significantly lower running times compared to existing methods as the market scale expands, demonstrating the potential of deep learning-based methods to accelerate the approximation of large-scale contextual market equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: The Informational Braess' Paradox (IBP) illustrates a counterintuitive scenario where revelation of additional roadway segments to some self-interested travelers leads to increased travel times for these individuals. IBP extends the original Braess' paradox by relaxing the assumption that all travelers have identical and complete information about the network. In this paper, we study the conditions under which IBP does not occur in networks with non-atomic selfish travelers and multiple origin-destination pairs. Our results completely characterize the network topologies immune to IBP, thus resolving an open question proposed by Acemoglu et al.</description>

Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible goods among a group of agents, aiming to limit the envy between any two agents. The central open problem in this literature, which has proven to be extremely challenging, is regarding the existence of an EFX allocation, i.e., an allocation such that any envy from some agent i toward another agent j would vanish if we were to remove any single good from the bundle allocated to j. When the agents' valuations are additive, which has been the main focus of prior works, Chaudhury et al. [2024] showed that an EFX allocation is guaranteed to exist for all instances involving up to three agents. Subsequently, Berger et al. [2022] extended this guarantee to nice-cancelable valuations and Akrami et al. [2023] to MMS-feasible valuations. However, the existence of EFX allocations for instances involving four agents remains open, even for additive valuations. We contribute to this literature by focusing on EF2X, a relaxation of EFX which requires that any envy toward some agent vanishes if any two of the goods allocated to that agent were to be removed. Our main result shows that EF2X allocations are guaranteed to exist for any instance with four agents, even for the class of cancelable valuations, which is more general than additive. Our proof is constructive, proposing an algorithm that computes such an allocation in pseudopolynomial time. Furthermore, for instances involving three agents we provide an algorithm that computes an EF2X allocation in polynomial time, in contrast to EFX, for which the fastest known algorithm for three agents is only pseudopolynomial.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Satisfying MXS and EFL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00358</link>

Abstract: The two standard fairness notions in the resource allocation literature are proportionality and envy-freeness. If there are n agents competing for the available resources, then proportionality requires that each agent receives at least a 1/n fraction of their total value for the set of resources. On the other hand, envy-freeness requires that each agent weakly prefers the resources allocated to them over those allocated to any other agent. Each of these notions has its own benefits, but it is well known that neither one of the two is always achievable when the resources being allocated are indivisible. As a result, a lot of work has focused on satisfying fairness notions that relax either proportionality or envy-freeness. In this paper, we focus on MXS (a relaxation of proportionality) and EFL (a relaxation of envy-freeness). Each of these notions was previously shown to be achievable on its own [Barman et al.,2018, Caragiannis et al., 2023], and our main result is an algorithm that computes allocations that simultaneously satisfy both, combining the benefits of approximate proportionality and approximate envy-freeness. In fact, we prove this for any instance involving agents with valuation functions that are restricted MMS-feasible, which are more general than additive valuations. Also, since every EFL allocation directly satisfies other well-studied fairness notions like EF1, 1/2-EFX, 1/2-GMMS, and 2/3-PMMS, and every MXS allocation satisfies 4/7-MMS, the allocations returned by our algorithm simultaneously satisfy a wide variety of fairness notions and are, therefore, universally fair [Amanatidis et al., 2020].</description>

      <title>Prophet Inequalities with Cancellation Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00527</link>

Abstract: Most of the literature on online algorithms in revenue management focuses on settings with irrevocable decisions, where once a decision is made upon the arrival of a new input, it cannot be canceled later. Motivated by modern applications -- such as cloud spot markets, selling banner ads, or online hotel booking -- we introduce and study "prophet inequalities with cancellations" under linear cancellation costs (known as the buyback model). In the classic prophet inequality problem, a sequence of independent random variables $X_1, X_2, \ldots$ with known distributions is revealed one by one, and a decision maker must decide when to stop and accept the current variable in order to maximize the expected value of their choice. In our model, after accepting $X_j$, one may later discard $X_j$ and accept another $X_i$ at a cost of $f \times X_j$, where $f\geq 0$ is a parameter. The goal is to maximize the expected net reward: the value of the final accepted variable minus the total cancellation cost. We aim to design online policies that are competitive against the optimal offline benchmark.
  Our first main result is an optimal prophet inequality for all parameters $f \ge 0$. We fully characterize the worst-case competitive ratio of the optimal online policy against the optimal offline via the solution to a certain differential equation (for which we provide a constructive solution). Our second main result is to design and analyze a simple and polynomial-time randomized adaptive policy that achieves this optimal competitive ratio. Importantly, our policy is order-agnostic (\`a la [Samuel-Cahn, 1984]), as it only needs the set of distributions and not their arrival order. These results are obtained by novel techniques related to factor-revealing LPs and generalized flow, reductions to a differential equation, and embedding of problem instances into specific Poisson point processes.</description>

      <title>The emergence of chaos in population game dynamics induced by comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise description of population game dynamics introduced by revision protocols - an economic model describing the agent's propensity to switch to a better-performing strategy - is of importance in economics and social sciences in general. In this setting innovation or imitation of others is the force which drives the evolution of the economic system. As the continuous-time game dynamics is relatively well understood, the same cannot be said about revision driven dynamics in the discrete time. We investigate the behavior of agents in a $2\times 2$ anti-coordination game with symmetric random matching and a unique mixed Nash equilibrium. In continuous time the Nash equilibrium is attracting and induces a global evolutionary stable state. We show that in the discrete time one can construct (either innovative or imitative) revision protocol and choose a level of the time step, under which the game dynamics is Li-Yorke chaotic, inducing complex and unpredictable behavior of the system, precluding stable predictions of equilibrium. Moreover, we reveal that this unpredictability is encoded into any imitative revision protocol. Furthermore, we show that for any such game there exists a perturbed pairwise proportional imitation protocol introducing chaotic behavior of the agents for sufficiently large time step.</description>

      <title>Meta-Computing Enhanced Federated Learning in IIoT: Satisfaction-Aware Incentive Scheme via DRL-Based Stackelberg Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) leverages Federated Learning (FL) for distributed model training while preserving data privacy, and meta-computing enhances FL by optimizing and integrating distributed computing resources, improving efficiency and scalability. Efficient IIoT operations require a trade-off between model quality and training latency. Consequently, a primary challenge of FL in IIoT is to optimize overall system performance by balancing model quality and training latency. This paper designs a satisfaction function that accounts for data size, Age of Information (AoI), and training latency for meta-computing. Additionally, the satisfaction function is incorporated into the utility functions to incentivize nodes in IIoT participation in model training. We model the utility functions of servers and nodes as a two-stage Stackelberg game and employ a deep reinforcement learning approach to learn the Stackelberg equilibrium. This approach ensures balanced rewards and enhances the applicability of the incentive scheme for IIoT. Simulation results demonstrate that, under the same budget constraints, the proposed incentive scheme improves utility by at least 23.7% compared to existing FL schemes without compromising model accuracy.</description>
