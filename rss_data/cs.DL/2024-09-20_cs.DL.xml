      <title>Exploring Scientometrics with the OpenAIRE Graph: Introducing the OpenAIRE Beginner's Kit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The OpenAIRE Graph is an extensive resource housing diverse information on research products, including literature, datasets, and software, alongside research projects and other scholarly outputs and context. It stands as a cornerstone among contemporary research information databases, offering invaluable insights for scientometric investigations. Despite its wealth of data, its sheer size may initially appear daunting, potentially hindering its widespread adoption. To address this challenge, this paper introduces the OpenAIRE Beginner's Kit, a user-friendly solution providing access to a subset of the OpenAIRE Graph within a sandboxed environment coupled with a Jupyter notebook for analysis. The OpenAIRE Beginner's Kit is meticulously designed to democratise research and data exploration, offering accessibility from standard desktop and laptop setups. Within this paper, we provide a brief overview of the included dataset and offer guidance on leveraging the kit through a selection of illustrative queries tailored to address common scientometric inquiries.</description>

      <title>An Outline for a Jupyter-Materials-Based Repository Website Focused on the Computational Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As access to the internet has become increasingly ubiquitous, along with the reliability and speed of internet providers, so too has the implementation of internet-based learning tools. These tools provide students opportunities to do meaningful work away from university, however, often at a financial cost to universities and students. Moreover, limited and high-cost internet access in less-developed countries and remote areas acts as a barrier to implementing these tools in a meaningful way, leading to inequalities in both the quality of education and the opportunities provided. This paper outlines the development process, and benefits, of a low-cost and light-weight repository website centered around disseminating open-source textbooks and other supplemental learning materials for computational sciences using Jupyter Notebooks. The website focuses on allowing students to download their textbooks and other materials from a centralized location, to be used offline or with limited internet access. Internet access is not the only constraining factor; access to reasonably priced personal computers also limits the effectiveness of internet-based learning tools. As such, this paper will also explore the feasibility of integrating low-cost Raspberry Pi kits into this development process as a way of increasing the reach of an online repository of open-source Jupyter Notebook textbooks. While this paper focuses on Canadian universities and remote communities, many of the website's proposed applications are relevant worldwide.</description>

      <title>ChemDFM: A Large Language Foundation Model for Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has played an increasingly important role in chemical research. However, most models currently used in chemistry are specialist models that require training and tuning for specific tasks. A more generic and efficient solution would be an AI model that could address many tasks and support free-form dialogue in the broad field of chemistry. In its utmost form, such a generalist AI chemist could be referred to as Chemical General Intelligence. Large language models (LLMs) have recently logged tremendous success in the general domain of natural language processing, showing emerging task generalization and free-form dialogue capabilities. However, domain knowledge of chemistry is largely missing when training general-domain LLMs. The lack of such knowledge greatly hinders the performance of generalist LLMs in the field of chemistry. To this end, we develop ChemDFM, a pioneering LLM for chemistry trained on 34B tokens from chemical literature and textbooks, and fine-tuned using 2.7M instructions. As a result, it can understand and reason with chemical knowledge in free-form dialogue. Quantitative evaluations show that ChemDFM significantly surpasses most representative open-source LLMs. It outperforms GPT-4 on a great portion of chemical tasks, despite the substantial size difference. We will open-source ChemDFM for the broader community of AI and chemistry.</description>
