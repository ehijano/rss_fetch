      <title>Polynomial functors in $\text{Ver}_4^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study polynomial functors in the incompressible category $\text{Ver}_4^+$, which can be viewed as super polynomial functors in characteristic 2. Concretely, we classify additive, exact and simple polynomial functors, and describe how simple polynomial functors evaluate on arbitrary objects. We also determine which objects are not annihilated by any polynomial functors of a given degree and for which objects the symmetric group algebra acts faithfully via the braiding.</description>

      <title>The Picky Conjecture for groups of Lie type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Moret\'o and Rizo proposed a conjecture, known as the Picky Conjecture, proposing new character correspondences extending the McKay Conjecture. We prove the Picky Conjecture for all quasi-simple groups of Lie type for non-defining primes. In favourable situations, we also obtain the stronger version postulating preservation of character values up to sign, and we show this stronger version holds in general when assuming certain natural properties of Lusztig's Jordan decomposition. Along the way, we complete the determination of semisimple picky elements in these groups by classifying picky 2- and 3-elements.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of the hyperplane complement of a quaternionic reflection group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the graded rank of the cohomology of the hyperplane complement associated with a quaternionic reflection group, and observe that it factors into irreducible factors with positive integer coefficients. For an irreducible group, these irreducible factors are all linear except at most one irreducible quadratic factor, which occurs for precisely three of the exceptional groups.</description>

      <title>Classification of Zamolodchikov periodic cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zamolodchikov periodicity is a property of certain discrete dynamical systems related to bipartite cluster algebras. It was first observed by Zamolodchikov in his study of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, initially for simply-laced Dynkin diagrams. It was proved by Keller to hold for tensor products of two Dynkin diagrams, and further shown by Galashin and Pylyavskyy to hold for pairs of commuting simply-laced Cartan matrices of finite type, which Stembridge classified in his study of admissible $W$-cells. We prove that the Zamolodchikov periodic cluster algebras are in bijection with pairs of commuting (not necessarily reduced or simply-laced) Cartan matrices of finite type. We fully classify all such pairs into 29 infinite families and 14 exceptional types in addition to the 6 infinite families and 11 exceptional types in Stembridge's classification, and show that all of these families can be derived from simply-laced types through folding and transpose. Finally, we find that these pairs are in 1-to-4 correspondence with nonnegative $W$-cells for products of two dihedral groups $W = I_2(p)\times I_2(q)$, which encode the action of the standard generators on the Kazhdan--Lusztig basis of the associated Iwahori--Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}(W)$.</description>

      <title>A unit theorem for products of groups with several ends and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his $1994$ survey, Kleinert defined formally and formulated the problem to obtain unit theorems for unit groups of orders in a semisimple algebra $A$. If $A$ is a group algebra $FG$, it boils down to classifying all finite groups $G$ such that the unit groups of most orders in $FG$ belong to a prescribed class $\mathcal{G}$ of infinite groups. We solve this problem for $\mathcal{G}$ consisting of the groups which are virtually a direct product of groups whose Cayley graph has more than one end. Subsequently, we obtain two types of applications. A first type being about the existence of torsion-free normal complements and a second about obtaining short and uniform proofs of some of the main results in [13,18,14,15].</description>

      <title>Period sheaves via perverse pullbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct period sheaves for Hamiltonian spaces, as conjectured in the work of Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis and Venkatesh, using the perverse pullback functors introduced in the authors' previous work. We prove a dimensional reduction isomorphism (generalizing the results of Davison and Kinjo in cohomological Donaldson--Thomas theory) which implies that perverse pullbacks refine the ordinary pullback functors in constructible sheaf theory, and relate perverse pullbacks to microstalk functors. These results imply that our period sheaves recover the known constructions in the cotangent and Whittaker cases.</description>

      <title>Eventually periodic resolutions for groups of type $\textbf{VFP}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a construction of eventually periodic projective resolutions for modules of type $\textbf{FP}_{\infty}$ over the integral group rings of $\Gamma = G / (c)$ of type $\textbf{VFP}$, with $G$ of type $\textbf{FP}$ and $c$ a central element. Our approach also applies more generally to quotients of rings of finite left global dimension by a regular central element. It utilizes a construction of Shamash, combined with the iterated mapping cone technique, to systematically `purge' homology from a complex. We demonstrate the computability of our method through explicit calculations for several families of groups including hyperbolic triangle groups and mapping class groups of the punctured plane.</description>

      <title>Universal K-matrices for quantum Kac-Moody algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.09218v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a cylindrical bialgebra, which is a quasitriangular bialgebra $H$ endowed with a universal K-matrix, i.e., a universal solution of a generalized reflection equation, yielding an action of cylindrical braid groups on tensor products of its representations. We prove that new examples of such universal K-matrices arise from quantum symmetric pairs of Kac-Moody type and depend upon the choice of a pair of generalized Satake diagrams. In finite type, this yields a refinement of a result obtained by Balagovi\'c and Kolb, producing a family of non-equivalent solutions interpolating between the quasi-K-matrix originally due to Bao and Wang and the full universal K-matrix. Finally, we prove that this construction yields formal solutions of the generalized reflection equation with a spectral parameter in the case of finite-dimensional representations over the quantum affine algebra $U_qL\mathfrak{sl}_2$.</description>

      <title>Generalized weighted surface algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.15218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weighted triangulation algebras associated to triangulation quivers and their socle deformations were recently introduced and studied in [15]-[20] and [2]. These algebras, based on surface triangulations and originated from the theory of cluster algebras, were also proved to be (with some minor exceptions) finite-dimensional tame symmetric and periodic algebras of period 4. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of a generalized triangulation quiver, extending the notion of a triangulation quiver. Inparticular, it is also shown that the generalized triangulation quivers can be constructed from triangulations of orientable surfaces with marked self-foldedtriangles. Moreover, motivated by the recent results of [28], we define and investigate so called weighted generalized triangulation algebras associated to generalized triangulation quivers, which naturally arise from mutations of weighted triangulation algebras.</description>

      <title>Trigonometric K-matrices for finite-dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.16503v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a complex simple Lie algebra and $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$ the corresponding quantum affine algebra. We prove that every irreducible finite-dimensional $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$-module gives rise to a family of trigonometric solutions of Cherednik's generalized reflection equation. These depend upon the choice of a quantum affine symmetric pair $U_q(\mathfrak{k})\subset U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$. Our result relies on the construction of universal K-matrices for arbitrary quantum symmetric pairs, obtained in our previous work, as well as the fact that every irreducible $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$-module is generically irreducible under restriction to $U_q({\mathfrak{k}})$. In the case of small modules and Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules, we obtain new solutions of the standard and the transposed reflection equations.</description>

      <title>Tensor K-matrices for quantum symmetric pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra, $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ its quantum group, and $U_q(\mathfrak{k}) \subset U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ a quantum symmetric pair subalgebra determined by a Lie algebra automorphism $\theta$. We introduce a category $W_\theta$ of weight $U_q(\mathfrak{k})$-modules, which is acted on by the category of weight $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-modules via tensor products. We construct a universal tensor K-matrix $\mathbb{K}$ (that is, a solution of a reflection equation) in a completion of $U_q(\mathfrak{k}) \otimes U_q(\mathfrak{g})$. This yields a natural operator on any tensor product $M \otimes V$, where $M\in W_\theta$ and $V\in {O}_\theta$, that is $V$ is a $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-module in category ${O}$ satisfying an integrability property determined by $\theta$. Canonically, $W_\theta$ is equipped with a structure of a bimodule category over ${O}_\theta$ and the action of $\mathbb{K}$ is encoded by a new categorical structure, which we call a boundary structure on $W_\theta$. This generalizes a result of Kolb which describes a braided module structure on finite-dimensional $U_q(\mathfrak{k})$-modules when $\mathfrak{g}$ is finite-dimensional. We also consider our construction in the case of the category ${C}$ of finite-dimensional modules over a quantum affine algebra, providing the most comprehensive universal framework to date for large families of solutions of parameter-dependent reflection equations. In this case the tensor K-matrix gives rise to a formal Laurent series with a well-defined action on tensor products of any module in $W_\theta$ and any module in ${C}$. This series can be normalized to an operator-valued rational function, which we call trigonometric tensor K-matrix, if both factors in the tensor product are in ${C}$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a universal framework for boundary transfer matrices, inspired by Sklyanin's two-row transfer matrix approach for quantum integrable systems with boundary conditions. The main examples arise from quantum symmetric pairs of finite and affine type. As a special case we recover a construction by Kolb in finite type. We review recent work on universal solutions to the reflection equation and highlight several open problems in this field.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity of characters of parabolic Verma modules, and of restricted Kostant partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2022, Huh-Matherne-M\'esz\'aros-St. Dizier showed that normalized Schur polynomials are Lorentzian, thereby yielding their continuous (resp. discrete) log-concavity on the positive orthant (resp. on their support, in type $A$ root directions). A reinterpretation of this result is that the characters of finite-dimensional simple representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ are denormalized Lorentzian (DL). In the same paper, these authors also showed that shifted characters of Verma modules over $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ are DL.
  In this work we extend these results to a larger family of modules that subsumes both of the above: we show that shifted characters of all parabolic Verma modules over $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ are denormalized Lorentzian. The proof involves certain graphs on $[n+1]$; more strongly, we explain why the character (i.e., generating function) of the Kostant partition function of any loopless multigraph on $[n+1]$ is Lorentzian after shifting and normalizing.
  We then show that parabolic Vermas form a "maximal" class with log-concave (hence DL) characters. Namely, log-concavity fails in greater generality along three natural directions: (1) it does not hold for every simple Lie type, (2) nor for a larger universal family of highest weight modules, the higher order Verma modules, even in type $A$, and (3) it does not always hold for important generalizations of Schur polynomials: the Jack and Macdonald polynomials.
  Finally, we extend these results to parabolic (i.e. "first order") and higher order Verma modules over the semisimple Lie algebras $\oplus_{t=1}^T \mathfrak{sl}_{n_t+1}(\mathbb{C})$. We also partially resolve a conjecture of Huh et al on the DL property for integral highest weight simple modules.</description>

      <title>A generalized character related to the local structure and representation theory of a finite group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03976v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the generalized character $\Psi_{1,p,G}$ of a finite group $G$ which vanishes on all $p$-singular elements of $G$ and whose value at each $p$-regular $y \in G$ is the number of $p$-elements of $C_{G}(y)$. We conjecture that this is always a character, and may be afforded by a projective $RG$-module, where $R$ is an appropriate complete discrete valuation ring whose residue field has characteristic $p$. We examine a number of case where this is the case, and consider consequences for the representation theory and character theory of $G$ when this conjecture is known to hold. In particular, we prove, among other things, that the conjecture is valid for all primes $p$ in the case that $G \cong {\rm PSL}(2,q)$ or ${\rm SL}(2,q)$ for every prime power $q$.</description>

      <title>The truncated symbol of a differential symmetry breaking operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the truncated symbol $\mathrm{Symb}_0(\mathbb{D})$ of a differential symmetry breaking operator $\mathbb{D}$ between parabolically induced representations. This generalizes the symbol map $\mathrm{Symb}$, which is defined for the case of abelian nilpotent radicals, to the non-abelian setting. The inverse $\mathrm{Symb}_0^{-1}$ of the truncated symbol map $\mathrm{Symb}_0$ enables one to apply a recipe of the F-method for any nilpotent radical.
  As an application, we classify and construct differential intertwining operators $\mathcal{D}$ on the full flag variety $SL(3,\mathbb{R})/B$ and homomorphisms $\varphi$ between Verma modules. It turned out that, surprisingly, Cayley continuants $\mathrm{Cay}_m(x;y)$ appeared in the coefficients of one of the five families of operators that we constructed. At the end, the factorization identities of the differential operators $\mathcal{D}$ and homomorphisms $\varphi$ are also classified. Binary Krawtchouk polynomials $K_m(x;y)$ play a key role in the proof.</description>

      <title>On the geometric Satake equivalence for Kac-Moody groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article establishes a geometric Satake equivalence for affine Kac-Moody groups as an equivalence of abelian semisimple categories over algebraically closed fields. We define a well-behaved category of equivariant sheaves on the double affine grassmannian \Gr_{G}, seen as a infty-stack, that we equip with a t-structure. We obtain an Braden's hyperbolic localization theorem for such a stack and prove that the constant term functor is t-exact using dimension estimates for affine MV-cycles. We then deduce the sought-for equivalence and prove that the IC-complexes match with the irreducible highest weight representations of the Langlands dual group G^{\vee}.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of field theories: Crane-Yetter and the shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work solves a 28-year conjecture by showing that two major invariants of smooth 4-manifolds, the shadow model (motivated by statistical mechanics [Tur91]) and the simplicial Crane-Yetter model (motivated by topological quantum field theory [CY93]), are in fact equal.
  These invariants, both of which degenerate to the 3D Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev model in a special case, had been open for years to clarify their relationship. Despite the seeming difference in their origins and formal constructions, we prove their equivalence. Along the way, we sketch a dictionary between the two models, provide a brief survey of the shadow construction \`a la Turaev, and suggest once again that the semisimple models have reached their limits.</description>

      <title>Stable Invariants of Words from Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $w$ be a word in a free group. A few years ago, Magee and the first named author discovered that the stable commutator length (scl) of $w$, a well-known topological invariant, can also be defined in terms of certain Fourier coefficients of $w$-random unitary matrices [arXiv:1802.04862]. But the random-matrix side of this equality can be naturally tweaked by considering $w$-random permutations, $w$-random orthogonal matrices and so on, to produce new invariants for any given word. Are these invariants new? interesting? Do they admit an intrinsic topological description as in the case of $w$-random unitaries and scl?
  The current paper formalizes the definition of these invariants coming from $w$-random matrices, answers the above questions in certain cases involving generalized symmetric groups, and poses detailed conjectures in many others. In particular, we present a plethora of topological, combinatorial and algebraic invariants of words which play, or are at least conjectured to play, a similar role to the one played by scl in the above-mentioned result. Among others, these invariants include two invariants recently defined by Wilton [arXiv:2210.09853]: the stable primitivity rank and a non-oriented analog of scl.</description>

      <title>Classifying thick subcategories over a Koszul complex via the curved BGG correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we classify the thick subcategories of the bounded derived category of dg modules over a Koszul complex on any list of elements in a regular ring. This simultaneously recovers a theorem of Stevenson when the list of elements is a regular sequence and the classification of thick subcategories for an exterior algebra over a field (via the BGG correspondence). One of the major ingredients is a classification of thick tensor submodules of perfect curved dg modules over a commutative noetherian graded ring concentrated in even degrees, recovering a theorem of Hopkins and Neeman. We give several consequences of the classification result over a Koszul complex, one being that the lattice of thick subcategories of the bounded derived category is fixed by Grothendieck duality.</description>

      <title>Stable Invariants of Words from Random Matrices II: Formulas and Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $w$ be a word in a free group. As was revealed by Magee and Puder in [arXiv:1802.04862], the stable commutator length (scl) of $w$, a well-known topological invariant, can also be defined in terms of certain stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random unitary matrices. In the first part of the current work [arXiv:2311.17733], we demonstrated how this phenomenon is much broader: we proved more instances of such results and conjectured others. These new results and conjectures involved other topological invariants (relatives of scl) and different families of groups.
  In the current paper we further extend and support this theory. We provide another instance of the theory and prove that the stable primitivity rank, too, can be expressed in terms of stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements of groups. We introduce concrete formulas for stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements in the symmetric group $S_N$ and its generalizations in the form of the wreath products $G\wr S_N$ where $G$ is an arbitrary compact group. We also define new stable invariants related to these groups, and prove they give bounds to many of the stable Fourier coefficients.
  As an aside, we generalize to tuples of words a result of Puder and Parzanchevski [arXiv:1202.3269] about the expected number of fixed points of $w$-random permutations.</description>
