      <title>Superdiffusive transport in chaotic quantum systems with nodal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of interacting fermionic quantum models in $d$ dimensions with nodal interactions that exhibit superdiffusive transport. We establish non-perturbatively that the nodal structure of the interactions gives rise to long-lived quasiparticle excitations that result in a diverging diffusion constant, even though the system is fully chaotic. Using a Boltzmann equation approach, we find that the charge mode acquires an anomalous dispersion relation at long wavelength $\omega(q) \sim q^{z} $ with dynamical exponent $z={\rm min}[(2n+d)/2n,2]$, where $n$ is the order of the nodal point in momentum space. We verify our predictions in one dimensional systems using tensor-network techniques.</description>

      <title>Extremal events dictate population growth rate inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent methods have been developed to map single-cell lineage statistics to population growth. Because population growth selects for exponentially rare phenotypes, these methods inherently depend on sampling large deviations from finite data, which introduces systematic errors. A comprehensive understanding of these errors in the context of finite data remains elusive. To address this gap, we study the error in growth rate estimates across different models. We show that under the usual bias-variance decomposition, the bias can be decomposed into a finite-time bias and nonlinear averaging bias. We demonstrate that finite-time bias, which dominates at short times, can be mitigated by fitting its monotonic behavior. In contrast, at longer times, nonlinear averaging bias becomes the predominant source of error, leading to a phase transition. This transition can be understood through the Random Energy Model, a mean-field model of disordered systems, where a few lineages dominate the estimator. Applying these methods to experimental data demonstrates that correcting for biases in lineage-based approaches yields consistent results for the long-term growth rate across multiple methods and enables the reverse-engineering of dynamic models. This new framework provides a quantitative understanding of growth rate estimators, clarifies the conditions under which they can be effectively applied to finite data, and introduces model-free approaches for studying the connections between physiology and cell growth.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Non-Equilibrium Critical Phenomena in a Simple Model of Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to understand vehicular traffic jams by studying a simple model, Elementary Cellular Automaton Rule 184 (ECA 184). Using key traffic observables, such as the total delay and relaxation time, as well as microscopic measures like delays and lifetimes of individual jams, we show how these quantities can fully characterize the system's behavior, revealing features analogous to those of a continuous phase transition. We exploit specific properties of ECA 184 to develop an efficient algorithm for calculating these observables numerically and introduce an auxiliary quantity, termed ''elementary jams'', which allows us to determine these observables. We discuss the implications of our results, highlighting connections to a potential field-theoretic description of traffic and suggest future application of these methods to more complex models.

      <title>Breakdown of superdiffusion in perturbed quantum integrable spin chains and ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superdiffusive transport with dynamical exponent $z=3/2$ has been firmly established at finite temperature for a class of integrable systems with a non-abelian global symmetry $G$. On the inclusion of integrability-breaking perturbations, diffusive transport with $z=2$ is generically expected to hold in the limit of late time. Recent studies of the classical Haldane-Ishimori-Skylanin model have found that perturbations that preserve the global symmetry lead to a much slower timescale for the onset of diffusion, albeit with uncertainty over the exact scaling exponent. That is, for perturbations of strength $\lambda$, the characteristic timescale for diffusion goes as $t_*\sim \lambda^{-\alpha}$ for some $\alpha$. Using large-scale matrix product state simulations, we investigate this behavior for perturbations to the canonical quantum model showing superdiffusion: the $S=1/2$ quantum Heisenberg chain. We consider a ladder configuration and look at various perturbations that either break or preserve the $SU(2)$ symmetry, leading to scaling exponents consistent with those observed in one classical study arXiv:2402.18661: $\alpha=2$ for symmetry-breaking terms and $\alpha=6$ for symmetry-preserving terms. We also consider perturbations from another integrable point of the ladder model with $G=SU(4)$ and find consistent results. Finally, we consider a generalization to an $SU(3)$ ladder and find that the $\alpha=6$ scaling appears to be universal across superdiffusive systems when the perturbations preserve the non-abelian symmetry $G$.</description>

      <title>Dissecting a Small Artificial Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the loss landscape and backpropagation dynamics of convergence for the simplest possible artificial neural network representing the logical exclusive-OR (XOR) gate. Cross-sections of the loss landscape in the nine-dimensional parameter space are found to exhibit distinct features, which help understand why backpropagation efficiently achieves convergence toward zero loss, whereas values of weights and biases keep drifting. Differences in shapes of cross-sections obtained by nonrandomized and randomized batches are discussed. In reference to statistical physics we introduce the microcanonical entropy as a unique quantity that allows to characterize the phase behavior of the network. Learning in neural networks can thus be thought of as an annealing process that experiences the analogue of phase transitions known from thermodynamic systems. It also reveals how the loss landscape simplifies as more hidden neurons are added to the network, eliminating entropic barriers caused by finite-size effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that confinement geometry can act as a rectifier in passive diffusion, optimally accelerating first-passage rates beyond free diffusion. Using analytic theory based on the Fick-Jacobs approach and Brownian dynamics simulations, we find nonmonotonic mean first-passage rates driven by entropy. Through the transmission probability, our findings highlight how confinement optimizes transport dynamics in trap-and-escape processes, with implications for molecular translocation and reaction kinetics in soft matter and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Eigenvector Overlaps of Random Covariance Matrices and their Submatrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the singular vectors of any $m \times n$ submatrix of a rectangular $M \times N$ Gaussian matrix and study their asymptotic overlaps with those of the full matrix, in the macroscopic regime where $N \,/\, M\,$, $m \,/\, M$ as well as $n \,/\, N$ converge to fixed ratios. Our method makes use of the dynamics of the singular vectors and of specific resolvents when the matrix coefficients follow Brownian trajectories. We obtain explicit forms for the limiting rescaled mean squared overlaps for right and left singular vectors in the bulk of both spectra, for any initial matrix $A\,$. When it is null, this corresponds to the Marchenko-Pastur setup for covariance matrices, and our formulas simplify into Cauchy-like functions.</description>

      <title>CrystalGRW: Generative Modeling of Crystal Structures with Targeted Properties via Geodesic Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining whether a candidate crystalline material is thermodynamically stable depends on identifying its true ground-state structure, a central challenge in computational materials science. We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Orthogonality catastrophe beyond bosonization from post-selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the dynamics induced by post-selected measurements can serve as a controlled route to access physical processes beyond the boundaries of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid physics. We consider a one-dimensional fermionic wire whose dynamics results from a sequence of weak measurements of the fermionic density at a given site, interspersed with unitary hopping dynamics. This realizes a non-Hermitian variant of the celebrated instance of a local scatterer in a fermionic system and its ensuing orthogonality catastrophe. We observe a distinct crossover in the system's time evolution as a function of the fermion density. In the high-density regime, reminiscent of the Hermitian case, a bosonized version of the model properly describes the dynamics while, as we delve into the low-density regime, the validity of bosonization breaks down, giving rise to irreversible behavior. Notably, this crossover from reversible to irreversible dynamics is non-perturbative in the measurement rate and can manifest itself even with relatively shallow measurement rates, provided that the system's density remains below the crossover threshold. Our results render a conceptually transparent model for exploring non-perturbative effects beyond bosonization, which could be used as a stepping stone to explore novel routes for the control of non-linear dynamics in low-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a second law of thermodynamics in isolated quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time. This appears to conflict with the reversible evolution of isolated quantum systems under the Schr\"odinger equation, which preserves the von Neumann entropy. Nonetheless, one finds that with respect to many observables, expectation values approach a fixed value -- their equilibrium value. This ultimately raises the question: in what sense does the entropy of an isolated quantum system increase over time? For classical systems, one introduces the assumption of a low entropy initial state along with the concept of ignorance about the microscopic details of the physical system, leading to a statistical interpretation of the second law. By considering the observables through which we examine quantum systems, both these assumptions can be incorporated, building upon recent studies of the equilibration on average of observables. While the statistical behavior of observable expectation values is well-established, a quantitative connection to entropy increase has been lacking so far. In deriving novel bounds for the equilibration of observables, and considering the entropy of the system relative to observables, we recover a variant of the second law: the entropy with respect to a given observable tends towards its equilibrium value in the course of the system's unitary evolution. These results also support recent findings which question the necessity of non-integrability for equilibration in quantum systems. We further illustrate our bounds using numerical results from the paradigmatic example of a quantum Ising model on a chain of spins. There, we observe entropy increasing up to equilibrium values, as well as fluctuations which expose the underlying reversible evolution in accordance with the derived bounds.</description>

      <title>Observation of Relaxation Stages in a Nonequilibrium Closed Quantum System: Decaying Turbulence in a Trapped Superfluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of non-equilibrium closed quantum systems and their route to thermalization are of fundamental interest to several fields, from cosmology to particle physics. However, a comprehensive description of non-equilibrium phenomena still presents a significant challenge. In this work, we report the observation of distinct stages during the relaxation of the decaying turbulence in trapped Bose-Einstein condensates. Our findings show a direct particle cascade from low to high momenta, a consequence of the energy injection in the system, exhibiting a characteristic universal scaling. This stage is followed by an inverse particle cascade responsible for repopulating the previously depleted condensate. Both cascades can be explained through self-similar solutions provided by wave turbulence theory. These findings provide important insights into the relaxation stages of out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Farmland Biodiversity Loss: A Bio-Economic Model of Land Consolidation and Pesticide Use</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19749v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biodiversity loss driven by agricultural intensification is a pressing global issue, with significant implications for ecosystem stability and human well-being. Existing policy instruments have so far proven insufficient in halting this decline, which raises the need to explore the possible feedback loops that are pivotal to ecosystem degradation. We design a minimal integrated bio-economic agent-based model to qualitatively explore macro-level biodiversity trends, as influenced by individual farmer behavior within simple decision-making processes. Our model predicts further biodiversity decline under a business-as-usual scenario, primarily due to intensified land consolidation. We evaluate two policy options: reducing pesticide use and subsidizing small farmers. While pesticide reduction rapidly benefits biodiversity in the beginning, it eventually leads to increased land consolidation and further biodiversity loss. In contrast, subsidizing small farmers by reallocating a small fraction of existing subsidies, stabilizes farm sizes and enhances biodiversity in the long run. The most effective strategy results from combining both policies, leveraging pesticide reduction alongside targeted subsidies to balance economic pressures and consistently improve biodiversity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a conformal field theory that arises in the infinite-volume limit of a spin chain with $U_q(sl_2)$ global symmetry. Most operators in the theory are defect-ending operators which allows $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetry transformations to act on them in a consistent way. We use Coulomb gas techniques to construct correlation functions and compute all OPE coefficients of the model, as well as to prove that the properties imposed by the quantum group symmetry are indeed satisfied by the correlation functions. In particular, we treat the non-chiral operators present in the theory. Free boson realization elucidates the origin of the defects attached to the operators. We also comment on the role of quantum group in generalized minimal models.</description>

      <title>Escape-from-a-layer approach for simulating the boundary local time in Euclidean domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient numerical approach to simulate the boundary local time of reflected Brownian motion, as well as the time and position of the associated reaction event on a smooth boundary of a Euclidean domain. This approach combines the standard walk-on-spheres algorithm in the bulk with the approximate solution of the escape problem in a boundary layer. In this way, the most time-consuming simulation of multiple reflections on the boundary is replaced by an equivalent escape event. We validate the proposed escape-from-a-layer approach by comparing simulated statistics of the boundary local time with exact results known for simple domains (a disk, a circular annulus, a sphere, a spherical shell) and with the numerical results obtained by a finite-element method in more sophisticated domains. This approach offers a powerful tool for simulating reflected Brownian motion in multi-scale confinements such as porous media or biological environments, and for solving the related partial differential equations. Its applications in the context of diffusion-controlled reactions in chemical physics are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We derive the hydrodynamic equations of perfect fluids without boost invariance [1] from kinetic theory. Our approach is to follow the standard derivation of the Vlasov hierarchy based on an a-priori unknown collision functional satisfying certain axiomatic properties consistent with the absence of boost invariance. The kinetic theory treatment allows us to identify various transport coefficients in the hydrodynamic regime. We identify a drift term that effects a relaxation to an equilibrium where detailed balance with the environment with respect to momentum transfer is obtained. We then show how the derivative expansion of the hydrodynamics of flocks can be recovered from boost non-invariant kinetic theory and hydrodynamics. We identify how various coefficients of the former relate to a parameterization of the so-called equation of kinetic state that yields relations between different coefficients, arriving at a symmetry-based understanding as to why certain coefficients in hydrodynamic descriptions of active flocks are naturally of order one, and others, naturally small. When inter-particle forces are expressed in terms of a kinetic theory influence kernel, a coarse-graining scale and resulting derivative expansion emerge in the hydrodynamic limit, allowing us to derive diffusion terms as infrared-relevant operators distilling different parameterizations of microscopic interactions. We conclude by highlighting possible applications.</description>
