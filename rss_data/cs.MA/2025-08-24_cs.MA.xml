      <title>Building and Measuring Trust between Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly interact with each other, most notably in multi-agent setups, we may expect (and hope) that `trust' relationships develop between them, mirroring trust relationships between human colleagues, friends, or partners. Yet, though prior work has shown LLMs to be capable of identifying emotional connections and recognizing reciprocity in trust games, little remains known about (i) how different strategies to build trust compare, (ii) how such trust can be measured implicitly, and (iii) how this relates to explicit measures of trust.
  We study these questions by relating implicit measures of trust, i.e. susceptibility to persuasion and propensity to collaborate financially, with explicit measures of trust, i.e. a dyadic trust questionnaire well-established in psychology. We build trust in three ways: by building rapport dynamically, by starting from a prewritten script that evidences trust, and by adapting the LLMs' system prompt. Surprisingly, we find that the measures of explicit trust are either little or highly negatively correlated with implicit trust measures. These findings suggest that measuring trust between LLMs by asking their opinion may be deceiving. Instead, context-specific and implicit measures may be more informative in understanding how LLMs trust each other.</description>

      <title>Sound and Solution-Complete CCBS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-time Conflict Based-Search (CCBS) has long been viewed as the de-facto optimal solver for multi-agent path finding in continuous time (MAPFR). Recent findings, however, show that the original theoretical variant of CCBS can suffer from non-termination, while the widely used implementation can return sub-optimal solutions. We introduce an analytical framework that yields simple and sufficient conditions under which any CCBS-style algorithm is both sound, i.e., returns only optimal solutions, and solution complete, i.e., terminates on every solvable MAPFR instance. Investigating the publicly available implementation of CCBS reveals that it violates these conditions. Though this merely indicates that CCBS might be unsound, this indication is supported by counter-examples.
  Leveraging the analytical framework, we propose a novel branching rule and prove that it satisfies the sufficient conditions, thereby restoring soundness and termination guarantees. Consequently, the resulting CCBS variant is both sound and solution complete, matching the guarantees of the discrete-time CBS for the first time in the continuous domain. We experimentally apply standard CCBS and CCBS under our branching rule to an example problem, with our branching rule returning a solution with lower sum-of-costs than standard CCBS. Because the branching rule largely only affects the branching step, it can be adopted as a drop-in replacement in existing code-bases, as we show in our provided implementation. Beyond CCBS, the analytical framework and termination criterion provide a systematic way to evaluate other CCBS-like MAPFR solvers and future extensions.</description>

      <title>Integrated Noise and Safety Management in UAM via A Unified Reinforcement Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) envisions the widespread use of small aerial vehicles to transform transportation in dense urban environments. However, UAM faces critical operational challenges, particularly the balance between minimizing noise exposure and maintaining safe separation in low-altitude urban airspace, two objectives that are often addressed separately. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based air traffic management system that integrates both noise and safety considerations within a unified, decentralized framework. Under this scalable air traffic coordination solution, agents operate in a structured, multi-layered airspace and learn altitude adjustment policies to jointly manage noise impact and separation constraints. The system demonstrates strong performance across both objectives and reveals tradeoffs among separation, noise exposure, and energy efficiency under high traffic density. The findings highlight the potential of RL and multi-objective coordination strategies in enhancing the safety, quietness, and efficiency of UAM operations.</description>

      <title>Abmax: A JAX-based Agent-based Modeling Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a principal approach for studying complex systems. By decomposing a system into simpler, interacting agents, agent-based modeling (ABM) allows researchers to observe the emergence of complex phenomena. High-performance array computing libraries like JAX can help scale such computational models to a large number of agents by using automatic vectorization and just-in-time (JIT) compilation. One of the caveats of using JAX to achieve such scaling is that the shapes of arrays used in the computational model should remain immutable throughout the simulation. In the context of agent-based modeling (ABM), this can pose constraints on certain agent manipulation operations that require flexible data structures. A subset of which is represented by the ability to update a dynamically selected number of agents by applying distinct changes to them during a simulation. To this effect, we introduce Abmax, an ABM framework based on JAX that implements multiple just-in-time (JIT) compilable algorithms to provide this functionality. On the canonical predation model benchmark, Abmax achieves runtime performance comparable to state-of-the-art implementations. Further, we show that this functionality can also be vectorized, making it possible to run many similar agent-based models in parallel. We also present two examples in the form of a traffic-flow model and a financial market model to show the use case of Abmax.</description>

      <title>DeepMEL: A Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework for Multimodal Entity Linking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to associate textual and visual mentions with entities in a multimodal knowledge graph. Despite its importance, current methods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse cross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs) and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM, significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision. DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving ACC by 1%-57%. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of all modules.</description>

      <title>ASIC-Agent: An Autonomous Multi-Agent System for ASIC Design with Benchmark Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Register Transfer Level (RTL) design, enabling high-quality code generation from natural language descriptions. However, LLMs alone face significant limitations in real-world hardware design workflows, including the inability to execute code, lack of debugging capabilities, and absence of long-term memory. To address these challenges, we present ASIC-Agent, an autonomous system designed specifically for digital ASIC design tasks. ASIC-Agent enhances base LLMs with a multi-agent architecture incorporating specialized sub-agents for RTL generation, verification, OpenLane hardening, and Caravel chip integration, all operating within a comprehensive sandbox environment with access to essential hardware design tools. The system leverages a vector database containing documentation, API references, error knowledge, and curated insights from the open-source silicon community. To evaluate ASIC-Agent's performance, we introduce ASIC-Agent-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess agentic systems in hardware design tasks. We evaluate ASIC-Agent with various base LLMs, providing quantitative comparisons and qualitative insights into agent behavior across different design scenarios. Our results demonstrate that ASIC-Agent, when powered by Claude 4 Sonnet, successfully automates a broad range of ASIC design tasks spanning varying levels of complexity, showing the potential of significantly accelerating the ASIC design workflow.</description>

      <title>Limit-Computable Grains of Truth for Arbitrary Computable Extensive-Form (Un)Known Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Bayesian player acting in an infinite multi-player game learns to predict the other players' strategies if his prior assigns positive probability to their play (or contains a grain of truth). Kalai and Lehrer's classic grain of truth problem is to find a reasonably large class of strategies that contains the Bayes-optimal policies with respect to this class, allowing mutually-consistent beliefs about strategy choice that obey the rules of Bayesian inference. Only small classes are known to have a grain of truth and the literature contains several related impossibility results. In this paper we present a formal and general solution to the full grain of truth problem: we construct a class of strategies wide enough to contain all computable strategies as well as Bayes-optimal strategies for every reasonable prior over the class. When the "environment" is a known repeated stage game, we show convergence in the sense of [KL93a] and [KL93b]. When the environment is unknown, agents using Thompson sampling converge to play $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibria in arbitrary unknown computable multi-agent environments. Finally, we include an application to self-predictive policies that avoid planning. While these results use computability theory only as a conceptual tool to solve a classic game theory problem, we show that our solution can naturally be computationally approximated arbitrarily closely.</description>

      <title>Swarming Without an Anchor (SWA): Robot Swarms Adapt Better to Localization Dropouts Then a Single Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the Swarming Without an Anchor (SWA) approach to state estimation in swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) experiencing ego-localization dropout, where individual agents are laterally stabilized using relative information only. We propose to fuse decentralized state estimation with robust mutual perception and onboard sensor data to maintain accurate state awareness despite intermittent localization failures. Thus, the relative information used to estimate the lateral state of UAVs enables the identification of the unambiguous state of UAVs with respect to the local constellation. The resulting behavior reaches velocity consensus, as this task can be referred to as the double integrator synchronization problem. All disturbances and performance degradations except a uniform translation drift of the swarm as a whole is attenuated which is enabling new opportunities in using tight cooperation for increasing reliability and resilience of multi-UAV systems. Simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its capability to sustain cohesive swarm behavior in challenging conditions of unreliable or unavailable primary localization.</description>

      <title>LLM-Based Agents for Competitive Landscape Mapping in Drug Asset Due Diligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing. Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal, unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research (65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the competitive analysis.</description>

      <title>Balancing Act: Prioritization Strategies for LLM-Designed Restless Bandit Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12112v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used to design reward functions based on human preferences in Reinforcement Learning (RL). We focus on LLM-designed rewards for Restless Multi-Armed Bandits, a framework for allocating limited resources among agents. In applications such as public health, this approach empowers grassroots health workers to tailor automated allocation decisions to community needs. In the presence of multiple agents, altering the reward function based on human preferences can impact subpopulations very differently, leading to complex tradeoffs and a multi-objective resource allocation problem. We are the first to present a principled method termed Social Choice Language Model for dealing with these tradeoffs for LLM-designed rewards for multiagent planners in general and restless bandits in particular. The novel part of our model is a transparent and configurable selection component, called an adjudicator, external to the LLM that controls complex tradeoffs via a user-selected social welfare function. Our experiments demonstrate that our model reliably selects more effective, aligned, and balanced reward functions compared to purely LLM-based approaches.</description>

      <title>SIGMA: Sheaf-Informed Geometric Multi-Agent Pathfinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem aims to determine the shortest and collision-free paths for multiple agents in a known, potentially obstacle-ridden environment. It is the core challenge for robotic deployments in large-scale logistics and transportation. Decentralized learning-based approaches have shown great potential for addressing the MAPF problems, offering more reactive and scalable solutions. However, existing learning-based MAPF methods usually rely on agents making decisions based on a limited field of view (FOV), resulting in short-sighted policies and inefficient cooperation in complex scenarios. There, a critical challenge is to achieve consensus on potential movements between agents based on limited observations and communications. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new framework that applies sheaf theory to decentralized deep reinforcement learning, enabling agents to learn geometric cross-dependencies between each other through local consensus and utilize them for tightly cooperative decision-making. In particular, sheaf theory provides a mathematical proof of conditions for achieving global consensus through local observation. Inspired by this, we incorporate a neural network to approximately model the consensus in latent space based on sheaf theory and train it through self-supervised learning. During the task, in addition to normal features for MAPF as in previous works, each agent distributedly reasons about a learned consensus feature, leading to efficient cooperation on pathfinding and collision avoidance. As a result, our proposed method demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art learning-based MAPF planners, especially in relatively large and complex scenarios, demonstrating its superiority over baselines in various simulations and real-world robot experiments.

      <title>FACET: Teacher-Centred LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems-Towards Personalized Educational Worksheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing heterogeneity of student populations poses significant challenges for teachers, particularly in mathematics education, where cognitive, motivational, and emotional differences strongly influence learning outcomes. While AI-driven personalization tools have emerged, most remain performance-focused, offering limited support for teachers and neglecting broader pedagogical needs. This paper presents the FACET framework, a teacher-facing, large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system designed to generate individualized classroom materials that integrate both cognitive and motivational dimensions of learner profiles. The framework comprises three specialized agents: (1) learner agents that simulate diverse profiles incorporating topic proficiency and intrinsic motivation, (2) a teacher agent that adapts instructional content according to didactical principles, and (3) an evaluator agent that provides automated quality assurance. We tested the system using authentic grade 8 mathematics curriculum content and evaluated its feasibility through a) automated agent-based assessment of output quality and b) exploratory feedback from K-12 in-service teachers. Results from ten internal evaluations highlighted high stability and alignment between generated materials and learner profiles, and teacher feedback particularly highlighted structure and suitability of tasks. The findings demonstrate the potential of multi-agent LLM architectures to provide scalable, context-aware personalization in heterogeneous classroom settings, and outline directions for extending the framework to richer learner profiles and real-world classroom trials.</description>
