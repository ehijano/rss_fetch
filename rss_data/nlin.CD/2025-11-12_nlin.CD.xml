      <title>Flow primitives and infinitesimal generators of Perron-Frobenius and Koopman operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman and the Perron-Frobenius operators are increasingly becoming popular in the control of complex nonlinear systems such as in a wide variety of robotics problems and flow control. This is in addition to the wide interest in the application of operator methods for better understanding of fluid flows. A particular problem of relevance to all such applications is, how does the Koopman or the Perron-Frobenius (PF) operator change if the underlying vector field of the dynamical system undergoes small changes or if two vector fields are added. The current numerical methods rely on significant computations and model or parameter changes to the dynamical system often require all the computations to be repeated. This paper reports on a novel approach to the computation of the approximate PF and Koopman operators in such cases. The approach makes use of the exponentials of the infinitesimal generators of these operators. It is shown that this approximation depends on the Lie bracket of the vector field and the perturbation vector field. Examples are described where the Koopman and PF operators are constructed from operators of primitive flows and for cases where the model parameters undergo perturbations.</description>

      <title>Measuring FPUT thermalization with Toda integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the ergodic properties of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou-$\alpha$ model for generic initial conditions using a Toda integral. It serves as an adiabatic invariant for the system and a suitable observable to measure its equilibrium time. Over this timescale, the onset of action diffusion results in ergodic temporal fluctuations. We compare this timescale with the inverse of the maximum Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ and its saturation time, which are systematically shorter. The Toda integral ergodization/equilibrium time is system size independent for long chains, but show dramatic growth when the system size is smaller than a critical one, whose value depends on the energy density. We measure the dependence of energy density on the critical system size and relate this observation to the possible emergence of a Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser regime. We numerically determine the critical energy density of this regime, finding that it approximately decays as $1/N^2$ with the number of particles N.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals into black holes surrounded by matter: Resonance crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The forthcoming space-based gravitational-wave observatory Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should enable the detection of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs), in which a stellar-mass compact object gradually inspirals into a supermassive black hole while emitting gravitational waves. Modeling the waveforms of such systems is a challenging task, requiring precise computation of energy and angular momentum fluxes as well as proper treatment of orbital resonances, during which two fundamental orbital frequencies become commensurate. In this work, we perform a systematic comparison of fluxes derived from three approaches: the quadrupole formula, post-Newtonian approximations, and time-domain solutions of the Teukolsky equation. We show that quadrupole-based fluxes remain in good agreement with Teukolsky results across a broad range of orbital configurations, including perturbed orbits. Building on these insights, we explore the dynamical impact of resonance crossings within the adiabatic approximation. By introducing novel numerical methods, we reduce computational costs and uncover diverse resonance-crossing behaviors. These results contribute to the effort to understand theoretically and model adequately resonance crossings during an EMRI.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian chaos and the enstrophy cascade in Ekman-Navier-Stokes two-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional turbulence with linear (Ekman) friction exhibits spectral properties that deviate from the classical Kraichnan prediction for the direct enstrophy cascade. In particular, for sufficiently small viscosity and large friction, the enstrophy flux is suppressed in the cascade and, as a consequence, the small-scale vorticity field becomes passively transported by the large-scale, chaotic flow. We numerically address this problem by investigating how the statistics of the Lagrangian Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent in 2D Ekman-Navier-Stokes simulations are affected by the friction coefficient and by the other parameters of the flow. We derive a simple phenomenological model that interpolates the dependence of the Lyapunov exponent on the flow statistics from the large friction limit, where analytical predictions are available, to the small friction region. We find that the distribution of the FTLE around this mean value is always close to a Gaussian, and this allows to make a simple prediction for the correction of the spectral slope of the direct cascade which is in very good agreement with the numerical results.</description>

      <title>The effect of discrete-time evolution on thermalisation in a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particles subject to weak contact interactions in a finite-size lattice tend to thermalise. The Hamiltonian evolution ensures energy conservation and the final temperature is fully determined by the initial conditions. In this work we show that equilibration processes are radically different in lattices subject to discrete-step unitary evolution, which have been implemented in photonic circuits, coin polarisation walkers and time-multiplexed pulses in fibres. Using numerical simulations, we show that weak nonlinearities lead to an equilibrium state of equal modal occupation across all the bands, i.e, a thermal state with infinite temperature and chemical potential. This state is reached no matter the initial distribution of modes and independent of the bands dispersions and gaps. We show that by engineering the temporal periodicity inherent to these systems, equilibration can be accelerated through resonant Floquet channels. Our results demonstrate that discrete time plays a crucial role in wave dynamics, fundamentally altering thermalisation processes within weak wave turbulence theory.</description>

      <title>Universal Frequency Correlations and Recurrence Statistics of Complex Impedance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear electromagnetic wave scattering systems can be characterized by an impedance matrix that relates the voltages and currents at the ports of the system. When the system size becomes greater than the wavelength of the fields involved, the impedance matrix becomes a complicated function of the details of the system, in which case a statistical model, such as the Random Coupling Model (RCM) becomes useful. The statistics of the elements of the RCM impedance matrix depend on the excitation frequency, the spectral density of the modes of the enclosed system volume, the average loss factor (Q^{-1}) of the system, and the properties of the coupling ports as given by their radiation impedances. In this paper, properties of the elements of impedance matrices are explored numerically and experimentally. These include the two point frequency correlation functions for the complex impedance of elements and the expected difference in frequencies between which impedance values are approximately repeated. Universal scaling arguments are then given for these quantities, hence these results are generic for all sufficiently complicated scattering systems, including acoustic and optical systems. The experimental data presented in this paper come from microwave graphs, billiards, and three-dimensional cavities with embedded tunable perturbers such as metasurfaces. The data is found to be in generally good agreement with the predictions for the two point frequency correlations and the frequency interval for successive repetitions of impedance matrix elements values.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue and pseudospectrum processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with rank 1 perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08129v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two kinds of matrix-valued dynamical processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with the additive rank 1 perturbations $\delta J$, where $\delta \in {\mathbb{C}}$ and $J$ is the all-ones matrix. For each process, first we report the complicated motion of the numerically obtained eigenvalues. Then we derive the specific equation which determines the motion of non-zero simple eigenvalues and clarifies the time-dependence of degeneracy of the zero-eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$. Comparison with the solutions of this equation, it is concluded that the numerically observed non-zero eigenvalues distributing around $\lambda_0$ are the exact eigenvalues not of the original system, but of the system perturbed by uncontrolled rounding errors of computer. The complex domain in which the eigenvalues of randomly perturbed system are distributed is identified with the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$ of the original system with $\delta J$. We characterize the pseudospectrum processes using the symbol curves of the corresponding nonnormal Toeplitz operators without $\delta J$. We report new phenomena in our second model such that at each time the outermost closed simple curve cut out from the symbol curve is realized as the exact eigenvalues, but the inner part of symbol curve is reduced in size and embedded in the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. Such separation of exact simple eigenvalues and a degenerated eigenvalue associated with pseudospectrum will be meaningful for numerical analysis, since the former is stable and robust, but the latter is highly sensitive and unstable with respective to perturbations. The present study will be related to the pseudospectra approaches to non-Hermitian systems developed in quantum physics</description>

      <title>Generalized Eigenspaces and Pseudospectra of Nonnormal and Defective Matrix-Valued Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider nonnormal matrix-valued dynamical systems with discrete time. For an eigenvalue of matrix, the number of times it appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial is called the algebraic multiplicity. On the other hand, the geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the linear space of eigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue. If the former exceeds the latter, then the eigenvalue is said to be defective and the matrix becomes nondiagonalizable by any similarity transformation. The discrete-time of our dynamics is identified with the geometric multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$. Its algebraic multiplicity takes about half of the matrix size at $t=1$ and increases stepwise in time, which keeps excess to the geometric multiplicity until their coincidence at the final time. Our model exhibits relaxation processes from far-from-normal to near-normal matrices, in which the defectivity of $\lambda_0$ is recovering in time. We show that such processes are realized as size reductions of pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. Here the pseudospectra are the domains on the complex plane which are not necessarily exact spectra but in which the resolvent of matrix takes extremely large values. The defective eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ is sensitive to perturbation and the eigenvalues of the perturbed systems are distributed densely in the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. By constructing generalized eigenspace for $\lambda_0$, we give the Jordan block decomposition for the resolvent of matrix and characterize the pseudospectrum dynamics. Numerical study of the systems perturbed by Gaussian random matrices supports the validity of the present analysis.</description>
