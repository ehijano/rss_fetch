      <title>Pushing the Frontier on Approximate EFX Allocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of allocating a set of indivisible goods to a set of agents with additive valuation functions, aiming to achieve approximate envy-freeness up to any good ($\alpha$-EFX). The state-of-the-art results on the problem include that (exact) EFX allocations exist when (a) there are at most three agents, or (b) the agents' valuation functions can take at most two values, or (c) the agents' valuation functions can be represented via a graph. For $\alpha$-EFX, it is known that a $0.618$-EFX allocation exists for any number of agents with additive valuation functions. In this paper, we show that $2/3$-EFX allocations exist when (a) there are at most \emph{seven agents}, (b) the agents' valuation functions can take at most \emph{three values}, or (c) the agents' valuation functions can be represented via a \emph{multigraph}. Our results can be interpreted in two ways. First, by relaxing the notion of EFX to $2/3$-EFX, we obtain existence results for strict generalizations of the settings for which exact EFX allocations are known to exist. Secondly, by imposing restrictions on the setting, we manage to beat the barrier of $0.618$ and achieve an approximation guarantee of $2/3$. Therefore, our results push the \emph{frontier} of existence and computation of approximate EFX allocations, and provide insights into the challenges of settling the existence of exact EFX allocations.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of T\^atonnement for Linear Fisher Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T\^atonnement is a simple, intuitive market process where prices are iteratively adjusted based on the difference between demand and supply. Many variants under different market assumptions have been studied and shown to converge to a market equilibrium, in some cases at a fast rate. However, the classical case of linear Fisher markets have long eluded the analyses, and it remains unclear whether t\^atonnement converges in this case. We show that, for a sufficiently small step size, the prices given by the t\^atonnement process are guaranteed to converge to equilibrium prices, up to a small approximation radius that depends on the stepsize. To achieve this, we consider the dual Eisenberg-Gale convex program in the price space, view t\^atonnement as subgradient descent on this convex program, and utilize novel last-iterate convergence results for subgradient descent under error bound conditions. In doing so, we show that the convex program satisfies a particular error bound condition, the quadratic growth condition, and that the price sequence generated by t\^atonnement is bounded above and away from zero. We also show that a similar convergence result holds for t\^atonnement in quasi-linear Fisher markets. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the theoretical linear convergence aligns with empirical observations.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Information Asymmetry in Two-Stage Contracts with Non-Myopic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Stackelberg game in which a principal (she) establishes a two-stage contract with a non-myopic agent (he) whose type is unknown. The contract takes the form of an incentive function mapping the agent's first-stage action to his second-stage incentive. While the first-stage action reveals the agent's type under truthful play, a non-myopic agent could benefit from portraying a false type in the first stage to obtain a larger incentive in the second stage. The challenge is thus for the principal to design the incentive function so as to induce truthful play. We show that this is only possible with a constant, non-reactive incentive functions when the type space is continuous, whereas it can be achieved with reactive functions for discrete types. Additionally, we show that introducing an adjustment mechanism that penalizes inconsistent behavior across both stages allows the principal to design more flexible incentive functions.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-Rank-Collections: Analyzing Expected Strategic Behavior with Uncertain Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Game theory relies heavily on the availability of cardinal utility functions, but in fields such as matching markets, only ordinal preferences are typically elicited. The literature focuses on mechanisms with simple dominant strategies, but many real-world applications lack dominant strategies, making the intensity of preferences between outcomes important for determining strategies. Even though precise information about cardinal utilities is not available, some data about the likelihood of utility functions is often accessible. We propose to use Bayesian games to formalize uncertainty about the decision-makers' utilities by viewing them as a collection of normal-form games. Instead of searching for the Bayes-Nash equilibrium, we study how uncertainty in utilities is reflected in uncertainty of strategic play. To do this, we introduce a novel solution concept called $\alpha$-Rank-collections, which extends $\alpha$-Rank to Bayesian games. This allows us to analyze strategic play in, for example, non-strategyproof matching markets, for which appropriate solution concepts are currently lacking. $\alpha$-Rank-collections characterize the expected probability of encountering a certain strategy profile under replicator dynamics in the long run, rather than predicting a specific equilibrium strategy profile. We experimentally evaluate $\alpha$-Rank-collections using instances of the Boston mechanism, finding that our solution concept provides more nuanced predictions compared to Bayes-Nash equilibria. Additionally, we prove that $\alpha$-Rank-collections are invariant to positive affine transformations, a standard property for a solution concept, and are efficient to approximate.</description>

      <title>Fair Distribution of Delivery Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of fair distribution of delivery tasks among a set of agents wherein delivery jobs are placed along the vertices of a graph. Our goal is to fairly distribute delivery costs (modeled as a submodular function) among a fixed set of agents while satisfying some desirable notions of economic efficiency. We adopt well-established fairness concepts -- such as envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) and minimax share (MMS) -- to our setting and show that fairness is often incompatible with the efficiency notion of social optimality. We then characterize instances that admit fair and socially optimal solutions by exploiting graph structures. We further show that achieving fairness along with Pareto optimality is computationally intractable. We complement this by designing an XP algorithm (parameterized by the number of agents) for finding MMS and Pareto optimal solutions on every tree instance, and show that the same algorithm can be modified to find efficient solutions along with EF1, when such solutions exist. The latter crucially relies on an intriguing result that in our setting EF1 and Pareto optimality jointly imply MMS. We conclude by theoretically and experimentally analyzing the price of fairness.</description>

      <title>Competitive Auctions with Imperfect Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The competitive auction was first proposed by Goldberg, Hartline, and Wright. In their paper, they introduce the competitive analysis framework of online algorithm designing into the traditional revenue-maximizing auction design problem. While the competitive analysis framework only cares about the worst-case bound, a growing body of work in the online algorithm community studies the learning-augmented framework. In this framework, designers are allowed to leverage imperfect machine-learned predictions of unknown information and pursue better theoretical guarantees when the prediction is accurate(consistency). Meanwhile, designers also need to maintain a nearly-optimal worst-case ratio(robustness).
  In this work, we revisit the competitive auctions in the learning-augmented setting. We leverage the imperfect predictions of the private value of the bidders and design the learning-augmented mechanisms for several competitive auctions with different constraints, including digital good auctions, limited-supply auctions, and general downward-closed permutation environments. For all these auction environments, our mechanisms enjoy $1$-consistency against the strongest benchmark $OPT$, which is impossible to achieve $O(1)$-competitive without predictions. At the same time, our mechanisms also maintain the $O(1)$-robustness against all benchmarks considered in the traditional competitive analysis. Considering the possible inaccuracy of the predictions, we provide a reduction that transforms our learning-augmented mechanisms into an error-tolerant version, which enables the learning-augmented mechanism to ensure satisfactory revenue in scenarios where the prediction error is moderate.</description>

      <title>Capacity Modification in the Stable Matching Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of capacity modification in the many-to-one stable matching of workers and firms. Our goal is to systematically study how the set of stable matchings changes when some seats are added to or removed from the firms. We make three main contributions: First, we examine whether firms and workers can improve or worsen upon changing the capacities under worker-proposing and firm-proposing deferred acceptance algorithms. Second, we study the computational problem of adding or removing seats to either match a fixed worker-firm pair in some stable matching or make a fixed matching stable with respect to the modified problem. We develop polynomial-time algorithms for these problems when only the overall change in the firms' capacities is restricted, and show NP-hardness when there are additional constraints for individual firms. Lastly, we compare capacity modification with the classical model of preference manipulation by firms and identify scenarios under which one mode of manipulation outperforms the other. We find that a threshold on a given firm's capacity, which we call its peak, crucially determines the effectiveness of different manipulation actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a truthful facility location problem in which there is a set of agents with private locations on the line of real numbers, and the goal is to place a number of facilities at different locations chosen from the set of those reported by the agents. Given a feasible solution, each agent suffers an individual cost that is either its total distance to all facilities (sum-variant) or its distance to the farthest facility (max-variant). For both variants, we show tight bounds on the approximation ratio of strategyproof mechanisms in terms of the social cost, the total individual cost of the agents.</description>

      <title>CHG Shapley: Efficient Data Valuation and Selection towards Trustworthy Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of machine learning models is crucial for ensuring trustworthy machine learning. Data Shapley, a landmark study on data valuation, advances this understanding by assessing the contribution of each datum to model accuracy. However, the resource-intensive and time-consuming nature of multiple model retraining poses challenges for applying Data Shapley to large datasets. To address this, we propose the CHG (Conduct of Hardness and Gradient) score, which approximates the utility of each data subset on model accuracy during a single model training. By deriving the closed-form expression of the Shapley value for each data point under the CHG score utility function, we reduce the computational complexity to the equivalent of a single model retraining, an exponential improvement over existing methods. Additionally, we employ CHG Shapley for real-time data selection, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying high-value and noisy data. CHG Shapley facilitates trustworthy model training through efficient data valuation, introducing a novel data-centric perspective on trustworthy machine learning.</description>

      <title>DU-Shapley: A Shapley Value Proxy for Efficient Dataset Valuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dataset valuation problem, that is, the problem of quantifying the incremental gain, to some relevant pre-defined utility of a machine learning task, of aggregating an individual dataset to others. The Shapley value is a natural tool to perform dataset valuation due to its formal axiomatic justification, which can be combined with Monte Carlo integration to overcome the computational tractability challenges. Such generic approximation methods, however, remain expensive in some cases. In this paper, we exploit the knowledge about the structure of the dataset valuation problem to devise more efficient Shapley value estimators. We propose a novel approximation, referred to as discrete uniform Shapley, which is expressed as an expectation under a discrete uniform distribution with support of reasonable size. We justify the relevancy of the proposed framework via asymptotic and non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees and illustrate its benefits via an extensive set of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Data Poisoning to Fake a Nash Equilibrium in Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize offline data poisoning attacks on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), where an attacker may change a data set in an attempt to install a (potentially fictitious) unique Markov-perfect Nash equilibrium for a two-player zero-sum Markov game. We propose the unique Nash set, namely the set of games, specified by their Q functions, with a specific joint policy being the unique Nash equilibrium. The unique Nash set is central to poisoning attacks because the attack is successful if and only if data poisoning pushes all plausible games inside the set. The unique Nash set generalizes the reward polytope commonly used in inverse reinforcement learning to MARL. For zero-sum Markov games, both the inverse Nash set and the set of plausible games induced by data are polytopes in the Q function space. We exhibit a linear program to efficiently compute the optimal poisoning attack. Our work sheds light on the structure of data poisoning attacks on offline MARL, a necessary step before one can design more robust MARL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Multi-Sender Persuasion: A Computational Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the multi-sender persuasion problem: multiple players with informational advantage signal to convince a single self-interested actor to take certain actions. This problem generalizes the seminal Bayesian Persuasion framework and is ubiquitous in computational economics, multi-agent learning, and machine learning with multiple objectives. The core solution concept here is the Nash equilibrium of senders' signaling policies. Theoretically, we prove that finding an equilibrium in general is PPAD-Hard; in fact, even computing a sender's best response is NP-Hard. Given these intrinsic difficulties, we turn to finding local Nash equilibria. We propose a novel differentiable neural network to approximate this game's non-linear and discontinuous utilities. Complementing this with the extra-gradient algorithm, we discover local equilibria that Pareto dominates full-revelation equilibria and those found by existing neural networks. Broadly, our theoretical and empirical contributions are of interest to a large class of economic problems.</description>

      <title>Randomized Binary and Tree Search under Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a generalized binary search problem on the line and general trees. On the line (e.g., a sorted array), binary search finds a target node in $O(\log n)$ queries in the worst case, where $n$ is the number of nodes. In situations with limited budget or time, we might only be able to perform a few queries, possibly sub-logarithmic many. In this case, it is impossible to guarantee that the target will be found regardless of its position. Our main result is the construction of a randomized strategy that maximizes the minimum (over the target position) probability of finding the target. Such a strategy provides a natural solution where there is no apriori (stochastic) information of the target's position. As with regular binary search, we can find and run the strategy in $O(\log n)$ time (and using only $O(\log n)$ random bits). Our construction is obtained by reinterpreting the problem as a two-player (\textit{seeker} and \textit{hider}) zero-sum game and exploiting an underlying number theoretical structure.
  Furthermore, we generalize the setting to study a search game on trees. In this case, a query returns the edge's endpoint closest to the target. Again, when the number of queries is bounded by some given $k$, we quantify a \emph{the-less-queries-the-better} approach by defining a seeker's profit $p$ depending on the number of queries needed to locate the hider. For the linear programming formulation of the corresponding zero-sum game, we show that computing the best response for the hider (i.e., the separation problem of the underlying dual LP) can be done in time $O(n^2 2^{2k})$, where $n$ is the size of the tree. This result allows to compute a Nash equilibrium in polynomial time whenever $k=O(\log n)$. In contrast, computing the best response for the hider is NP-hard.</description>
