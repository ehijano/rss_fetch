      <title>Yamaguti algebras and noncrossing partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Das defined a new type of algebras, the Yamaguti algebras, which are supposed to serve as envelopes of Lie-Yamaguti algebras appearing naturally in differential geometry. We show that the nonsymmetric operad of Yamaguti algebras admit a simple combinatorial description via noncrossing partitions without singleton blocks.</description>

Abstract: We attach to each weak model category $\mathcal{M}$ a class of first order formulas about the fibrant objects of $\mathcal{M}$ whose validity is invariant under homotopies and weak equivalences. This is a generalization of the classical Blanc-Freyd Language of categories -- which involves formula avoiding equality on objects and which are invariant under isomorphism and equivalences of categories. In particular, we obtain similar homotopy invariant languages for $2$-categories, bicategories, chain complexes, Kan complexes, quasi-categories, Segal spaces, and so on...</description>

      <title>The six operations in topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.10212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the six functor formalism for sheaves on locally compact Hausdorff topological spaces, as developed for example in Kashiwara and Schapira's book Sheaves on Manifolds, can be extended to sheaves with values in any closed symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category which is stable and bicomplete. Notice that, since we do not assume that our coefficients are presentable or restrict to hypercomplete sheaves, our arguments are not obvious and are substantially different from the ones explained by Kashiwara and Schapira. Along the way we also study locally contractible geometric morphisms and prove that, if $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a continuous map which induces a locally contractible geometric morphism, then the exceptional pullback functor $f^!$ preserves colimits and can be related to the pullback $f^*$. At the end of our paper we also show how one can express Atiyah duality by means of the six functor formalism.</description>

      <title>Morse theory for chromatic Delaunay triangulations</title>

Abstract: The chromatic alpha filtration is a generalization of the alpha filtration that can encode spatial relationships among classes of labelled point cloud data, and has applications in topological data analysis of multi-species data. In this paper we introduce the chromatic Delaunay-\v{C}ech and chromatic Delaunay-Rips filtrations, which are computationally favourable alternatives to the chromatic alpha filtration. We use generalized discrete Morse theory to show that the \v{C}ech, chromatic Delaunay-\v{C}ech, and chromatic alpha filtrations are related by simplicial collapses. Our result generalizes a result of Bauer and Edelsbrunner from the non-chromatic to the chromatic setting. We also show that the chromatic Delaunay-Rips filtration is locally stable to perturbations of the underlying point cloud. Our results provide theoretical justification for the use of chromatic Delaunay-\v{C}ech and chromatic Delaunay-Rips filtrations in applications, and we demonstrate their computational advantage with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>On the attaching map of the 3-cell skeleton of the homotopy fibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f\in\pi_{n+k}(S^{n})$, ($n\geq2$ and $k\geq0$) and let $F$ be the homotopy fibre of the pinch map $\s C_{f}=S^{n+1}\cup e^{n+k+2} \rightarrow S^{n+k+2}$, (in the case $k=0$, further suppose that $\s C_{f}\not\simeq*$). Assume that we wish to compute the $p$-primary component of $\pi_{*}(\Sigma C_{f})$ which is possibly far unstable, where $p$ is a prime different from 3. As a type of Gray's relative James constructions, it is known that the homotopy fibre $ F$ has a CW decomposition $F=(S^{n+1}\cup_{\af} e^{2n+k+2})\cup_{\beta} e^{3n+2k+3}\cup \cdots$, where $\af=[1_{S^{n+1}},\s f]\in\pi_{n+k+1}(S^{n})$ is the Whitehead product and $\beta$ is a higher Whitehead product. However, higher Whitehead products are intricate and difficult to manage in general. In this paper, by use of Selick-Wu's $\mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{min}}$-theory together with the machinery of Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequences, we show that in the 2-local case, the attaching map $\beta\in \pi_{3n+2k+2}(S^{n+1}\cup_{\af} e^{2n+k+2})$ is decomposed to be $\s^{2n+k+2}f$ composing with a certain inclusion map; in the $p$-local case, where $p\geq5$ and $n+k$ is odd, the attaching map $\beta$ admits a similar decomposition. By this, we are able to calculate the $p$-primary components of the possibly far unstable homotopy groups $\pi_{*}(\Sigma C_{f})$ via the homoptopy fibration $F\rightarrow \Sigma C_{f} \rightarrow S^{n+k+2}$ in the range requiring the 3-cell skeleton of $F$, if the involved homotopy groups of spheres are known; (if $p\geq5$ further assume that $n+k$ is odd). As an application, we determine the 2-primary component of the far unstable homotopy group $\pi_{18}(\Sigma ^{3}\mathbb{C}P^{2})$.</description>

      <title>Quasi-flag manifolds and moment graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new class of topological $G$-spaces generalizing the classical flag manifolds $G/T$ of compact connected Lie groups. These spaces, which we call the $m$-quasi-flag manifolds $ F_m = F_m(G,T) $, are topological realizations of the algebras $ Q_k(W) $ of $k$-quasi-invariant polynomials of the Weyl group $ W $ in the sense that their (even-dimensional) $G$-equivariant cohomology $ H_G(F_m, {\mathbb C}) $ is naturally isomorphic to $ Q_k(W) $, where $ m $ is a $W$-invariant integer-valued multiplicity function on the system of roots of $W$ and $ k = \frac{m}{2}$ or $ \frac{m+1}{2}$ depending on whether $m$ is even or odd. Many topological properties and algebraic structures related to the flag manifolds can be extended to quasi-flag manifolds. We compute the cohomology of quasi-flag manifolds by constructing their rational algebraic models in terms of coaffine stacks -- a certain kind of derived stacks introduced by B.To\"en and J. Lurie to provide an algebro-geometric framework for rational homotopy theory. Besides cohomology, we also compute the equivariant K-theory of quasi-flag manifolds and extend some of our cohomological results to the multiplicative setting. On the topological side, our approach is strongly influenced by the classical work on homotopy decompositions of classifying spaces of compact Lie groups; however, the diagrams that we use in our decompositions do not arise from collections of subgroups of $G$ but rather from moment graphs -- combinatorial objects introduced in a different area of topology called the GKM theory.</description>

      <title>Comparing dg category models for path spaces via $A_\infty$-functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a many-object dual version of Chen's iterated integral map. For any topological space X, the construction takes the form of an A-infinity functor between two dg categories whose objects are the points of X: the domain has as morphisms the singular (cubical) chains on the space of (Moore) paths in X and the codomain has morphisms arising by totalizing a cosimplicial chain complex determined by the dg coalgebra of singular (simplicial) chains in X. When X is simply connected, we show this construction defines a homotopy inverse to a classical map of Adams, which sends ordered sequences of singular simplices in X linked by shared vertices to cubes of paths in X. When X is not necessarily simply connected, following an idea of Irie, we incorporate the fundamental groupoid of X into the construction and deduce analogous results. Along the way, we provide an elementary and new proof of the fact that the (direct-sum) cobar construction of the chains in X, suitably interpreted, models the dg category of paths in X, an extension of Adams's cobar theorem established by Rivera-Zeinalian using different methods.</description>

      <title>Localising invariants in derived bornological geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study several categories of analytic stacks relative to the category of bornological modules over a Banach ring. When the underlying Banach ring is a non-Archimedean valued field, this category contains derived rigid analytic spaces as a full subcategory. When the underlying field is the complex numbers, it contains the category of derived complex analytic spaces. In the second part of the paper, we consider localising invariants of rigid categories associated to bornological algebras. The main results in this part include Nisnevich descent for derived analytic spaces and a version of the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch Theorem for derived dagger analytic spaces over an arbitrary Banach ring.</description>
