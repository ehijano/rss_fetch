      <title>Non-Standard Interactions of Supernova Neutrinos and Mass Ordering Ambiguity at DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) can notably modify the pattern of resonant flavor conversion of neutrinos within supernovae and significantly impact the neutronization burst signal in forthcoming experiments such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The presence of NSI can invert the energy levels of neutrino matter eigenstates and even induce a new resonance in the inner parts close to the proto-neutron star. We demonstrate how DUNE can use these new configurations of energy levels to have sensitivity to NSIs down to $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$. We also elucidate how the effect may result in a puzzling confusion of normal and inverted mass orderings by highlighting the emergence or vanishing of the neutronization peak, which distinguishes between the two mass orderings. Potential implications are analyzed thoroughly.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous CP Breaking in a QCD-like Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the phase structure of a QCD-like theory at $\bar\theta =\pi$ obtained from supersymmetric $SU(N)$ QCD perturbed by a small amount of supersymmetry breaking via anomaly mediation (AMSB QCD). The spectrum of this theory matches that of QCD at the massless level, though the superpartners are not decoupled. In this theory it is possible to nail down the phase structure at $\bar\theta=\pi$ as a function of the quark masses and the number of flavors $F$. For one flavor we find that there is a critical quark mass, below which CP is unbroken, while above the critical mass CP is spontaneously broken. At the critical mass there is a second-order phase transition along with a massless $\eta'$. We are able to analytically solve for the minima and the critical mass for $N=2,3$ as well as for the large $N$ limit, while for other $N$ one can find numerical results. For two flavors, we find that CP is always broken as long as the quark masses are equal and non-zero, however there is a non-trivial phase boundary for unequal quark masses, which we find numerically. For $F\geq 3$ we obtain an intricate phase boundary which reproduces the various quark mass limits. All our results are in agreement with the predictions for ordinary QCD that were based on anomaly matching arguments for generalized symmetries and the effective chiral Lagrangian. We also briefly comment on the domain wall solutions first discussed by Draper, and are able to present analytic results for the simplest case of $SU(2)$ with one flavor.</description>

      <title>Indirect Searches for Ultraheavy Dark Matter in the Time Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter may exist today in the form of ultraheavy composite bound states. Collisions between such dark matter states can release intense bursts of radiation that includes gamma-rays among the final products. Thus, indirect-detection signals of dark matter may include unconventional gamma-ray bursts. Such bursts may have been missed not necessarily because of their low arriving gamma-ray fluxes, but rather their briefness and rareness. We point out that intense bursts whose non-detection thus far are due to the latter can be detected in the near future with existing and planned facilities. In particular, we propose that, with slight experimental adjustments and suitable data analyses, imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and Pulsed All-sky Near-infrared and Optical Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (PANOSETI) are promising tools for detecting such rare, brief, but intense bursts. We also show that if we assume these bursts originate from collisions of dark matter states, IACTs and PANOSETI can probe a large dark matter parameter space beyond existing limits. Additionally, we present a concrete model of dark matter that produces bursts potentially detectable in these instruments.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the excesses in associated di-photon production at 152 GeV in 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistically significant excesses exist at around 152 GeV in associated di-photon production ($\gamma\gamma+X$) in the sidebands of SM Higgs analyses of ATLAS (using the full run-2 dataset). They are most pronounced in the single-$\tau$, missing-transverse-energy, four-jet and $\geqslant1\ell+\!\geqslant1b$-jet channels ($\approx3\sigma$) and can be explained by the Drell-Yan production of new Higgs bosons, i.e. $pp\to W^*\to H^\pm H^0$. We first examine the excesses in a simplified model approach, considering that $H^\pm$ decays to $\tau\nu$, $WZ$ or $tb$. Both the $\tau\nu$ and $tb$ decay modes individually lead to a significance of $\lessapprox4\sigma$ while for $WZ$ one can obtain at most $3.5\sigma$. This is because the decays of $WZ$ lead to multiple leptons contributing to the two-lepton channel which does not show an excess at 152 GeV. Next, we consider two-Higgs-doublet models where the charged Higgs does not decay to $WZ$ at tree-level, finding a significance of $\gtrapprox4\sigma$ for a branching ratio of the new neutral Higgs to photons of $\approx$2%. Even though this branching fraction is quite sizable, it can be obtained in composite models or via the Lagrangian term $\lambda_6 H_1^\dagger H_1 H_2^\dagger H_1+{\rm h.c.}$ breaking the commonly imposed $Z_2$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Distilling circularly polarized photon emission from magnetized chiral plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emission of circularly polarized photons from a magnetized quark-gluon plasma with nonzero quark-number and chiral charge chemical potentials. These chemical potentials qualitatively influence the differential emission rates of circularly polarized photons. A nonzero net electric charge density, induced by quark-number chemical potentials, enhances the overall emission of one circular polarization over the other, while a nonzero chiral charge density introduces a spatial asymmetry in the emission with respect to reflection in the transverse plane. The signs of the electrical and chiral charge densities determine which circular polarization dominates overall and whether the emission preferentially aligns with or opposes the magnetic field. Based on these findings, we propose that polarized photon emission is a promising observable for characterizing the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Angular distributions of Drell-Yan leptons in the TMD factorization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the angular structure functions for Drell-Yan leptons in $Z/\gamma$-boson production within the framework of the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization theorem, including kinematic power corrections (KPCs). We find good agreement with the data in the applicability region of the TMD factorization theorem. The inclusion of KPCs allows us to describe all angular coefficients in a frame-independent manner using only the leading-twist TMD distributions: the unpolarized and the Boer-Mulders functions. The value of the Boer-Mulders function is determined using the ATLAS measurement of the $A_2$ angular coefficient. The analysis is performed at N$^4$LL perturbative order. Additionally, we discuss the technical implementation and impact of KPCs on the phenomenology of TMD distributions.</description>

      <title>Net-Proton Number Cumulants in Strongly and Weakly Coupled QGP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a unified description of the QCD phase diagram across different energy regimes. Without any adjustable free parameters fitted to lattice or experimental data, we demonstrate that the net-proton number cumulant ratios from the Beam Energy Scan-I (BES-I) central ($0-5\%$) Au+Au collision experiments at RHIC, for center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s} \geq 39\,\text{GeV}$, are well described by the \textit{dynamical soft-wall} AdS black hole model, indicating the formation of a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP). We identify a critical point at \(\mu_B = 247\,\text{MeV}\) or \(\sqrt{s}=16\,\text{GeV}\) in this model, where net-proton cumulant ratios show non-monotonic variation. However, for $\sqrt{s} &lt; 39\,\text{GeV}$, the recent BES-II data does not exhibit the expected variation due to the critical point, suggesting instead a transition to a nearly-cold ($\mu_B \gg T$) weakly coupled QGP (wQGP) for $\sqrt{s} &lt; 7.7\,\text{GeV}$. This prediction can be tested by the upcoming STAR Fixed-Target experimental data.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic and two-photon transition form factors of the pseudoscalar mesons: An algebraic model computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute electromagnetic and two-photon transition form factors of ground-state pseudoscalar mesons: $\pi,\,K,\,\eta_c,\,\eta_b$. To this end, we employ an algebraic model based upon the coupled formalism of Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations. Within this approach, the dressed quark propagator and the relevant Bethe-Salpeter amplitude encode the internal structure of the corresponding meson. Electromagnetic properties of the meson are probed via the quark-photon interaction. The algebraic model employed by us unifies the treatment of all ground-state pseudoscalar mesons. Its parameters are carefully fitted performing a global analysis of existing experimental data including the knowledge of the charge radii of the mesons studied. We then compute and predict electromagnetic and two-photon transition form factors for a wide range of probing photon momentum-squared which is of direct relevance to the experimental observations carried out thus far or planned at different hadron physics facilities such as the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) and the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider. We also present comparisons with other theoretical models and approaches and lattice quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Vector meson's spin alignments in high energy reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global spin alignment of vector mesons has been observed by the STAR collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). It provides a unique opportunity to probe the correlation between the polarized quark and antiquark in the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions, opening a new window to explore the properties of sQGP. In addition, spin alignments of vector mesons have also been observed in other high-energy particle collisions. The results seem to be strongly dependent on the hadronization mechanism, so comprehensive studies are needed.In this article, we present a brief review of theoretical and experimental advances in the study of vector meson's spin alignments in a variety of high-energy particle collisions, with emphasis on hadronization mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Secrets of Vortex Neutron Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigation of decay and scattering processes of particles in a vortex state offers a novel and promising approach for probing particle structure. Our study reveals distinct properties of vortex neutron decay, which deviate from those of classical plane-wave neutron decay. We present the energy-angle distributions of the final-state electron and antineutrino in unpolarized vortex neutrons, as well as angle distributions integrated over their energies. Notably, we provide theoretical calculations of the decay behavior of neutrons with varying vortex cone angles and initial energies. We propose that identifying the vortex state of the initial neutron can be achieved by analyzing the angular and energy distributions of the final-state particles, introducing new degrees of freedom for studying weak interactions and neutron decay kinematics that have been previously overlooked in particle physics. This timely investigation takes advantage of recent advancements in vortex neutron preparation and analysis, opening up new avenues for exploring the fundamental properties of matter.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor of four-fermion operator and fermion portal dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ultraviolet completion of semileptonic four-fermion operator $O_{ledq}^{\alpha \beta 11}$ that incorporates Majorana dark matter (DM) in both lepton-flavor-conserving (LFC) and lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) scenarios at the one-loop level via box diagram, which effectively alleviates the lower bounds on the new physics scale. The interplay between the model-independent constraints on the Wilson coefficients and DM direct detection, relic density, and collider searches in the context of fermion portal DM model with two mediators is investigated. We find that both the projected future constraint on the LFC Wilson coefficient $C_{ledq}^{2211}/\Lambda^2&lt; (12.3~\text{TeV})^{-2}$ from the measurements of neutrino non-standard interaction in the next-generation neutrino oscillation experiments, and LFV constraint $C_{ledq}^{1211}/\Lambda^2&lt; \left(2.2\times 10^3 ~\text{TeV} \right)^{-2}$ from ongoing charged-lepton-flavor-violation searches, provide a complementary exploration of the parameter space encompassing the DM mass and scalar mass. With the colored mediator mass typically around $2~\text{TeV}$, the sensitivity of the indirect constraints on the four-fermion operator could surpass those of collider searches and DM direct detection, in scenarios where the masses of the DM and scalar are close. By ensuring the correct DM relic density, however, we obtain that the collider searches and DM direct detection are more sensitive to the electroweak scale DM and scalar compared to the indirect constraints.</description>

      <title>Modular Family Symmetry in F-Theory GUTs from the Bottom-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite modular family symmetry can emerge from top-down approaches based on heterotic string theory or Type IIB string theory. We show that, in addition to such approaches, it can also emerge from local F-Theory bottom-up constructions. As a first example of the new approach, we have analysed in detail a concrete F-Theory Fluxed $SU(5)$ Grand Unified Theory (GUT) with modular $S_4$ family symmetry. The model fits the fermion mass and mixing data very well and serves as a demonstration of the bottom-up approach to modular family symmetry in F-Theory fluxed GUTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of neutrinos produced in LHC collisions by the far-forward FASER and SND@LHC experiments in 2023 herald the new era of collider neutrino physics. These high-intensity forward neutrino fluxes from proton-proton LHC collisions enable novel opportunities in QCD, neutrino physics, BSM searches, and astroparticle physics. In this contribution, we briefly review the physics potential of neutrino deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) measurements at the LHC to shed light on proton and nuclear structure, both for ongoing far-forward experiments and for the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF) to operate concurrently with the HL-LHC. We consider the reach of LHC neutrino DIS to scrutinise the mechanisms of forward hadron production and constrain QCD in the ultra-small-$x$ region. We also discuss how neutrino DIS measurements at these far-forward detectors enhance direct and indirect BSM searches at the HL-LHC.</description>

      <title>Multipartite dark matter in a gauge theory of leptons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical conservation of the lepton number is an accidental symmetry present in the Standard Model (SM). Thus, we consider here a scenario where the SM is extended with a U(1) gauge group, promoting the lepton number to a local symmetry. The gauge anomaly cancellations necessitate the extension of the particle spectrum with several beyond the SM (BSM) particle fields. The extended lepton gauge group breaks around the TeV scale via spontaneous symmetry breaking, and a $Z_2$ symmetry remains, which ensures the stability of the light $Z_2$ odd BSM particles. Interestingly, the particle spectrum of the model has two distinct dark sectors, with one having a Dirac-type DM and the other one containing a Majorana-type DM, thus resulting in a multipartite dark matter scenario. We have explored the available parameter space consistent with the observed dark matter relic density and direct detection measurements for both of the DM particles. Having a Majorana dark matter, we have also studied for the gamma line signatures to constrain the parameter space from the indirect dark matter detection experiments like FermiLAT and CTA.</description>

      <title>Charged current weak production of $\Delta(1232)$ induced by electrons and positrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charged current weak production of $\Delta (1232)$ from the free proton target induced by the electron/positron in the intermediate energy range corresponding to the beam energy available at JLab and Mainz, has been studied. The results for the differential scattering cross section $\frac{d\sigma}{dQ^2}$, the angular distribution $\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega_{\Delta}}$, and the total scattering cross section $\sigma(E_e)$ for both the electron and positron induced processes are presented, for the various energies in the range of 0.5--4~GeV. The cross section $\sigma(E_e)$ is found to be of the order of $10^{-39}$~cm$^{2}$ for the electron/positron energies in the few GeV range. The availability of electron/positron beams having well defined energy and direction with very high luminosity of the order of $10^{38}-10^{39}$~cm$^{-2}$~sec$^{-1}$, makes it possible to observe the weak charged current production of $\Delta(1232)$ and determine the axial vector form factors $C_{i}^{A} (Q^2);~(i=3-5)$. The sensitivity of the differential cross section $\frac{d\sigma}{dQ^2}$ to the subdominant form factors $C_{3}^{A}(Q^2)$ and $C_{4}^{A} (Q^2)$ is found to be strong enough, especially in the low $Q^2$ region, which can be used to determine them phenomenologically and to test the various theoretical models proposed to calculate them.</description>

      <title>Searching Accretion-Enhanced Dark Matter Annihilation Signals in the Galactic Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study reanalyzes the detection prospects of dark matter (DM) annihilation signals in the Galactic Center, focusing on velocity-dependent dynamics within a spike density near the supermassive black hole (Sgr~A$^{\star}$). We investigate three annihilation processes -- $p$-wave, resonance, and forbidden annihilation -- under semi-relativistic velocities, leveraging gamma-ray data from Fermi and DAMPE telescopes. Our analysis integrates a fermionic DM model with an electroweak axion-like particle (ALP) portal, exploring annihilation into two or four photons. Employing a comprehensive six-dimensional integration, we precisely calculate DM-induced gamma-ray fluxes near Sgr~A$^{\star}$, incorporating velocity and positional dependencies in the annihilation cross-section and photon yield spectra. Our findings highlight scenarios of resonance and forbidden annihilation, where the larger ALP-DM-DM coupling constant $C_{a\chi\chi}$ can affect spike density, potentially yielding detectable gamma-ray line spectra within Fermi and DAMPE energy resolution. We set upper limits for $C_{a\chi\chi}$ across these scenarios, offering insights into the detectability and spectral characteristics of DM annihilation signals from the Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Parametric Integrals in the Minkowski Regime without Contour Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present selected examples demonstrating an alternative approach to contour deformation for numerically computing loop integrals in the Minkowski regime. This method focuses on identifying singular hypersurfaces (varieties of the $\mathscr{F}$ polynomial) and mapping them to known points which can then be resolved by employing blow-ups/sector decomposition techniques, thereby avoiding the need for contour deformation. Using this technique, we achieve improved convergence properties without the need for contour deformation, which is known to significantly increase the complexity of the integrand by introducing, for example, derivatives of the $\mathscr{F}$ polynomial and complicated Jacobians. We highlight that while we have only tested the approach on selected one-, two- and three-loop massless and one-loop massive examples, it shows promise for practical applications, offering potential benefits over the traditional approach. Evaluation times are compared with existing contour deformation implementations to illustrate the performance of this alternative method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the decay of a thermally excited metastable vacuum in classical field theory using real-time numerical simulations. We find a lower decay rate than predicted by standard thermal theory. The discrepancy is due to the violation of thermal equilibrium during the critical bubble nucleation. It is reduced by introducing dissipation and noise. We propose a criterion for the system to remain in equilibrium during the nucleation process and show that it is violated in the Hamiltonian evolution of a single field. In the case of many fields, the fulfillment of the criterion is model-dependent.</description>

      <title>Higher-Dimensional MOG dark compact object: shadow behavior in the light of EHT observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consideration of extra spatial dimensions is motivated by the unification of gravity with other interactions, the achievement of the ultimate framework of quantum gravity, and fundamental problems in particle physics and cosmology. Much attention has been focused on the effect of these extra dimensions on the modified theories of gravity. Analytically examining astrophysical phenomena like black hole shadows is one approach to understand how extra dimensions would affect the modified gravitational theories. The purpose of this study is to derive a higher dimensional metric for a dark compact object in STVG theory and then examine the behavior of the shadow shapes for this solution in STVG theory in higher dimensions. We apply the Carter method to formulate the geodesic equations and the Hamilton Jacobi method to find photon orbits around this higher dimensional MOG dark compact object. We investigate the effects of extra dimensions and the STVG parameter alpha on the black hole shadow size. Next, we compare the shadow radius of this higher dimensional MOG dark compact object to the shadow size of the supermassive black hole M87, which has been realized by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaborations, in order to restrict these parameters. We find that extra dimensions in the STVG theory typically lead to a reduction in the shadow size of the higher dimensional MOG dark compact object, whereas the effect of parameter alpha on this black hole shadow is suppressible. Remarkably, given the constraints from EHT observations, we find that the shadow size of the four dimensional MOG dark compact object lies in the confidence levels of the EHT data. Finally, we investigate the issue of acceleration bounds in higher dimensional MOG dark compact object in confrontation with EHT data of M87.</description>

      <title>Electron scattering cross sections for 6,7Li and 7Be nuclei within the unified electroweak theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06407v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study employs the multipole expansion within the unified electroweak theory to investigate the electron scattering cross sections for 6,7Li and 7Be nuclei. The multipole form factors presented in the expressions of the cross sections are directly calculated based on the many-particle shell model and fractional parentage coefficients without using any approximations. The results obtained indicate that the conventional impulse approximation can be applied to the electron-nucleus scattering only when the energy of incident electrons does not exceed twice the nucleon mass. In addition, the quasi-elastic scattering cross section of 7Li in the excitation from its ground state to the nearest excited state and that of elastic scattering in the ground state are independently treated, whereas they have not been separately measured in experiments. The calculated scattering cross sections using the V-A structure agree reasonably well with the available experimental data at low (MeV) energies and provide predictive information at high (GeV) energies. The scattering cross sections are found to rapidly decrease in all cases with increasing the incident electron energy and scattering angle. In particular, at the energies of hundreds of GeV and higher, there are only the forward scattering processes. Furthermore, by comparing the elastic cross sections of three investigated nuclei at a certain energy and scattering angle, the rule that the nuclear size is proportional to the number of nucleons is clearly shown.</description>

      <title>Origin of effective graviton mass from spontaneous symmetry breaking of scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativity and quantum field theory govern all fundamental physical processes, from nuclear and subatomic scales to the solar system, galactic, and cosmology. Both theories work remarkably well in their tested domains. However, there is minimal overlap between the two domains. Our work demonstrates that the non-overlapping of domains \emph{no longer} holds when non-perturbative effects are considered. We introduce a novel mechanism in which the gravitons acquire \emph{effective mass} due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of global or local symmetry of complex scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. In the flat space-time limit, we demonstrate that the resulting action for the graviton is identical to the extended Fierz-Pauli (FP) action, corresponding to the mass deformation parameter $\alpha = 1/2$. The extended FP action has 6 Degrees of freedom and no ghost. For local $U(1)$ SSB, we establish that the effective graviton mass is related to the mass of the gauge boson and the electric charge of the complex scalar field. Interestingly, our results indicate that the millicharged dark matter scalar fields, generating dark photons, can produce graviton mass of the same order as the Hubble constant $(H_0)$. Hence, we argue that the dark sector offers a natural explanation for the acceleration of the current Universe.</description>

      <title>Investigation of sources affecting longitudinal particle distribution in heavy-ion collisions using spectators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the sources controlling the longitudinal distribution of produced particles in heavy-ion collisions is crucial to characterize the shape of the Quark-Gluon Plasma. This study proposes a novel correlator between the forward-backward asymmetry of spectator numbers and final-state multiplicities to quantify the contribution from preferential emission to the longitudinal distribution of produced particles. Using the AMPT model, we demonstrate that the correlator peaks at large $\eta$, indicating an increased contribution of preferential emission to particle production towards forward pseudorapidities. Thus, this correlator provides a direct constraint on the initial state sources governing rapidity-odd directed flow and flow decorrelation. The correlator exhibits sensitivity to string fragmentation parameters and spectator matter dynamics such as fragmentation and evaporation. Our findings motivate an experimental measurement of this correlator to constrain initial-state sources determining the longitudinal evolution of the Quark-Gluon Plasma, including complex dynamics of spectators in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced $\psi^{\prime}$ yield and $\psi^{\prime}/(J/\psi)$ yield ratio as a possible signature of QGP formation in high multiplicity $p+p$ collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppression in the yield of quarkonia (heavy quark-antiquark bound states) has been considered one of the important signatures of the formation of the thermalized deconfined partonic matter, also known as the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collision Experiments (RHICE). Traditionally, the in-medium dissociation of quarkonium states has been presented by implicitly assuming an adiabatic approximation, which considers that the heavy quark Hamiltonian changes slowly over time owing to change in the medium. However, in high multiplicity smaller systems, such as in $p+p$ collisions, the early development of transverse flow resulting from the finite transverse size of the locally thermalized medium may cause the quarkonium states to undergo a non-adiabatic evolution. It has been argued that in the presence of such a non-adiabatic evolution, the suppression of heavy quark-antiquark bound state yields may not reliably indicate QGP formation~\cite{Bagchi:2023vfv}. We propose that, rather than concentrating on the suppression of $J/\psi$ yields, the enhancement in the yield ratio of $\psi^{\prime}$ to $J/\psi$ (i.e., $\psi^{\prime} / (J/\psi)$), along with an increase in $\psi^{\prime}$ yield, should be considered as a probe of QGP formation for small systems. Our findings, based on realistic modeling of the time evolution of small systems, suggest that the yield ratio $\psi^{\prime} / (J/\psi)$ and the yield of $\psi^{\prime}$ increase as a function of hydrodynamization temperature incorporating the non-adiabatic transitions in high multiplicity $p+p$ collisions.</description>

Abstract: The decay of Higgs boson into two spin-1/2 particles provides an ideal system to reveal quantum entanglement and Bell-nonlocality. Future $e^+e^-$ colliders can improve the measurement accuracy of the spin correlation of tau lepton pairs from Higgs boson decay. We show the testability of Bell inequality through $h\to \tau\tau$ at Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC). Two realistic methods of testing Bell inequality are investigated, i.e., T\"{o}rnqvist's method and Clauser-Home-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. In the simulation, we take into account the detector effects of CEPC including uncertainties for tracks and jets from $Z$ boson in the production of $e^+e^-\to Zh$. Necessary reconstruction approaches are described to measure quantum entanglement between $\tau^+$ and $\tau^-$. Finally, we show the sensitivity of CEPC to the Bell inequality violation for the two methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of the Polyakov quark-meson model with two flavors, the bubble dynamics of a first-order phase transition in the region of high density and low temperature are investigated by using the homogeneous thermal nucleation theory. In mean-field approximation, after obtaining the effective potential with inclusion of the fermionic vacuum term, we build a geometric method to search two existing minima, which can be actually connected by a bounce interpolated between a local minimum to an adjacent global one. For both weak and strong first-order hadron quark phase transitions, as fixing the chemical potentials at $\mu=306 \mathrm{MeV}$ and $\mu=310 \mathrm{MeV}$, the bubble profiles, the surface tension, the typical radius of the bounce and the saddle point action as a function of temperature are numerically calculated in the presence of a nucleation bubble. It is found that the surface tension remains a very small value even when the density is high. It is also noticed that the deconfinement phase transition does not change chiral phase transition dramatically for light quarks and phase boundaries for hadron and quark matter should be resized properly according to the saddle-point action evaluated on the bounce solution.</description>

      <title>A Duet of Freeze-in and Freeze-out: Lepton-Flavored Dark Matter and Muon Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a Lepton-Flavored Dark Matter model and its signatures at a future Muon Collider. We focus on the less-explored regime of feeble dark matter interactions, which suppresses the dangerous lepton-flavor violating processes, gives rise to dark matter freeze-in production, and leads to long-lived particle signatures at colliders. We find that the interplay of dark matter freeze-in and its mediator freeze-out gives rise to an upper bound of around TeV scales on the dark matter mass. The signatures of this model depend on the lifetime of the mediator, and can range from generic prompt decays to more exotic long-lived particle signals. In the prompt region, we calculate the signal yield, study useful kinematics cuts, and report tolerable systematics that would allow for a $5\sigma$ discovery. In the long-lived region, we calculate the number of charged tracks and displaced lepton signals of our model in different parts of the detector, and uncover kinematic features that can be used for background rejection. We show that, unlike in hadron colliders, multiple production channels contribute significantly which leads to sharply distinct kinematics for electroweakly-charged long-lived particle signals. Ultimately, the collider signatures of this lepton-flavored dark matter model are common amongst models of electroweak-charged new physics, rendering this model a useful and broadly applicable benchmark model for future Muon Collider studies that can help inform work on detector design and studies of systematics.</description>

Abstract: An important problem in the particle physics is interaction of the Higgs boson with the fermions. It is in the processes, which involve $h f f $ interaction, the manifestations of $CP$ violation are possible. This in turn can be helpful in solving the problem of the dominance of matter over antimatter in the Universe. In this connection, in the present paper, the effect of longitudinal polarization of leptons and quarks produced in the decay of the Higgs boson is investigated and calculated. We consider the case in which the Higgs boson interacts with fermions via a mixture of scalar and pseudoscalar couplings. Under this assumption, the longitudinal polarization can acquire non-zero values due to imaginary part of loop corrections to tree-level amplitudes. This polarization is a direct signature of the $CP$ violation in the Higgs sector. Effects of the longitudinal polarization of $\tau$ leptons on the energy distribution of the pions in the two-step Higgs-boson decay $h \to \tau^- \tau^+ \to \pi^- \nu_\tau \pi^+ \bar{\nu}_\tau$ are also studied, and the energy asymmetry with corresponding moments are calculated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of charm quark on the chiral phase transition of light quarks at finite temperature based on the four-flavor soft-wall holographic QCD model. In the massless limit, we find that the thermal chiral phase transition is of the second order in the four-quark flavor system. In the case with the massive charm quark and the massless light and strange quarks, the order of the phase transition changes to the first order. This is due to the quark flavor symmetry breaking which is associated with the violation of the $U(1)$ axial symmetry. Once the light and strange quarks get massive, the explicit chiral symmetry breaking becomes eminent, then the crossover phase transition is realized at the physical quark masses. We also map the order of the phase transition on a phase diagram in the quark mass plane where the light- and strange-quark masses are degenerate but differ from the value of the charm quark mass. This phase diagram is an extension of the conventional Columbia plot to the four-quark flavor system. The critical exponents related to the chiral phase transition are also addressed.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics of bubbles nucleated during a first-order phase transition is controlled by the non-equilibrium fluctuations generated by the traveling domain wall. An accurate modelling of the out-of-equilibrium properties of the plasma is necessary for the characterization of the phase transition relics, such as the signal of gravitational waves. In this thesis we provide a solution to the Boltzmann equation that describes the plasma fluctuations without imposing any ansatz on the perturbation by devising a new spectral method that leverages on the rotational invariance of the collision operator. This allows for a robust and fast computation of the terminal velocity of the wall. We then compare our results with the previous approaches in the literature finding important quantitative and qualitative differences. We also employ our method to determine the terminal velocity of the wall for two benchmark configurations in the singlet extended Standard Model. We finally assess the impact of different approximations and we find that the most important source of uncertainty is given by the infrared modes of the electroweak gauge bosons.</description>

Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) aims to inject oxygen (${}^{16}O$) ions in the next run into its experiments. This include the anticipated one-day physics run focusing on $OO$ collisions at center-of-mass energy \sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}} = 7 Tev. In this study, we have used recently developed version of the EPOS (EPOS4) to study the production of identified particles ($\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$ and $p(\overline{p})$) in $OO$ collisions at 7 Tev. Predictions of transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra, $\langle p_T \rangle$, integrated yield (dN/dy) for different centrality classes are studied. To provide insight into the collective nature of the produced particles, we look into the $p_T$-differential particle ratios ($K/\pi$ and $p/\pi$) and $p_T$-integrated particle ratios to ($\pi^++\pi^-$) as a function of charge particle multiplicity. The shape of the charge particle multiplicity ($dN/d\eta$) and $\langle p_T \rangle$ is well described by the EPOS4. The EPOS4 predictions for the ratios of $K/\pi$ and $p/\pi$ exhibit a systematic overestimation compared to the observed trends as a function of charged-particle multiplicity. Interestingly, the $OO$ results of $p_T$-integrated particle ratios shows a clear final state multiplicity overlap with $pp$, $p-Pb$ and $Pb-Pb$ collisions. EPOS4 mimics signs of collectivity and is one of the suitable candidates to study ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Furthermore, the foreseen data from $OO$ collisions at the LHC, when available, will help to better understand the heavy-ion-like behavior in small systems as well as help to put possible constraints on the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Dark matter from mediator decay in early matter domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study dark matter production from mediator decays in scenarios with an epoch of early matter domination. Particles that mediate interactions between dark matter and the standard model particles are kinematically accessible to the thermal bath as long as their mass is below the reheating temperature of the Universe after inflation. Decay of on-shell mediators can then lead to copious production of dark matter during early matter domination or a preceding radiation-dominated phase. In particular, for mediators that are charged under the standard model, it can exceed the standard freeze-in channel due to inverse annihilations at much lower temperatures (often by many orders of magnitude). The requirement to obtain the correct relic abundance severely constrains the parameter space for dark matter masses above a few TeV.</description>

      <title>The Type-I Seesaw family</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of the Type-I Seesaw family of neutrino mass models, including the conventional type-I seesaw and its low-scale variants, namely the linear and inverse seesaws. We establish that all these models essentially correspond to a particular form of the type-I seesaw in the context of explicit lepton number violation. We then focus into the more interesting scenario of spontaneous lepton number violation, systematically categorizing all inequivalent minimal models. Furthermore, we identify and flesh out specific models that feature a rich majoron phenomenology and discuss some scenarios which, despite having heavy mediators and being invisible in processes such as $\mu \to e \gamma$, predict sizable rates for decays including the majoron in the final state.</description>

      <title>Numerical implementation of evolution equations for twist-3 collinear PDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twist-3 collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs) are matrix elements of quark-gluon-quark or three-gluons light-cone operators. They depend on three momentum fraction variables, which are restricted to a hexagon region, and the evolution kernels are defined via two-dimensional convolution in these variables. We present the numerical realisation of the twist-3 evolution equations at leading order in the strong coupling for all kinds of twist-3 PDF (quark, gluon, chiral-even/odd, etc). We provide two independent codes (in C and Fortran) that have been extensively cross-checked, and are ready-to-use. We supplement the paper with a review of known properties of twist-3 PDFs.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity dependence of the $p_T$-spectra for charged particles and its relationship with partonic entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the multiplicity dependence of the transverse momentum $p_T$ spectra of hadrons produced in high-energy collisions. We propose that the partonic distribution be parameterized by its non-extensive entropy and the parton saturation scale $Q_s(x)$. These two variables can be identified from the produced charged hadron distributions and provide important information on the gluon dynamics at the moment of interaction. From this perspective we interpret data from different ALICE multiplicity classes at $\sqrt{s}= 13$ TeV and $\sqrt{s}= 5.02$ TeV. A multiplicity dependent scaling function is presented and the dependence of the interaction area on multiplicity is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Exclusive $J/\Psi$ and $\rho^0$ vector meson production using BK evolution theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exclusive diffractive processes, such as exclusive vector meson production, serve as excellent probes of hadron structure within the perturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The exclusive process involving light and heavy vector mesons, $e p \rightarrow e V(V=J/\Psi,\rho,\phi)$, has been investigated at the HERA accelerator facility. In this study, we focus on the theoretical prediction of exclusive $J/\Psi$ and $\rho^0$ vector meson production. Employing the color dipole description of deep inelastic scattering (DIS), we calculate both the differential cross-section and total cross-section of $J/\Psi$ and $\rho^0$ vector mesons, employing an analytical solution of the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation. Furthermore, we present the ratio of the longitudinal to the transverse cross-section for $J/\Psi$ and $\rho^0$ as a function of $Q^2$. Two well-known vector meson wave function models, Boosted Gaussian (BG) and Gaus-LC, have been integrated into our analysis, showing slight sensitivity to the chosen vector meson wave functions. Our theoretical predictions agree well with the available experimental data for vector meson production. The analytical solution of the BK equation proves reliable for the theoretical prediction of exclusive vector mesons within a specific range of $Q^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a first order phase transition (FOPT) for a Vector Dark Matter (VDM) in the early universe in which its mass may partially arise from such mechanism in the hidden sector. We calculate the ratio of VDM that may enter the bubble for various bubble wall velocities as well as various nucleation temperatures that produce the measured dark matter relic abundance via bubble filtering. In the following, we focus on gravitational wave (GW) signals which produced by FOPT and show that it can be detectable at the DECIGO, TianQin, LISA and Ultimate-DECIGO (UDECIGO) experiments.</description>

      <title>Use of the Meta-analysis and Kolmogorov Criteria in the Finding of Singularities of a Nuclear Matter Created in Ultra Relativistic Nuclear Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:1512.07829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Published theoretical data from several models: PHSD and HSD both with and without chiral symmetry restoration (CSR), applied to experimental data on nuclear collisions from BEVALAC and SIS to LHC energies were analyzed using meta-analysis and Kolmogorov criteria. This made it possible to localize possible features of nuclear matter created in central nucleus-nucleus collisions. Ignition of a drop of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) begins already at an energy of about $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2 GeV. We estimate that this QGP droplet occupies a small fraction, 15 $\%$ (average radius of about 5.3 fermi if the fireball radius is 10 fermi) of the total volume of the fireball created at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.7 GeV. A drop of exotic matter undergoes a split phase transition: separated boundaries of sharp (1st order) crossover and CSR in chiral limit, between QGP and Quarkyonic matter at an energy about $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.5 GeV. The critical endpoint of 2nd order probably cannot be reached in nuclear collisions. The triple phase area occupies interval from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 12 GeV to 15 GeV, the critical endpoint of 1st order at around $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 20 GeV. The boundary of smooth (2nd order) crossover transition with CSR in chiral limit between Quarkyonic matter and QGP was localized between $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 9.3 GeV and 12 GeV, and between Hadronic and QGP in the interval from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 15 GeV to 20 GeV, the boundary of sharp (1st order) crossover transition with CSR in chiral limit between Hadronic matter and QGP was localized after $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 20 GeV. The phase trajectory of the hadronic corona, enveloping the exotic droplet, always remains in the hadronic phase.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-Equivariant Geometric Algebra Transformers for High-Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting scientific understanding from particle-physics experiments requires solving diverse learning problems with high precision and good data efficiency. We propose the Lorentz Geometric Algebra Transformer (L-GATr), a new multi-purpose architecture for high-energy physics. L-GATr represents high-energy data in a geometric algebra over four-dimensional space-time and is equivariant under Lorentz transformations, the symmetry group of relativistic kinematics. At the same time, the architecture is a Transformer, which makes it versatile and scalable to large systems. L-GATr is first demonstrated on regression and classification tasks from particle physics. We then construct the first Lorentz-equivariant generative model: a continuous normalizing flow based on an L-GATr network, trained with Riemannian flow matching. Across our experiments, L-GATr is on par with or outperforms strong domain-specific baselines.</description>

      <title>Consistent Theories for the DESI dark energy fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for physically consistent realizations of evolving dark energy suggested by the cosmological fit of DESI, Planck and Supernovae data. First we note that any lagrangian description of the standard Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm eff}$, allows for the addition of a cosmological constant. We perform the cosmological fit finding new regions of parameter space that however continue to favour dark energy with $w_{\rm eff}&lt;-1$ at early times, that is challenging to realize in consistent theories. Next, in the spirit of effective field theories, we consider the effect of higher order terms in the Taylor expansion of the equation of state of dark energy around the present epoch. We find that non-linear corrections of the equation of state are weakly constrained, thus opening the way to scenarios that differ from CPL at early times, possibly with $w_{\rm eff}&gt;-1$ at all times. We present indeed scenarios where evolving dark energy can be realized through quintessence models. We introduce in particular the ramp model where dark energy coincides with CPL at late times and approximates to a cosmological constant at early times. The latter model provides a much better fit than $\Lambda$CDM, and only slightly worse than $w_0w_a$CDM, but with the notable advantage of being described by a simple and theoretically consistent lagrangian of a canonical quintessence model.</description>
