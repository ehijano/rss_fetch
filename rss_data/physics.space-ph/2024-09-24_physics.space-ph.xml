      <title>Observation of Chaotic fluctuations in Turbulent Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence is a prevalent phenomenon in space and astrophysical plasmas, often characterized by stochastic fluctuations. While laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have revealed chaotic behavior, in-situ observations of turbulent plasmas in natural environments have predominantly shown highly stochastic signatures. Here, we present unprecedented in-situ evidence of chaotic fluctuations in the turbulent solar wind plasma downstream of the Earth's bow shock. By analyzing the relative location of magnetic-field fluctuations on the permutation entropy-complexity plane (C-H plane), we demonstrate that turbulence in the magnetosheath plasma exhibits characteristics of chaotic fluctuations rather than stochastic behavior, diverging from the expected traits of well-developed turbulence. This finding challenges established notions of plasma turbulence and reveals the need for caution when using the magnetosheath as a laboratory for studying plasma turbulence.</description>

      <title>Hall MHD waves: A fundamental departure from their MHD counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is demonstrated through a succinct derivation as to how the linear waves in Hall magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD) constitute a fundamental departure from the standard MHD waves. Apart from modifying the conventional MHD spectrum, the Hall current induces a distinct and new branch consisting of purely circularly polarized waves that may become the representative shear waves.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation of X-point collapse in an extended magnetohydrodynamics framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of X-point collapse in magnetic reconnection has witnessed extensive study in the context of space and laboratory plasmas. In this paper, a recently derived mathematical formulation of X-point collapse applicable in the regime of extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) is shown to possess a noncanonical Hamiltonian structure composed of five dynamical variables inherited from its parent model. The Hamiltonian and the noncanonical Poisson bracket are both derived, and the latter is shown to obey the requisite properties of antisymmetry and the Jacobi identity (an explicit proof of the latter is provided). In addition, the governing equations for the Casimir invariants are presented, and one such solution is furnished. The above features can be harnessed and expanded in future work, such as developing symplectic integrators for this dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Constructing Linear Operators Using Classical Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a methodology for generating linear operators that approximately represent nonlinear systems of perturbed ordinary differential equations. This is done through the application of classical perturbation theory via the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e expansion, followed by an extension of the space of configuration that guarantees the linear representation of the expanded system of differential equations. To ensure that such a linear representation exists, this paper uses polynomial basis functions. Pseudo-code describing the implementation of the proposed method is listed. The method is applied to the Duffing oscillator as well as to the J2 problem, with and without atmospheric drag, both analyzed using an osculating formulation. Additionally, conditions on the osculating Keplerian elements that produce low-eccentricity frozen orbits are presented, and a modification of the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method is proposed to enable the generation of linear operators that dynamically adapt to changes in the frequency of the motion. Finally, the proposed method is compared with alternatives in the literature.</description>

      <title>Limb Observations of Global Solar Coronal EUV Wavefronts: the Inclination, Kinematics, Coupling with the Expanding CMEs, and Connection with the CME-driven Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We select and investigate six global solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave events using data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). These eruptions are all on the limb but recorded as halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs) because the CME-driven shocks have expanded laterally to the opposite side. With the limb observations avoiding the projection effect, we have measured the inclination and speed of the EUV wavefront from 1.05 to 1.25 $R_\odot$. We also investigate the coupling and connection of the EUV wavefront with the CME boundary and the CME-driven shock, respectively. The major findings in the six events are: (1) the forward inclination of the primary and coronal-hole transmitted EUV wavefronts is estimated, respectively, and the origins of these inclinations and their effects on the estimate of actual wavefront speed are investigated; (2) the wavefront speed can be elevated by loop systems near the coronal base, and the average speed in the low corona has no clear correlation with the lateral expansion of the CME-driven shock in the high corona; (3) the fast magnetosonic Mach number of the wavefront is larger than unity from the coronal base; (4) the EUV wavefront is coupled with the CME driver throughout the propagation in two events; (5) after the EUV wavefront vanishes, the CME-driven shock continues traveling on the opposite side and disconnects from the EUV wavefront in four events. These results and their implications are discussed, which provide insight into the properties of global EUV waves.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Solar Cycle Influence on Long-Term Orbital Deterioration of Space Debris in LEO and MEO orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid increase in the number of space debris represents a substantial threat to the sustained viability of space operations. Monitoring these debris is critical for space situational awareness. Therefore, it has become of immense importance to understand the impact of solar activity on the space debris orbit. This first kind of study examines the effect of solar cycles, specifically Solar Cycles 22, 23, and 24, on the orbital decay of space debris. Utilizing TLE data for 95 objects in LEO and MEO dating back to the 1960s, we examined the orbital decay rates of these objects across the three solar cycles. Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between orbital decay and various indices serving as proxies for solar and geomagnetic activity. Notably, Solar Cycle 22 exhibited the highest decay rates, while Solar Cycle 24 showed the lowest. These findings emphasize the critical link between solar activity and its lasting impact on space debris in the current space age. The findings will play a crucial role in accurately monitoring, modeling, and forecasting space debris orbits for variations over solar cycle time scales.</description>
