      <title>Love beyond Einstein: Metric reconstruction and Love number in quadratic gravity using WEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study tidal Love numbers of static black holes in four-dimensional quadratic theory of gravity, extending the result of GR. We use worldline effective field theory (WEFT) methods to compute metric perturbations from one-point functions, treating the higher-derivative terms perturbatively. We show that insertions of scalar fields on the worldline induce non-zero tidal tails, and the corresponding Love number displays no RG running. The same conclusion holds for the insertions of tensor fields. Furthermore, for scalar dipole perturbations, we derive a Yukawa-deformed Frobenius solution and match the asymptotic behavior to fix the UV charge, finding agreement with EFT predictions of Wilson coefficients. Our work demonstrates that quadratic higher-curvature corrections induce non-zero but scale-independent tidal responses, offering a robust EFT framework to test deviations from GR in gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Towards Motivic Coactions at Genus One from Zeta Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motivic coaction of multiple zeta values and multiple polylogarithms encodes both structural insights on and computational methods for scattering amplitudes in a variety of quantum field theories and in string theory. In this work, we propose coaction formulae for iterated integrals over holomorphic Eisenstein series that arise from configuration-space integrals at genus one. Our proposal is motivated by formal similarities between the motivic coaction and the single-valued map of multiple polylogarithms at genus zero that are exposed in their recent reformulations via zeta generators. The genus-one coaction of this work is then proposed by analogies with the construction of single-valued iterated Eisenstein integrals via zeta generators at genus one. We show that our proposal exhibits the expected properties of a coaction and deduce $f$-alphabet decompositions of the multiple modular values obtained from regularized limits.</description>

      <title>Quantising Chiral Bosons On Riemann Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sen's action in two dimensions governs a chiral boson coupled to a two-dimensional metric together with a second chiral boson that couples to a flat two-dimensional metric. This second scalar decouples from the physical degrees of freedom. The generalisation of this action to one in which the second chiral scalar couples to an arbitrary second metric is used to formulate the theory on an arbitrary two-dimensional manifold. We use this action with both metrics Riemannian (or complex) to formulate the path integral on any Riemann surface. We calculate the partition function in this way and check the result with that calculated using canonical quantisation, and then extend this to multiple chiral bosons. The partition function for chiral scalars taking values on a rational torus is a sum of terms, each of which is the product of two holomorphic functions, one a function of the modulus of the first metric and the other a function of the modulus of the second metric. In particular, for the case of chiral bosons moving on a torus defined by an even self-dual lattice, the partition function is a single product of two such holomorphic functions, not a sum of such terms. This is applied to the heterotic string to give a world-sheet action whose quantisation is modular invariant and free from anomalies. We discuss modular invariance for the moduli of both metrics and the extension to higher genus Riemann surfaces.</description>

      <title>ETH-monotonicity and the black hole singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ETH-monotonicity is a recently discovered quantum advantage in quantum chaotic many-body systems which reinforces the Kelvin statement of the second law of thermodynamics over and above the universal entropic contribution. We show that the boundary conformal field theory in AdS/CFT correspondence possesses ETH-monotonicity. This leads to our proposal that the black hole singularity is a microstate for which ETH-monotonicity dominates the entropic factor.</description>

      <title>The dyonic Kerr-Schild ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a geometric extension of the Kerr-Schild ansatz that incorporates both electric and magnetic sectors of the Maxwell field in a unified framework, without resorting to duality rotations. We start observing that the known purely electric solution satisfies Maxwell's equations due to a closedness condition obeyed by the Kerr-Schild null congruence. From the associated local exactness property, we construct a new one-form naturally linked to the congruence as a sort of Poincar\'e dualization. This leads us to propose a geometrically motivated dyonic vector potential within the Kerr-Schild ansatz, defined as a superposition of an electric contribution along the congruence and a magnetic one that aligns to the dualized one-form. We then show that for a stationary and axisymmetric Kerr-Schild ansatz, the electrovac circularity theorem uniquely constrains not only the scalar profile of the metric, but also those associated to the electric-magnetic splitting of the gauge field. The resulting formalism provides a transparent derivation of the dyonic Kerr-Newman solution and extends naturally to the (A)dS case, highlighting the intrinsic interplay between geometry and matter in a Kerr-Schild setting.</description>

      <title>Photon polarization tensor in presence of constant and arbitrary electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the photon polarization tensor at one-loop order in the presence of a constant and uniform electric field. Our calculation is carried out for arbitrary field strength using the Schwinger proper-time formalism, and we explicitly derive an expression for the polarization tensor without approximations. We also present a complementary derivation within the strong field approximation. Our main contribution lies in expressing the polarization tensor in terms of a physically motivated tensor basis that ensures transversality and thus preserves gauge invariance. This basis, constructed from the preferred direction defined by the external electric field, makes explicit the breaking of Lorentz symmetry. We verify the consistency of our results by recovering the well-known vacuum polarization tensor in the zero-field limit and by demonstrating agreement between the strong field limit of the general expression and the result obtained directly in the strong field approximation. Interestingly, in the latter case, only one tensor structure survives, corresponding to the transverse dynamics with respect to the field direction, which highlights the dominance of perpendicular modes.</description>

      <title>Timelike Liouville theory and AdS$_3$ gravity at finite cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that AdS$_3$ gravity with conformal boundary conditions is described by coupling the holographic CFT to timelike Liouville theory and deforming by an exactly marginal operator. In this description, the Liouville field controls the finite-cutoff radial wall in the bulk. We check this proposal in the semiclassical limit by matching the sphere and torus partition functions between the bulk and boundary theories. By scaling parameters of the Liouville theory we can push our bulk description deep inside the interior of black hole geometries. The same scaling of parameters leads to a flat-space limit with a two-dimensional CFT as its holographic dual theory.</description>

      <title>AdS$_3$ black holes with primary Proca hair from regularized Gauss-Bonnet coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a consistent three-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory as a vector-tensor theory within the generalized Proca class by employing a regularization procedure based on the Weyl geometry, which was introduced recently in arXiv:2504.13084. We then obtain an asymptotically AdS$_3$, static, and circularly symmetric black hole solution with primary Proca hair. Afterwards, we investigate the effect of the scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet coupling constructed previously by different regularization schemes. We further generalize these solutions by incorporating an electric charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the low-energy dynamics of massless Dirac fermions interacting with a propagating, relativistic photon in 2+1 spacetime dimensions, when we turn on a uniform magnetic field. This problem can be solved when the magnetic field is sufficiently strong. As observed previously, we find that the vacuum spontaneously breaks some of the global symmetries. We also determine the spectrum of excitations around this vacuum, and compute the resulting low-energy effective action. We use techniques that were previously developed for quantum Hall ferromagnets in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Regulator and gauge dependence of the Abelian gauge coupling in asymptotically safe quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both General Relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics are not UV complete. General Relativity is perturbatively non-renormalizable, while the Standard Model features Landau poles, where couplings are predicted to diverge at finite energies, e.g., in the Abelian gauge sector. Asymptotically safe quantum gravity may resolve both of these issues at the same time. In this paper, we assess the systematic uncertainties associated with this scenario, in particular with the gravitationally induced UV-completion of the Abelian gauge sector. Specifically, we study the dependence of this qualitative feature, namely the existence of a UV-complete gauge sector, on unphysical choices like the gauge, and the regulator function. Intriguingly, in some scenarios, we find simultaneous points of minimal sensitivity relative to both the regulator and gauge parameters, which allow for a UV completion. This provides further indications that the simultaneous UV-completion of quantum gravity and matter via an asymptotically safe fixed point is a robust physical feature, and that physical quantities, like scaling exponents, can become independent of unphysical choices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Hamiltonian framework for nonlocal Lagrangian systems without relying on infinite-derivative expansions. Starting from a (trajectory-based) variational principle and a generalized Noether theorem, we define the canonical momenta and energy. Moreover, we construct a (pre)symplectic form on the kinematic space, and show that its restriction to the phase space (by implementing the constraints) yields a true (pre)symplectic structure encoding the dynamics. Three examples -- a finite nonlocal oscillator, the fully nonlocal Pais-Uhlenbeck model, and a delayed harmonic oscillator -- demonstrate how phase space and the Hamiltonian emerge without explicitly solving the Euler-Lagrange equations.</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of topological defects in $K3$ sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a $K3$ surface, a supersymmetric non-linear K3 sigma model is the internal superconformal field theory (SCFT) in a six dimensional compactification of type IIA superstring on $\mathbb{R}^{1,5} \times K3$. These models have attracted attention due to the discovery of Mathieu moonshine phenomena for the elliptic genera of K3 surfaces, and have played a pivotal role in extending Mukai's theorem on classification of symplectic automorphisms of $K3$ surfaces. We report on recent progress (arXiv:2402.08719 [hep-th]) in characterizing topological defects in $K3$ models, generalizing the notion of symmetries to categories of topological operators supported on arbitrary codimension submanifolds with possibly non-invertible fusion rules. Taking advantage of the interpretation of Mukai lattice as the D-brane charge lattice, we present a number of general results for the category of topological defect lines preserving the superconformal algebra and spectral flow, obtained by studying their fusion with boundary states. While for certain K3 models infinitely many simple defects, and even a continuum, can occur, at generic points in the moduli space the category is actually trivial, i.e. it is generated by the identity defect. Furthermore, if a K3 model is at the attractor point for some BPS configuration of D-branes, then all topological defects have integral quantum dimension. We also introduce a conjecture that a continuum of topological defects arises if and only if the K3 model is a (possibly generalized) orbifold of a torus model. These general results are confirmed by the analysis of significant examples. We also point out the connection to recent studies of topological defects in the Conway moonshine module theory (arXiv:2412.21141 [hep-th],arXiv:2504.18619 [hep-th]).</description>

      <title>Constraints on cosmological parameters and CMB first acoustic peak in conformal Killing gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the frame of conformal Killing gravity cosmology, we performed a Bayesian analysis on two different datasets of Baryonic Acoustic oscillations (DESI and SDSS DR16) and on two datasets of SNeIa (Pantheon+ and Union3). The results for H0 and Omega_M in a spatially flat FRW background are consistent with the Lambda-CDM scenario. We obtain a non-negligible negative value for the novel density of dark sector, Omega_D, and its relevance in the evolution of the cosmological observables thus finding quantitatively what its contribution is on real data to match the standard scenario. The results confirm the dynamical character of dark energy. We also calculate the deceleration parameter q0 and the present time dark energy equation of state parameter w0: the latter belongs to the quintessence regime. The evaluation of the first acoustic peak of CMB places it extraordinarily near to the best value provided by the Planck collaboration. In this scenario, we can conclude that late time and early time data can be successfully matched under the same standard.</description>

      <title>Creating a Universe from Nothing as an Alternative to the Cosmological Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the cosmological Robertson-Walker geometry required of the cosmological principle both the Weyl tensor $C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ and the Bach tensor $W^{\mu\nu}=[2\nabla_{\kappa}\nabla_{\lambda}-R_{\lambda\kappa}]C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ vanish. In general, in perturbations around the cosmological background neither of the fluctuating $\delta C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ or $\delta W^{\mu\nu}$ would vanish. However, it is possible for $\delta W^{\mu\nu}$ to vanish even as $\delta C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ does not. In this paper we construct an explicit model in which this is the case. The model consists of a tensor gravitational wave
  fluctuating around a background with a constant negative 3-curvature. The model is exactly solvable and consists purely of geometric quantities with no matter fields at all (i.e., $G^{\mu\nu}=0$, $\delta G^{\mu\nu}=0$, $W^{\mu\nu}=0$, $\delta W^{\mu\nu}=0$, where $G^{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor). The model can thus be created out of nothing, with creating a universe from nothing thus being an alternative principle to the cosmological principle. The fluctuating gravitational wave contributes to the temperature anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background in a calculable manner, for which we provide a simple analytic way of treating spatial modes that is based on the use of a spatial mode addition theorem. In addition, we provide a treatment of the anisotropy that is based on properties of bandwidth limited functions.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Entanglement in Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local measurements can radically reshape patterns of many-body entanglement, especially in long-range entangled quantum-critical states. Yet, analytical results addressing the effects of measurements on many-body states remain scarce, and measurements are often approximated as forcing specific measurement outcomes. We study measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, a broad family of 1+1d quantum critical states described at low energies by compact free boson conformal field theories (CFT). Measuring the local charge operator, we show that the MIE is entirely universal, conformally invariant, and depends on the operator content of the CFT. Using a replica-trick to address the randomness of the measurement outcomes, we compute the MIE exactly for Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, in very good agreement with matrix-product state calculations. We show that the MIE for physical quantum measurements is fundamentally different from the entanglement induced by forcing measurement outcomes, and has a natural interpretation in terms of Born averaging over conformally-invariant boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: First-order phase transitions in the early Universe are a well-motivated source of gravitational waves (GWs). In this Letter, we identify a previously overlooked GW production mechanism: gravitational transition radiation, arising from graviton emission by particles whose mass changes as they pass through expanding bubble walls. Unlike conventional sources such as bubble collisions or sound waves, this mechanism operates at the microscopic scale set by the Lorentz-contracted wall thickness, leading to GW emission at significantly higher frequencies. The resulting spectrum features a distinctive shape with a peak frequency redshifting to $f_{\rm peak}\sim \gamma_w T_0\sim \gamma_w\times 10^{10}\,{\rm Hz}$ where $\gamma_w$ is the Lorentz boost factor of the wall velocity and $T_0$ is the current temperature of the Universe. This mechanism is generic and is expected to operate similarly for domain walls and other relativistic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Signatures of quantum chaos and complexity in the Ising model on random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate signatures of quantum chaos and complexity in the quantum annealing Ising model on random Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. By tuning the connectivity of the graph, the dynamics can be driven from a localized phase through a chaotic regime to an integrable limit. While this dynamical transition reflects in the spectral characteristics, we pursue a broader suite of quantum chaos indicators,some of which can be measured on near-term quantum devices. We study deep thermalization of a quantum state ensemble obtained from a natural unraveling of the subsystem density matrix as an indicator of chaotic dynamics. This extends the analysis of quantum chaos to the ensemble of quantum states. Furthermore, we analyze the eigenstate and eigenvalue correlations through the partial spectral form factor of subsystems and observe distinct signatures of the onset of chaos and its system size dependence, providing experimentally measurable indicators of the localization-to-chaos transition. As a locality-independent probe, we show that the Krylov complexity of operators is also maximized in the chaotic regime, providing a link between graph topology and information scrambling. Finally, we investigate a quantum analogue of the Mpemba effect, where initially "hotter" states can thermalize anomalously fast, a phenomenon most cleanly observed within the chaotic phase. However, away from the chaotic regime, the system is distinguished by multiple crossings across connectivity in its distance from the thermal ensemble with time. Collectively, this work presents a broad characterization of chaos, providing insight beyond spectral analysis and practical indicators for benchmarking near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Variations of the crossover and first-order phase transition curve in modeling the QCD equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice QCD calculations have shown that the transition from hadrons to quarks and gluons is a rapid crossover at $T = 155-160$ MeV at vanishing chemical potential. Many model calculations show that the transition is first-order at sufficiently high baryon chemical potential. It is then natural to expect the existence of a critical point where the crossover and first-order phase transition lines meet. We show how to embed a phase boundary that terminates at the critical point in a smooth background equation of state, using several different but closely related criteria, so as to yield the critical exponents and critical amplitude ratios expected of a transition in the 3D Ising and liquid-gas universality class. The crossover curves can be tuned to pass through experimental freeze-out data from heavy ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC. The resulting equations of state can be used in hydrodynamic simulations of these collisions to probe the existence of a critical point and corresponding first-order phase transition.</description>

      <title>Plabic Tangles and Cluster Promotion Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the BCFW recurrence for tilings of the amplituhedron, we introduce the general framework of `plabic tangles' that utilizes plabic graphs to define rational maps between products of Grassmannians called `promotions'. The central conjecture of the paper is that promotion maps are quasi-cluster homomorphisms, which we prove for several classes of promotions. In order to define promotion maps, we utilize $m$-vector-relation configurations ($m$-VRCs) on plabic graphs. We relate $m$-VRCs to the degree (a.k.a `intersection number') of the amplituhedron map on positroid varieties and characterize all plabic trees with intersection number one and their VRCs. Finally, we show that promotion maps admit an operad structure and, supported by the class of `$4$-mass box' promotion, we point at new positivity properties for non-rational maps beyond cluster algebras. Promotion maps have important connections to the geometry and cluster structure of the amplituhedron and singularities of scattering amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Bootstrap Approach to a Non-Relativistic Potential for Quarkonium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum bootstrap method is applied to determine the bound-state spectrum of Quarkonium systems using a non-relativistic potential approximation. The method translates the Schr\"odinger equation into a set of algebraic recursion relations for radial moments $\langle r^m \rangle$, which are constrained by the positive semidefiniteness of their corresponding Hankel matrices. The numerical implementation is first validated by calculating the $1S$ and $1P$ mass centroids for both charmonium ($c\bar{c}$) and bottomonium ($b\bar{b}$) systems, finding deviations of less than 0.5\% from experimental data from the Particle Data Group (PDG). This analysis is then extended to the hypothetical toponium ($t\bar{t}$) system, predicting a $1S$ ground state mass of $M \approx 344.3 \text{ GeV}$. This theoretical mass is in agreement with the energy of the recently observed resonance-like enhancement in the $t\bar{t}$ cross-section by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. This result provides theoretical support for the interpretation of this experimental phenomenon as the formation of a quasi-bound toponium state and highlights the predictive power of the non-relativistic potential approach for systems of two massive quarks.</description>

      <title>Lattice results for the equation of state in dense QCD-like theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent progress in Monte Carlo simulations of dense two-color QCD (QC$_2$D), focusing on the phase diagram, the equation of state, and the sound velocity in the low-temperature regime. In three-color QCD at finite density, especially at low temperatures, the notorious sign problem makes lattice Monte Carlo simulations intractable. In contrast, QC$_2$D is free from this issue due to the pseudoreality of the quark representation. Recent independent lattice studies have revealed unexpected phenomena through first-principles calculations of the phase structure and thermodynamics. A particularly notable finding is that the sound velocity exceeds the so-called conformal (holography) bound, \( c_s^2/c^2 \le 1/3 \), which had not been observed in QCD-like theories at finite temperature. In this review, we focus primarily on results from a series of works by our group~\cite{Iida:2019rah, Iida:2020emi,Iida:2022hyy, Ishiguro:2021yxr, Iida:2024irv}, along with related studies in dense QC$_2$D and three-color QCD with isospin chemical potential. We discuss the possibility and physical implications of conformal bound violation even for three-color dense QCD, together with insights from effective model analyses and recent observations of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Probing the Weak Gravity Conjecture: Novel Aschenbach Signatures in Superextremal Non-Linear Charged AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the nonlinear charged Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole solution within the framework of massive gravity, motivated by recent advancements linking the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) to phenomena such as Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) and photon sphere dynamics. Building on these foundations, we focus on the Aschenbach effect-a relativistic phenomenon intricately tied to the geometry of photon spheres and known to occur in some special sub-extremal non rotating black holes. Our primary objective is to determine whether this effect persists not only up to the extremal limit but also beyond, into the superextremal regime, thus probing the stability and validity of black hole characteristics in these extreme conditions. By analyzing the nonlinear charged AdS black hole solutions in massive gravity, we demonstrate that the Aschenbach effect remains a robust feature across both extremal and superextremal configurations. This extension suggests that key relativistic signatures and the underlying spacetime structures associated with high-spin black holes continue to hold beyond classical boundaries. Our results provide new insights into the behavior of ultra-compact objects and highlight promising directions for exploring the limits of general relativity, as well as potential generalizations of the WGC and WCC in strong gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder Black Hole with Quintessential Dark Energy and a String Clouds: Geodesics, Perturbative Dynamics, and Thermal Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a deformed Schwarzschild black hole (BH) within a loop quantum gravity (LQG) framework incorporating both a quintessence field (QF) and a cloud of strings (CS), aiming to understand how these exotic fields collectively influence various physical phenomena in the BH's vicinity. We systematically investigate the quantum Oppenheimer--Snyder (QOS) spacetime by deriving the complete metric and analyzing horizon structures, showing significant modifications to the classical geometry through the interplay of quantum deformation effects, CS, and QF parameters. Our comprehensive geodesic analysis demonstrates that null geodesics exhibit modified effective potentials and altered photon trajectories, while timelike geodesics show enhanced orbital velocities and geodesic precession frequencies compared to classical predictions, providing potentially observable signatures through precision measurements. The BH shadow investigation reveals systematic increases in shadow radius with both CS and QF parameters, offering new possibilities for testing exotic matter configurations through next-generation high-resolution observations. We examine field perturbations of different spins -- including scalar, electromagnetic (EM), and fermionic fields -- demonstrating that the BH remains stable under external disturbances while exhibiting modified quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra that could serve as observational discriminators. Most remarkably, our thermodynamic analysis reveals exotic thermal behavior including negative temperature regimes, fundamentally altered stability conditions, and genuine phase transitions between distinct BH configurations, extending well beyond classical general relativity predictions.</description>

      <title>Particle Dynamics and Thermal Properties in Kalb-Ramond ModMax Black Holes: Theoretical Predictions for Observational Tests of Exotic Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of geodesic motion and thermodynamic behavior in Kalb--Ramond (KR) black hole (BH) spacetimes sourced by ModMax electrodynamics. Both neutral and charged test particle dynamics are investigated, highlighting how the Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) parameter $\ell$, the ModMax nonlinearity parameter $\gamma$, and the discrete branch parameter $\zeta$ significantly modify orbital structures compared to classical Schwarzschild and Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) solutions. Effective potential analysis reveals notable shifts in the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO): ordinary branches allow stable orbits closer to the horizon, while phantom branches shift them outward by factors of 5--10. For charged particles, the combined influence of modified gravity and nonlinear electromagnetic fields may induce chaotic trajectories in certain regimes. On the thermodynamic side, we derive full expressions for Hawking temperature, entropy, and Helmholtz free energy. Ordinary branches exhibit divergent specific heat indicating second-order phase transitions, whereas phantom branches yield consistently negative specific heat, implying thermal instability. Phantom BHs are found to possess higher Hawking temperatures and show distinct thermodynamic phase structures, including Hawking--Page-type transitions. Observational features such as BH shadows and gravitational lensing are explored, revealing parameter-dependent changes in photon sphere radii and deflection angles. Notably, the deflection angle analysis via the Gauss--Bonnet theorem method (GBTm) shows opposite-sign electromagnetic corrections for phantom versus ordinary branches, suggesting potential observational discriminants.</description>

Abstract: We study the $1/c$ expansion of general relativity within a formulation that is compatible with both the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner and the Kol-Smolkin decompositions. The Einstein-Hilbert action takes a common form for those decompositions as they are dual to each other. We first develop a method to expand this generic form and then push the expansion up to $c^{-3}$ order within this novel approach. Next, we apply our technique to the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner decomposition and expand it up to $c^{-3}$ order explicitly. In order to demonstrate the applicability of our method and to highlight the duality at the level of expansion, we also perform the expansion in the Kol-Smolkin decomposition up to $c^{-1}$ order. Lastly, we make some all-order observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore in detail, the time evolution of Krylov complexity. We demonstrate, through analytical computations, that in finite many-body systems, while ramp and plateau are two generic features of Krylov complexity, the manner in which complexity saturates reveals the chaotic nature of the system. In particular, we show that the dynamics towards saturation precisely distinguish between chaotic and integrable systems. For chaotic models, the saturation value of complexity reaches its infinite time average at a finite saturation time. In this case, depending on the initial state, it may also exhibit a peak before saturation. In contrast, in integrable models, complexity approaches the infinite time average value from below at a much longer timescale. We confirm this distinction using numerical results for specific spin models.</description>

      <title>A geometric phase approach to quark confinement from stochastic gauge-geometry flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply a stochastic version of the geometric (Ricci) flow, complemented with the stochastic flow of the gauge Yang--Mills sector, in order to seed the chromo-magnetic and chromo-electric vortices that source the area-law for QCD confinement. The area-law is the key signature of quark confinement in Yang--Mills gauge theories with a non-trivial center symmetry. In particular, chromo-magnetic vortices enclosed within the chromo-electric Wilson loops instantiate the area-law asymptotic behaviour of the Wilson loop vacuum expectation values. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow is responsible for the topology changes that induce the appearance of the vortices. When vortices vanish, due to topology changes in the manifolds associated to the hadronic ground states, the evaluation of the Wilson loop yields a dependence on the length of the path, hence reproducing the perimeter law of the hadronic (Higgs) phase of real QCD. Confinement, instead, is naturally achieved within this context as a by-product of the topology change of the manifold over which the dynamics of the Yang--Mills fields is defined. It is then provided by the Aharonov--Bohm effect induced by the concatenation of the compact chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic fluxes originated by the topology changes. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow naturally accomplishes a treatment of the emergence of the vortices and the generation of turbulence effects. Braiding and knotting, resulting from topology changes, namely stochastic fluctuations, stabilize the chromo-magnetic vortices. Finally, we observe that dimensional transmutation for the Yang-Mills fields can be derived from the scaling property of the geometric part of the stochastic flow. Specifically, a relation that involves the infrared equilibrium limit of the Planck constant can be derived that yields the correct order of magnitude for $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological CPT Theorem</title>

Abstract: The CPT theorem states that a unitary and Lorentz-invariant theory must also be invariant under a discrete symmetry $\mathbf{CRT}$ which reverses charge, time, and one spatial direction. In this article, we study a $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry group, in which two of the nontrivial symmetries (``Reflection Reality'' and a 180 degree rotation) are implied by Unitarity and Lorentz Invariance respectively, while the third is $\mathbf{CRT}$. (In cosmology, Scale Invariance plays the role of Lorentz Invariance.) This naturally leads to converses of the CPT theorem, as any two of the discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries will imply the third one. Furthermore, in many field theories, the Reflection Reality $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is actually sufficient to imply the theory is fully unitary, over a generic range of couplings. Building upon previous work on the Cosmological Optical Theorem, we derive non-perturbative reality conditions associated with bulk Reflection Reality (in all flat FLRW models) and $\mathbf{CRT}$ (in de Sitter spacetime), in arbitrary dimensions. Remarkably, this $\mathbf{CRT}$ constraint suffices to fix the phase of all wavefunction coefficients at future infinity (up to a real sign) -- without requiring any analytic continuation, or comparison to past infinity -- although extra care is required in cases where the bulk theory has logarithmic UV or IR divergences. This result has significant implications for de Sitter holography, as it allows us to determine the phases of arbitrary $n$-point functions in the dual CFT.</description>

      <title>Modular Features of Superstring Scattering Amplitudes: Generalised Eisenstein Series and Theta Lifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous papers it has been shown that the coefficients of terms in the large-$N$ expansion of a certain integrated four-point correlator of superconformal primary operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory are rational sums of real-analytic Eisenstein series and "generalised Eisenstein series''. The latter are novel modular functions first encountered in the context of graviton amplitudes in type IIB superstring theory. Similar modular functions, known as two-loop modular graph functions, are also encountered in the low-energy expansion of the integrand of genus-one closed superstring amplitudes. In this paper we further develop the mathematical structure of such generalised Eisenstein series emphasising, in particular, the occurrence of $L$-values of holomorphic cusp forms in their Fourier mode decomposition. We show that both the coefficients in the large-$N$ expansion of the integrated correlator and two-loop modular graph functions admit a unifying description in terms of four-dimensional lattice sums generated by theta lifts of local Maass functions, which generalise the structure of real-analytic Eisenstein series. Through the theta lift representation, we demonstrate that elements belonging to these two families of non-holomorphic modular functions can be expressed as rational linear combinations of generalised Eisenstein series for which all the $L$-values of holomorphic cusp forms precisely cancel.</description>

      <title>No-go Theorem for Cosmological Parity Violation</title>

Abstract: A no-go theorem for parity-violation in even $D$-dimensional spacetimes invariant under $ISO(d)$ and dilatations (as well as the implications for odd $D$) is derived. For the case of real massless scalar and gravitons (as well as any massless even integer spin-$s$ field) at $\mathcal{I}^+$, the reality of wavefunction coefficients in Fourier space to all orders in perturbation theory (any order in loops) coming from a local, unitary, IR- and UV-finite theory, which start from the initial \CRT-invariant Bunch-Davies state in the infinite past, is proven. From this it is inferred that a parity-odd correlator with any massless scalar fields and even integer spin-$s$ fields vanishes in the presence of any number of interactions of massless fields. The same is true for correlators with an even number of conformally-coupled and massless odd integer spin-$s$ external fields, which is used to derive the cosmological analogue of Furry's theorem. The fundamental implications of \CRT symmetry for theories with chemical potentials, such as Chern-Simons and Axion inflation, is also discussed. Given the recent interest in parity-violation coming from observational claims of parity-violation detection, these results provide clear constraints on parity-violating models of inflation and establish the measurement of any parity-odd correlator as an exceptionally sensitive probe of new physics beyond vanilla inflation.</description>

      <title>The thread embodiment of holographic quantum entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10691v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper systematically develops the concept of entanglement threads that characterize the entanglement structure of holographic duality. Behind this framework lies a simple philosophy: holographic quantum entanglement can be visualized using thread-like objects. Inspired by the fact that tensor network models can be deformed into a quantum circuit form with flow-conserving features, we abstract the concept of entanglement threads. These entanglement threads can be understood as a pre-set ensemble of wires in a holographic quantum circuit, and we propose that they characterize the underlying partially ordered structure of holographic quantum entanglement. Combining the concepts of entanglement threads and kinematic space, a elegant circuit interpretation for the holographic complexity is provided. We also clarify the connection and distinction between entanglement threads and the previously proposed concept of bit threads.</description>

      <title>Physics on manifolds with exotic differential structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A given topological manifold can sometimes be endowed with inequivalent differential structures. Physically this means that what is meant by a differentiable function (smooth) is simply different for observers using inequivalent differential structures. {The 7-sphere, $\bS^7$, was the first topological manifold where the possibility of inequivalent differential structures was discovered \cite{Milnor}.} In this paper, we examine the import of inequivalent differential structures on the physics of fields obeying the Dirac equation on $\bS^7$. { $\bS^7$ is a fibre bundle of the 3-sphere as a fibre on the 4-sphere as a base. We consider the Kaluza-Klein limit of such a fibre bundle which reduces to a SO(4) Yang-Mills gauge theory over $\bS^4$. We find, for certain specific symmetric set of gauge potentials, that the spectrum of the Dirac operator can be computed explicitly, for each choice of the differential structure. Hence identical topological manifolds have different physical laws. We find this the most important conclusion of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Towards the Double Copy Formulation for the Abelian Sector of Heterotic Double Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown that double field theory (DFT) action can be constructed in a perturbative manner up to cubic order by using double copy of Yang-Mills. This construction can also be extended by starting with higher-derivative Yang-Mills theory to obtain higher-derivative DFT action. In this work, we extend this classical double copy formulation to the Abelian subsector of heterotic DFT, starting with a Yang-Mills theory that includes a charged scalar field, namely (Y M + \phi^3) theory. The action we constructed by a double copy procedure exactly matches with the Abelian sector of heterotic DFT action up to cubic order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that when two toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds and their corresponding toric varieties are related by a birational transformation, they are associated with a pair of dimer models on the 2-torus that define dimer integrable systems, which themselves become birationally equivalent. These integrable systems defined by dimer models were first introduced by Goncharov and Kenyon. We illustrate this equivalence explicitly using a pair of dimer integrable systems corresponding to the abelian orbifolds of the form C^3/Z_4 x Z_2 with orbifold action (1,0,3)(0,1,1) and C/Z_2 x Z_2 with action (1,0,0,1)(0,1,1,0), whose spectral curves and Hamiltonians are shown to be related by a birational transformation.</description>

      <title>RNS superstring measure for genus 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new formula for the RNS supersting measure for genus 3. Our derivation is based on invariant theory. We follow Witten's idea of using an algebraic parametrization of the moduli space (which he applied to re-derive D'Hoker and Phong's formula for the RNS superstring measure for genus 2); but the particular parametrization that we use has not been applied to superstring theory before. We prove that the superstring measure is a linear combinaition (with complex coefficients) of three known functions. Furthermore, we conjecture the values of the coefficients of this linear combination and provide evidence for this conjecture. Unlike the Ansatz of Cacciatori, Dalla Piazza and van Geemen from 2008, our formula has a polar singularity along the hyperelliptic locus; the existence of this singularity was established by Witten in 2015. Moreover, our formula is not an Ansatz but follows from first principles, except for the values of the three coefficients.</description>

      <title>Center-vortex semiclassics with non-minimal 't Hooft fluxes on $\mathbb{R}^2\times T^2$ and center stabilization at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the semiclassical description of confinement for $4$d $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory on small $\mathbb{R}^2\times T^2$ with non-minimal 't Hooft twist $p$ with $\gcd(N,p)=1$. For this purpose, we construct the self-dual center vortex for non-minimal 't Hooft twists from the Kraan-van Baal-Lee-Lu-Yi (KvBLLY) monopoles by using the $3$d Abelianized description of $SU(N)$ gauge fields on $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$ with nontrivial holonomy backgrounds. This construction shows the self-dual vortex has (1) the fractional magnetic charge $q/N$ with $pq=1$ mod $N$, (2) the fractional topological charge $1/N$, and (3) the fractional instanton action $S_{\mathrm{YM}}=8\pi^2/(Ng^2)$. The confinement vacua for $NL\Lambda\ll 1$ can be described by the dilute gas approximation of center vortices, and we give the semiclassical formula for the $\theta$ dependence and confining string tensions. We apply this result to understand the suitable choice of the twist $p$ for center stabilization at large $N$. In particular, we test the proposal using the Fibonacci sequence, $N=F_{n+2}$ and $p=F_n$, suggested in studies of the twisted Eguchi-Kawai model, from the viewpoint of the $1$-form and $0$-form center symmetries.</description>

      <title>On world-sheet S-matrix of NSR string in static gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20262v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As was shown in arXiv:1203.1054, expanding the Nambu action near the "long string" vacuum in the static gauge one finds that the one-loop 2 to 2 scattering amplitude of the $D-2=24$ transverse 2d fluctuations $X^i$ is given by a pure phase expression consistent with underlying integrability. Similar computation in the Green-Schwarz superstring was carried out in arXiv:2404.09658. Here we consider the case of the NSR string starting with its manifestly 2d covariant action given by $D$ scalar multiplets coupled to 2d supergravity. Eliminating the zweibein and gravitino fields is non-trivial, and a Nambu-like formulation of the spinning string involving only scalar coordinates and their 2d fermionic partners has not previously been available. We show how the auxiliary fields can be eliminated in static gauge after a specific choice of superconformal gauge for the fermions, while keeping the transverse fields $X^i$ and $\psi^i$ off-shell. The resulting one-loop S-matrix for $X^i$ is found, as expected, to be the same as in the GS superstring case. We also discuss similar actions for the heterotic string and a $T\bar T$ deformation of free 2d scalar multiplet.</description>

      <title>Free field construction of Heterotic string compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds of Berglund-Hubsch type in the Batyrev-Borisov combinatorial approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01068v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterotic string models in $4$-dimensions are the hybrid theories of a left-moving $N=1$ fermionic string whose additional $6$-dimensions are compactified on a $N=2$ SCFT theory with the central charge $9$, and a right-moving bosonic string, whose additional dimensions are also compactified on $N=2$ SCFT theory with the central charge $9$, and the remaining $13$ dimensions compactified on the torus of $E(8)\times SO(10)$ Lie algebra.
  The important class of exactly solvable Heterotic string models considered earlier by D. Gepner corresponds to the products of $N=2$ minimal models with the total central charge $c=9$. These models are known to describe Heterotic string models compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds, which belong a special subclass of general CY manifolds of Berglund-Hubsch type. We generalize this construction to all cases of compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds of general Berglund-Hubsch type, using Batyrev-Borisov combinatorial approach. In particular, starting from the mirror pair of Batyrev lattices corresponding to a given CY manifold, we construct vertex operators of the complete physical theory as cohomology of Borisov differentials that correspond to points of reflexive Batyrev polyhedra. In particular, we show how the number of $27$, $\overline{27}$ and Singlet representations of $E(6)$ is determined by the data of reflexive Batyrev polytope that determines this CY-manifold.</description>

      <title>Examples for BPS solitons destabilized by quantum effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate serval models for two scalar fields in one space dimension with topologically stable solitons that are constructed from BPS equations. The asymptotic behavior of these solitons fully determines their classical energies. A particular feature of the considered mode ls is that there are several translationally invariant ground states that we call primary and secondary vacua. The former are those that ar e asymptotically assumed by the solitons. Solitons that occupy a secondary vacuum in finite but eventually large portions of space are clas sically degenerate. hus the quantum contributions to the energies are decisive for the energetically favored soliton. While some of these s olitons were constructed previously, we, for the first time, compute the leading (one-loop) quantum contribution their energies. In all ca ses considered we find that this contribution is not bounded from below and that it is the more negative the larger the region is in which the soliton approaches a secondary vacuum. This corroborates the conjecture, earlier inferred from the Shifman-Voloshin soliton, that the a vailability of secondary vacua destabilizes these solitons on the quantum level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of 2D gravity -- ``matrix model'' duality on the example of $(2,2p+1)$ minimal string. We propose a reformulation of the duality, related to a more conventional one by ``$x-y$ swap'' in the language of topological recursion. This formulation elucidates some conceptual and technical difficulties in the dictionary of the duality and relation to other examples. In particular, it allows to circumvent the necessity to use ``resonance transformations'', that were previously introduced to match the worldsheet and ``matrix model'' correlators, and the expressions for minimal string amplitudes in this approach are reminiscent of the ones obtained recently for ``complex Liouville string'' theory. Using this new approach, we also formulate a conjecture on how one can compute amplitudes with operators other than tachyons in the dual theory.</description>

      <title>Gauged permutation invariant tensor quantum mechanics, least common multiples and the inclusion-exclusion principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the canonical ensemble partition functions for gauged permutation invariant tensor quantum harmonic oscillator thermodynamics, finding surprisingly simple expressions with number-theoretic characteristics. These systems have a gauged symmetry of $S_N$, the symmetric group of all permutations of a set of $N$ objects. The symmetric group acts on tensor variables $ \Phi_{ i_1, \cdots , i_s } $, where the $s$ indices each range over $ \{ 1, 2, \cdots , N \} $ and have the standard $S_N$ action of permutations. The result is a sum over partitions of $N$ and the summand is a product admitting simple expressions, which depend on the least common multiples (LCMs) of subsets of the parts of the partition. The inclusion-exclusion principle of combinatorics plays a central role in the derivation of these expressions. The behaviour of these partition functions under inversion of the Boltzmann factor $ x = e^{ - \beta } $ is governed by universal sequences associated with invariants of symmetric groups and alternating groups. The partition functions allow the development of a high temperature expansion analogous to the $s=2$ matrix case. The calculation of an $s$-dependent breakdown point leads to a critical Boltzmann factor $ x_c = { \log N \over sN^{ s-1}}$ as the leading large $N$ approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory with a holographic dual. Specifically, we are interested in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational scattering involving black holes.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Quantum Connections: Assessing the Viability of Weak Gravity and Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjectures in Kerr-Newman-Kiselev-Letelier Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses a potential validation of the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) with the weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC), as a significant challenge in quantum gravity. We explore the viability of the WGC and WCCC in the context of the Kerr-Newman-Kiselev-Letelier (KNKL) black hole. Although these conjectures appear unrelated, but surprising connection between these conjectures, It establishes a bridge between the quantum and the cosmic. By imposing specific constraints on the black hole's parameters, we demonstrate that the WGC and WCCC can be compatible in certain regions. We examine the properties of the KNKL black hole for $q/m &gt; (Q/M )_{ext}$, where $(Q/M )_{ext}$ is the charge-to-mass ratio of a large extremal black hole. We present figures to test the validity of both conjectures simultaneously. Without the spin parameter \(a\), the cloud of string parameter \(b\), quintessence parameter \(\gamma\), and equation of state parameter \(\omega\), the black hole either has two event horizons if \(Q^2/M^2 \leq 1\) or none event horizon if \(Q^2/M^2 &gt; 1\) which leads to a naked singularity that contradicts the WCCC. However, when \(a\), \(b\), \(\gamma\), and \(\omega\) are present, the black hole has event horizons in some regions in the \(Q^2/M^2 &gt; 1\) that ensure the singularity is covered and both the WGC and WCCC are fulfilled. Actually, we face this issue in the extremality state of the black hole viz these conjectures remain viable, with the black hole maintaining an event horizon. We conclude that certain regions of \(a\), \(b\), \(\gamma\), and \(\omega\) parameters can make the WGC and WCCC compatible, indicating their agreement when these parameters are present.</description>

      <title>Gauge structure of Yang-Mills theories with extra dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:1801.07843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An effective Lagrangian for Yang-Mills theories with $n$ extra dimensions is constructed. We start from a field theory governed by the extra-dimensional Poincar\'e group $ISO(1,3+n)$ and the extended gauge group $SU(N,M^{4+n})$, characterized by an energy scale $\Lambda$ and assumed to be valid at energies far below this scale. Assuming that the size of the extra dimensions is much larger than the distance scale at which this theory is valid, an effective theory with symmetry groups $ISO(1,3)$ and $SU(N,M^{4})$ is constructed. Such theories are connected by a canonical transformation that hides $ISO(1,3+n)\otimes SU(N,M^{4+n})$ into $ISO(1,3)\otimes SU(N,M^{4})$, and endows the KK gauge fields with mass. Using a set of orthogonal functions $\{f^{(\underline{0})},f^{(\underline{m})}(\bar x)\}$, generated by the Casimir invariant $\bar{P}^2$ associated with the translations subgroup $T(n)\subset ISO(n)$, the degrees of freedom of $ISO(1,3+n)\otimes SU(N,M^{4+n})$ are expanded via a general Fourier series, whose coefficients are the degrees of freedom of $ISO(1,3)\otimes SU(N,M^{4})$. These functions, corresponding to the projection on the coordinates basis $\{|\bar{x} \big &gt;\}$ of the discrete basis $\{|0\big &gt;,|p^{(\underline{m})}\big &gt;\}$ generated by $\bar {P}^2$, are central in defining the effective theory. Components along the base state $f^{(\underline{0})}=\big &lt;\bar x|0\big&gt;$, identified as the standard Yang-Mills fields, do not receive mass at the compactification scale; components along excited states $f^{(\underline{m})}=\big &lt;\bar x|p^{(\underline{m})}\big&gt;$, corresponding to KK excitations, receive mass at this scale. Associated with any direction $|p^{(\underline{m})}\neq0\big &gt;$ there are a massive gauge field and a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Resemblances of this mass-generating mechanism with the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism are stressed.</description>

      <title>Orbifold completion of 3-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06485v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of 3-dimensional ``orbifold completion'', to describe (generalised) orbifolds of topological quantum field theories as well as all their defects. Given a semistrict 3-category $\mathcal{T}$ with adjoints for all 1- and 2-morphisms (more precisely, a Gray category with duals), we construct the 3-category $\mathcal{T}_{\textrm{orb}}$ as a Morita category of certain $E_1$-algebras in $\mathcal{T}$ which encode triangulation invariance. We prove that in $\mathcal{T}_{\textrm{orb}}$ again all 1- and 2-morphisms have adjoints, that it contains $\mathcal{T}$ as a full subcategory, and we argue, but do not prove, that it satisfies a universal property which implies $(\mathcal{T}_{\textrm{orb}})_{\textrm{orb}} \cong \mathcal{T}_{\textrm{orb}}$. This is a categorification of the work in [CR]. Orbifold completion by design allows us to lift the orbifold construction from closed TQFT to the much richer world of defect TQFTs. We illustrate this by constructing a universal 3-dimensional state sum model with all defects from first principles, and we explain how recent work on defects between Witt equivalent Reshetikhin--Turaev theories naturally appears as a special case of orbifold completion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05375v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the effects of a local axion dark matter background on the $g-2$ of the electron. We calculate loop corrections to the photon-electron vertex and determine analytical formulas for the spin and cyclotron frequencies when the electron is in an external magnetic field. By comparing with current measurements of these observables, we are able to place the strongest constraint on the axion-elecron coupling for axion masses below $3\times10^{-18}\text{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric hybrid inflation and current-carrying metastable cosmic strings in $SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_R$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a realistic supersymmetric model for superheavy metastable cosmic strings (CSs) that can be investigated in the current pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments. It is based on shifted $\mu$-hybrid inflation in which the symmetry breaking $SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_R\rightarrow SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_{B-L}\times U(1)_R$ proceeds along an inflationary trajectory such that the topologically unstable primordial monopoles are inflated away. {{The breaking of $U(1)_{B-L} \times U(1)_R \rightarrow U(1)_Y$ after inflation ends yields the superheavy metastable CSs carrying the right handed neutrino zero modes that generate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), which we show is consistent with the current PTA data set and the LIGO O3 run}}. The scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are compatible with the Planck 2018 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope measurements. Both reheating and leptogenesis are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Condensation Completion and Defects in 2+1D Topological Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the condensation completion of a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$, which yields a fusion 2-category $\Sigma\mathcal{C}$ of separable algebras, bimodules over algebras and bimodule maps in $\mathcal{C}$. Physically, $\Sigma\mathcal{C}$ is the fusion 2-category of codimension-1 defects, codimension-2 defects and instantons in the $2+1$D topological order $\mathcal{C}$. We realize the rough-rough wall and $e$-$m$ exchange wall in Toric Code model on the lattice by deforming the Hamiltonian based on the corresponding algebraic data. We apply condensation completion to Toric Code, $3\mathbf{F}$, two-laryer semion and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological orders, and explicitly enumerate their $1$d and $0$d defects along with fusion rules. We also mention other applications of condensation completion: alternative interpretations of condensation completion of a braided fusion category; condensation completion of the category of symmetry charges and its correspondence to gapped phases with symmetry; for a topological order $\mathcal{C}$, one can find all gapped boundaries of the stacking of $\mathcal{C}$ with its time-reversal conjugate through computing the condensation completion of $\mathcal{C}$.</description>

      <title>Eikonal gravitational-wave lensing in Einstein-aether theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein-aether theory provides a model to test the validity of local Lorentz invariance in gravitational interactions. The speed of gravitational waves as measured from the binary neutron star event GW170817 sets stringent limits on Einstein-aether theory, but only on a combination of the theory's free parameters. For this reason, a significant part of the theory's parameter space remains unconstrained by observations. Motivated by this, we explore the propagation of gravitational waves in Einstein-aether theory over an inhomogeneous background (i.e., gravitational wave lensing) as a potential mechanism to break the degeneracies between the theory's free parameters, and hence enable new constraints on the theory to be obtained. We reduce our analysis to gravitational waves that pass far from the lens' center and short wavelength signals, both compared to the lens' gravitational radius (eikonal limit). By applying these approximations and bringing the field equations into the form of the so-called kinetic matrix and applying a formalism known as the propagation eigenstate framework, we find that the speed of gravitational waves is modified by inhomogeneities in the aether field. However, the modification is common to both gravitational polarizations and vanishes in the limit in which gravitational waves propagate with luminal speed. This lens-dependent gravitational wave speed contrasts with the lens-induced birefringence observed in other theories beyond general relativity, like Horndeski's theory. While the potential to improve tests based on gravitational-wave speed is limited, our formalism sets the basis to fully describe signal propagation over inhomogeneous spacetimes in Einstein-aether theory and other extensions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Quantum Toroidal Algebra U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor}), Vertex Operators and L-operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new vertex operators, both the type I and the type II dual, of the elliptic quantum toroidal algebra U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor}) by combining representations of U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor}) and the notions of the elliptic stable envelopes for the instanton moduli space M(n,r). The vertex operators reproduce the shuffle product formula of the elliptic stable envelopes by their composition. We also show that the vacuum expectation value of a composition of the vertex operators gives a correct formula of the K-theoretic vertex function for M(n,r). We then derive exchange relations among the vertex operators and construct a L-operator satisfying the RLL=LLR^* relation with R and R^* being elliptic dynamical instanton R-matrices defined as transition matrices of the elliptic stable envelopes. Assuming a universal form of L, we define a comultiplication \Delta in terms of it. It turns out that the new vertex operators are intertwining operators of the U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor})-modules w.r.t \Delta.</description>

      <title>Far from Perfect: Quantum Error Correction with (Hyperinvariant) Evenbly Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of qubit codes that we call Evenbly codes, building on a previous proposal of hyperinvariant tensor networks. Its tensor network description consists of local, non-perfect tensors describing CSS codes interspersed with Hadamard gates, placed on a hyperbolic $\{p,q\}$ geometry with even $q\geq 4$, yielding an infinitely large class of subsystem codes. We construct an example for a $\{5,4\}$ manifold and describe strategies of logical gauge fixing that lead to different rates $k/n$ and distances $d$, which we calculate analytically, finding distances which range from $d=2$ to $d \sim n^{2/3}$. Investigating threshold performance under erasure, depolarizing, and pure Pauli noise channels, we find that the code exhibits a depolarizing noise threshold of about 19.1% in the code-capacity model and 50% for pure Pauli and erasure channels under suitable gauges. We also test a constant-rate version with $k/n = 0.125$, finding excellent error resilience (about 40%) under the erasure channel. Recovery rates for these and other settings are studied both under an optimal decoder as well as a more efficient but non-optimal greedy decoder. We also consider generalizations beyond the CSS tensor construction, compute error rates and thresholds for other hyperbolic geometries, and discuss the relationship to holographic bulk/boundary dualities. Our work indicates that Evenbly codes may show promise for practical quantum computing applications.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the scalar-induced one-loop correction to the power spectrum of tensor perturbations produced during single-field slow-roll inflation. We find that the correction is given by the square of the product of the slow-roll parameter and the tree-level scalar power spectrum. We also discuss the implications of the logarithmic contribution.</description>

Abstract: We present a Group Field Theory (GFT) quantization of the Husain-Kucha\v{r} (HK) model formulated as a non-interacting GFT. We demonstrate that the path-integral formulation of this HK-GFT provides a complete spinfoam model and a unique Fock representation that describes the quantum three-geometries of the HK model. These results provide a link to the canonical quantization of the HK model and demonstrate how GFTs can bridge distinct quantization schemes.</description>

Abstract: For the first time, we present the model-independent two-loop effective action up to dimension six after integrating out heavy scalar(s) employing the Heat-Kernel method. We compute the effective operators that emerge at two-loop for two example models: heavy electroweak complex Triplet and Doublet scalars. We present our results on the SILH basis. We also capture the effect in the fermion sector. For these two scenarios, we compute all the fermionic effective operators up to dimension six.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A 2+1D superfluid in a rapidly rotating trap forms an array of vortices, with collective excitations called Tkachenko modes. Du et al. (2024) argued from an effective field theory viewpoint that these excitations are described by a field theory living on a non-commutative space. We elucidate the microscopic origin of these non-commutative fields, and present a novel derivation of the effective field theory for this superfluid using a lowest Landau level projected coherent state path integral approach. Besides conceptual clarity, this approach makes quantitative predictions about the long-wavelength, low-energy behavior in terms of the microscopic parameters of the short-range interacting lowest Landau level superfluid -- relevant to trapped Bose-Einstein condensate experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the Higgs field as a fundamental scalar in the Standard Model within the framework of modular inflation models, where a modulus field acts as the inflaton and its interactions are governed by an underlying modular symmetry. In general, the Higgs field can participate in the dynamics of modular inflation, leading to a two-field inflationary system-termed \emph{Higgs-Modular inflation}-which exhibits non-trivial dynamics and interesting phenomenological implications. We analyze Higgs-Modular inflation both analytically and numerically, highlighting its attractor behavior and the resulting observational constraints. In particular, we find that Higgs-Modular inflation is favored by the latest data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in certain regions of parameter space. This is in contrast to both pure Higgs inflation and pure modular inflation with a Starobinsky-type potential, which tend to predict a relatively low spectral index. Additionally, we discuss the cutoff scale of this inflationary model and the reheating processes induced by the decays of the modulus and the Higgs field.</description>

      <title>Natural neutrino mass hierarchy in a theory of gauge flavour deconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how a natural neutrino mass hierarchy with large lepton mixing angles may be achieved in a theory of gauge flavour deconstruction. Hitherto it has been shown that neutrino anarchy may result from such theories, but here we show that this need not necessarily be the case. In particular we consider the minimal tri-hypercharge theory, and show that the decomposition of the family hypercharges into the corresponding $B-L$ gauge groups, together with the charged lepton mass hierarchy, implies the sequential dominance conditions for a neutrino mass hierarchy, where lepton mixing originates from both the neutrino and charged lepton sectors. We present novel and model-independent sequential dominance results applicable to this case, but also useful more generally. We also show how natural quark mass and mixing are included in such a framework.</description>

      <title>Torsion parallel spinors on Lorentzian four-manifolds and supersymmetric evolution flows on bundle gerbes</title>

Abstract: This dissertation is concerned with the geometric study of differential spinors on oriented and spin Lorentzian four-manifolds via the theory of spinorial polyforms. The main results and applications are directed towards the investigation of torsion parallel spinors and the globally hyperbolic evolution flow determined by the globally hyperbolic solutions of the four-dimensional supersymmetric NS-NS system. This differential system, which originates in supergravity and string theory, involves skew-torsion parallel spinors subject to a curvature condition and provides a natural gauge-theoretic interpretation of skew-symmetric torsion as the curvature of a connection on an abelian bundle gerbe - a natural categorification of the notion of principal circle bundle.</description>

Abstract: We develop a novel approach for the self-consistent solution of coupled sets of Bethe-Salpeter and Schwinger-Dyson equations in QCD. This framework allows us to maintain the axial Ward-Takahashi identities of the theory within advanced approximation schemes, such as the skeleton or three-particle irreducible expansions. For this purpose we reformulate the Schwinger-Dyson equation of the axial-vector vertex such that the bulk of its quantum corrections is expressed in terms of a novel vertex. Crucially, this vertex satisfies a symmetry-induced relation of its own, which involves the full quark-gluon vertex. As a result, the Schwinger-Dyson equation reproduces the standard Ward-Takahashi identity satisfied by the axial-vector vertex. Consequently, the known relation between the quark mass function and the wave function of the pion in the chiral limit is duly fulfilled. The present approach offers valuable insights into the interplay between symmetry and dynamics, and provides a practical path towards computations of hadron physics within sophisticated approximations. In particular, the one-loop dressed truncation of the key dynamical equations, including that of the quark-gluon vertex, is shown to be completely compatible with the required symmetry relations. Further extensions and potential phenomenological applications of the developed framework are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Aspects of Natural Top Quark Condensation</title>

Abstract: In top quark condensation the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) boson is a $\bar{t}t$ bound state. With a UV completion of a single coloron exchange interaction, a recent semiclassical treatment gave a novel theory of the BEH boson as an extended object with composite scale $M_0\sim 6$ TeV. Presently we obtain the semiclassical theory as an effective action, using the source/Legendre transformation techniques of Jackiw, \etal, and fermion loop effects in the large-$N_c$ limit by deploying an auxiliary field to implement the sum of leading fermion loop diagrams. The theory remains natural at the loop level, with fine tuning at the level of a few \%, and the effective coupling of the 4-fermion interaction, $\bar{g}_0^2$, is significantly enhanced by quantum loops over the fundamental coloron coupling, $g_0^2$. Hence a relatively weaker ``topcolor'' theory can produce critical coupling in the effective BEH bound state theory.</description>

      <title>Cheng's eigenvalue comparison on metric measure spaces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the localization technique, we prove a sharp upper bound on the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of metric balls in essentially non-branching $\mathsf{CD}^{\star}(K,N)$ spaces. This extends a celebrated result of Cheng to the non-smooth setting of metric measure spaces satisfying Ricci curvature lower bounds in a synthetic sense, via optimal transport. Rigidity and stability statements are provided for $\mathsf{RCD}^{\star}(K,N)$ spaces; the stability seems to be new even for smooth Riemannian manifolds. We then present some mathematical and physical applications: in the former, we obtain an upper bound on the $j^{th}$ Neumann eigenvalue in essentially non-branching $\mathsf{CD}^{\star}(K,N)$ spaces and a bound on the essential spectrum in non-compact $\mathsf{RCD}^{\star}(K,N)$ spaces; in the latter, the eigenvalue bounds correspond to general upper bounds on the masses of the spin-2 Kaluza-Klein excitations around general warped compactifications of higher-dimensional theories of gravity.</description>
