      <title>Constraints on the perfect phylogeny mixture model and their effect on reducing degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perfect phylogeny mixture (PPM) model is useful due to its simplicity and applicability in scenarios where mutations can be assumed to accumulate monotonically over time. It is the underlying model in many tools that have been used, for example, to infer phylogenetic trees for tumor evolution and reconstruction. Unfortunately, the PPM model gives rise to substantial ambiguity -- in that many different phylogenetic trees can explain the same observed data -- even in the idealized setting where data are observed perfectly, i.e. fully and without noise. This ambiguity has been studied in this perfect setting by Pradhan et al. 2018, which proposed a procedure to bound the number of solutions given a fixed instance of observation data. Beyond this, studies have been primarily empirical. Recent work (Myers et al. 2019) proposed adding extra constraints to the PPM model to tackle ambiguity. In this paper, we first show that the extra constraints of Myers et al. 2019, called longitudinal constraints (LC), often fail to reduce the number of distinct trees that explain the observations. We then propose novel alternative constraints to limit solution ambiguity and study their impact when the data are observed perfectly. Unlike the analysis in Pradhan et al. 2018, our theoretical results regarding both the inefficacy of the LC and the extent to which our new constrains reduce ambiguity are not tied to a single observation instance. Rather, our theorems hold over large ensembles of possible inference problems. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study degeneracy in the PPM model in this ensemble-based theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>The tournament ratchet's clicktime process, and metastability in a Moran model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muller's ratchet, in its prototype version, models a haploid, asexual population whose size~$N$ is constant over the generations. Slightly deleterious mutations are acquired along the lineages at a constant rate, and individuals carrying less mutations have a selective advantage. In the classical variant, an individual's selective advantage is proportional to the difference between the population average and the individual's mutation load, whereas in the ratchet with {\em tournament selection} only the signs of the differences of the individual mutation loads matter. In a parameter regime which leads to slow clicking (i.e. to a loss of the currently fittest class at a rate $\ll 1/N$) we prove that the rescaled process of click times of the tournament ratchet converges as $N\to \infty$ to a Poisson process. Central ingredients in the proof are a thorough analysis of the metastable behaviour of a two-type Moran model with selection and deleterious mutation (which describes the size of the fittest class up to its extinction time) and a lower estimate on the size of the new fittest class at a clicktime.</description>

      <title>Binary Galton-Watson trees with mutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a multitype Galton-Watson process that allows for the mutation and reversion of individual types in discrete and continuous time. In this setting, we explicitly compute the time evolution of quantities such as the mean and distributions of different types. This allows us in particular to estimate the proportions of different types in the long run, as well as the distribution of the first time of occurrence of a given type as the tree size or time increases. Our approach relies on the recursive computation of the joint distribution of types conditionally to the value of the total progeny. In comparison with the literature on related multitype models, we do not rely on approximations.</description>

      <title>Quenched coalescent for diploid population models with selfing and overlapping generations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general diploid population model with self-fertilization and possible overlapping generations, and study the genealogy of a sample of $n$ genes as the population size $N$ tends to infinity. Unlike traditional approach in coalescent theory which considers the unconditional (annealed) law of the gene genealogies averaged over the population pedigree, here we study the conditional (quenched) law of gene genealogies given the pedigree. We focus on the case of high selfing probability and obtain that this conditional law converges to a random probability measure, given by the random law of a system of coalescing random walks on an exchangeable fragmentation-coalescence process of \cite{berestycki04}. This system contains the system of coalescing random walks on the ancestral recombination graph as a special case, and it sheds new light on the site-frequency spectrum (SFS) of genetic data by specifying how SFS depends on the pedigree. The convergence result is proved by means of a general characterization of weak convergence for random measures on the Skorokhod space with paths taking values in a locally compact Polish space.</description>
