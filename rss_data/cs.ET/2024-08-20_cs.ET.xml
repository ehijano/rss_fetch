      <title>The Chemputer and Chemputation: A Universal Chemical Compound Synthesis Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes a rigorous proof for the universality of the chemputer as a chemical synthesis machine, capable of constructing any stable and isolable molecule through a finite, expressible process. This process is governed by three key parameters: reagents, process conditions, and catalysts. Additionally, the study introduces dynamic error correction mechanisms integrated into each step of the synthesis pathway, ensuring real-time accuracy and reliability. The role of universally configurable hardware is also highlighted, with the introduction of a 'chempiling' function that translates synthesis pathways into executable hardware configurations. These advancements collectively demonstrate the chemputer's capability to perform any feasible chemical synthesis, thereby establishing it as a universal tool in chemical manufacturing and synthesis. I show that every finitely realizable chemical synthesis process that can exist within the bounds of physical laws can be perfectly instantiated and executed by a universal chemputer, provided that the process can be completed within the finite number of reagent input vessels, reaction vessels, and product output vessels available, and that the error correction mechanisms are sufficiently robust to maintain the accuracy of the synthesis within these constraints. Finally, I show that chemical reactions are not implicit functions, but are an emergent property coming from the combination of the reagents, process conditions, and catalysts.</description>

      <title>Experimental Characterization of Hydrodynamic Gating-Based Molecular Communication Transmitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) is a bio-inspired method of transmitting information using biochemical signals, promising for novel medical, agricultural, and environmental applications at the intersection of bio-, nano-, and communication technologies. Developing reliable MC systems for high-rate information transfer remains challenging due to the complex and dynamic nature of application environments and the physical and resource limitations of micro/nanoscale transmitters and receivers. Microfluidics can help overcome many such practical challenges by enabling testbeds that can replicate the application media with precise control over flow conditions. However, existing microfluidic MC testbeds face significant limitations in chemical signal generation with programmable signal waveforms, e.g., in terms of pulse width. To tackle this, we previously proposed a practical microfluidic MC transmitter architecture based on the hydrodynamic gating technique, a prevalent chemical waveform generation method. This paper reports the experimental validation and characterization of this method, examining its precision in terms of spatiotemporal control on the generated molecular concentration pulses. We detail the fabrication of the transmitter, its working mechanism and discuss its potential limitations based on empirical data. We show that the microfluidic transmitter is capable of providing precise, programmable, and reproducible molecular concentration pulses, which would facilitate the experimental research in MC.</description>

      <title>Experiment-based Models for Air Time and Current Consumption of LoRaWAN LR-FHSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long Range - Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (LR-FHSS) is an emerging and promising technology recently introduced into the LoRaWAN protocol specification for both terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks, notably satellites. The higher capacity, long-range and robustness to Doppler effect make LR-FHSS a primary candidate for direct-to-satellite (DtS) connectivity for enabling Internet-of-things (IoT) in remote areas. The LR-FHSS devices envisioned for DtS IoT will be primarily battery-powered. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the current consumption characteristics and Time-on-Air (ToA) of LR-FHSS technology. However, to our knowledge, no prior research has presented the accurate ToA and current consumption models for this newly introduced scheme. This paper addresses this shortcoming through extensive field measurements and the development of analytical models. Specifically, we have measured the current consumption and ToA for variable transmit power, message payload, and two new LR-FHSS-based Data Rates (DR8 and DR9). We also develop current consumption and ToA analytical models demonstrating a strong correlation with the measurement results exhibiting a relative error of less than 0.3%. Thus, it confirms the validity of our models. Conversely, the existing analytical models exhibit a higher relative error rate of -9.2 to 3.4% compared to our measurement results. The presented in this paper results can be further used for simulators or in analytical studies to accurately model the on-air time and energy consumption of LR-FHSS devices.</description>

      <title>Brain Inspired Probabilistic Occupancy Grid Mapping with Hyperdimensional Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time robotic systems require advanced perception, computation, and action capability. However, the main bottleneck in current autonomous systems is the trade-off between computational capability, energy efficiency and model determinism. World modeling, a key objective of many robotic systems, commonly uses occupancy grid mapping (OGM) as the first step towards building an end-to-end robotic system with perception, planning, autonomous maneuvering, and decision making capabilities. OGM divides the environment into discrete cells and assigns probability values to attributes such as occupancy and traversability. Existing methods fall into two categories: traditional methods and neural methods. Traditional methods rely on dense statistical calculations, while neural methods employ deep learning for probabilistic information processing. Recent works formulate a deterministic theory of neural computation at the intersection of cognitive science and vector symbolic architectures. In this study, we propose a Fourier-based hyperdimensional OGM system, VSA-OGM, combined with a novel application of Shannon entropy that retains the interpretability and stability of traditional methods along with the improved computational efficiency of neural methods. Our approach, validated across multiple datasets, achieves similar accuracy to covariant traditional methods while approximately reducing latency by 200x and memory by 1000x. Compared to invariant traditional methods, we see similar accuracy values while reducing latency by 3.7x. Moreover, we achieve 1.5x latency reductions compared to neural methods while eliminating the need for domain-specific model training.</description>

      <title>Establishment of a Blockchain-based Architecture for Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fake News are a contemporary phenomenon with potential devastating effects. For inquiry and auditability purposes, it is essential that the news, once classified as false, can be persisted in an immutable means so that interested parties can query it. Although Blockchain clearly satisfies the main requirements for Fake News Management Software Systems, the prescriptive architectural solutions for that domain that cohabit Blockchain with other technologies in a single proposal still need to be made available. This paper's main contribution is presenting a prescriptive architectural solution for blockchain-based fake news management software systems. The Hoffmeister process for software architecture design is systematically followed to culminate in a software solution for that domain. The implementation of two candidate architectures and a brief simulation-based evaluation show the feasibility of the solution to satisfy the functional and quality requirements.</description>

      <title>VRCopilot: Authoring 3D Layouts with Generative AI Models in VR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immersive authoring provides an intuitive medium for users to create 3D scenes via direct manipulation in Virtual Reality (VR). Recent advances in generative AI have enabled the automatic creation of realistic 3D layouts. However, it is unclear how capabilities of generative AI can be used in immersive authoring to support fluid interactions, user agency, and creativity. We introduce VRCopilot, a mixed-initiative system that integrates pre-trained generative AI models into immersive authoring to facilitate human-AI co-creation in VR. VRCopilot presents multimodal interactions to support rapid prototyping and iterations with AI, and intermediate representations such as wireframes to augment user controllability over the created content. Through a series of user studies, we evaluated the potential and challenges in manual, scaffolded, and automatic creation in immersive authoring. We found that scaffolded creation using wireframes enhanced the user agency compared to automatic creation. We also found that manual creation via multimodal specification offers the highest sense of creativity and agency.</description>

      <title>In-Memory Learning Automata Architecture using Y-Flash Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modern implementation of machine learning architectures faces significant challenges due to frequent data transfer between memory and processing units. In-memory computing, primarily through memristor-based analog computing, offers a promising solution to overcome this von Neumann bottleneck. In this technology, data processing and storage are located inside the memory. Here, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes floating-gate Y-Flash memristive devices manufactured with a standard 180 nm CMOS process. These devices offer attractive features, including analog tunability and moderate device-to-device variation; such characteristics are essential for reliable decision-making in ML applications. This paper uses a new machine learning algorithm, the Tsetlin Machine (TM), for in-memory processing architecture. The TM's learning element, Automaton, is mapped into a single Y-Flash cell, where the Automaton's range is transferred into the Y-Flash's conductance scope. Through comprehensive simulations, the proposed hardware implementation of the learning automata, particularly for Tsetlin machines, has demonstrated enhanced scalability and on-edge learning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Parameter Setting Heuristics Make the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm Suitable for the Early Fault-Tolerant Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most promising quantum heuristics for combinatorial optimization. While QAOA has been shown to perform well on small-scale instances and to provide an asymptotic speedup over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems, fault-tolerance is understood to be required to realize this speedup in practice. The low resource requirements of QAOA make it particularly suitable to benchmark on early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC) hardware. However, the performance of QAOA depends crucially on the choice of the free parameters in the circuit. The task of setting these parameters is complicated in the EFTQC era by the large overheads, which preclude extensive classical optimization. In this paper, we summarize recent advances in parameter setting in QAOA and show that these advancements make EFTQC experiments with QAOA practically viable.</description>

      <title>Towards the Information-Theoretic Limit of Programmable Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scalability of many programmable photonic circuits is limited by the $2\pi$ tuning range needed for the constituent phase shifters. To address this problem, we introduce the concept of a phase-efficient circuit architecture, where the average phase shift is $\ll 2\pi$. We derive a universal information-theoretic limit to the phase-shift efficiency of universal multiport interferometers, and propose a "3-MZI" architecture that approaches this limit to within a factor of $2\times$, approximately a $10\times$ reduction in average phase shift over the prior art, where the average phase shift scales inversely with system size as $O(1/\sqrt{N})$. For non-unitary circuits, we show that the 3-MZI saturates the theoretical bound for Gaussian-distributed target matrices. Using this architecture, we show optical neural network training with all phase shifters constrained to $\lesssim 0.2$ radians without loss of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Introducing a new hyper-parameter for RAG: Context Window Utilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new hyper-parameter for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems called Context Window Utilization. RAG systems enhance generative models by incorporating relevant information retrieved from external knowledge bases, improving the factual accuracy and contextual relevance of generated responses. The size of the text chunks retrieved and processed is a critical factor influencing RAG performance. This study aims to identify the optimal chunk size that maximizes answer generation quality. Through systematic experimentation, we analyze the effects of varying chunk sizes on the efficiency and effectiveness of RAG frameworks. Our findings reveal that an optimal chunk size balances the trade-off between providing sufficient context and minimizing irrelevant information. These insights are crucial for enhancing the design and implementation of RAG systems, underscoring the importance of selecting an appropriate chunk size to achieve superior performance.</description>

      <title>Reverse Map Projections as Equivariant Quantum Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the novel class $(E_\alpha)_{\alpha \in [-\infty,1)}$ of reverse map projection embeddings, each one defining a unique new method of encoding classical data into quantum states. Inspired by well-known map projections from the unit sphere onto its tangent planes, used in practice in cartography, these embeddings address the common drawback of the amplitude embedding method, wherein scalar multiples of data points are identified and information about the norm of data is lost.
  We show how reverse map projections can be utilised as equivariant embeddings for quantum machine learning. Using these methods, we can leverage symmetries in classical datasets to significantly strengthen performance on quantum machine learning tasks.
  Finally, we select four values of $\alpha$ with which to perform a simple classification task, taking $E_\alpha$ as the embedding and experimenting with both equivariant and non-equivariant setups. We compare their results alongside those of standard amplitude embedding.</description>
