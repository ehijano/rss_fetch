      <title>Numerical Analysis of Antenna Parameter Influence on Brightness Temperature in Medical Microwave Radiometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a study on the influence of antenna parameters in medical microwave radiometers on brightness temperature. A series of computational experiments was conducted to analyse the dependence of brightness temperature on antenna characteristics. Various antenna parameters and their effect on the distribution of electromagnetic fields in biological tissues were examined. It was demonstrated that considering the antenna mismatch parameter is crucial when modelling the brightness temperature of biological tissues, contributing about 2 percent to its formation. The depth range of brightness temperature measurement was determined. The dependence of brightness temperature on the antenna diameter and frequency was established. The findings of this study can be applied to improve medical microwave radiometers and enhance their efficiency in the early diagnosis of various diseases.</description>

      <title>Electrical and Mechanical Modeling of Uterine Contractions Analysis Using Connectivity Methods and Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Premature delivery is a leading cause of fetal death and morbidity, making the prediction and treatment of preterm contractions critical. The electrohysterographic (EHG) signal measures the electrical activity controlling uterine contraction. Analyzing EHG features can provide valuable insights for labor detection. In this paper, we propose a framework using simulated EHG signals to identify features sensitive to uterine connectivity. We focus on EHG signal propagation during delivery, recorded by multiple electrodes. Simulated EHG signals were generated using electrical diffusion (ED) and mechanotransduction (EDM) to identify which connectivity methods and graph parameters best represent uterine synchronization. The signals were simulated in two scenarios: using only ED by modifying tissue resistance, and using both ED and EDM by varying mechanotransduction model parameters. A matrix of 16 surface electrodes was used for the simulations. Our results show that a simplified electromechanical model can monitor uterine synchronization. Feature selection using Fscore on real and simulated EHG signals highlighted that the best features for detecting mechanotransduction shifts were H2 alone or combined with Str, R2(PR), and ICOH(Str). The best features for detecting electrical diffusion shifts were H2, Eff, PR, and BC.</description>

      <title>Novel Direct Alpha Spectroscopy Technique for $^{225}$Ac Radiopharmaceutical detection in Cancer Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Targeted alpha-particle therapy (TAT) employs alpha-emitting radionuclides conjugated to tumor-targeting molecules to deliver localized radiation to cancer cells, showing great promise in treating metastatic cancers. Among these radionuclides, Actinium-225 ($^{225}$Ac, t$_{1/2}$ = 9.9 days) has emerged as a clinically promising candidate. Its decay chain generates four successive alpha emissions, resulting in highly localized and effective cytotoxic damage to cancer cells when delivered to tumor sites. However, the assumption of complete retention of $^{225}$Ac and its radioactive daughters at these target sites is often inaccurate. The nuclear recoil effect can lead to off-target distribution and unintended toxicity.
  Our results revealed distinct spectral differences between radiolabeled cells and reference samples, demonstrating [$^{225}$Ac]Ac-crown-TATE uptake by AR42J cells. Detection of $^{213}$Po, one of the $^{225}$Ac decay daughters, highlighted partial retention and release of decay products from cells, providing information on intracellular retention and daughter redistribution. Geant4 simulations confirmed the alignment of experimental data with theoretical models, validating the method's accuracy. This study establishes a direct alpha spectroscopy approach for investigating $^{225}$Ac and its daughters' behavior in cells and offers a powerful tool for microdosimetry estimation.</description>

      <title>Energy-Threshold Bias Calculator: A Physics-Model Based Adaptive Correction Scheme for Photon-Counting CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon-counting detector based computed tomography (PCCT) has greatly advanced in recent years. However, the spectral inconsistency is still a serious challenge for PCCT that could directly introduce obvious artifacts and severe inaccuracies. This work attempts to overcome the challenge by modeling the spectral inconsistency in a novel, unified, and two-term factorized framework, with a spectral skew term independent of the energy threshold, and an energy-threshold bias analytical characterization term. To solve the spectral inconsistency, a two-step decomposition algorithm called energy-threshold bias calculator (ETB-Cal) is derived here, in which the spectral skew term is grossly determined at a relatively low energy threshold and only the energy-threshold bias is needed to be calculated as the energy threshold changes. After the two terms being computed out in calibration stage, they will be incorporated into our spectral model to generate the spectral correction vectors as well as the material decomposition vectors if needed, for PCCT projection data. To validate our method, both numerical simulations physics experiments were carried out on a tabletop PCCT system. Preliminary results showed that the spectral inconsistency can be significantly reduced, for example, with an non-uniformity quantitative indicators decreasing from 26.27 to 5.80 HU for Gammex multi-energy phantom and from 27.88 to 3.16 HU for kyoto head phantom. The considerable improvements consistently demonstrate a great potential of the proposed novel physics-model based correction scheme in practical applications, as computationally efficient, calibration-wise convenient with high degree of generality, and substantially avoiding the use of X-ray florescence material in the energy-threshold calibration.</description>

      <title>Miniaturized liquid metal composite circuits with energy harvesting coils for battery-free bioelectronics and optogenetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past years, rapid progress has been made on soft-matter electronics for wearable and implantable devices, for bioelectronics and optogenetics. Liquid Metal (LM) based electronics were especially popular, due to their long-term durability, when subject to repetitive strain cycles. However, one major limitation has been the need for tethering bioelectronics circuits to external power, or the use of rigid bulky batteries. This has motivated a growing interest in wireless energy transfer, which demands circuit miniaturization. However, miniaturization of LM circuits is challenging due to low LM-substrate adhesion, LM smearing, and challenges on microchip-interfacing. In this article, we address these challenges by high-resolution laser-assisted micropatterning of biphasic LM composites and vapor-assisted LM microchip soldering. Through development of a search algorithm for optimization of the biphasic ink coil performance, we designed and implemented micro coils with trace spacing of 50 {\mu}m that can harvest a significant amount of energy (178 mW/cm2) through near field inductive coupling. We show miniaturized soft-matter circuits with integrated SMD chips such as NFC chips, capacitors, and LEDs that are implemented in a few minutes through laser patterning, and vaporassisted soldering. In the context of optogenetics, where lightweight, miniaturized systems are needed to provide optical stimulation, soft coils stand out in terms of their improved conformability and flexibility. Thus, this article explores the applications of soft coils in wearable and implantable devices, with a specific focus on their use in optogenetics.</description>

      <title>In Vivo Study of Bone Growth Around Additively Manufactured Implants with Ti-6Al-4V and Bioactive Glass Powder Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Osseointegration is crucial to the success of biomedical implants. Additive manufacturing of implants offers a high degree of design freedom, enabling precise control over implant geometry and material composition. Bioactive glass (BG) can substantially enhance bone binding and bioactivity; however, limited research has been conducted on its incorporation into additively manufactured implants. The performance of BG varies depending on the incorporation method, and the spatial and temporal evolution of its integration remains unclear. In this study, we synthesized Ti-6Al-4V/58S BG composites by using the selective laser melting method and systematically compared the effects of BG coating and doping in additively manufactured implants. In vivo histological results from animal tests were statistically analyzed and discussed in terms of osseointegration over 4- and 12-week periods. Bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and bone density (BD) were used as quantitative metrics to evaluate interactions between the implants and surrounding bone. Our findings indicate that both BG-doped and BG-coated implants accelerated bone ingrowth during the early stages of healing. BG-coated implants demonstrated a greater improvement than did pure 3D-printed Ti-6Al-4V implants. However, the effects of BG became nonsignificant during the later healing stage (12 weeks). This study provides a foundation for systematically investigating BG incorporation methods in 3D-printed biomedical implants and their effect on osseointegration.</description>

      <title>Self-Calibrated Epipolar Reconstruction for Assessment of Aneurysms in the Internal Carotid Artery Using In-Silico Biplane Angiograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The treatment of intracranial aneurysms (IA) relies on angiography guidance using biplane views. However, accurate flow estimation and device sizing for treatment are often compromised by vessel overlap and foreshortening, which can obscure critical details. This study introduces an epipolar reconstruction approach to enhance 3D rendering of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and aneurysm dome using routinely acquired biplane angiographic data. Our method aims to improve procedural guidance by overcoming the limitations of traditional two-dimensional imaging techniques. This study employed three 3D geometries of ICA aneurysms to simulate virtual angiograms. These angiograms were generated using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver, followed by the simulation of biplane angiography using a cone-beam geometry. Self-calibration was accomplished by matching contrast media position as a function of time between biplane views. Feature-matching was used to triangulate and reconstruct vascular structures in 3D. The projection data was utilized to refine the 3D estimation, including elimination of erroneous structures and ellipse-fitting. The accuracy of the reconstructions was evaluated using the Dice-Sorensen coefficient, comparing the 3D reconstructions to the original models. The proposed epipolar reconstruction method generalized well across the three tested aneurysm models, with respective Dice-Sorensen coefficients of 0.745, 0.759, and 0.654. Errors were primarily due to partial vessel overlap. The average reconstruction time for all three volumes was approximately 10 seconds. The proposed epipolar reconstruction method enhanced 3D visualization, addressing challenges such as projection-induced vessel foreshortening. This method provides a solution to the complexity of IA visualization, with the potential to provide more accurate analysis and device sizing for treatment.</description>

      <title>Developing an Agent-Based Mathematical Model for Simulating Post-Irradiation Cellular Response: A Crucial Component of a Digital Twin Framework for Personalized Radiation Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present the Physical-Bio Translator, an agent-based simulation model designed to simulate cellular responses following irradiation. This simulation framework is based on a novel cell-state transition model that accurately reflects the characteristics of irradiated cells. To validate the Physical-Bio Translator, we performed simulations of cell phase evolution, cell phenotype evolution, and cell survival. The results indicate that the Physical-Bio Translator effectively replicates experimental cell irradiation outcomes, suggesting that digital cell irradiation experiments can be conducted via computer simulation, offering a more sophisticated model for radiation biology. This work lays the foundation for developing a robust and versatile digital twin at multicellular or tissue scales, aiming to comprehensively study and predict patient responses to radiation therapy.</description>

      <title>Joint Reconstruction and Motion Estimation in Sparse-View 4DCT Using Diffusion Models within a Blind Inverse Problem Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) is essential for medical imaging applications like radiotherapy, which demand precise respiratory motion representation. Traditional methods for reconstructing 4DCT data suffer from artifacts and noise, especially in sparse-view, low-dose contexts. We propose a novel framework that integrates motion correction and diffusion models (DMs) within a blind inverse problem formulation. By leveraging prior probability distributions from DMs, we enhance the joint reconstruction and motion estimation process, improving image quality and preserving resolution. Experiments on extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantom data demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques, yielding artifact-free, high-resolution reconstructions even under irregular breathing conditions. These results showcase the potential of combining DMs with motion correction to advance sparse-view 4DCT imaging.</description>

      <title>Deformable Image Registration of Dark-Field Chest Radiographs for Local Lung Signal Change Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark-field radiography of the human chest has been demonstrated to have promising potential for the analysis of the lung microstructure and the diagnosis of respiratory diseases. However, previous studies of dark-field chest radiographs evaluated the lung signal only in the inspiratory breathing state. Our work aims to add a new perspective to these previous assessments by locally comparing dark-field lung information between different respiratory states. To this end, we discuss suitable image registration methods for dark-field chest radiographs to enable consistent spatial alignment of the lung in distinct breathing states. Utilizing full inspiration and expiration scans from a clinical chronic obstructive pulmonary disease study, we assess the performance of the proposed registration framework and outline applicable evaluation approaches. Our regional characterization of lung dark-field signal changes between the breathing states provides a proof-of-principle that dynamic radiography-based lung function assessment approaches may benefit from considering registered dark-field images in addition to standard plain chest radiographs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systemic drug administration often causes off-target effects limiting the efficacy of advanced therapies. Targeted drug delivery approaches increase local drug concentrations at the diseased site while minimizing systemic drug exposure. We present a magnetically guided microrobotic drug delivery system capable of precise navigation under physiological conditions. This platform integrates a clinical electromagnetic navigation system, a custom-designed release catheter, and a dissolvable capsule for accurate therapeutic delivery. In vitro tests showed precise navigation in human vasculature models, and in vivo experiments confirmed tracking under fluoroscopy and successful navigation in large animal models. The microrobot balances magnetic material concentration, contrast agent loading, and therapeutic drug capacity, enabling effective hosting of therapeutics despite the integration complexity of its components, offering a promising solution for precise targeted drug delivery.</description>

      <title>Unified 3D MRI Representations via Sequence-Invariant Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised deep learning has accelerated 2D natural image analysis but remains difficult to translate into 3D MRI, where data are scarce and pre-trained 2D backbones cannot capture volumetric context. We present a sequence-invariant self-supervised framework leveraging quantitative MRI (qMRI). By simulating multiple MRI contrasts from a single 3D qMRI scan and enforcing consistent representations across these contrasts, we learn anatomy-centric rather than sequence-specific features. This yields a robust 3D encoder that performs strongly across varied tasks and protocols. Experiments on healthy brain segmentation (IXI), stroke lesion segmentation (ARC), and MRI denoising show significant gains over baseline SSL approaches, especially in low-data settings (up to +8.3% Dice, +4.2 dB PSNR). Our model also generalises effectively to unseen sites, demonstrating potential for more scalable and clinically reliable volumetric analysis. All code and trained models are publicly available.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the application of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as a diagnostic tool for myasthenia gravis, a severe neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue. Blood serum samples were analyzed using SERS substrates embedded with 5 nm gold nanoparticles, resulting in significant Raman signal enhancement and the detection of disease-specific spectral features. The study demonstrates the potential of SERS to identify subtle biochemical changes associated with oxidative stress and altered molecular composition in serum, providing a sensitive and non-invasive approach for diagnosis.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo simulation framework for investigating the effect of inter-track coupling on H$_2$O$_2$ productions at ultra-high dose rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Lower production of H$_2$O$_2$ in water is a hallmark of ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) compared to the conventional dose rate (CDR). However, the current computational models based on the predicted yield of H$_2$O$_2$ are in opposite of the experimental data. Methods: We construct an analytical model for the rate equation in the production of H$_2$O$_2$ from \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals and use it as a guide to propose a hypothetical geometrical inhomogeneity in the configuration of particles in the FLASH-UHDR beams. We perform a series of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the track structures for a system of charged particles impinging the medium in the form of clusters and/or bunches. Results: We demonstrate the interplay of diffusion, reaction rates, and overlaps in track-spacing attribute to a lower yield of H$_2$O$_2$ at FLASH-UHDR vs. CDR. This trend is reversed if spacing among the tracks becomes larger than a critical value, with a length scale that is proportional to the diffusion length of \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals modulated by a rate of decay due to recombination with other species, available within a track, and the space among the tracks. The latter is substantial on the suppressing of the H$_2$O$_2$ population at FLASH-UHDR relative to CDR. Conclusions: Based on our analysis of the present work, at FLASH-UHDR, the lower yield in H$_2$O$_2$ can be interpreted as a signature of bunching the particles in beams of ionizing radiation. The beams enter the medium in closely packed clusters and form inhomogeneities in the track-structure distribution. Thus the MC simulations based on the assumption of uniformly distributed tracks are unable to explain the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Reproducibility Made Easy: A Tool for Methodological Transparency and Efficient Standardized Reporting based on the proposed MRSinMRS Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent expert consensus found that non-standard reporting in MRS studies led to poor reproducibility. In order to address this, MRSinMRS guidelines were introduced; however, because of the disparate nomenclature and data formats, adoption has been slow. To get around this problem, REMY, a toolbox that supports major vendor formats, was created. By efficiently filling in important fields in the MRSinMRS table, it improves reproducibility. Even with certain hardware-related restrictions, REMY makes a substantial contribution to the completion of acquisition parameters, which facilitates reporting. Its compatibility and user-friendly interface should promote widespread adoption of MRSinMRS, raising the caliber of MRS research.</description>

      <title>First Pilot Tests of Compton Imaging and Boron Concentration Measurements in BNCT Using i-TED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dosimetry in BNCT poses significant challenges due to the indirect effect of neutrons interacting with elements within the body and uncertainties associated with the uptake of boron compounds used in clinical practice. Current treatment planning relies on unconventional estimates of boron tumor uptake derived from prior PET scans and thus, an online boron-uptake monitor would be highly convenient. This work presents the first pilot experiments carried out at ILL-Grenoble with the high-efficiency Compton camera i-TED, hereby aiming at demonstrating its applicability for BNCT dosimetry by introducing real-time measurement of the boron concentration and imaging capabilities of spatial dose distribution. In this experiment, we measured the $^{10}$B uptake of different cancer cells of tongue squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma and glioblastoma treated with BPA (80~ppm of $^{10}$B). The samples were irradiated with the thermal neutron spectrum of ILL-Grenoble and the 478keV $\gamma$-rays from the $^{7}$Li de-excitation after the neutron-boron reaction were registered both with the Compton imager and the high-sensitivity FIPPS HPGe array. These series of measurements allowed us to demonstrate the imaging capabilities of the Compton imaging device for the 478 keV $\gamma$-rays of interest for dosimetry in BNCT, as well as to assess its sensitivity, which was found to be below 1 $\mu$g of $^{10}$B.</description>

      <title>A recent evaluation on the performance of LLMs on radiation oncology physics using questions of randomly shuffled options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: We present an updated study evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) in answering radiation oncology physics questions, focusing on the recently released models.
  Methods: A set of 100 multiple-choice radiation oncology physics questions, previously created by a well-experienced physicist, was used for this study. The answer options of the questions were randomly shuffled to create "new" exam sets. Five LLMs -- OpenAI o1-preview, GPT-4o, LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet -- with the versions released before September 30, 2024, were queried using these new exam sets. To evaluate their deductive reasoning ability, the correct answer options in the questions were replaced with "None of the above." Then, the explain-first and step-by-step instruction prompts were used to test if this strategy improved their reasoning ability. The performance of the LLMs was compared with the answers from medical physicists.
  Results: All models demonstrated expert-level performance on these questions, with o1-preview even surpassing medical physicists with a majority vote. When replacing the correct answer options with 'None of the above', all models exhibited a considerable decline in performance, suggesting room for improvement. The explain-first and step-by-step instruction prompts helped enhance the reasoning ability of the LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet models.
  Conclusion: These recently released LLMs demonstrated expert-level performance in answering radiation oncology physics questions, exhibiting great potential to assist in radiation oncology physics education and training.</description>

      <title>Ultrasonic Medical Tissue Imaging Using Probabilistic Inversion: Leveraging Variational Inference for Speed Reconstruction and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a promising technique for achieving high-resolution imaging in medical ultrasound. Traditional FWI methods suffer from issues related to computational efficiency, dependence on initial models, and the inability to quantify uncertainty. This study introduces the Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm into FWI, aiming to improve inversion performance and enhance uncertainty quantification. By deriving the posterior gradient, the study explores the integration of SVGD with FWI and demonstrates its ability to approximate complex priors. In-silico experiments with synthetic data and real-world breast tissue data highlight the advantages of the SVGD-based framework over conventional FWI. SVGD-based FWI improves inversion quality, provides more reliable uncertainty quantification, and offers a tighter bound for the prior distribution. These findings show that probabilistic inversion is a promising tool for addressing the limitations of traditional FWI methods in ultrasonic imaging of medical tissues.</description>

      <title>Multi-Branch Generative Models for Multichannel Imaging with an Application to PET/CT Synergistic Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08748v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for learned synergistic reconstruction of medical images using multi-branch generative models. Leveraging variational autoencoders (VAEs), our model learns from pairs of images simultaneously, enabling effective denoising and reconstruction. Synergistic image reconstruction is achieved by incorporating the trained models in a regularizer that evaluates the distance between the images and the model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on both Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) datasets, showcasing improved image quality for low-dose imaging. Despite challenges such as patch decomposition and model limitations, our results underscore the potential of generative models for enhancing medical imaging reconstruction.</description>
