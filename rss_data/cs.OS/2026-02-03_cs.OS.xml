      <title>Reexamining Paradigms of End-to-End Data Movement</title>

Abstract: The pursuit of high-performance data transfer often focuses on raw network bandwidth, where international links of 100 Gbps or higher are frequently considered the primary enabler. While necessary, this network-centric view is incomplete. It equates provisioned link speeds with practical, sustainable data movement capabilities. It is a common observation that lower-than-desired data rates manifest even on 10 Gbps links and commodity hardware, with higher-speed networks only amplifying their visibility. We investigate six paradigms -- from network latency and TCP congestion control to host-side factors such as CPU performance and virtualization -- that critically impact data movement workflows. These paradigms represent widely accepted engineering assumptions that inform system design, procurement decisions, and operational practices in production data movement environments. We introduce the Drainage Basin Pattern conceptual model for reasoning about end-to-end data flow constraints across heterogeneous hardware and software components at varying desired data rates to address the fidelity gap between raw bandwidth and application-level throughput. Our findings are validated through rigorous production-scale deployments, from 10 Gbps links to U.S. DOE ESnet technical evaluations and transcontinental production trials over 100 Gbps operational links. The results demonstrate that principal bottlenecks often reside outside the network core, and that a holistic hardware-software co-design enables consistent, predictable performance for moving data at scale and speed.</description>
