      <title>Egalitarian-equivalent and strategy-proof mechanisms in homogeneous multi-object allocation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of allocating homogeneous and indivisible objects among agents with money. In particular, we investigate the relationship between egalitarian-equivalence (Pazner and Schmeidler, 1978), as a fairness concept, and efficiency under agents' incentive constraints. As a first result, we characterize the class of mechanisms that satisfy egalitarian-equivalence, strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and no subsidy. Our characterization reveals a strong tension between egalitarian-equivalence and efficiency: under these properties, the mechanisms allocate objects only in limited cases. To address this limitation, we replace strategy-proofness with the weaker incentive property, non-obvious manipulability (Troyan and Morrill, 2020). We show that this relaxation allows us to design mechanisms that achieve efficiency while still ensuring egalitarian-equivalence. Furthermore, upon achieving efficiency, we identify the agent optimal mechanism in the characterized class.</description>

      <title>Contracting a crowd of heterogeneous agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a principal-agent model involving a large population of heterogeneously interacting agents. By extending the existing methods, we find the optimal contracts assuming a continuum of agents, and show that, when the number of agents is sufficiently large, the optimal contracts for the problem with a continuum of agents are near-optimal for the finite agents problem. We make comparative statistics and provide numerical simulations to analyze how the agents' connectivity affects the principal's value, the effort of the agents, and the optimal contracts.</description>

      <title>On Probabilistic Assignment Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the classical assignment problem with initial endowments in a probabilistic framework. In this setting, each agent initially owns an object and has strict preferences over the entire set of objects, and the goal is to reassign objects in a way that satisfies desirable properties such as strategy-proofness, Pareto efficiency, and individual rationality. While the celebrated result by Ma (1994) shows that the Top Trading Cycles (TTC) rule is the unique deterministic rule satisfying these properties, similar positive results are scarce in the probabilistic domain. We extend Ma's result in the probabilistic setting, and as desirable properties, consider SD-efficiency, SD-individual rationality, and a weaker notion of SD-strategy-proofness -- SD-top-strategy-proofness -- which only requires agents to have no incentive to misreport if doing so increases the probability of receiving their top-ranked object. We show that under deterministic endowments, a probabilistic rule is SD-efficient, SD-individually rational, and SD-top-strategy-proof if and only if it coincides with the TTC rule. Our result highlights a positive possibility in the face of earlier impossibility results for fractional endowments (Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011)) and provides a first step toward reconciling desirable properties in probabilistic assignments with endowments.</description>

      <title>On the existence of EFX allocations for goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a set $E$ of $m$ indivisible goods and a set $N$ consisting of $n \geq 2$ agents. The paper shows that if two agents have \textit{arbitrary} set monotonic valuation functions and the remaining agents have size monotonic valuation functions, then EFX allocations always exist.</description>

      <title>A Folk Theorem for Indefinitely Repeated Network Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a repeated game in which players, considered as nodes of a network, are connected. Each player observes her neighbors' moves only. Thus, monitoring is private and imperfect. Players can communicate with their neighbors at each stage; each player, for any subset of her neighbors, sends the same message to any player of that subset. Thus, communication is local and both public and private. Both communication and monitoring structures are given by the network. The solution concept is perfect Bayesian equilibrium. In this paper we show that a folk theorem holds if and only if the network is 2-connected for any number of players.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning to Trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can players sustain long-run trust when their equilibrium beliefs are shaped by machine-learning methods that penalize complexity? I study a game in which an infinite sequence of agents with one-period recall decides whether to place trust in their immediate successor. The cost of trusting is state-dependent. Each player's best response is based on a belief about others' behavior, which is a coarse fit of the true population strategy with respect to a partition of relevant contingencies. In equilibrium, this partition minimizes the sum of the mean squared prediction error and a complexity penalty proportional to its size. Relative to symmetric mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, this solution concept significantly narrows the scope for trust.</description>

      <title>Networked Information Aggregation via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a distributed learning problem in which learning agents are embedded in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). There is a fixed and arbitrary distribution over feature/label pairs, and each agent or vertex in the graph is able to directly observe only a subset of the features -- potentially a different subset for every agent. The agents learn sequentially in some order consistent with a topological sort of the DAG, committing to a model mapping observations to predictions of the real-valued label. Each agent observes the predictions of their parents in the DAG, and trains their model using both the features of the instance that they directly observe, and the predictions of their parents as additional features. We ask when this process is sufficient to achieve \emph{information aggregation}, in the sense that some agent in the DAG is able to learn a model whose error is competitive with the best model that could have been learned (in some hypothesis class) with direct access to \emph{all} features, despite the fact that no single agent in the network has such access. We give upper and lower bounds for this problem for both linear and general hypothesis classes. Our results identify the \emph{depth} of the DAG as the key parameter: information aggregation can occur over sufficiently long paths in the DAG, assuming that all of the relevant features are well represented along the path, and there are distributions over which information aggregation cannot occur even in the linear case, and even in arbitrarily large DAGs that do not have sufficient depth (such as a hub-and-spokes topology in which the spoke vertices collectively see all the features). We complement our theoretical results with a comprehensive set of experiments.</description>

      <title>On Gale's Contribution in Revealed Preference Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Gale's important paper published in 1960. This paper contains an example of a candidate of the demand function that satisfies the weak axiom of revealed preference and that is doubtful that it is a demand function of some weak order. We examine this paper and first scrutinize what Gale proved. Then we identify a gap in Gale's proof and show that he failed to show that this candidate of the demand function is not a demand function. Next, we present three complete proofs of Gale's claim. First, we construct a proof that was constructible in 1960 by a fact that Gale himself demonstrated. Second, we construct a modern and simple proof using Shephard's lemma. Third, we construct a proof that follows the direction that Gale originally conceived. Our conclusion is as follows: although, in 1960, Gale was not able to prove that the candidate of the demand function that he constructed is not a demand function, he substantially proved it, and therefore it is fair to say that the credit for finding a candidate of the demand function that satisfies the weak axiom but is not a demand function is attributed to Gale.</description>

      <title>Experiments in the Linear Convex Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06530v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes two rankings of statistical experiments using the linear convex order. These rankings hold in a broader set of scenarios where intuition suggests that one experiment is more informative than another, and provide more tractable characterizations than Blackwell order, which relies on the convex order. We apply these rankings to compare statistical experiments in binary-action decision problems and in decision problems that aggregate payoffs over a collection of binary-action decision problems. Furthermore, these rankings enable comparisons of statistical experiments in moral hazard problems without requiring the validity of the first-order approach, thereby complementing the results in Holmstr\"om (1979) and Kim (1995).</description>

      <title>It's Not All Black and White: Degree of Truthfulness for Risk-Avoiding Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classic notion of \emph{truthfulness} requires that no agent has a profitable manipulation -- an untruthful report that, for \emph{some} combination of reports of the other agents, increases her utility. This strong notion implicitly assumes that the manipulating agent either knows what all other agents are going to report, or is willing to take the risk and act as-if she knows their reports.
  Without knowledge of the others' reports, most manipulations are \emph{risky} -- they might decrease the manipulator's utility for some other combinations of reports by the other agents. Accordingly, a recent paper (Bu, Song and Tao, ``On the existence of truthful fair cake cutting mechanisms'', Artificial Intelligence 319 (2023), 103904) suggests a relaxed notion, which we refer to as \emph{risk-avoiding truthfulness (RAT)}, which requires only that no agent can gain from a \emph{safe} manipulation -- one that is sometimes beneficial and never harmful.
  Truthfulness and RAT are two extremes: the former considers manipulators with complete knowledge of others, whereas the latter considers manipulators with no knowledge at all. In reality, agents often know about some -- but not all -- of the other agents. This paper introduces the \emph{RAT-degree} of a mechanism, defined as the smallest number of agents whose reports, if known, may allow another agent to safely manipulate, or $n$ if there is no such number. This notion interpolates between classic truthfulness (degree $n$) and RAT (degree at least $1$): a mechanism with a higher RAT-degree is harder to manipulate safely.
  To illustrate the generality and applicability of this concept, we analyze the RAT-degree of prominent mechanisms across various social choice settings, including auctions, indivisible goods allocations, cake-cutting, voting, and two-sided matching.</description>

Abstract: We prove that any optimal, independent, and zero unanimous fuzzy classification aggregation function of a continuum of individual classifications of $m\ge 3$ objects into $2\le p\le m$ types must be a weighted arithmetic mean. We also provide a characterization for the case when $m=p=2$.</description>
