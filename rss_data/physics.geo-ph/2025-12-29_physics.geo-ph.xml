      <title>Numerical simulation of lunar response to gravitational waves and its 3D topographic effect using the spectral-element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Moon has been regarded as a natural Weber bar capable of amplifying gravitational waves (GWs) for detecting events across a wide range of frequencies. However, accurately determining the amplification effects remains challenging due to the absence of 3D numerical simulation methods. In this study, we develop a high-order 3D finite element method (spectral-element method, SEM) to numerically simulate the lunar response to GWs below 20 mHz. We verify the accuracy of our method by comparing the resonant peaks of our results with those from semi-analytical solutions and find that the frequency deviation is less than 3% for the first peak at about 1 mHz and less than 0.8% for the subsequent peaks up to 10 mHz. Using this method, we evaluate the amplification of GW signals due to 3D topographic effects of the Moon, and we find enhancements at a series of specific frequency components. These results highlight the non-negligible effect of surface topography on the lunar response to GWs, as a fundamental factor that holds significant implications across both global and regional analyses. Our work paves the way for a comprehensive evaluation of the Moon's resonant response to GWs, helpful for the strategic planning of lunar GW detections.</description>

      <title>Impact of the sodium and calcium chlorides uptake on the interfacial behavior of ice: premelting, structure, and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypothesis: Seawater ice and frozen aqueous solutions in contact with air can exhibit a thin quasi-brine surface layer intruding between ice and vapor, but a detailed characterization of surface properties and its relation to three phase coexistence has been lacking. Using thermodynamic arguments we show how it is possible to characterize the surface layers by comparison to the three phase ice-brine-air bulk phase diagram, despite the difficulty to control or monitor all of the relevant thermodynamic fields of the two component system.
  Simulations: We performed computer simulations of surface briny layers of sodium and calcium chloride adsorbed on ice. Using suitable order parameters and a rigorous geometrical dividing surface, we are able to characterize the layer's thermodynamic state, measure its properties and relate them to the corresponding properties of the bulk solution.
  Results: Our results confirm that undersaturated briny surface layers can form down to the eutectic point, with a maximum concentration that is bound by the liquidus line of the ice-brine phase diagram. Such layers are distinct from finite size realizations of three phase coexistence, and can be regarded as genuine surface states, but their salt content can increase the premelting layer thickness by a factor of two or more. Owing to this significant thickness, these layers can be related to bulk electrolyte solutions of similar concentration, both as regards the structural organization of ions and the dynamical properties of the quasi-liquid film.</description>

      <title>Flow morphology and patterns in porous media convection: A persistent homology analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convective mixing in porous media is crucial in both geophysical and industrial fields, spanning applications ranging from carbon dioxide sequestration to contaminant transport in groundwater. Key processes are affected by convective heat transport or diffusion of chemical species in porous formations. Intense convection flow and mixing create complex, dynamic patterns that are difficult to predict and measure. The present work focuses on the use of topological data analysis, in particular, the measures emerging from the growing field of persistent homology (PH), to quantify these patterns. These measures are objective and quantify structures across all temperature or concentration values simultaneously. These techniques, when applied to classical porous media setups, such as one-sided and Rayleigh-B\'enard flow configurations, provide new insights into the system's structure, flow patterns, and macroscopic mixing properties. Using large datasets we make publicly available, comprising original simulations as well as those presented in previous works, we correlate the behaviour of the heat transport rate (quantified by the Nusselt number) with the evolution of the flow structures (quantified by the PH measures). Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of the flow evolution over a wide range of governing parameters, namely the Rayleigh-Darcy number and the domain size.</description>

      <title>Jacobi's solution for geodesics on a triaxial ellipsoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On Boxing Day, 1838, Jacobi found a solution to the problem of geodesics on a triaxial ellipsoid, with the course of the geodesic and the distance along it given in terms of one-dimensional integrals. Here, a numerical implementation of this solution is described. This entails accurately evaluating the integrals and solving the resulting coupled system of equations. The inverse problem, finding the shortest path between two points on the ellipsoid, can then be solved using a similar method as for biaxial ellipsoids.</description>
