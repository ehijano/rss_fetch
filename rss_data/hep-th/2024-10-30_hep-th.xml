      <title>Holographic Complexity in String and M Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thus far, the literature regarding holographic complexity almost entirely focuses on the context of $(d+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime rather than the full higher-dimensional gauge/gravity duality in string or M theory. We provide a framework to study holographic complexity in the full duality, explaining the relation of complexity functionals in the higher-dimensional theory to those in anti-de Sitter spacetime and when complexity functionals can apply universally to gauge/gravity dualities rather than a specific dual pair. We also show that gauge invariance constrains boundary terms for complexity functionals, using the ten- and eleven-dimensional supergravity actions as key examples. Finally, we propose new universal complexity functionals following these considerations, including a revised gauge-invariant action complexity.</description>

      <title>Morse-Bott inequalities, Topology Change and Cobordisms to Nothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cobordism Conjecture predicts spacetime-ending configurations, such as Bubbles of Nothing (BoN), being commonplace. These correspond to vacuum decays in which the compactification manifold $\mathcal{C}_n$ shrinks to a point, with the instability expanding at the speed of light and leaving nothing (not even spacetime) behind. Most constructions of BoN or cobordisms to nothing found in the literature feature simple instances of $\mathcal{C}_n$ or singular cobordisms, which cannot be approached from the effective field theory. Assuming the solution mediating such decay to nothing is homeomorphic to a smooth description, we are able to go a step further, and obtain topological bounds on its homology for generic $\mathcal{C}_n$. Through the use of Morse-Bott theory we then translate this into information on the number and types of topology changes the compact manifold experiences as we move towards the tip of the bordism, as well as the location of possible cobordism defects. We illustrate our results with different detailed examples coming from String Theory. Furthermore, with this approach, we are able to study more complicated arrangements such as BoN collisions or intersection of End of the World branes.</description>

      <title>Spherical Branes and the BMN Matrix Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on $S^d$ using supersymmetric localisation and holography. We argue that the analytic continuation in dimension to $d=1$ yields a Euclidean version of the BMN matrix quantum mechanics. This system can be analysed at large $N$ using supersymmetric localisation and leads to explicit results for the free energy on $S^d$ and the expectation value of supersymmetric Wilson loops. We show how these results can be reproduced at strong gauge coupling using holography by employing spherical D-brane solutions. We construct these solutions for any value of $d$ using an effective supergravity description and pay particular attention to the subtleties arising in the $d\to1$ limit. Our results have implications for the BMN matrix quantum mechanics and the physics of circular D0-branes.</description>

      <title>What is the Geometry of Effective Field Theories?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate on a recently proposed geometric framework for scalar effective field theories. Starting from the action, a metric can be identified that enables the construction of geometric quantities on the associated functional manifold. These objects transform covariantly under general field redefinitions that relate different operator bases, including those involving derivatives. We present a novel geometric formula for the amplitudes of the theory, where the vertices in Feynman diagrams are replaced by their geometrized counterparts. This makes the on-shell covariance of amplitudes manifest, providing the link between functional geometry and effective field theories.</description>

      <title>Monopole-vortex continuity of ${\mathcal N}=1$ super Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb{R}^2 \times S^1 \times S^1$ with 't Hooft twist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ${\mathcal N} = 1$ $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory on $\mathbb{R}^2\times (S^1)_3\times (S^1)_4$ with the 't Hooft twist. The theory becomes weakly coupled if the length $L_4$ of $(S^1)_4$ is sufficiently small, $NL_4\Lambda\ll 1$. We explore the nonperturbative dynamics at the weak-coupling regime by changing the size of $L_3$ and uncover how $3$d monopole/bion-based effective theory for $L_3\gg L_4$ is related to the $2$d vortex-based theory for $L_3\approx L_4$. The highlights of our results are (1) the smooth ``weak-weak" continuity of the vacuum structure and gluino condensate during the $3$d-$2$d dimensional reduction, (2) the crossover of Wilson loop behavior from the area law in $3$d to the perimeter law in $2$d via a ``double-string" picture, (3) the role of mass deformation in breaking discrete chiral symmetry and restoring the area law in $2$d, and (4) the microscopic investigation of bions during the reduction from $3$d to $2$d and the cancellation of the vacuum energy due to the hidden topological angle. We also discuss the generalization of our results for (1)--(3) from $\mathcal{N}=1$ SYM to QCD with adjoint quarks.</description>

      <title>Field Space Geometry and Nonlinear Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a geometric formulation of effective field theories via nonlinear supersymmetry. Non-supersymmetric particles are embedded in constrained superfields governed by a nonlinear sigma model, and operators are collected into potentials on the target space. The use of chiral superfields standardizes the treatment of flavor across scalars and fermions, and the minimal jet bundle extension makes invariance under derivative field redefinitions manifest.</description>

      <title>Bulk quantum corrections to entwinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine $1/N$ corrections to a notion of generalized entanglement entropy known as entwinement dual to the length of a winding geodesic in asymptotically AdS$_3$ geometries. We explain how $1/N$ corrections can be computed formally via the FLM formula by relating entwinement to an ordinary entanglement entropy in a fictitious covering space. Moreover, we explicitly compute $1/N$ corrections to entwinement for thermal states and small winding numbers using a monodromy method to determine the corrections to the dominant conformal block for the replica partition function. We also determine a set of universal corrections at finite temperature for large winding numbers. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the "entanglement builds geometry" proposal.</description>

      <title>Physical Running in Conformal Gravity and Higher Derivative Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the physical running of a general higher derivative scalar coupled to a nondynamical metric and of higher derivative Weyl invariant gravity with a dynamical metric in four dimensions. In both cases, we find that the physical running differs from the $\mu$-running of dimensional regularization because of infrared divergences which are present in amplitudes also at large momenta, differently from what happens in standard two derivative theories. We use the higher derivative scalar as a toy-model to elaborate on the properties of the conformal limit in relation to the trace anomaly. The physical running of higher derivative Weyl gravity, while different from the $\mu$-running, remains asymptotically free, suggesting that the model is a viable completion of Einstein's gravity, at least from the point of view of its renormalization group properties.</description>

      <title>What is the graviton pole made of?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the physical mechanisms responsible for generating the graviton pole in twice-subtracted dispersion relations, both in flat space and in AdS. To characterize these mechanisms, we analyze the energy scale at which the graviton pole is generated in scattering experiments at various impact parameters. At large impact parameters, we identify the eikonal model of high-energy gravitational scattering as a universal mechanism that generates the graviton pole in dispersion relations. At smaller impact parameters, the graviton pole can arise from stringy higher-spin resonances. The length scale at which the graviton pole generation scale departs from its semiclassical eikonal value indicates the breakdown of gravitational EFT. In flat space, we derive a Tauberian theorem for the graviton pole, which must be satisfied by any UV completion of gravity that admits twice-subtracted dispersion relations. In AdS, free or non-holographic CFTs offer an alternative mechanism to generate the graviton pole. More broadly, we find that the existing picture of high-energy gravitational scattering, including phenomena such as black hole formation and various stringy effects, is compatible with the twice-subtracted dispersion relations.</description>

      <title>Nonsingular black holes as dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is commonly assumed that low-mass primordial black holes cannot constitute a significant fraction of the dark matter in our universe due to their predicted short lifetimes from the conventional Hawking radiation and evaporation process. Assuming physical black holes are nonsingular--likely due to quantum gravity or other high-energy physics--we demonstrate that a large class of nonsingular black holes have finite evaporation temperatures. This can lead to slowly evaporating low-mass black holes or to remnant mass states that circumvent traditional evaporation constraints. As a proof of concept, we explore the limiting curvature hypothesis and the evaporation process of a nonsingular black hole solution in two-dimensional dilaton gravity. We identify generic features of the radiation profile and compare them with known regular black holes, such as the Bardeen solution in four dimensions. Remnant masses are proportional to the fundamental length scale, and we argue that slowly evaporating low-mass nonsingular black holes, or remnants, are viable dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity with purely virtual particles from asymptotically local quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the local limits of various classes of unitary, nonlocal quantum field theories. While it is easy to build nonlocal models with well-behaved asymptotics in Euclidean space, the Minkowskian correlation functions typically exhibit singular behaviors. We introduce "asymptotically local" quantum field theory (AL-QFT) as the class that encompasses unitary, nonlocal theories with well-defined local limits in Minkowski spacetime. The target models cannot propagate ghosts, but are allowed to contain purely virtual particles (PVPs). In the bubble diagram, the nonlocal deformation generates PVPs straightforwardly. In the triangle diagram, it does so possibly up to multi-threshold corrections, which may be adjusted by tuning the deformation itself. We build examples of AL-QFTs, including a deformation of quantum gravity with purely virtual particles. AL-QFT can serve various purposes, such as suggesting innovative approaches to off-shell physics, providing an alternative formulation for theories with PVPs, or smoothing out nonanalytic behaviors. We discuss its inherent arbitrariness and the implications for renormalizability.</description>

      <title>Hyper-Hermitian Weyl Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-dual double copy is further explored. In previous work, it has been shown that Hyper-Hermitian manifolds also have associated the self-dual gauge theories via Kerr-Schild double copy. The self-dual double copy is generalized in the structure of the kinematic algebra by changing the area-preserving diffeomorphisms algebra by the diffeomorphisms on a surface algebra. This gave rise to the hyper-Hermitian double copy in the Kerr-Schild approach. In the present article, we further study the hyper-Hermitian case using the Weyl double copy formalism. In particular, we have found solutions within this formalism for different hyper-Hermitian metrics. One of the main features is that there will be two Maxwell spinors and one of them is source-free and the other has a source current. This is compatible with the fact that in general the hyper-Hermitian spaces are not Ricci-flat.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach To Find The Generalized Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Higgs BPS Vortices and Their Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose that all BPS vortex solutions within the generalized Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Higgs (MCSH) model can be found from a single system of equations. This set of equations is derived using the BPS Lagrangian method, which is a more robust generalization of Bogomolnyi's trick. We show that the known spherically symmetric BPS vortices can be reproduced as certain limits of Bogomolnyi equations in the generalized MCSH Model. This provides us with a possible classification system using the auxiliary functions in the BPS Lagrangian. Furthermore, we also study the properties of each known vortex through the numerical approach where we found that all of the vortices behave similarly under variations of their free parameters and a system of well-separated MCSH vortices saturates the BPS bound.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Barrow Einstein-power-Yang-Mills AdS black hole in the restricted phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we know that due to the quantum gravitational effects black hole horizons are ``fractalized'' into a sphereflake by Barrow. Based on this issue, in this work we investigate the phase structure and stability of the Einstein-Power-Yang-Mills AdS black holes with the fractal structure on the black hole horizon in the restricted phase space. Through the thermodynamics first law and the Smarr relation in the restricted phase space, we observe that the mass parameter is understood as the inter energy and the Smarr relation is not a homogeneous function of order one for all quantities due to the fractal structure. And the fractal structure can be regarded as a phase transition probe. When this system with the fixed central charge there exists a novel phenomena: the supercritical phase transition. Furthermore the effects of the fractal parameter and non-linear Yang-Mills parameter on the thermodynamics stability of this system are also investigated.</description>

      <title>Inertial Transformations and the Nonexistence of Tachyons for Spacetime Dimension Greater than Two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider real linear transformations between two inertial frames with constant relative speed $v$ in a $d$-dimensional spacetime where light moves with constant speed $c=1$ (for some chosen units) in all frames. For $d=2$ we show that the standard relative velocity formula holds and that any associated anisotropic conformal factor is multiplicative under composition of inertial transformations for $|v|\neq 1$. Assuming that the inertial transformation matrix is continuous in a neighbourhood of $v=0$ and differentiable at $v=0$, we determine the conformal factor for all $|v|\neq 1$. For an isotropic spacetime, the general solution reduces to the standard $d=2$ Lorentz transformation for $|v|&lt;1$ or to a Tachyonic transformation for $|v|&gt;1$, first described by Parker in 1969. For $d&gt;2$ we show that no Tachyonic-like inertial transformations exist which are compatible with constant light speed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of quantum field theories with relativistic Luttinger fermions and local self-interaction in scalar channels. For an understanding of possible low-energy phases, we first classify the set of mass terms arising from scalar fermion bilinears. For large flavor numbers, we show that each of our models features a coupling branch in which the theory is asymptotically free. In order to address the long-range behavior, we use mean-field theory which is exact in the limit of large flavor numbers. We identify two models which undergo dimensional transmutation, interconnecting the asymptotically free high-energy regime with an ordered low-energy phase sustaining a vacuum condensate. We also study the analytic structure of the Luttinger-fermionic propagator in the various possible gapped phases.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a detailed study of the thermodynamics of charged BTZ black holes using the conformal holographic extended thermodynamics formalism and Tsallis statistics. The cornerstone of our thermodynamic framework is the re-scaling of CFT by the conformal factor, which is considered a thermodynamic parameter. Here, the AdS radius is distinct from the CFT radius, allowing for independent variations of the central charge and volume. Our analysis revealed that the thermodynamic behavior of charged BTZ black holes in three dimensions is characterized by the stability and absence of phase transitions, contrasting with the behavior of four-dimensional black holes. The central charge of CFT notably influences the thermal evolution of these black holes, with a smaller central charge leading to faster thermal processes. Additionally, the temperature of large black holes is proportional to their entropy. By incorporating Tsallis statistics into our study, we found that the stability of black holes depends on the Tsallis parameter. Black holes are always stable when the Tsallis parameter is less than 2. However, if this parameter is greater than 2, a first-order phase transition occurs between small stable and large unstable. Overall, our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the holographic thermodynamics of lower-dimensional black holes and the impact of non-extensive statistics on their physical properties.</description>

      <title>Induced current in high-dimensional AdS bulk in the presence of a cosmic string and brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the vacuum bosonic current associated with a massive charged scalar field propagating in a $(D+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) bulk in the presence of an idealized carrying-magnetic-flux cosmic string and also a brane. We assume that the string is perpendicular to the brane which is parallel to the AdS boundary.
  The brane divides the space in two regions with different properties of vacuum states. We investigate the only non-vanishing azimuthal components of the induced currents in both regions. To develop this analysis we calculate first, for both regions, the positive frequency Wightman functions. These present contributions associated with the presence of a cosmic string only plus the other induced by the brane. In this talk we consider only the contributions induced by the brane.</description>

      <title>Quantum equations of motion and the geometrical imperative II: relativistic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extract the square root of the Minkowski metric using Dirac/Clifford matrices. The resulting $4\times 4$ operator $d{\bf S}$ that represents the square root, can be used to transform four vectors between relatively moving observers. This effects the usual Lorentz transformation. In addition it acts on a Dirac bi-spinor. The operator is essentially a Hamiltonian that can be used to write an equation of motion for a relativistic spinor. This turns out to be the Dirac equation for electrons in standard form. We believe that is is a new approach to familiar results.</description>

Abstract: Measurements in many-body quantum systems can generate non-trivial phenomena, such as preparation of long-range entangled states, dynamical phase transitions, or measurement-altered criticality. Here, we introduce a new measurement scheme that produces an ensemble of mixed states in a subsystem, obtained by measuring a local Hermitian observable on part of its complement. We refer to this as the observable-projected ensemble. Unlike standard projected ensembles-where pure states are generated by projective measurements on the complement-our approach involves projective partial measurements of specific observables. This setup has two main advantages: theoretically, it is amenable to analytical computations, especially within conformal field theories. Experimentally, it requires only a linear number of measurements, rather than an exponential one, to probe the properties of the ensemble. As a first step in exploring the observable-projected ensemble, we investigate its entanglement properties in conformal field theory and perform a detailed analysis of the free compact boson.</description>

      <title>Breaking the north-south symmetry: dyonic spinning black holes with synchronized gauged scalar hair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stationary clouds of a gauged, complex scalar field on a magnetically (and possibly electrically as well) charged Kerr-Newman black hole (BH). The existence of a magnetic charge $Q_m$ promotes a north-south $\textit{asymmetry}$ of the scalar clouds. This breakdown of the clouds' $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry carries through to the spacetime $\textit{geometry}$ for the non-linear continuation of the clouds: a family of magnetically charged (or dyonic) BHs with synchronized gauged scalar hair, which we construct. Their distinct phenomenology is illustrated by their imaging, exhibiting skewed shadows and lensing. Such hairy BHs could, in principle, result from the superradiant instability of magnetically charged Kerr-Newman BHs, unveiling a dynamical mechanism for creating north-south asymmetric BHs from standard $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric electrovacuum BHs.</description>

      <title>Is the finite temperature effective potential, effective for dynamics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the applicability of the finite temperature effective potential in the equation of motion of a homogeneous ``misaligned'' scalar condensate $\varphi$, and find important caveats that severely restrict its domain of validity: \textbf{i:)} the \emph{assumption} of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) is in general not warranted, \textbf{ii:)} we show a direct relation between the effective potential and the thermodynamic entropy density $\mathcal{S}= - \partial V_{eff}(T,\varphi)/\partial T$, which entails that for a dynamical $\varphi(t)$ the entropy becomes a non-monotonic function of time, \textbf{iii:)} parametric instabilities in both cases with and without spontaneous symmetry breaking lead to profuse particle production with non-thermal distribution functions, \textbf{iv:)} in the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking spinodal instabilities yield a complex effective potential, internal energy and \emph{entropy}, an untenable situation in thermodynamics. All these caveats associated with dynamical aspects, cannot be overcome by finite temperature equilibrium resummation schemes. We argue that the dynamics of the condensate leads to decoupling and freeze-out from (LTE), and propose a \emph{closed} quantum system approach based on unitary time evolution. It yields the correct equations of motion without the caveats of the effective potential, and provides a fully renormalized and thermodynamically consistent framework to study the dynamics of the ``misaligned'' condensate, with real and conserved energy and entropy amenable to numerical study. The evolution of the condensate leads to profuse \emph{stimulated particle production} with non-thermal distribution functions. Possible emergent asymptotic non-thermal states and eventual re-thermalization are conjectured.</description>

      <title>Invisible Higgs decay from dark matter freeze-in at stronger coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Higgs boson decay into dark matter (DM) in the framework of freeze-in at stronger coupling. Even though the Higgs-DM coupling is significant, up to order one, DM does not thermalize due to the Boltzmann suppression of its production at low temperatures. We find that this mechanism leads to observable Higgs decay into invisible final states with the branching fraction of 10% and below, while producing the correct DM relic abundance. This applies to the DM masses down to the MeV scale, which requires a careful treatment of the hadronic production modes. For DM masses below the muon threshold, the Boltzmann suppression is not operative and the freeze-in nature of the production mechanism is instead guaranteed by the smallness of the electron Yukawa coupling. As a result, MeV DM with a significant coupling to the Higgs boson remains non-thermal as long as the reheating temperature does not exceed $\mathcal{O}(100)\;$MeV. Our findings indicate that there are good prospects for observing light non-thermal DM via invisible Higgs decay at the LHC and FCC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the limit of vanishing up, down and strange quark masses, QCD exhibits a chiral symmetry. This symmetry is broken spontaneously to its vector subgroup, giving rise to Goldstone bosons. These acquire a small mass through the explicit chiral symmetry breaking for non-vanishing quark masses. The consequences of these broken symmetries can be investigated in a suitably tailored effective field theory called chiral pertubation theory. It admits a perturbative expansion in the external momenta and the Goldstone boson masses and can be systematically analyzed in terms of a loop expansion. The appearing ultraviolet divergences in loop diagrams can be dealt with order-by-order through the Goldstone boson contact interactions. Matter fields like the lowest-lying baryons can also included, leading to a rich and testable phenomenology of low-energy QCD.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of melting domain walls and their gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study domain walls (DWs) arising in field theories where $Z_2$-symmetry is spontaneously broken by a scalar expectation value decreasing proportionally to the Universe temperature. The energy density of such melting DWs redshifts sufficiently fast not to overclose the Universe. For the first time, evolution of melting DWs and the resulting gravitational waves (GWs) is investigated numerically using lattice simulations. We show that formation of closed melting DWs during radiation domination is much more efficient compared to the scenario with constant tension DWs. This suggests that it can be the main mechanism responsible for reaching the scaling regime similarly to the case of cosmic strings. However, the scaling behaviour of melting DWs is observed, provided only that the initial scalar field fluctuations are not very large. Otherwise, simulations reveal violation of the scaling law, potentially of the non-physical origin. The spectrum of GWs emitted by melting DWs is also significantly different from that of constant tension DWs. Whether the system has reached scaling or not, the numerical study reveals a GW spectrum described in the infrared by the spectral index $n \approx 1.6$ followed by the causality tail. We attribute the difference from the value $n=2$ predicted in our previous studies to a finite lifetime of the DW network. Notably, the updated index is still in excellent agreement with the recent findings by pulsar timing arrays, which confirms that melting DWs can be responsible for the observed (GW) signal. We also point out that results for evolution of melting DWs in the radiation-dominated Universe are applicable to constant tension DW evolution in the flat spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of metric-affine gravity theories, where the metric and connection are independent, we examine actions involving quadratic terms in the Ricci scalar curvature and the Holst invariant. These actions are non-minimally coupled to a scalar field. We explore the behavior of the corresponding effective metric theory, which includes an extra dynamic pseudoscalar degree of freedom. Detailed analysis of inflationary predictions reveals compliance with recent observations across various parameters, potentially allowing a higher tensor-to-scalar ratio. The spectral index's direction of change varies based on parameter positioning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.11642v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the entanglement entropy in a two dimensional conformal field theory at finite size and finite temperature in the large central charge limit via the replica trick. We first generalize the known monodromy method for the calculation of conformal blocks on the plane to the torus. Then, we derive a monodromy method for the zero-point conformal blocks of the replica partition function. We explain the differences between the two monodromy methods before applying them to the calculation of the entanglement entropy. We find that the contribution of the vacuum exchange dominates the entanglement entropy for a large class of CFTs, leading to universal results in agreement with holographic predictions from the RT formula. Moreover, we determine in which regime the replica partition function agrees with a correlation function of local twist operators on the torus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform an extensive bootstrap study of Hermitian and non-Hermitian theories based on the novel analytic continuation of $\langle\phi^n\rangle$ or $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ in $n$. We first use the quantum harmonic oscillator to illustrate various aspects of the $\phi^n$ trajectory bootstrap method, such as the large $n$ expansion, matching conditions, exact quantization condition, and high energy asymptotic behavior. Then we derive highly accurate solutions for the anharmonic oscillators with the parity invariant potential $V(\phi)=\phi^2+\phi^{m}$ and the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant potential $V(\phi)=-(i\phi)^{m}$ for a large range of integral $m$, showing the high efficiency and general applicability of this new bootstrap approach. For the Hermitian quartic and non-Hermitian cubic oscillators, we further verify that the non-integer $n$ results for $\langle\phi^n\rangle$ or $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ are consistent with those from the wave function approach. In the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant case, the existence of $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ with non-integer $n$ allows us to bootstrap the non-Hermitian theories with non-integer powers, such as fractional and irrational $m$.</description>

      <title>B-brane Transport and Grade Restriction Rule for Determinantal Varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study autoequivalences of $D^{b}Coh(X)$ associated to B-brane transport around loops in the stringy K\"ahler moduli of $X$. We consider the case of $X$ being certain resolutions of determinantal varieties embedded in $\mathbb{P}^{d}\times G(k,n)$. Such resolutions have been modeled, in general, by nonabelian gauged linear sigma models (GLSM). We use the GLSM construction to determine the window categories associated with B-brane transport between different geometric phases using the machinery of grade restriction rule and the hemisphere partition function. In the family of examples analyzed the monodromies around phase boundaries enjoy the interpretation as loop inside link complements. We exploit this interpretation to find a decomposition of autoequivalences into simpler spherical functors and we illustrate this in two examples of Calabi-Yau 3-folds $X$, modeled by an abelian and nonabelian GLSM respectively. In additon we also determine explicitly the action of the autoequivalences on the Grothendieck group $K(X)$ (or equivalently, B-brane charges).</description>

      <title>Critical spin chains and loop models with $U(n)$ symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting with the Ising model, statistical models with global symmetries provide fruitful approaches to interesting physical systems, for example percolation or polymers. These include the $O(n)$ model (symmetry group $O(n)$) and the Potts model (symmetry group $S_Q$). Both models make sense for $n,Q\in \mathbb{C}$ and not just $n,Q\in \mathbb{N}$, and both give rise to a conformal field theory in the critical limit.
  Here, we study similar models based on the unitary group $U(n)$. We focus on the two-dimensional case, where the models can be described either as gases of non-intersecting orientable loops, or as alternating spin chains. This allows us to determine their spectra either by computing a twisted torus partition function, or by studying representations of the walled Brauer algebra.
  In the critical limit, our models give rise to a CFT with global $U(n)$ symmetry, which exists for any $n\in\mathbb{C}$. Its spectrum is similar to those of the $O(n)$ and Potts CFTs, but a bit simpler. We conjecture that the $O(n)$ CFT is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of the $U(n)$ CFT, where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ acts as complex conjugation.</description>

      <title>The strong CP problem revisited and solved by the gauge group topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exploit the non-perturbative result that the $\theta$ angle which defines the vacuum structure is not a $c$-number free parameter, as suggested by the instanton semi-classical approximation, but instead one of the points of the spectrum of the central operator $\tilde{\theta}$ which describes the gauge group topology. Hence, the value of such an angle should not be \textit{a priori} fixed, but rather be determined, as any quantum operator, by the infinite volume limit of the functional integral, where the fermionic mass term uniquely fixes the phase, with $&lt; \tilde{\theta} &gt; = \theta_M$, the mass angle. Such an equality is stable under radiative corrections performed before the infinite volume limit of the functional integral.
  The mechanisms is carefully controlled in the massive Schwinger model with attention to the infrared problems, to the volume effects induced by boundary terms and with a careful discussion of the infinite volume limit of the functional integral. The extension to the QCD case relies on the choice of modified APS boundary conditions which do not break chiral symmetry, allowing for the crucial role of the fermionic mass term in uniquely determining the phase, with a solution of the strong $CP$ problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gauge theory formulation of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and propose Korteweg-de Vries asymptotic conditions that generalize the asymptotic dynamics of the theory. They permit to construct an enlarged set of boundary actions formed by higher order generalizations of the Schwarzian derivative that contain the Schwarzian as lower term in a tower of SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$ invariants. They are extracted from the KdV Hamiltonians and can be obtained recursively. As a result, the conformal symmetry breaking observed in nearly AdS$_{2}$ is characterized by a much larger set of dynamical modes associated to the stationary KdV hierarchy. We study quantum perturbation theory for the generalized Schwarzian action including the symplectic measure and compute the one-loop correction to the partition function. We find that despite the non-linear nature of the higher-Schwarzian contribution, it acquires a manageable expression that renders a curious leading temperature dependence on the entropy $S=\#T^{a}$ for $a$ an odd integer.</description>

      <title>Some Lower Dimensional Quantum Field Theories Reduced from Chern-Simons Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study symmetry reductions in the context of Euclidean Chern-Simons gauge theories to obtain lower dimensional field theories. Symmetry reduction in certain gauge theories is a common tool for obtaining explicit soliton solutions. Although pure Chern-Simons theories do not admit solitonic solutions, symmetry reduction still leads to interesting results. We establish relations at the semiclassical regime between pure Chern-Simons theories on $S^3$ and the reduced Quantum Field Theories, based on actions obtained by the symmetry reduction of the Chern-Simons action, spherical symmetry being the prominent one. We also discuss symmetry reductions of Chern-Simons theories on the disk, yielding $BF$-theory in two dimensions, which signals a curious relationship between symmetry reductions and the boundary conformal field theories. Finally, we study the Chern-Simons-Higgs instantons and show that under certain circumstances, the reduced action can formally be viewed as the action of a supersymmetric quantum mechanical model. We discuss the extent to which the reduced actions have a fermionic nature at the level of the partition function.</description>

      <title>Janus and RG-flow interfaces from matter-coupled F(4) gauged supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study supersymmetric Janus solutions from matter-coupled $F(4)$ gauged supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets and $SO(4)\sim SO(3)\times SO(3)$ gauge group. There are two supersymmetric $AdS_6$ vacua preserving all supersymmetries with $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ and $SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ symmetries dual to $N=2$ SCFTs in five dimensions. We consider a truncation to $SO(2)_{\textrm{diag}}\subset SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ singlet scalars and find a number of new supersymmetric Janus solutions preserving eight supercharges. These solutions holographically describe conformal interfaces within $N=2$ five-dimensional SCFTs involving deformations by source terms and vacuum expectation values of relevant and irrelevant operators. Apart from the Janus solutions interpolating between $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ $AdS_6$ vacua, some of the solutions have $SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ $AdS_6$ vacua generated by holographic RG flows from the $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ phases on both sides. We also give an evidence for solutions describing RG-flow interfaces with $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ $AdS_6$ vacuum on one side and $SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ $AdS_6$ vacuum on the other side. The solutions provide first examples of Janus solutions involving more than one $AdS_6$ vacuum in six-dimensional gauged supergravity.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional (bi-)scalar gravities from four-dimensional Horndeski</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a classical two-dimensional bi-scalar gravity based on the Kaluza-Klein reduction applied to the four-dimensional Horndeski theory. One of the scalar fields arises from the original four-dimensional theory, while the extra scalar emerges from the reduction process. We also introduce a two-dimensional bi-scalar identity that allows for a more concise and elegant reformulation of the resulting bi-scalar Lagrangian. Additionally, we study the linear perturbations around a static background to demonstrate that the bi-scalar theory may support a single healthy propagating mode. Furthermore, by restricting the scalar fields, we investigate a general single scalar theory that is identical to the two-dimensional Horndeski theory up to a boundary term. Our results provide a framework to map a generic two-dimensional dilaton gravity into four-dimensional Horndeski theory.</description>

      <title>Weyl gauge invariant DBI action in conformal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the analogue of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action in Weyl conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions and obtain a general theory of gravity with Weyl gauge symmetry of dilatations (Weyl-DBI). This is done in the {\it Weyl gauge covariant} formulation of conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions, suitable for a gauge theory, which renders this geometry {\it metric}. The Weyl-DBI action has the same gauge invariant expression with {\it dimensionless} couplings in any dimension $d$, so it has no need of a UV regulator (be it an additional field, higher derivative operator or DR subtraction scale) for which reason we argue it is Weyl-anomaly free. For $d=4$, the leading order of a series expansion of the Weyl-DBI action recovers exactly the gauge invariant Weyl quadratic gravity action associated to this geometry, that is Weyl anomaly-free; this is broken spontaneously and Einstein-Hilbert gravity is recovered in the broken phase, with $\Lambda&gt;0$. The series expansion of Weyl-DBI action also contains additional terms of non-perturbative nature that can however be recovered by quantum corrections in Weyl quadratic gravity in $d=4$ in a gauge invariant (geometric) regularisation automatically provided by the Weyl-DBI action. If the Weyl gauge boson is not dynamical the Weyl-DBI action recovers in the leading order the conformal gravity action. All fields and scales are of {\it geometric origin}, with no added matter, scalar field compensators or UV regulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify the irreducible modules of a rational Lorentzian lattice vertex operator algebra (LLVOA) based on an even, self-dual Lorentzian lattice $\Lambda\subset\mathbb{R}^{m,n}$ of signature $(m,n)$. We show that the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible modules of the LLVOA are in one-to-one correspondence with the equivalence classes $\Lambda_0^\circ/\Lambda_0$ for a certain subset $\Lambda_0^\circ\subset\mathbb{R}^{m,n}$ and a full rank sublattice $\Lambda_0\subset\Lambda$. We also classify the intertwining operators between the modules and calculate the fusion rules. We then describe the standard construction of modular tensor category (MTC) associated to rational LLCFTs. We explicitly construct the modular data and braiding and fusing matrices for the MTC. As a concrete example, we show that the LLCFT based on a certain even, self-dual Lorentzian lattice of signature $(m, n)$, with $m$ even, realizes the $D(m \bmod 8)$ level 1 Kac-Moody MTC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct, for spin $0,1,2$ tensor fields on S$^d$, a set of ladder operators that connect the distinct UIRs of SO$(d+1)$. This is achieved by relying on the conformal Killing vectors of S$^d$. For the case of spinning fields, the ladder operators generalize previous expressions with a compensating transformation necessary to preserve the transversality condition. We then extend the results to the Exceptional/Discrete UIRs of SO$(d,1)$, again relying on the conformal Killing vectors of de Sitter space. Our construction recovers the conventional conformal primary transformations for the scalar fields when the mass term leads to conformal coupling. A similar approach for the spin-2 field leads to the conformal-like operators found recently.</description>

      <title>Geodesics in Carrollian Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the geodesics in different types of Carrollian RN (Reissner-Nordstr\"om) black holes, considering the motions of both neutral and charged particles. We use the geodesic equations in the weak Carrollian structure and analyze the corresponding trajectories projected onto the absolute space, and find that the geodesics are well-defined. In particular, we examine the electric-electric and magnetic-electric limit of the RN black hole, focusing on their geodesic structures. We find that the global structures of the usual RN black holes get squeezed under the ultra-relativistic limit. More precisely, the nonextreme magnetic-electric RN spacetime has two different asymptotic flat patches while the extreme black hole spacetime consists of only one patch. For the magnetic-electric RN spacetime, the Carrollian extremal surfaces (CESs) divide the spacetime into several geodesically complete regions, and the geodesics can only travel in one of these regions. For the charged particles, we extend the analysis by considering their interactions with the electromagnetic field in the Carrollian RN spacetimes and find that their trajectories are significantly different from the neutral geodesics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.11965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose gauge-covariant neural networks along with a specialized training algorithm for lattice QCD, designed to handle realistic quarks and gluons in four-dimensional space-time. We show that the smearing procedure can be interpreted as an extended version of residual neural networks with fixed parameters. To demonstrate the applicability of our neural networks, we develop a self-learning hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm in the context of two-color QCD, yielding outcomes consistent with those from the conventional Hybrid Monte Carlo approach.</description>

      <title>Genus $g$ Zhu Recursion for Vertex Operator Algebras and Their Modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe Zhu recursion for a vertex operator algebra (VOA) and its modules on a genus $g$ Riemann surface in the Schottky uniformisation. We show that $n$-point (intertwiner) correlation functions are written as linear combinations of $(n-1)$-point functions with universal coefficients given by derivatives of the differential of the third kind, the Bers quasiform and certain holomorphic forms. We use this formula to describe conformal Ward identities framed in terms of a canonical differential operator which acts with respect to the Schottky moduli and to the insertion points of the $n$-point function. We consider the generalised Heisenberg VOA and determine all its correlation functions by Zhu recursion. We also use Zhu recursion to derive linear partial differential equations for the Heisenberg VOA partition function and various structures such as the bidifferential of the second kind, holomorphic $1$-forms, the prime form and the period matrix. Finally, we compute the genus $g$ partition function for any rational Euclidean lattice generalised VOA.</description>

      <title>Net-Proton Number Cumulants in Strongly and Weakly Coupled QGP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a description of the QCD phase diagram across different energy regimes. Without any adjustable free parameters fitted to lattice or experimental data, we demonstrate that the net-proton number cumulant ratios from the Beam Energy Scan-I (BES-I) central ($0-5\%$) Au+Au collision experiments at RHIC, for center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s} \geq 39\,\text{GeV}$, are well described by the $\textit{dynamical soft-wall}$ AdS black hole model, indicating the formation of a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) dominated by gluons in the large $N_c$ limit. We identify a critical point at $\mu_B = 247\,\text{MeV}$ or $\sqrt{s}=16\,\text{GeV}$ in this model, where net-proton cumulant ratios show non-monotonic variation. However, for $\sqrt{s} &lt; 39\,\text{GeV}$, the recent BES-II data does not exhibit the expected variation due to the critical point, suggesting instead a transition to a nearly-cold ($\mu_B \gg T$) weakly coupled QGP (wQGP), for $\sqrt{s} &lt; 7.7\,\text{GeV}$, dominated by valence quarks. This prediction can be tested by the upcoming STAR Fixed-Target experimental data.</description>

      <title>Event Horizon Telescope observations exclude compact objects in baseline mimetic gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mimetic gravity has gained significant appeal in cosmological contexts, but static spherically symmetric space-times within the baseline theory are highly non-trivial: the two natural solutions are a naked singularity and a black hole space-time obtained through an appropriate gluing procedure. We study the shadow properties of these two objects, finding both to be pathological. In particular, the naked singularity does not cast a shadow, whereas the black hole casts a shadow which is too small. We argue that the Event Horizon Telescope images of M87$^{\star}$ and Sgr A$^{\star}$ rule out the baseline version of mimetic gravity, preventing the theory from successfully accounting for the dark sector on cosmological scales. Our results highlight an interesting complementarity between black hole imaging observations and modified gravity theories of cosmological interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the impact of the phantom field (or anti-Maxwell field) on the structure of three-dimensional black holes in the presence of the cosmological constant, we present the first extraction of solutions for the phantom BTZ (A)dS black hole. In this study, we analyze the effect of the phantom field on the horizon structure. Furthermore, we compare the BTZ black holes in the presence of both the phantom and Maxwell fields. Additionally, we calculate the conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the phantom BTZ black holes, demonstrating their compliance with the first law of thermodynamics. Subsequently, we assess the effects of the electrical charge and the cosmological constant on the local stability in the canonical ensemble by considering these fields with respect to the heat capacity. We then investigate the global stability area of the BTZ black holes with phantom and Maxwell fields within the grand canonical ensemble using Gibbs free energy. In this analysis, we evaluate the influence of the electrical charge and the cosmological constant on this area.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Quasi-Integrable Equations from traveling-wave data using the Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are used to study vortex solutions in the 2+1 dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations. These solutions include the regularized long-wave (RLW) equation and the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) equation, which are toy models of the geostrophic shallow water model in the planetary atmosphere. PINNs successfully solve these equations in the forward process and the solutions are obtained using the mesh-free approach and automatic differentiation while accounting for conservation laws. In the inverse process, the proper equations can be successfully derived from a given training data. Since these equations have a lot in common, there are situations when substantial misidentification arises during the inverse analysis. We consider PINNs with conservation laws (referred to as cPINNs), deformations of the initial profiles, and a friction approach that provides excellent discrimination of the equations to improve the identification's resolution.</description>
