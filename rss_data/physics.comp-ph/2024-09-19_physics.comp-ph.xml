      <title>On the generalization ability of coarse-grained molecular dynamics models for non-equilibrium processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One essential goal of constructing coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) models is to accurately predict non-equilibrium processes beyond the atomistic scale. While a CG model can be constructed by projecting the full dynamics onto a set of resolved variables, the dynamics of the CG variables can recover the full dynamics only when the conditional distribution of the unresolved variables is close to the one associated with the particular projection operator. In particular, the model's applicability to various non-equilibrium processes is generally unwarranted due to the inconsistency in the conditional distribution. Here, we present a data-driven approach for constructing CGMD models that retain certain generalization ability for non-equilibrium processes. Unlike the conventional CG models based on pre-selected CG variables (e.g., the center of mass), the present CG model seeks a set of auxiliary CG variables based on the time-lagged independent component analysis to minimize the entropy contribution of the unresolved variables. This ensures the distribution of the unresolved variables under a broad range of non-equilibrium conditions approaches the one under equilibrium. Numerical results of a polymer melt system demonstrate the significance of this broadly-overlooked metric for the model's generalization ability, and the effectiveness of the present CG model for predicting the complex viscoelastic responses under various non-equilibrium flows.</description>

      <title>Effects of the entropy source on Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show how different sources of random numbers influence the outcomes of Monte Carlo simulations. We compare industry-standard pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) to a quantum random number generator (QRNG) and show, using examples of Monte Carlo simulations with exact solutions, that the QRNG yields statistically significantly better approximations than the PRNGs. Our results demonstrate that higher accuracy can be achieved in the commonly known Monte Carlo method for approximating $\pi$. For Buffon's needle experiment, we further quantify a potential reduction in approximation errors by up to $1.89\times$ for optimal parameter choices when using a QRNG and a reduction of the sample size by $\sim 8\times$ for sub-optimal parameter choices. We attribute the observed higher accuracy to the underlying differences in the random sampling, where a uniformity analysis reveals a tendency of the QRNG to sample the solution space more homogeneously. Additionally, we compare the results obtained with the QRNG and PRNG in solving the non-linear stochastic Schr\"odinger equation, benchmarked against the analytical solution. We observe higher accuracy of the approximations of the QRNG and demonstrate that equivalent results can be achieved at 1/3 to 1/10-th of the costs.</description>

      <title>Exascale Quantum Mechanical Simulations: Navigating the Shifting Sands of Hardware and Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The era of exascale computing presents both exciting opportunities and unique challenges for quantum mechanical simulations. While the transition from petaflops to exascale computing has been marked by a steady increase in computational power, the shift towards heterogeneous architectures, particularly the dominant role of graphical processing units (GPUs), demands a fundamental shift in software development strategies. This review examines the changing landscape of hardware and software for exascale computing, highlighting the limitations of traditional algorithms and software implementations in light of the increasing use of heterogeneous architectures in high-end systems. We discuss the challenges of adapting quantum chemistry software to these new architectures, including the fragmentation of the software stack, the need for more efficient algorithms (including reduced precision versions) tailored for GPUs, and the importance of developing standardized libraries and programming models.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Sparse Solvers for Severely Ill-Conditioned Linear Systems in Geophysical Marker-In-Cell Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving sparse linear systems is a critical challenge in many scientific and engineering fields, particularly when these systems are severely ill-conditioned. This work aims to provide a comprehensive comparison of various solvers designed for such problems, offering valuable insights and guidance for domain scientists and researchers. We develop the tools required to accurately evaluate the performance and correctness of 16 solvers from 11 state-of-the-art numerical libraries, focusing on their effectiveness in handling ill-conditioned matrices. The solvers were tested on linear systems arising from a coupled hydro-mechanical marker-in-cell geophysical simulation. To address the challenge of computing accurate error bounds on the solution, we introduce the Projected Adam method, a novel algorithm to efficiently compute the condition number of a matrix without relying on eigenvalues or singular values. Our benchmark results demonstrate that Intel oneAPI MKL PARDISO, UMFPACK, and MUMPS are the most reliable solvers for the tested scenarios. This work serves as a resource for selecting appropriate solvers, understanding the impact of condition numbers, and improving the robustness of numerical solutions in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Designing a minimal Landau theory to stabilize desired quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interparticle interactions with multiple length scales play a pivotal role in the formation and stability of quasicrystals. Choosing a minimal set of length scales to stabilize a given quasicrystal is a challenging problem. To address this challenge, we propose an intelligent screening method (ISM) to design a Landau theory with a minimal number of length scales -- referred to as the minimal Landau theory -- that includes only the essential length scales necessary to stabilize quasicrystals. Based on a generalized multiple-length-scale Landau theory, ISM first evaluates various spectral configurations of candidate structures under a hard constraint. It then identifies the configuration with the lowest free energy. Using this optimal configuration, ISM calculates phase diagrams to explore the thermodynamic stability of desired quasicrystals. ISM can design a minimal Landau theory capable of stabilizing the desired quasicrystals by incrementally increasing the number of length scales. Our application of ISM has not only confirmed known behaviors in 10- and 12-fold quasicrystals but also led to a significant prediction that quasicrystals with 8-, 14-, 16-, and 18-fold symmetry could be stable within three-length-scale Landau models.</description>

      <title>Modeling water radiolysis with Geant4-DNA: Impact of the temporal structure of the irradiation pulse under oxygen conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The differences in H2O2 production between conventional (CONV) and ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) irradiations in water radiolysis are still not fully understood. The lower levels of this radiolytic species, as a critical end product of water radiolysis, are particularly relevant for investigating the connection between the high-density energy deposition during short-duration physical events (ionizations or excitations) and biological responses of the FLASH effect. In this study, we developed a new Geant4-DNA chemistry model to simulate radiolysis considering the time structure of the irradiation pulse at different absorbed doses to liquid water of 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 2 Gy under 1 MeV electron irradiation. The model allows the description of the beam's temporal structure, including the pulse duration, the pulse repetition frequency, and the pulse amplitude for the different beam irradiation conditions through a wide dose rate range, from 0.01 Gy/s up to about 105 Gy/s, at various oxygen concentrations. The preliminary results indicate a correlation between the temporal structure of the pulses and a significant reduction in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at different dose rates.</description>

      <title>Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field crystal study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene stacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a recently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems incorporating out-of-plane deformations and parameterized to match to density functional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The specific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four $5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between perfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the dislocations in the defected layer leads to out-of-plane deformations that in turn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are made for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a defect-free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and system size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by roughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence across the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height profiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.</description>

      <title>Uncovering liquid-substrate fluctuation effects on crystal growth and disordered hyperuniformity of two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of two-dimensional (2D) crystals on fluctuating surfaces using a phase field crystal model that is relevant on atomic length and diffusive time scales. Motivated by recent experiments which achieved unprecedented fast growth of large-size high-quality 2D crystals on liquid substrates, we uncover novel effects of liquid surfaces on microstructural ordering. We find that substrate fluctuations generate short-ranged noise that speeds up crystallization and grain growth of the overlayer, surpassing that of free-standing system. Coupling to the liquid substrate fluctuations can also modulate local randomness, leading to intriguing disordered structures with hidden spatial order, i.e., disordered hyperuniformity. These results reveal the physical mechanisms underlying the fast growth of 2D crystals on liquid surfaces and demonstrate a novel strategy for synthesizing disordered hyperuniform thin film structures.</description>

      <title>AHKASH: a new Hybrid particle-in-cell code for simulations of astrophysical collisionless plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{A}$strophysical $\texttt{H}$ybrid-$\texttt{K}$inetic simulations with the $\texttt{flASH}$ code ($\texttt{AHKASH}$) -- a new Hybrid particle-in-cell (PIC) code developed within the framework of the multi-physics code $\texttt{FLASH}$. The new code uses a second-order accurate Boris integrator and a predictor-predictor-corrector algorithm for advancing the Hybrid-kinetic equations, using the constraint transport method to ensure that magnetic fields are divergence-free. The code supports various interpolation schemes between the particles and grid cells, with post-interpolation smoothing to reduce finite particle noise. We further implement a $\delta f$ method to study instabilities in weakly collisional plasmas. The new code is tested on standard physical problems such as the motion of charged particles in uniform and spatially varying magnetic fields, the propagation of Alfv\'en and whistler waves, and Landau damping of ion acoustic waves. We test different interpolation kernels and demonstrate the necessity of performing post-interpolation smoothing. We couple the $\texttt{TurbGen}$ turbulence driving module to the new Hybrid PIC code, allowing us to test the code on the highly complex physical problem of the turbulent dynamo. To investigate steady-state turbulence with a fixed sonic Mach number, it is important to maintain isothermal plasma conditions. Therefore, we introduce a novel cooling method for Hybrid PIC codes and provide tests and calibrations of this method to keep the plasma isothermal. We describe and test the `hybrid precision' method, which significantly reduces (by a factor $\sim1.5$) the computational cost, without compromising the accuracy of the numerical solutions. Finally, we test the parallel scalability of the new code, showing excellent scaling up to 10,000~cores.</description>

      <title>TR-ARPES Signal in Pumped Semiconductors within Dynamical Projective Operatorial Approach (DPOA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, after discussing in detail the internals of our recently developed method, the dynamical projective operatorial approach (DPOA), we provide the framework to apply this method to pumped semiconductor lattice systems and, in particular, to study and analyze their electronic excitations and TR-ARPES signal. The expressions for relevant out-of-equilibrium Green's functions and TR-ARPES signal are given within the DPOA framework and, defining a retarded TR-ARPES signal, it is shown that it is possible to obtain an out-of-equilibrium version of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We clarify how single- and multi-photon resonances, rigid shifts, band dressings, and different types of sidebands emerge in the TR-ARPES signal. We also propose protocols for evaluating the strength of single- and multi-photon resonances and for assigning the residual excited electronic population at each crystal momentum and band to a specific excitation process. Hamiltonians, where intra- and inter-band transitions are selectively inhibited, are defined and used to analyze the effects on the TR-ARPES signal and the residual electronic excited population. Three relevant cases of light-matter coupling are examined within the dipole gauge: only a local dipole, only the Peierls substitution in the hopping term, and both terms at once. The transient and residual pump effects are studied in detail, including the consequences of the lattice symmetries at different crystal momenta on the TR-ARPES signal. A detailed study of the dependence of the TR-ARPES signal on the probe-pulse characteristics is also reported. To provide a guideline for understanding the complex effects and interplays and the variety of possible physical phenomena without being limited by the characteristics of a single particular real material, we have chosen to study a prototypical pumped two-band semiconductor lattice system.</description>

      <title>Mesh-based Super-Resolution of Fluid Flows with Multiscale Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph neural network (GNN) approach is introduced in this work which enables mesh-based three-dimensional super-resolution of fluid flows. In this framework, the GNN is designed to operate not on the full mesh-based field at once, but on localized meshes of elements (or cells) directly. To facilitate mesh-based GNN representations in a manner similar to spectral (or finite) element discretizations, a baseline GNN layer (termed a message passing layer, which updates local node properties) is modified to account for synchronization of coincident graph nodes, rendering compatibility with commonly used element-based mesh connectivities. The architecture is multiscale in nature, and is comprised of a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale message passing layer sequences (termed processors) separated by a graph unpooling layer. The coarse-scale processor embeds a query element (alongside a set number of neighboring coarse elements) into a single latent graph representation using coarse-scale synchronized message passing over the element neighborhood, and the fine-scale processor leverages additional message passing operations on this latent graph to correct for interpolation errors. Demonstration studies are performed using hexahedral mesh-based data from Taylor-Green Vortex flow simulations at Reynolds numbers of 1600 and 3200. Through analysis of both global and local errors, the results ultimately show how the GNN is able to produce accurate super-resolved fields compared to targets in both coarse-scale and multiscale model configurations.</description>
