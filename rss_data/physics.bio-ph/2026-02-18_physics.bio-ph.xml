      <title>Bringing calorimetry (back) to life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-calorimetry offers significant potential as a quantitative method for studying the structure and function of biological systems, for instance, by probing the excess heat released by cellular or sub-cellular structures, isothermal or not, when external parameters change. We present the conceptual framework of nonequilibrium calorimetry, and as illustrations, we compute the heat capacity of biophysical models with few degrees of freedom related to ciliar motion (rowing model) and molecular motor motion (flashing ratchets). Our quantitative predictions reveal intriguing dependencies of the (nonequilibrium) heat capacity as a function of relevant biophysical parameters, which can even take negative values as a result of biological activity.</description>

      <title>Global phase-space geometry of three-dimensional gliding: terminal velocity manifolds, separatrices, and stability structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a three-dimensional dynamical-systems framework for passive gliding and identify the global phase-space structures that organize its motion. Extending previous two-dimensional models of non-equilibrium gliding, we show that the 3D velocity dynamics possess an attracting, normally hyperbolic invariant surface, the terminal velocity manifold (TVM), onto which all trajectories rapidly collapse before evolving slowly toward a glide equilibrium. There is also a separatrix surface associated with an invariant manifold of an unstable equilibrium within the TVM, which partitions initial conditions into qualitatively distinct descent behaviors: efficient shallow glides versus steep, drag-dominated descent. Using lift-drag data from three representative airfoils--a snake-inspired bluff body, the Zimmerman planform characteristic of Draco lizards, and the classical NACA 0012--we compute the full equilibrium surfaces, analyze their pitch-roll bifurcations, and reconstruct the TVM and separatrix geometry in three dimensions. The results reveal that (i) equilibrium stability changes with both pitch and roll, rather than pitch alone; (ii) separatrix geometry determines the dynamic accessibility of shallow glides; and (iii) bio-inspired airfoils possess compact separatrix regions that make efficient gliding robust across a wide range of initial jump conditions. This work unifies biological and engineered gliders within a single global geometric framework and establishes separatrix geometry on the TVM as a principled diagnostic for glide robustness.</description>

      <title>Virtual ultrasound machine operating in a GHz to MHz frequency range for particle-based biomedical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound-matter interactions underpin numerous biomedical and soft-matter applications, yet simulating these phenomena is challenging due to the large separation of viscous and sonic time scales. Continuum methods capture large-scale wave propagation but cannot resolve microscale interactions, while particle-based approaches offer molecular resolution but struggle with efficiency and stability at larger scales. We introduce a particle-based virtual ultrasound machine that uses a novel smoothed dissipative particle dynamics variant with an implicit pressure solver and a negative-pressure stabilization scheme, required to mimic acoustic propagation across MHz-GHz frequencies. We demonstrate its capabilities by modeling the acoustophoresis of encapsulated microbubbles, a key mechanism in ultrasound-mediated drug delivery. Beyond this application, the approach establishes a generalizable platform for simulating wave-matter interactions in soft and biological materials, opening new directions for computational studies of acoustics-driven phenomena in science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Fastest first-passage time for multiple searchers with finite speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the mean fastest first-passage time (fFPT) to an immobile target for an ensemble of $N$ independent finite-speed random searchers driven by dichotomous noise and described by the telegrapher's equation. In stark contrast to the well-studied case of Brownian particles -- for which the mean fFPT vanishes logarithmically with $N$ -- we uncover that the mean fFPT is bounded from below by the minimal ballistic travel time, with an exponentially fast convergence to this bound as $N \to \infty$. This behavior reveals a dramatic efficiency advantage of physically realistic, finite-speed searchers over Brownian ones and illustrates how diffusive macroscopic models may be conceptually misleading in predicting the short-time behavior of a physical system. We extend our analysis to anomalous diffusion generated by Riemann-Liouville-type dichotomous noises and find that target detection is more efficient in the superdiffusive regime, followed by normal and then subdiffusive regimes, in agreement with physical intuition and contrary to earlier predictions.</description>

      <title>New sector morphologies emerge from anisotropic colony growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Competition during range expansions is of great interest from both practical and theoretical view points. Experimentally, range expansions are often studied in homogeneous Petri dishes, which lack spatial anisotropy that might be present in realistic populations. Here, we analyze a model of anisotropic growth, based on coupled Kardar-Parisi-Zhang and Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov equations that describe surface growth and lateral competition. Compared to a previous study of isotropic growth, anisotropy relaxes a constraint between parameters of the model. We completely characterize spatial patterns and invasion velocities in this generalized model. In particular, we find that strong anisotropy results in a distinct morphology of spatial invasion with a kink in the displaced strain ahead of the boundary between the strains. This morphology of the out-competed strain is similar to a shock wave and serves as a signature of anisotropic growth.</description>

      <title>Octopus-like Reaching Motion: A Perspective Inspired by Whipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stereotypical reaching motion of the octopus arm has drawn growing attention for its efficient control of a highly deformable body. Previous studies suggest that its characteristic bend propagation may share underlying principles with the dynamics of a whip. This work investigates whether whip-like passive dynamics in water can reproduce the kinematic features observed in biological reaching and their similarities and differences. Platform-based whipping tests were performed in water and air while systematically varying material stiffness and driving speed. Image-based quantification revealed that the Ecoflex Gel 2 arm driven at 150 rpm (motor speed) reproduced curvature propagation similar to that observed in octopus reaching. However, its bend-point velocity decreased monotonically rather than exhibiting the biological bell-shaped profile, confirming that the octopus reaching movement is not merely a passive whipping behavior. The absence of propagation in air further highlights the critical role of the surrounding medium in forming octopus-like reaching motion. This study provides a new perspective for understand biological reaching movement, and offers a potential platform for future hydrodynamic research.</description>
