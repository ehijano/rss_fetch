      <title>NeutrinoOsc3Flavor: CP Phase Dependence in Three-Flavor Neutrino Oscillations: A Numerical Study in Vacuum and Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NeutrinoOsc3Flavor, a lightweight and fully transparent computational framework for exact three flavor neutrino oscillation studies in vacuum and constant density matter. The code numerically solves the Schrodinger evolution equation in the flavor basis using explicit construction and diagonalization of the effective Hamiltonian within the PMNS formalism, including full CP Violating phase dependence. In contrast to large scale oscillation toolkits optimized for experimental simulations, NeutrinoOsc3Flavor is designed as a minimal dependency reference implementation, emphasizing analytical traceability, equation level accessibility, and cross platform portability. The framework relies solely on NumPy for numerical linear algebra and runs natively on both Linux and Windows systems without external compilation or specialized libraries. As an internal consistency and validation feature, we implement an independent analytical determination of the matter modified Hamiltonian eigenvalues using the Cardano method and demonstrate excellent agreement with numerical diagonalization. CP Phase dependence is used as a sensitive diagnostic of numerical stability and correctness of the evolution operator in both vacuum and matter. NeutrinoOsc3Flavor is intended as a verification oriented and pedagogical computational tool, suitable for theoretical cross-checks, educational use, and benchmarking of more complex neutrino oscillation software, rather than as a replacement for full experimental simulation frameworks. Here, we consider the DUNE experiments baseline length in the python implementation but in general we can implement any value of baseline length.</description>

      <title>The ubiquitous flavor pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system of classical interacting spins can develop collective instabilities which, in the nonlinear regime, mimic the motion of a gyroscopic pendulum. Known as the flavor pendulum, this behavior appears among the collective modes of a dense neutrino plasma after a strong reduction of phase space through symmetry assumptions. It has been identified in homogeneous slow and fast flavor systems and, most recently, in single-wave solutions of the fast system. We explain the reasons for its ubiquitous appearance. We show that a system of three classical spins must always be pendular, or only two in the presence of an external field. Furthermore, such a system always defines a continuum of vectors with time-independent length. If these are identified as interacting spins, they immediately lead to the continuum cases of slow and fast flavor pendula. As another new insight, any of these spins can be chosen as the pendulum, periodically exchanging flavor with the rest of the system.</description>

      <title>Axion-Like Electrophilic Portal for Pion Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a scenario where Strongly Interacting Massive Particle (SIMP) dark matter interacts with an axion-like particle (ALP) that couples exclusively to electrons. This minimal setup provides interactions which enforce thermal equilibrium between dark matter and the SM in the early Universe. We analyze the cosmological evolution of the dark sector and the constraints arising from dark matter annihilations, ALP laboratory searches and astrophysical observations. Our results show that the allowed parameter space is wider than previous studies and an ALP with mass $m_a \sim {\cal O}(10)~\text{MeV}$ can act as a viable portal between the visible and dark sectors. Interestingly, this mass range overlaps with the parameter space suggested by the reported $X_{17}$ anomaly. Furthermore, the introduction of non-vanishing $\theta$ angle in the dark sector of the model opens up the parameter space to heavy ALP masses.</description>

      <title>Exploring Thermalization and Multi-Freeze-Out Effects in Pb-Pb collisions Based on Tsallis pT Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates transverse-momentum (pT) distributions of pi-, pi+, K-, K+, p, pbar, K0s, and Lambda in several centrality classes of Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 2.76 TeV. The measured spectra are analyzed with the Tsallis non-extensive distribution, from which the effective temperature T, non-extensive parameter q, and the mean transverse momentum mean_pT are extracted for each particle species and centrality interval. To disentangle thermal and collective effects, the mean kinetic freeze-out temperature T0 is obtained from the intercept of the T-versus-mass relation, while the average transverse flow velocity betaT is extracted from the slope of mean_pT versus the mean moving mass for pions, kaons, and protons.
  The results show that T increases and q decreases with increasing centrality, indicating a hotter and more equilibrated system in central collisions. A clear mass dependence of T supports a multi-freeze-out scenario, with heavier particles decoupling earlier. Both T0 and betaT rise from peripheral to mid-central collisions before saturating toward central events, which may suggest the onset of collective behavior or changes in freeze-out dynamics. These observations provide new insights into the thermal and dynamical properties of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Generalized Neutrino Interactions: constraints and parametrizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized neutrino interactions (GNI) are emerging as a convenient framework for describing effective scalar, vector, and tensor interactions. Such interactions arise naturally from extensions of the Standard Model that aim to explain neutrino properties and their mass origin. In this paper, we carefully study the two more common parametrizations for GNI and how to relate them. This allows us to compare bounds obtained from CEvNS and deep-inelastic scattering under the same footing. In addition, we present the current bounds from CEvNS measurements by COHERENT and compare them to those obtained from deep inelastic scattering on the same level. Our results focus on neutrino-quark interactions, and illustrate the complementarity between experiments working at different scales for GNI, showing that scalar interactions are better constrained by low-energy experiments like COHERENT, while tensor interactions are robustly constrained from deep inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Hydrogenated carbon structures as directional sub-GeV dark matter detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose hydrogenated carbon structures as targets with a remarkable sensitivity to dark matter-nucleon interactions, in the mass range between the 1 MeV and 100 MeV. The ejection of a proton following the interaction with a dark matter particle is a quasi-elastic process, with an extremely small energy threshold, and a clear experimental signature. The proposed detectors are simple, technologically ready, and inexpensive. Yet, they can be considerably more sensitive than current experiments. They also allow strong directionality, to be used towards efficient background rejection.</description>

      <title>Quantum Tomography of Fermion Pairs in $e^+e^-$ Collisions: Longitudinal Beam Polarization Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum tomography study of fermion pair production at future $e^+e^-$ colliders, emphasizing how longitudinal beam polarization controls the two-qubit spin density matrix. We study the processes $e^+ e^- \to t\bar{t},\ e^+e^-\to \mu^+\mu^-$ and Bhabha scattering $e^+e^-\to e^+e^-$, representing the mass threshold behavior, the $Z$ pole resonance and the $s/t$-channel interplay. We choose to focus on three key concepts: quantum entanglement via the concurrence $\mathcal{C}$, Bell nonlocality via the optimal Clauser Horne Shimony Holt (CHSH) parameter $\mathcal{B}$, and non-stabilizerness (``magic'') via the second stabilizer R\'enyi entropy $\mathcal{M}_2$. For the $s$-channel-dominated channels, longitudinal polarization mainly reshapes single-spin polarizations while leaving the spin-correlation matrix largely unchanged, rendering $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ comparatively robust, but inducing a pronounced variation of $\mathcal{M}_2$. In contrast, in Bhabha scattering, polarization modifies the relative contributions of the $s$-channel and $t$-channel and can strongly affect all three observables. The observability of entanglement, Bell nonlocality, and magic exceeds the $5\sigma$ level when both statistical and systematic uncertainties are included, establishing the fermion pair systems as ideal laboratories for quantum-information studies in high energy leptonic collisions. With optimized beam polarization, future $e^+e^-$ colliders will provide a unique opportunity to experimentally explore and influence quantum resources in particle interactions.</description>

      <title>Differentiating Dimension-6 and Dimension-8 Effects in $\nu$SMEFT at the HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dimension-eight effects in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory extended by right-handed neutrinos ($\nu$SMEFT). Using the Hilbert series formalism, we derive the complete basis of dimension-eight operators and confirm agreement with existing classifications, providing a systematic framework beyond the conventional dimension-six truncation. We analyse the collider phenomenology of the representative operator $\mathcal{O}_{N^{2}q^{2}B}^{(1,2)}$ at the High-Luminosity LHC. The resulting signatures involve pair production of right-handed neutrinos in association with jets, followed by decays into electron-jet final states with potentially displaced vertices. Since similar final states are generated by leading dimension-six operators, we explicitly address whether dimension-eight contributions can be experimentally distinguished from dimension-six effects. Using a Boosted Decision Tree analysis based on kinematic observables, we show that the dimension-eight signal can be reliably separated from each relevant dimension-six hypothesis. Our results demonstrate that dimension-eight operators in the $\nu$SMEFT can give rise to experimentally resolvable signatures and should be included in collider EFT interpretations.</description>

      <title>Searching for missing direct photons in heavy-ion collisions with P and CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute synchrotron radiation from a plasma in which $P$- and $CP$-violating parameters, a chiral chemical potential and a chiral gradient, couple to fermions. To do this, we compute exact wavefunctions for the fermions in the presence of these parameters and an external constant magnetic field. We find that these parameters increase the synchrotron radiation emitted by the fermions while also decreasing the traditionally large synchrotron radiation elliptic flow coefficient $v_2$. We apply these results to the quark-gluon plasma, where just such a contribution could provide a solution to the missing direct photons puzzle. We also use our wavefunctions to give a derivation of the chiral magnetic effect.</description>

      <title>Wave packet description of Majorana neutrino oscillations in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana neutrino oscillations in a magnetic field are considered using the wave packets formalism. The modified Dirac equation for Majorana neutrinos with non-zero transition magnetic moments propagating in a magnetic field is solved analytically in the two flavour case. The expressions for the oscillations probabilities are derived accounting for the decoherence effect emerging at distances exceeding the coherence length. It is shown that for Majorana neutrinos propagating in a magnetic field the coherence length coincides with the coherence length for neutrino oscillations in vacuum when the vacuum frequency is much greater than the magnetic frequency ($\omega_{vac} \gg \omega_B$), while it is proportional to the cube of the average neutrino momentum if ($\omega_{vac} \ll \omega_B$). We show that the decoherence effect may appear during neutrino propagation in a magnetic field of supernova.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Induced Nuclear De-Excitation at SBND with Ab Initio Nuclear Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the sensitivity of the Short-Baseline Near Detector (SBND) experiment to light dark matter using MeV-scale electromagnetic activity. Inelastic scattering of dark matter with argon nuclei can excite nuclear states that subsequently de-excite via the emission of MeV-scale photons, producing localized low-energy "blip" signatures in a liquid argon time projection chamber. We perform state-of-the-art ab initio nuclear calculations, including all relevant argon excited states with energies up to 18 MeV, to provide reliable predictions for these signals. After accounting for relevant backgrounds, we find that SBND can probe previously unexplored regions of parameter space for light dark matter.</description>

      <title>Cosmological phase transitions: from particle physics to gravitational waves, semi-analytically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent evidence of a stochastic gravitational wave background found by pulsar timing array experiments, we focus on one of the prime cosmological explanations, i.e. a supercooled first order phase transition. If confirmed, it would offer a unique opportunity to probe early Universe dynamics and the related physics beyond the Standard Model of particles and interactions. However, the prediction of the gravitational wave spectrum from a given particle physics scenario requires theoretically and computationally demanding methods. While several tools have been put forward to reduce uncertainties and automatize these computations, we study here the possibility to perform the full pipeline of computations semi-analytically in the $4D$ theory, thus avoiding computationally intensive simulations. Our approach yields accurate results that can be used in phenomenological studies and allow for an efficient exploration of the connection between the particle physics models and their cosmological predictions.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the shear viscosity, $\eta$, in two limits: perturbative QCD and an excluded-volume hadron resonance gas (HRG), at finite BSQ densities. Using an interpolation framework, we connect these regimes. In addition, we present results for (almost) next-to-leading order weak-coupling shear viscosity for QCD at finite $\mu_B$, and discuss the convergence of the perturbative series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working with a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector $\otimes$ vector contact interaction (SCI), a largely algebraic three-body Faddeev equation treatment of the nucleon bound state problem is introduced and used to deliver results for all nucleon charge and magnetisation distributions and their flavour separation. A strength of the SCI treatment is that it provides for a transparent understanding of this three-body approach to developing predictions for baryon observables. Comparisons of SCI results with predictions obtained in realistic-interaction Faddeev equation studies reveal the sensitivities of given observable to phenomena associated with the emergence of hadron mass.</description>

      <title>Constraints on light dark matter from primordial black hole evaporation at dark matter direct detection experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are able to produce light dark matter (DM) particles via Hawking radiation, and yield a flux of boosted DM that can be probed at underground DM direct detection experiments. We analyze both galactic and extragalactic contributions to the differential flux of light DM from PBH evaporation, and then compute the expected event rate from PBH boosted DM scattering off electrons or nuclei after taking into account the attenuation effect. Using recent data from DM direct detection experiments XENONnT, PandaX-4T and LZ, we set constraints on both DM-electron and DM-nucleus scattering cross sections, as well as the fraction of DM composed of PBHs $f_{\rm PBH}$ for $9\times10^{14}-1\times10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ PBHs that are not fully evaporated today. We also investigate the spectral evolution induced by Hawking evaporation throughout the evaporation and post-evaporation regimes. The constraints on the PBH mass are then extended into the $1\times10^{13}-6\times10^{14}\,\mathrm{g}$ window for fully evaporated PBHs.</description>

Lett. 135, 011903(2025), which incorporates the left-hand cut from one-pion exchange, to low-energy neutron-proton scattering in the $^1S_0$ and $^3S_1$ channels. The amplitude zero for the center-of-mass momentum near 0.35 GeV in the $^1S_0$ channel is naturally accommodated within this framework. We extract the pole position, scattering length, effective range, and the pseudoscalar pion-nucleon coupling constant $g_{\pi N}^2/(4\pi)$ at different expansion orders. The low-energy parameters are stable and consistent with established values, while $g_{\pi N}^2/(4\pi)$ exhibits larger uncertainties. The extraction of $g_{\pi N}^2/(4\pi)$ is data-driven, relying on the analytic constraints from the left-hand cut and phase-shift data within the one-pion-exchange approximation. Despite larger uncertainties compared to high-precision extractions, the consistency with established values demonstrates that this framework can probe the left-hand-cut singularity.</description>

      <title>Studying Energy-Energy Correlators in pp Collisions at the LHC with a Jet-Free Event-Topology Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a jet-free approach for measuring energy-energy correlators (EEC) in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), employing an event-topology method that does not rely on explicit jet reconstruction. Using the leading charged hadron as a reference axis, the azimuthal plane is divided into Toward and Transverse regions, enabling a robust background subtraction and extending EEC measurements into the low $p_T$ regime where conventional jet-based approaches become unreliable. The method is validated through comparisons with conventional jet reconstruction results. We systematically explore the dependence of the EEC on the leading-particle transverse momentum and parton flavor. The observed scaling between the EEC peak position and the hard scale suggests that this topology-based EEC captures effectively the transition between perturbative and non-perturbative QCD regimes. Distinct differences are found between quark- and gluon-initiated events, reflecting their different color charges and radiation patterns. Extending the analysis to heavy flavor, EECs triggered by leading charm mesons exhibit a suppressed magnitude and a peak shifted toward larger angular separations relative to inclusive charged-particle triggers, providing a direct manifestation of the dead-cone effect. This jet-free EEC framework offers a simple and experimentally robust tool for studying the scale and flavor dependence of the QCD dynamics, with promising applications to proton-nucleus and heavy-ion collisions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Search for the production of dark Higgs in the framework of Mono-Z$^{\prime}$ portal at the FCC-ee simulated electron-positron collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 240$ GeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03235v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we study the possible production of the dark Higgs boson ($h_{D}$) candidates, which originated from a simplified-model scenario based on the Mono-Z$^{\prime}$ model, in association with a neutral gauge boson (Z$^{\prime}$). This study has been performed by studying events with dimuon plus missing transverse energy produced in the simulated electron-positron collisions at the foreseen Future Circular Collider in the Electron-Positron collision mode (FCC-ee), operating at 240 GeV center of mass energy and integrated luminosity of 10.8 ab$^{-1}$. In case no new physics has been discovered, we set upper limits at a 95\% confidence level on the mass of the dark Higgs.</description>

      <title>Collectivity Signatures in High-Multiplicity pp Collisions from Hybrid Hydro+Tsallis Modeling of Pion Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse momentum (pT) distributions up to pT = 20 GeV/c for pions produced in the ten different multiplicity classes (MCs) of symmetric pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV have been investigated. Two distinct models, the Tsallis-Pareto type function (model) and the combined BGBW model and Tsallis-Pareto type model have been employed to fit the pT distributions via the minimum chi-square method. The combined Hydro+Tsallis model is more reliably describing the pT spectra than the Tsallis-Pareto model. The Tsallis temperature (T), non-extensivity parameter (q), normalization constant (N0), Kinetic freeze-out temperature (T0), transverse flow velocity (betaT), and (mean pT) have been extracted through the fitting procedure via the employed models. The Tsallis-Pareto model gives T, q, N0 and mean pT while Hydro+Tsallis model gives T0, betaT, T, q, N0 and mean pT. Incorporating the values of the extracted T and q the thermodynamic quantities and response functions, including energy density (epsilon), particle density (n), entropy density (s), pressure (P), specific heat at constant volume (CV), squared speed of sound (cs2), mean free path (lambda), Knudsen number (Kn), isothermal compressibility (kappaT), and expansion coefficient (alpha) have been calculated at the freeze-out stage. It has been observed that T, betaT, mean pT, N0, epsilon, n, s, P, CV, cs2, and alpha increase with increasing(decreasing) the charged particles multiplicity density dNch/deta(MCs). While T0, q, lambda, Kn, and kappaT decrease with increasing(decreasing) dNch/deta(MCs). These systematic variations in the trends of parameters might suggest the gradual transition towards collectivity and thermal equilibration in the high multiplicity pp events, possibly signalling enhanced collective dynamics and partial thermalization in small collision systems.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric dark matter from leptogenesis in type-III seesaw framework with modular $S_4$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for neutrino masses, baryogenesis, and dark matter based on a modular $S_4$ symmetry combined with a type-III seesaw mechanism. All Yukawa couplings, CP phases, and flavor textures originate from a single complex modulus $\tau$, whose vacuum expectation value controls both visible and dark sector dynamics. The same modular parameter fixes the neutrino mass matrix, determines the CP asymmetries driving resonant leptogenesis, and correlates the resulting baryon and dark matter abundances. A detailed numerical analysis shows that the model reproduces all neutrino oscillation data within the $3\sigma$ NuFIT~5.2 (2024) ranges for normal ordering, predicting $\delta_{\rm CP} \simeq \pm (150^\circ-180^\circ)$, $\sum m_\nu\simeq(0.06-0.08)~\mathrm{eV}$, and an effective Majorana mass $m_{\beta\beta} \simeq (8 - 18)\times 10^{-3}~\mathrm{eV}$, testable in next-generation neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments. The same modular Yukawas yield resonantly enhanced CP asymmetries $|\epsilon_{L,\chi}| \sim 10^{-9}-10^{-6}$ at $M_\Sigma \sim 10^{7}~\mathrm{GeV}$, successfully generating the observed baryon asymmetry $\eta_B\simeq6\times10^{-10}$ and dark relic density $\Omega_\chi h^2\simeq0.12$ without additional free parameters. The predicted correlation $\Omega_\chi/\Omega_B\simeq5.4$ fixes the dark matter mass to $m_\chi\simeq0.1-2~\mathrm{GeV}$, consistent with all current constraints. This framework therefore realizes a fully predictive baryon$-$dark matter co-genesis, where the geometry of the modular symmetry links the origin of flavor, CP violation, and the cosmic matter asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Probing Direct $CP$ Violation in $\Lambda_b^0 \to P_c^+ h^-$ $(h=\pi,K)$ with Final-State Rescattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LHCb collaboration has recently reported a measurement of the difference in direct CP asymmetries for the decays $\Lambda_b^0 \to J/\psi \, p \, h^-$ (with $h = K, \pi$), offering new experimental constraints on the decay dynamics of heavy baryons into charmonium final states. Inspired by these findings, we explore the branching ratios and direct CP violations for the decays $\Lambda_b^0 \to P_c^+(4312, 4440, 4457)\,h^-$ within the framework of final-state rescattering. Our analysis indicates that the branching fractions for $\Lambda_b^0 \to P_c^+ \pi^-$ lie around the $10^{-6}$ level, with the corresponding direct CP asymmetries approaching approximately $1\%$. In contrast, the direct CP violation for the decay $\Lambda_b^0 \to P_c^+ K^-$ is found to be very small, while its branching ratios show a strong dependence on the spin assignments of the $P_c$ states. These predictions may provide useful guidance for more precise CP measurements and amplitude analyses in the $P_c$ region in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-restoring finite counterterms of SMEFT four-fermion operator insertions at one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some effects induced by SMEFT operators at one loop have attracted a lot of attention in recent years, in particular, the renormalization of divergences by physical operators in single insertions of dimension-6 operators. Important non-logarithmically enhanced contributions must also be calculated. We discuss dimensional regularization in the Breitenlohner-Maison-'t Hooft-Veltman scheme. The goal here consists of determining in this scheme quantum effects in chiral theories at one loop. Namely, the determination of finite counterterms at one loop that reestablish the Slavnov-Taylor identities, which follow from gauge symmetries. These counterterms are necessary due to the presence of evanescent symmetry-breaking terms in the classical Lagrangian needed to regularize fermion propagators. We consider a technique that allows an easier calculation of such finite effects, relying on the identification of $(D-4)/(D-4)$ terms of one-loop amplitudes with an external ghost leg. We focus on dimension-6 four-fermion operators, identifying all finite counterterms in the Breitenlohner-Maison-'t Hooft-Veltman scheme at one loop, and as expected find no obstructions to the Slavnov-Taylor identities that cannot be cured by finite counterterms. This represents one step towards moving to higher order calculations.</description>

Abstract: Modern machine learning is driving a paradigm shift in particle physics phenomenology at the Large Hadron Collider. This short review examines the transformative role of machine learning across the entire theoretical prediction pipeline, from parton-level calculations to full simulations. We discuss applications to scattering amplitude computations, phase space integration, Parton Distribution Function determination, and parameter extraction. Some critical frontiers for the field including uncertainty quantification, the role of symmetries, and interpretability are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Quantum speed limit time for bipartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations in matter with non-standard interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the three-flavor neutrino oscillation framework, we investigate the transition probabilities of an initial muon neutrino flavor state in the presence of non-standard interactions (NSIs) characterized by complex off-diagonal ($|\epsilon_{\alpha\beta}|e^{i\phi_{\alpha\beta}}$) and diagonal parameters ($|\epsilon_{\alpha\alpha}-\epsilon_{\beta\beta}|$), including a CP-violating phase and a constant matter potential, under both normal (NO) and inverted mass ordering (IO) scenarios. Within these scenarios and through the lens of mode entanglement, bipartite entanglement measures such as entanglement entropy and capacity of entanglement are quantified in terms of the transition probabilities, which can be measured in neutrino oscillation experiments. Using these two bipartite entanglement measures, we further explore the quantum speed limit (QSL) time, which describes how rapidly bipartite entanglement evolves during neutrino oscillations. We illustrate our results using the baseline lengths and energies corresponding to ongoing long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments, such as T2K, NO$\nu$A, and the upcoming DUNE experiment. In the presence of a CP-violating phase and a constant matter potential, both with and without NSI effects, we compare the QSL time behavior for bipartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations for NO and IO. The most pronounced discrepancies in the QSL time for bipartite entanglement arise from the off-diagonal NSI parameter $\epsilon_{\mu\tau}$ across both the NO and IO scenarios. We emphasize that among all the experiments considered, NO$\nu$A and DUNE exhibit a rapid suppression of bipartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations in the standard oscillation scenario with NO at the end of their baseline lengths for the corresponding best-fit value of CP-violating phase. Our results hint at a possible imprint of new physics in neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>Exploring Higgs EFT in $t\bar{t}hh$ at High Luminosity LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-resonant production of a Higgs boson pair in association with a top-antitop quark pair ($pp\rightarrow t\bar{t}hh$) has only recently begun to be explored at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and provides a unique and largely uncharted probe of the top-Higgs sector, offering complementary sensitivity to the Higgs self-coupling and higher-dimensional interactions beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we present a detailed study of this process within the framework of Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). A comparative analysis is performed using a traditional cut-based approach in the single-lepton channel and a multivariate parametric boosted decision tree method in both single-lepton and dilepton final states. We derive one- and two-parameter limits at 95\% confidence level on the HEFT couplings $\delta\kappa_\lambda$, $c_2$, $c_{2g}$, and $c_{tg}$. The projected bound on $\delta\kappa_\lambda$ is weaker than current experimental constraints from dedicated Higgs-pair measurement; however, this coupling plays a critical role in shaping the multidimensional allowed parameter space. For the remaining HEFT couplings, where no direct experimental limits currently exist, our results provide the first sensitivity projections in the $t\bar{t}hh$ channel. Overall, this study demonstrates the strong potential of the $t\bar{t}hh$ production process to probe extended Higgs and top-quark interactions beyond the Standard Model through the exploitation of the $t\bar{t}hh$ data at the HL-LHC.</description>

      <title>Modified Teleparallel $f(T)$ Gravity, DESI BAO and the $H_0$ Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether late-time modifications of gravity in the teleparallel framework can impact the current tension in the Hubble constant $H_0$, focusing on $f(T)$ cosmology as a minimal and well-controlled extension of General Relativity. We consider three representative $f(T)$ parametrisations that recover the teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity at early times and deviate from it only at late epochs. The models are confronted with unanchored Pantheon+ Type~Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations, compressed Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, and redshift-space distortion data, allowing us to jointly probe the background expansion and the growth of cosmic structures. Two of the three models partially shift the inferred value of $H_0$ towards local measurements, while the third worsens the discrepancy. This behaviour is directly linked to the effective torsional dynamics, with phantom-like regimes favouring higher $H_0$ and quintessence-like regimes producing the opposite effect. A global statistical comparison shows that the minimal $f(T)$ extensions considered here are not favoured over $\Lambda$CDM by the combined data. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that late-time torsional modifications can non-trivially redistribute current cosmological tensions among the background and growth sectors.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Signals for Supernova Explosions of Three-Dimensional Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are sources of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by hydrodynamical instabilities and highly time-dependent anisotropies of the neutrino radiation. In this work we analyze both contributions to the GW signal for two state-of-the-art three-dimensional (3D) SN models computed with the Prometheus-Vertex neutrino-hydrodynamics code. In contrast to the far majority of models analyzed for GWs so far, our core-collapse simulations were started with 12.28 M_sun (18.88 M_sun) progenitors, whose final hour (7 min) of convective oxygen-shell burning was computed in 3D and featured a vigorous oxygen-neon shell merger. The corresponding large-scale asymmetries in the oxygen layer are conducive to buoyancy-aided neutrino-driven explosions. The models were continuously evolved in 3D from the pre-collapse evolution until 5.11 s (1.68 s) after the core bounce. The GW signals result from the well-known dynamical phenomena in the SN core such as prompt postshock convection, neutrino-driven convection, the standing accretion shock instability, proto-neutron star oscillations, and anisotropic ejecta expansion. They do not exhibit any new or specific features that can be unambiguously connected to the powerful pre-collapse activity in the progenitors, but we identify interesting differences compared to results in the literature. We also discuss measurement prospects by interferometers, confirming that GW signals from future Galactic SNe will be detectable with existing and next-generation experiments working in the frequency range f ~ 1-2000 Hz.</description>

      <title>QCD Scattering Amplitudes and Prescriptive Unitarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework for the maximally-transcendental part of planar QCD scattering amplitudes and perform the first bootstrap computation of six-gluon MHV amplitudes in massless QCD at the symbol level. By analyzing the maximal weight projection of amplitudes at the integrand level, we relate their maximally-transcendental parts to prescriptive unitarity integrals. This reveals a novel analytic structure: the prefactors multiplying the functions of maximal transcendentality are identified with the four-dimensional leading singularities of the theory. As a consequence, these prefactors admit a complete classification and can be computed using on-shell diagrams, a formalism originally developed in $\mathcal{N}{=}4$ super Yang-Mills theory. As a concrete application, we determine the two-loop prefactors for planar MHV gluon amplitudes at arbitrary multiplicity. Combining these prefactors with recent advances in the planar two-loop six-point function space and explicit six-point prescriptive-unitarity input, we construct a complete symbol ansatz and uniquely fix the maximally-transcendental part of the two-loop six-gluon MHV QCD amplitudes by imposing physical constraints. The resulting symbols are expressible in a reduced 137-letter alphabet, suggesting that this alphabet is complete for two-loop six-point massless MHV scattering. We also discuss the implications for multi-collinear splitting and multi-soft functions.</description>

Abstract: This review article is based on a seminar presented at the Higgs pairs workshop 2025. Stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds can serve as probe of the diverse phenomenology encountered in beyond-Standard-Model scenarios featuring phase transitions in the early Universe. Focussing on gravitational wave production from first-order phase transitions, we present the main results of a recent analysis by the LISA Cosmology Working Group concerning the detectability of such signals with LISA. Strong degeneracies, both among the parameters controlling the phase transition and between these and the parameters of the beyond-Standard-Model scenario underlying the phase transition, complicate the reconstruction of the model from a potential signal. Nonetheless, once a specific scenario is assumed, LISA observations can supply constraints possibly complementary to those obtainable from present and future particle colliders.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a 3.0$\sigma$ Deviation in Gravitational Light Deflection from General Relativity at Cosmological Scales with KiDS-Legacy and CMB Lensing</title>

Abstract: General Relativity (GR) faces challenges from cosmic acceleration and observational tensions, necessitating stringent tests at cosmological scales. In this work, we probe GR deviations via a $\mu$-$\Sigma$ modified gravity parameterization, integrating KiDS-Legacy weak lensing (1347 deg$^2$, $z\leq 2.0$), joint CMB data (Planck/ACT/SPT), DESI DR2 BAO, and DES-Dovekie supernovae. KiDS-Legacy significantly improves constraint precision: $\mu_0$ (matter clustering) by $\sim 43\%$ and $\Sigma_0$ (gravitational light deflection) by $\sim 60\%$ relative to CMB alone. In the $\Lambda$CDM background, $\mu_0 = 0.21\pm 0.21$ is consistent with GR, while $\Sigma_0 = 0.149\pm 0.051$ deviates from GR at the 3.0$\sigma$ level -- attributed to large-scale CMB lensing from ACT/SPT. This precise separation of GR-consistent matter clustering and deviant light deflection provides key observational clues for new physics or data systematics. Our work underscores the critical role of synergizing high-precision CMB and WL data in advancing GR tests.</description>

      <title>Jet-associated Balance Functions of Charged and Identified Hadrons in pp Collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV using PYTHIA8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of charge balance functions inside jets in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV using the PYTHIA8 event generator. The balance function is a differential observable of opposite-charge correlations, which is calculated in the jet frame for inclusive charged hadrons and the identified $\pi$, $K$, and $p$. The results show a clear narrowing of the balancing width with increasing jet charged multiplicity, indicating that particle production becomes more localized in momentum space in high-multiplicity jets.This trend resembles features attributed to collective expansion in heavy-ion collisions. The species dependence highlights sensitivity to the redistribution of strangeness and baryon number during string fragmentation and color reconnection. The new CR tune yields a little broader proton balance-function width in $\Delta\phi^{*}$ than CP5, hinting at enhanced baryon-production dynamics, whereas meson widths differ only mildly. These comparisons suggest that multiparton interactions and color reconnection contribute to the observed trends, potentially generating collective like features inside jets, especially in high multiplicity jets, via nontrivial color dynamics alongside standard fragmentation. Taken together, the results establish identified hadron balance functions in high multiplicity jets as a sensitive probe of hadronization and provide new constraints for models of small system collectivity.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy and femtoscopic correlation function of the $B\bar{D}$, $B=(N, \Delta)$ system in quark delocalization color screening model</title>

Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the pentaquark systems with quark contents $qqqq\bar{c}$ with the analyzed total spin and parity quantum numbers of $J^{P}=\frac{1}{2}^{-}$, $J^{P}=\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ and $J^{P}=\frac{5}{2}^{-}$, in the I=0, I=1 and I=2 isospin channels. The effective potentials between baryon and meson clusters are given, and the possible bound states are also investigated. Also, the study of the scattering process of the open channels is performed to identify possible resonance states. Our estimations indicate that several possible bound states and narrow baryon-meson resonances are found from corresponding the calculation processes. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental measurement, we also extract the low-energy scattering parameters and compute the femtoscopic correlation functions for the $N\bar{D}$ system using the CATS framework. The results demonstrate that the predicted $I=0$ bound state manifests as a significant enhancement at low momentum accompanied by a characteristic suppression. In contrast, the $I=1$ correlations remain relatively flat as the predicted resonances are kinematically distant from the threshold. The $I=2$ sector exhibits strong spin dependence, where the bound state signal in the $J=1/2^{-}$ channel is largely masked by repulsive components in spin-averaged observables. This cancellation effect suggests that future experimental searches at ALICE and LHCb may require spin-selective measurements to identify such states. These predictions provide crucial theoretical guidance for future experiments.</description>

Abstract: The rotation effect on the QCD properties is an open question. We study the dynamic gluon mass in a dense QCD matter, the rotation is introduced by taking a covariant transformation between the flat and curved spaces. The law of causality which restricts the rotation strength of the system is carefully considered in the calculation. we find that the rotation effect is not monotonous. Overall, it behaves like an anti-screening effect, reflecting in the decreasing gluon mass, but the strength changes with the rotation. For a QCD matter with low baryon density, the screening effect in the flat space can be completely canceled by the rotation, and gluons are confined in a strongly rotating matter. When the rotation is extremely high, the matter approaches to a weakly interacting gas.</description>

      <title>Advancing the phenomenology of GeV-scale axion-like particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04525v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searches for axion-like particles (ALPs) with masses in the GeV range are a central objective of present and future Intensity Frontier experiments. Interpreting these searches demands a reliable description of ALP production in hadronic collisions and decay. The prescription currently adopted by the community (i) depends on parameters of unphysical chiral rotation used to match gluonic ALP interactions with the interactions in terms of hadronic bound states, (ii) misdescribes the mass scaling of the ALP flux, and neglects mixing with heavy pseudoscalar resonances. We introduce a framework that treats GeV-scale ALP interactions in a chiral-rotation-invariant manner, includes their mixing with heavier excitations $\pi(1300)$, $\eta(1295)$, and $\eta(1440)$, and properly describes their production channels. When applying our description to proton beam experiments, we find that existing bounds and projected sensitivities shift by up to an order of magnitude relative to earlier estimates. We further delineate the dominant theoretical uncertainties, which originate from the still-incomplete experimental knowledge of the spectrum of pseudoscalar excitations.</description>

      <title>Momentum Flow Mechanisms and Color-Lorentz Forces on Quarks in the Nucleon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Momentum conservation in the nucleon is examined in terms of continuous flow of the momentum current density (or in short, momentum flow), which receives contributions from both kinetic motion and interacting forces involving quarks and gluons. While quarks conduct momentum flow through their kinetic motion and the gluon scalar (anomaly) contributes via pure interactions, the gluon stress tensor has both effects. The quarks momentum flow encodes the information of the color-Lorentz force density on them, and the momentum conservation allows to trace its origin to the gluon tensor and anomaly (a ``negative pressure'' potential). From the state-of-the-art lattice calculations and experimental fits on the form factors of the QCD energy-momentum tensor, we exhibit pictures of the momentum flow and the color-Lorentz forces on the quarks in the nucleon. In particular, the anomaly contributes a critical attractive force with a strength similar to that of a heavy-quark confinement potential.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Positivity Bounds on Higgs-Portal Light Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational positivity bounds are constraints on a renormalizable theory in the presence of a massless graviton, under the assumption that the gravitational theory is ultraviolet-completed by a perturbative string theory. We derive these bounds for the Higgs-portal scalar dark matter model using the forward scattering process $\phi \phi \to \phi \phi$. We find that, in the absence of a dark matter self-coupling, new physics beyond the Higgs-portal dark matter interaction must appear below an energy scale of $10^{10}$ GeV if the dark matter mass is smaller than the Higgs boson mass. The presence of a dark matter self-coupling alters this situation. A hierarchy between the dark matter four-point self-coupling $\lambda_{\phi}$ and a tiny Higgs-portal coupling $\lambda_{h\phi}$ is required to raise the energy scale at which the new physics appears. If $\lambda_{\phi}/\lambda_{h\phi} = 10^{12}$, the dark matter model can remain valid up to the grand unified theory (GUT) scale or the typical string scale. In this case, the relic abundance of dark matter in the Universe can be reproduced via the dark freeze-out scenario. A parameter set with $\lambda_{\phi} \sim O(1)$, $\lambda_{h\phi} \sim 10^{-12}$, and a sub-GeV dark matter mass can accommodate the GUT-scale $\Lambda$ within the Higgs-portal light dark matter framework.</description>

      <title>Revising the Mass of Light Hybrid Mesons: NLO QCD Sum Rules Point to $\phi(2170)$ as a Prime Candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD sum rule analysis for light hybrid mesons with $J^{PC}=1^{--}$, incorporating condensates up to dimension-8 and NLO corrections to the perturbative, gluon condensate, and four-quark condensate contributions. These corrections are found to be substantial and reveal the necessity of contributions beyond leading order. Employing both Laplace (LSR) and Gaussian (GSR) sum rules, our analysis predicts a mass in the conservative range of $2.1-2.4\,\text{GeV}$ for the light $1^{--}$ hybrid. These predictions are significantly lower than previous leading-order (LO) estimates (around $2.9\,\text{GeV}$) and bridge the gap between QCD sum rules and other approaches. Our findings establish the $\phi(2170)$ resonance as a prime candidate for the light vector hybrid meson.</description>

      <title>Updated Bounds on the Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model from LHC Dilepton Resonance Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Left-Right model is a popular extension of the Standard Model that features three new neutral gauge bosons, $W^{\pm}_R$ and $Z_R$. Collider searches for a Left-Right symmetry are often concentrated on the charged right-handed current, but in this work, we take advantage of the dilepton data at the LHC with center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and 139 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity to place lower mass bounds in the $Z_R$ mass based on the $p\,p \rightarrow Z_{R} \rightarrow \ell^{+} \, \ell^{-}$ process. We vary the $SU(2)_R$ gauge coupling from $g_{R}=0.4$ to $g_{R}=1.0$, and impose $M_{Z_R}&gt;4.9$ TeV and $M_{Z_{R}}&gt;6.1$ TeV, respectively. Lastly, we put our findings into perspective with $W_R$ searches at the LHC and show that our limits cover an unexplored region of parameter space, where the right-handed neutrino is heavier than the $W_R$ boson.</description>

      <title>Probing displaced (dark)photons from low reheating freeze-in at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the Standard Model (SM) by introducing a $U(1)'$ gauge boson and a real pseudo-scalar field, both odd under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The resulting low-energy spectrum consists of a stable vector as the dark matter candidate, and a pseudo-scalar mediator, which interacts with the SM via a Higgs portal coupling and a dimension-five portal connecting it to both the dark and visible photons. We explore the freeze-in of both particles at low reheating temperature, finding a rich yield evolution dynamics in the early Universe. This setup brings a consistent dark matter scenario in which the dark photon relic abundance is generated through freeze-in at low reheating temperatures. In addition to its cosmological viability, the model can be tested at the LHC: Higgs bosons can decay into dark photons and displaced visible photons via the long-lived mediator. These signatures allow us to constrain the Higgs portal coupling using recent searches for non-pointing photons and limits on invisible or undetected Higgs decays. We derive meaningful constraints on the dark matter parameter space, in particular excluding a thermalized mediator in the region compatible with the observed relic abundance.</description>

      <title>A Journey of Seeking Pressure and Forces in the Nucleon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Momentum current density (MCD) $T^{ij}$ is a general physics concept describing the momentum conservation through momentum flow generated from both the kinetic motion of particles and the interacting forces among them. It has been suggested by M. Polyakov et al. that the MCD in the nucleon, characterized by the form factor $C/D$ of the QCD energy-momentum tensor, can be interpreted as the pressure and shear forces between adjacent parts of the system because the nucleon interior approximates a continuous medium. While intuitively appealing, we find that the interpretation is hard to justify from a detailed examination of the physical mechanisms for the momentum flow in QCD. After reviewing through a broad range of classical and quantum systems, we find that while thermal and/or quantum average of isotropic motion contributes to kinetic MCD a pressure term proportional to $\delta^{ij}$, when there is an anisotropic motion, the pressure cannot simply be identified from the MCD tensor. Furthermore, kinetic pressure cannot be considered as the surface force between adjacent parts of a system. More importantly, at the scale of the nucleon dimension, the color forces among quarks and gluons is by no means short-ranged as in a continuous medium, and the resulting interaction MCD cannot be interpreted as normal or shear ``stress'' force, although an isotropic term from the QCD trace anomaly may be interpreted as a ``vacuum pressure.'' Following our previous study of force densities through divergences of kinetic MCDs, we affirm that the vacuum pressure term provides a confining potential on the quarks through color Lorentz forces.</description>

      <title>Reviving the energy-dependent partonic structure of $f_0(980)$ via two-pion distribution amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for analyzing four-body semileptonic weak decays, performing the first high-twist analysis of the $D_s \to \left[ \pi\pi \right]_{\rm S}$ form factors using light-cone distribution amplitudes for the isoscalar two-pion state ($2\pi$DAs). It is motivated by persistent tensions between phenomenological cascade analyses and QCD-based interpretations of the partonic structure of $f_0$ meson. Our study reveals that the twist-3 $2\pi$DAs incorporate an asymmetry in the partial-wave expansion, a feature absent in single $f_0$ distribution amplitudes, that drives a substantial cancellation between twist-2 and twist-3 contributions to the form factors. As a result, the predicted decay rate falls significantly below the experimental value. These findings indicate that the isoscalar two-pion system near the charm scale is not primarily a $q{\bar q}$ state, reviving the energy-dependent partonic structures of light scalar mesons by highlighting a fundamental limitation of the single-meson LCDA approach in describing such complex systems.</description>

Abstract: We examine the spectrum of the $\Sigma\,(\frac{1}{2}^-)$ family based on the experimental $K^-p$ scattering data and lattice QCD simulations within the Hamiltonian Effective Field Theory. Especially, two different scenarios are constructed in order to clarify whether there is one or two $\Sigma\,(\frac{1}{2}^-)$ resonances with masses around 1.5$\sim$1.7 GeV. The relevant lattice QCD data support our scenario with two resonance poles at $1687-110\,i$ and $1714-14\,i$ MeV in which the bare strange triquark core plays an important role. We also show an extra clear cusp structure around 1.4 GeV in our scattering T matrices associated with the odd-parity strange baryons.</description>

      <title>Noninflationary solution to the monopole problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles are a long-standing prediction of Grand Unified Theories, yet their efficient production in early universe phase transitions would lead to a monopole abundance that far exceeds observational limits. The standard solution of the problem invokes inflation occurring after monopole production, diluting their density to undetectable levels and eliminating any possibility of present-day observation. Here, we propose an alternative solution based on the breaking, in the early universe prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, of the Weyl conformal symmetry of the gauge kinetic sector of the Lagrangian. This mechanism enhances monopole annihilation, thereby reducing their abundance to acceptable levels without requiring inflation. This scenario also predicts a residual flux of GUT monopoles potentially within the sensitivity of current and upcoming cosmic ray detectors, making their discovery possible in the near future.</description>

      <title>Emission of Nambu-Goldstone bosons from the semilocal string network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semilocal cosmic string is a line-like non-topological soliton associated with the breakdown of the $SU(2)_{\rm global} \times U(1)_{\rm gauge}$ symmetry to the $U(1)_{\rm global}$ symmetry. The broken phase has two massless Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes as dynamical fields, and they can be emitted by semilocal strings. In this paper, we numerically show that such NG bosons are copiously produced with the evolution of the semilocal string network in the early universe. Our numerical analysis shows that the spectrum of produced particles has a peak at low momenta corresponding to the horizon scale. If the emitted NG bosons acquire mass due to soft-breaking terms, they can take the role of dark matter. This scenario typically predicts very light pseudo NG boson dark matter.</description>

      <title>Two-loop anomalous dimensions for baryon-number-violating operators in SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the two-loop renormalization-group equations for the baryon-number-violating dimension-six operators in the SMEFT. This includes all three gauge interactions, the Yukawa, and Higgs self-interaction contributions. In addition, we present the one-loop matching of the $S_1$ scalar leptoquark on the SMEFT, which can generate the Wilson coefficients of all four gauge-invariant baryon-number-violating SMEFT operators. Using this example, we demonstrate the cancellation of scheme and matching-scale dependences. Together with the known two-loop renormalization-group evolution below the electroweak scale in the LEFT, as well as the one-loop matching of SMEFT onto LEFT, our results enable consistent next-to-leading-log analyses of nucleon decays, provided that the relevant matrix elements are known at next-to-leading-order accuracy.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Properties of the Proton from a Deformed AdS Holographic Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gravitational form factors of the proton and some of its mechanical properties. We use a holographic model based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, in which a deformation in the anti-de Sitter background geometry is considered. By describing the proton as a Dirac field in this background, we numerically evaluate the gloun contribution of its gravitational form factors $A$ and $C$ from its energy-momentum tensor. A comparison of our numerical results with respect to some lattice QCD results and previous results in holography is made. In general, a good agreement is found. We also evaluate the term $D$ and make use of it to compute the pressure and shear distributions in the system, which result in a stable composed particle interpretation consistent with the von Laue stability condition. The energy distribution in the system is also obtained. Internal forces are investigated to support this picture. We are also able to compute the radii associated with these distributions in the proton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown in this paper that the QCD equations for dipole density have the natural solution: the 'fan' diagrams of the Pomeron calculus. We found the dipole densities comparing the analytic solution to the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation for the simplified leading twist kernel with the $t$ channel unitarity. Using these densities we calculate the contributions of large Pomeron loops to dipole-dipole scattering at high energies. Applying the Abramovsky,Gribov and Kancheli cutting rules we found that the produced gluons are distributed accordingly the KNO (Koba, Nielsen and Olesen) law which leads to the entropy $S_E = \ln(x G(x,Q^2))$ in an agreement with Kharzeev - Levin predictions.</description>

      <title>New modular fixed point models and their phenomenological implications for JUNO, T2HK and DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a general analysis of minimal modular fixed point models based on two right-handed neutrinos (2RHNs) and three modular fixed points, and find that the only viable possibilities are based on modular $S_4'$ and $A_5$ symmetry. Such models are highly predictive, with neutrino masses and the lepton mixing mixing matrix being fixed by three real parameters, as in the Littlest Seesaw Models. We perform an exhaustive scan over all possible models in this class and find many viable fixed points and modular form alignments, after confronting them with the latest neutrino oscillation global fits. The resulting models have the new feature that the two Dirac columns take more general forms than traditional Littlest Seesaw models, resulting in new sum rule relations between the solar and reactor angles, beyond those associated with TM1 (where the first column of the tri-bimaximal mixing matrix is preserved), which are compared to present and future projected JUNO results. We also compare the predictions of these models for the atmospheric angle and CP violating phase to current global fits and future T2HK and DUNE sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Constraints on birefringence-free photon theory within standard-model extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constraints on the birefringence-free subset of Lorentz-violating (LV) operators are derived using 14 GRB photons in the GeV-band. These constraints target the isotropic $c_{(I)00}^{(d)}$ coefficients for dimensions $d=6,8,10$ within the framework of the Standard-Model Extension (SME). Employing theory-agnostic Bayesian parameter estimation methods, our analysis indicates a preference for subluminal LV effects. Focusing on this case, we further refine the parameter constraints, yielding results that are mutually consistent. Within the 95\% posterior credible interval, our constraints yield the bounds, $|c_{(I)00}^{(6)}|\le7.75 \times 10^{-20} ~ {\rm GeV}^{-2}$, $|c_{(I)00}^{(8)}|\le4.92 \times 10^{-24} ~ {\rm GeV}^{-4}$, and $|c_{(I)00}^{(10)}|\le3.46 \times 10^{-28} ~ {\rm GeV}^{-6}$, which improve upon the most stringent credible-interval bounds reported in the literature by at least five orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Can negative bare couplings make sense? The $\vec{\phi}^4$ theory at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02516v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar $\lambda\phi^4$ theory in 3+1D, for a positive coupling constant $\lambda&gt;0$, is known to have no interacting continuum limit, which is referred to as quantum triviality. However, it has been recently argued that the theory in 3+1D with an $N$-component scalar $\vec{\phi}$ and a $(\vec{\phi}\cdot\vec{\phi})^{\,2}=\vec{\phi}^{\,4}$ interaction term does have an interacting continuum limit at large $N$. It has been suggested that this continuum limit has a negative (bare) coupling constant and exhibits asymptotic freedom, similar to the $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric $-g\phi^4$ field theory. In this paper I study the $\vec{\phi}^{\,4}$ theory in 3+1D at large $N$ with a negative coupling constant $-g&lt;0$, and with the scalar field taking values in a $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric complex domain. The theory is non-trivial, has asymptotic freedom, and has a Landau pole in the IR, and I demonstrate that the thermal partition function matches that of the positive-coupling $\lambda&gt;0$ theory when the Landau poles of the two theories (in the $\lambda&gt;0$ case a pole in the UV) are identified with one another. The spirit of renormalization is that observables do not depend on the renormalization scale. Here we see even if the coupling is taken negative above the scale of the Landau pole, thermodynamic observables are unaffected. Thus the $\vec{\phi}^{\,4}$ theory at large $N$ appears to have a negative bare coupling constant; the coupling only becomes positive in the IR, which in the context of other $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric and large-$N$ quantum field theories I argue is perfectly acceptable.</description>

      <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Gravitational Wave Searches above 10 kHz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first direct measurement of gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations has opened up new avenues to explore our Universe. This white paper outlines the challenges and gains expected in gravitational-wave searches at frequencies above the LIGO/Virgo band. The scarcity of possible astrophysical sources in most of this frequency range provides a unique opportunity to discover physics beyond the Standard Model operating both in the early and late Universe, and we highlight some of the most promising of these sources. We review several detector concepts that have been proposed to take up this challenge, and compare their expected sensitivity with the signal strength predicted in various models. This report is the summary of a series of workshops on the topic of high-frequency gravitational wave detection, held in 2019 (ICTP, Trieste, Italy), 2021 (online) and 2023 (CERN, Geneva, Switzerland).</description>

      <title>Power law $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider a generalization of Starobinsky inflation obtained by combining power law ($R^\beta$), and $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation ($E$-model). The Einstein frame potential for this model is that of power law Starobinsky inflation modified by a parameter $\alpha$ in the exponential. After computing power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations numerically, we perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on the potential parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $M$, and the number of e-foldings $N_{pivot}$ during inflation, using Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18), DES and BAO observations. We find $\log_{10}\alpha= 0.37^{+0.82}_{-0.85}$, $\beta = 1.969^{+0.020}_{-0.023}$, $M=\left(3.54^{+2.62}_{-1.73}\right)\times 10^{-5}$ and $N_{pivot} = 47\pm{10}$. With these mean values of the potential parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and varying $N_{pivot}$ between $40$ to $55$, we also find that the $r-n_s$ predictions of our model lie well within the $1\sigma$ bounds of joint constraints from combined analysis of ACT, Planck-2018, BICEP and BAO observations. We compute the Bayesian evidences for our proposed model, power law Starobinsky inflation, $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation and Starobinsky inflation. Considering the Starobinsky model as the base model, we calculate the Bayes factor and find that our proposed model is mildly favored by the CMB and LSS observations.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum dynamics of vortex particles in accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experiments with spin-polarized beams of leptons and hadrons typically employ plane-wave states with definite momenta and energies. In contrast, vortex states represent cylindrical waves carrying a well-defined orbital angular momentum projection along the propagation direction. This projection can be arbitrarily large, endowing such particles with magnetic moments orders of magnitude greater than those of plane-wave states. Consequently, vortex particles could complement - or even replace - spin-polarized beams in high-energy collisions, enabling access to observables beyond the reach of the conventional states. Although relativistic vortex beams have yet to be realized, we investigate the radiative and non-radiative dynamics of angular momentum for vortex particles in accelerators. We compute the timescale for angular momentum loss via photon emission, finding it significantly longer than typical acceleration times. The non-radiative dynamics is governed by precession, with the orbital angular momentum precessing at a frequency markedly different from that of spin. Similar to spin tunes in circular accelerators, this can induce resonances that disrupt the beam's orbital momentum - occurring far more frequently for vortex beams than for spin-polarized ones. Thus, vortex particle acceleration can be more feasible in linacs, while Siberian snakes could serve as a tool for angular momentum manipulations.</description>

      <title>$\nu p$-process in Core-Collapse Supernovae: Imprints of General Relativistic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of a number of proton-rich isotopes in the solar system has been a long-standing puzzle. A promising explanation is the $\nu p$-process, which is posited to operate in the neutrino-driven outflows that form inside core-collapse supernovae after shock revival. While recent studies have analyzed several relevant physical effects that influence the efficiency of this process, the impact of General Relativity (GR) on it remains unexplored. We perform a comparative analysis of the time-integrated $\nu p$-process yields in Newtonian and fully GR calculations, using detailed models of time-evolving outflow profiles. The GR effects are seen to suppress the production of seed nuclei, significantly boosting the resulting $p$-nuclide abundances. Our reference GR model, with an 18~$M_\odot$ progenitor, reproduces both the relative and absolute solar system abundances of the entire set of the $p$ nuclides in the mass range $74\leq A\leq102$. The yields are suboptimal in our 12.75~$M_\odot$ GR model, where the outflow transitions to the supersonic regime several seconds into the explosion, suppressing further $p$-nuclide production. In both models, most of the production of the crucial $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$ $p$ isotopes occurs relatively early, 1--3 seconds after shock revival. In contrast, a large fraction of the shielded isotope $^{92}{\rm Nb}$ is produced in the subsequent ejecta. The impact of GR on this isotope is especially large, with its final abundance boosted by a factor of 25 compared to a Newtonian calculation. In summary, with the GR effects taken into account, the $\nu p$-process in a sufficiently massive progenitor can provide a unifying explanation for the origin of all $p$ nuclei in the solar system up to $^{102}$Pd.</description>

      <title>A quantum information method for early universe with non-trivial sound speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many quantum gravitational frameworks, such as DBI inflation, k-essence, and effective field theories obtained by integrating out heavy modes, can lead to a non-trivial sound speed. Meanwhile, our universe can be described as an open system. Under the non-trivial sound speed, we employ the method of open quantum systems combined with Arnoldi iterations to study the Krylov complexity throughout the early universe, including the inflationary, radiation-dominated, and matter-dominated epochs. A key ingredient in our analysis is the open two-mode squeezed state formalism and the generalized Lanczos algorithm. To numerically compute the Krylov complexity, we are the first time to derive the evolution equations for the parameters $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ within an open two-mode squeezed state. Our results indicate that the Krylov complexity exhibits a similar trend in both the standard case and the case with non-trivial sound speed. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we also investigate the Krylov entropy for completeness. The evolution of the Krylov entropy shows a clear difference between the standard case and the non-trivial sound speed case. Furthermore, based on the behavior of the Lanczos coefficients, we find that the case of non-trivial sound speed behaves as a maximally chaotic system. However, our numerical results suggest that the Krylov complexity does not saturate to a constant value due to the huge expansion of spacetime background. This study offers a new perspective for exploring the early universe through the quantum information.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Measuring $CP$-Violation in $B_s^0 \rightarrow \phi \mu^+\mu^-$ via Time-Dependent Angular Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the prospects for performing a time-dependent angular analysis of $B_s^0 \rightarrow \phi \mu^+\mu^-$ decays at hadron colliders, and introduces new optimised angular observables associated with $B_s^0$-mixing in the decay rate. The time-dependent normalised decay rate and corresponding probability density function is presented both for when the flavour of the $B_s^0$ meson at production is tagged and when it is untagged. The normalised angular terms linked to $B_s^0$-mixing in the tagged (untagged) case are denoted $\mathcal{Z}_i$ ($\mathcal{H}_i$), and their optimised counterparts as $Q_i$ ($\mathcal{M}_i$).
  The expected sensitivities of these observables at the end of Run 3, Run 4, and Run 5 of the LHC are determined using pseudoexperiments generated with a decay-time resolution, background level, and signal yield similar to those reported by the LHCb collaboration. It is found that all observables can be extracted with Run 3 statistics, and that the $\mathcal{H}_i$ and $\mathcal{Z}_i$ observables have similar sensitivity, despite the former being suppressed by mixing terms. Moreover, the angular observables only accessible via flavour tagging, such as the equivalent of $P_5^{\prime}$ in the $B^0_s$ system, are found to exhibit sensitivities comparable to current measurements in $B^0 \rightarrow K^{\ast 0} \mu^+\mu^-$ decays once Run 5 datasets are available. Fits to the observables to extract the Wilson coefficients show a significant increase in precision when either the observables accessible via time-dependent analysis, or flavour tagging, are included. A marked increase in sensitivity to $CP$-violating short-distance effects is observed for a subset of the new optimised $M_i$ and $Q_i$ observables.</description>

      <title>Neutron star cooling implications and magnetic field of the Vela Junior central compact object from all XMM-Newton and Chandra spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The central compact object (CCO) in the Vela Junior supernova remnant is a young neutron star whose relatively low X-ray flux and small distance suggest it has a mass high enough to activate fast neutrino cooling processes. Here we analyse all XMM-Newton MOS and pn and Chandra ACIS-S spectra of the Vela Junior CCO, with observations taking place over the 9 years from 2001 to 2010. We find that the best-fit flux and spectral model parameters do not vary significantly when treating each observation independently, and therefore we fit all the spectra simultaneously using various spectral models to characterize the predominantly thermal emission from the neutron star surface. Our results indicate the Vela Junior CCO has an atmosphere composed of hydrogen, a hot spot temperature (unredshifted) of 3.5x10^6 K, and a colder surface temperature of (6.6-8.8)x10^5 K. Possible absorption lines at ~0.6 keV and 0.9 keV provide evidence for the first-time of an average surface magnetic field B~3x10^10 G for this CCO, which is similar to the magnetic field of other CCOs. At the accurate new Vela Junior distance of 1.4 kpc, the observed luminosity that is dominated by the hot spot is ~5x10^32 erg s^-1. The luminosity from the rest of the colder surface is (1.3-4.0)x10^32 erg s^-1. The cool luminosity and temperature imply the Vela Junior CCO is indeed colder than many other young neutron stars and probably has a high mass that triggered fast neutrino cooling.</description>

      <title>Conservative Black Hole Scattering at Fifth Post-Minkowskian and Second Self-Force Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory formalism, we compute the conservative scattering angle and impulse for classical black hole scattering at fifth post-Minkowskian (5PM) order by providing the second self-force (2SF) contributions. This four-loop calculation involves non-planar Feynman integrals and requires advanced integration-by-parts reduction, novel differential-equation strategies, and efficient boundary-integral algorithms to solve a system of hundreds of master integrals in four integral families on high-performance computing systems. The resulting function space includes multiple polylogarithms as well as iterated integrals with a K3 period, which generate a spurious velocity divergence at $v/c=\sqrt{8}/3$. This divergence is present in the potential region and must be canceled by contributions from the radiative memory region, while its dimensional-regularisation pole should cancel against the radiative tail region. We find that the standard use of Feynman propagators to access the conservative sector fails to ensure this cancellation. We propose a conservative propagator prescription which realises both cancellations leading to a physically sensible answer. All available low-velocity checks of our result against the post-Newtonian literature are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension as an Effect of Horizon Entanglement Nonequilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an infrared mechanism for alleviating the Hubble constant tension, based on a small departure from entanglement equilibrium at the cosmological apparent horizon. If the horizon entanglement entropy falls slightly below the Bekenstein-Hawking value, we parametrize the shortfall by a fractional deficit $\delta(a)$ evolving with the FLRW scale factor $a$. The associated equipartition deficit at the Gibbons-Hawking temperature then sources a smooth, homogeneous component whose density scales as $H^{2}/G$, with a dimensionless coefficient $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ of order unity times $\delta(a)$. Because this component tracks $H^{2}$, it is negligible at early times but can activate at redshifts $z\lesssim 1$, raising the late time expansion rate by a few percent without affecting recombination or the sound horizon. We present a minimal three parameter activation model for $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ and derive its impact on the background expansion, effective equation of state, and linear growth for a smooth entanglement sector. The framework predicts a small boost in $H(z)$, a mild suppression of $f\sigma_{8}(z)$, and a corresponding modification of the low-$z$ distance-redshift relation. We test these predictions against current low-redshift data sets, including SN~Ia distance moduli, baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements, cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and redshift space distortion constraints, and discuss whether the $H_0$ tension can be consistently interpreted as a late-time, horizon-scale information deficit rather than an early universe modification.</description>

      <title>Localization-delocalization transition at weak coupling in two-color matrix QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the matrix model of two-color one-flavor adjoint QCD (matrix-QCD$_{2,1}^{\text{adj}}$) in the weak coupling regime (small $g$) and in the chiral limit. The Yang-Mills potential has two distinct gauge invariant minima: one at $A_i=0$ and the other at $A_i = \frac{\sigma_i}{2g}$. We show that when the chiral chemical potential $c \leq \frac{3}{2}$, there is a quantum phase transition at $g_0^\ast \simeq 0.143$: for $g&lt;g_0^\ast$, the ground state wavefunction is localized near $A_i=0$, while for $g&gt;g_0^\ast$, the ground state is delocalized over the gauge configuration space. The transition between these two phases is singular, with the ground state at $g_0^\ast$ being distinctly different from that of $g_0^\ast \pm|\epsilon|$. At $g_0^\ast$, we show that the square of the chromoelectric field vanishes, strongly suggesting that the system is in a ``dual superconductor" phase. Numerical evidence shows that the localization-delocalization phenomenon holds for the 1st and 2nd excited states as well, leading us to conjecture that there are an infinite number of isolated singular points $g_0^\ast&gt; g_1^\ast&gt;g_2^\ast&gt; \cdots$ accumulating to $g=0$. For $c=1$, the model formally possesses $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry. We show that in the localized phase (i.e. for $g&lt;g_0^\ast$) the supermultiplet structure is disrupted and SUSY is spontaneously broken.</description>
