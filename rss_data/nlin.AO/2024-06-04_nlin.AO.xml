      <title>Multistable Physical Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are inspired by the brain, are a central pillar in the ongoing breakthrough in artificial intelligence. In recent years, researchers have examined mechanical implementations of ANNs, denoted as Physical Neural Networks (PNNs). PNNs offer the opportunity to view common materials and physical phenomena as networks, and to associate computational power with them. In this work, we incorporated mechanical bistability into PNNs, enabling memory and a direct link between computation and physical action. To achieve this, we consider an interconnected network of bistable liquid-filled chambers. We first map all possible equilibrium configurations or steady states, and then examine their stability. Building on these maps, both global and local algorithms for training multistable PNNs are implemented. These algorithms enable us to systematically examine the network's capability to achieve stable output states and thus the network's ability to perform computational tasks. By incorporating PNNs and multistability, we can design structures that mechanically perform tasks typically associated with electronic neural networks, while directly obtaining physical actuation. The insights gained from our study pave the way for the implementation of intelligent structures in smart tech, metamaterials, medical devices, soft robotics, and other fields.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Crowd Egress with Environmental Stressors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01393v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a modeling framework to characterize evacuee response to environmental stimuli during emergency egress. The model is developed in consistency with stress theory, which explains how an organism reacts to environmental stressors. We integrate the theory into the well-known social-force model, and develop a framework to simulate crowd evacuation behavior in multi-compartment buildings. Our method serves as a theoretical basis to study crowd movement at bottlenecks, and simulate their herding and way-finding behavior in normal and hazardous conditions. The pre-movement behavior is also briefly investigated by using opinion dynamics with social group model. The algorithms have been partly tested in FDS+EVAC as well as our simulation platform crowdEgress.</description>

      <title>The Origin and Evolution of Information Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge when describing the origin of life is to explain "how instructional information control systems emerge naturally and spontaneously from mere molecular dynamics". So far, no one has clarified how information control emerged ab initio and how primitive control mechanisms in life might have evolved, becoming increasingly refined. Based on recent experimental results showing that chemical computation does not require the presence of life-related chemistry, we elucidate the origin and early evolution of information handling by chemical automata, from information processing (computation) to information storage (memory) and information transmission (communication) and later digital messengers, covering at the same time its syntactic, semantic and pragmatic flavors. In contrast to other theories that assume the existence of initial complex structures, our representation starts from trivial self-replicators whose interaction leads to the arising of more powerful molecular machines. By describing precisely the primordial transitions in chemistry-based computation, our framework is capable of explaining the above-mentioned gaps and can be translated to other models of computation, which allow us to explore biological phenomena at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Being compatible with the free energy principle, we have developed a computational enactivist theoretical framework that could be able to describe from the origin of life to higher-level cognition, as if it were a purely constructivist narrative. At the end of our manuscript, we propose some ways to extend our ideas, including experimental validation of our theory (both in vitro and in silico).</description>
