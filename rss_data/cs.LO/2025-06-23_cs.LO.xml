      <title>Modal Logic for Stratified Becoming: Actualization Beyond Possible Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article develops a novel framework for modal logic based on the idea of stratified actualization, rather than the classical model of global possible worlds. Traditional Kripke semantics treat modal operators as quantification over fully determinate alternatives, neglecting the local, dynamic, and often asymmetric nature of actualization processes. We propose a system Stratified Actualization Logic (SAL) in which modalities are indexed by levels of ontological stability, interpreted as admissibility regimes. Each modality operates over a structured layer of possibility, grounded in the internal coherence of transitions between layers. We formally define the syntax and semantics of SAL, introduce its axioms, and prove soundness and completeness. Applications are discussed in connection with temporal becoming, quantum decoherence domains, and modal metaphysics. The result is a logic that captures the ontological structure of actualization without recourse to abstract possible worlds, offering a stratified alternative to standard modal realism.</description>

      <title>Beyond Prediction -- Structuring Epistemic Integrity in Artificial Reasoning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive framework for artificial intelligence systems that operate under strict epistemic constraints, moving beyond stochastic language prediction to support structured reasoning, propositional commitment, and contradiction detection. It formalises belief representation, metacognitive processes, and normative verification, integrating symbolic inference, knowledge graphs, and blockchain-based justification to ensure truth-preserving, auditably rational epistemic agents.</description>

      <title>ARCH-COMP25 Category Report: Stochastic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report is concerned with a friendly competition for formal verification and policy synthesis of stochastic models. The main goal of the report is to introduce new benchmarks and their properties within this category and recommend next steps toward next year's edition of the competition. In particular, this report introduces three recently developed software tools, a new water distribution network benchmark, and a collection of simplified benchmarks intended to facilitate further comparisons among tools that were previously not directly comparable. This friendly competition took place as part of the workshop Applied Verification for Continuous and Hybrid Systems (ARCH) in Summer 2025.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Model-Checking Quantum Pushdown Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of model-checking quantum pushdown systems from a computational complexity point of view. We arrive at the following equally important, interesting new results:
  We first extend the notions of the {\it probabilistic pushdown systems} and {\it Markov chains} to their quantum analogues and investigate the question of whether it is necessary to define a quantum analogue of {\it probabilistic computational tree logic} to describe the probabilistic and branching-time properties of the {\it quantum Markov chain}. We study its model-checking question and show that model-checking of {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems (qBPA)} against {\it probabilistic computational tree logic (PCTL)} is generally undecidable, i.e., there exists no algorithm for model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} against {\it probabilistic computational tree logic}.
  We then study in which case there exists an algorithm for model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} and show that the problem of model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} against {\it bounded probabilistic computational tree logic} (bPCTL) is decidable, and further show that this problem is in $NP$-complete. Our reduction is from the {\it bounded Post Correspondence Problem} for the first time, a well-known $NP$-complete problem.</description>

      <title>Deciding Termination of Simple Randomized Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that universal positive almost sure termination (UPAST) is decidable for a class of simple randomized programs, i.e., it is decidable whether the expected runtime of such a program is finite for all inputs. Our class contains all programs that consist of a single loop, with a linear loop guard and a loop body composed of two linear commuting and diagonalizable updates. In each iteration of the loop, the update to be carried out is picked at random, according to a fixed probability. We show the decidability of UPAST for this class of programs, where the program's variables and inputs may range over various sub-semirings of the real numbers. In this way, we extend a line of research initiated by Tiwari in 2004 into the realm of randomized programs.</description>

      <title>Automata on $S$-adic words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question in logic and verification is the following: for which unary predicates $P_1, \ldots, P_k$ is the monadic second-order theory of $\langle \mathbb{N}; &lt;, P_1, \ldots, P_k \rangle$ decidable? Equivalently, for which infinite words $\alpha$ can we decide whether a given B\"uchi automaton $A$ accepts $\alpha$? Carton and Thomas showed decidability in case $\alpha$ is a fixed point of a letter-to-word substitution $\sigma$, i.e., $\sigma(\alpha) = \alpha$. However, abundantly more words, e.g., Sturmian words, are characterised by a broader notion of self-similarity that uses a set $S$ of substitutions. A word $\alpha$ is said to be directed by a sequence $s = (\sigma_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ over $S$ if there is a sequence of words $(\alpha_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ such that $\alpha_0 = \alpha$ and $\alpha_n = \sigma_n(\alpha_{n+1})$ for all $n$; such $\alpha$ is called $S$-adic. We study the automaton acceptance problem for such words and prove, among others, the following. Given finite $S$ and an automaton $A$, we can compute an automaton $B$ that accepts $s \in S^\omega$ if and only if $s$ directs a word $\alpha$ accepted by $A$. Thus we can algorithmically answer questions of the form "Which $S$-adic words are accepted by a given automaton $A$?"</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Model Integration with Open World Temporal Logic for Process Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) have yielded powerful models capable of extracting structured information from diverse and complex data sources. However, a significant challenge lies in translating these perceptual or extractive outputs into actionable, reasoned decisions within complex operational workflows. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach that integrates the outputs from various machine learning models directly with the PyReason framework, an open-world temporal logic programming reasoning engine. PyReason's foundation in generalized annotated logic allows for the seamless incorporation of real-valued outputs (e.g., probabilities, confidence scores) from diverse ML models, treating them as truth intervals within its logical framework. Crucially, PyReason provides mechanisms, implemented in Python, to continuously poll ML model outputs, convert them into logical facts, and dynamically recompute the minimal model, ensuring real-tine adaptive decision-making. Furthermore, its native support for temporal reasoning, knowledge graph integration, and fully explainable interface traces enables sophisticated analysis over time-sensitive process data and existing organizational knowledge. By combining the strengths of perception and extraction from ML models with the logical deduction and transparency of PyReason, we aim to create a powerful system for automating complex processes. This integration finds utility across numerous domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, and business operations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Strategy Synthesis for MDPs via Hierarchical Block Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software-intensive systems, such as software product lines and robotics, utilise Markov decision processes (MDPs) to capture uncertainty and analyse sequential decision-making problems. Despite the usefulness of conventional policy synthesis methods, they fail to scale to large state spaces. Our approach addresses this issue and accelerates policy synthesis in large MDPs by dynamically refining the MDP and iteratively selecting the most fragile MDP regions for refinement. This iterative procedure offers a balance between accuracy and efficiency, as refinement occurs only when necessary. Through a comprehensive empirical evaluation comprising diverse case studies and MDPs up to 1M states, we demonstrate significant performance improvements yielded by our approach compared to the leading probabilistic model checker PRISM (up to 2x), thus offering a very competitive solution for real-world policy synthesis tasks in larger MDPs.</description>

      <title>T-CPDL: A Temporal Causal Probabilistic Description Logic for Developing Logic-RAG Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models excel at generating fluent text but frequently struggle with structured reasoning involving temporal constraints, causal relationships, and probabilistic reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Temporal Causal Probabilistic Description Logic (T-CPDL), an integrated framework that extends traditional Description Logic with temporal interval operators, explicit causal relationships, and probabilistic annotations. We present two distinct variants of T-CPDL: one capturing qualitative temporal relationships through Allen's interval algebra, and another variant enriched with explicit timestamped causal assertions. Both variants share a unified logical structure, enabling complex reasoning tasks ranging from simple temporal ordering to nuanced probabilistic causation. Empirical evaluations on temporal reasoning and causal inference benchmarks confirm that T-CPDL substantially improves inference accuracy, interpretability, and confidence calibration of language model outputs. By delivering transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained temporal and causal semantics, T-CPDL significantly enhances the capability of language models to support robust, explainable, and trustworthy decision-making. This work also lays the groundwork for developing advanced Logic-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Logic-RAG) frameworks, potentially boosting the reasoning capabilities and efficiency of knowledge graph-enhanced RAG systems.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Model-checking of Discrete-Timed Networks and Symmetric-Broadcast Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02466v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the complexity of the model-checking problem for parameterized discrete-timed systems with arbitrarily many anonymous and identical processes, with and without a distinguished "controller", and communicating via synchronous rendezvous. Our framework extends the seminal work from German and Sistla on untimed systems by adding discrete-time clocks to processes. For the case without a controller, we show that the systems can be efficiently simulated -- and vice versa -- by systems of untimed processes that communicate via rendezvous and symmetric broadcast, which we call "RB-systems". Symmetric broadcast is a novel communication primitive that allows all processes to synchronize at once; however, it does not distinguish between sending and receiving processes. We show that the parameterized model-checking problem for safety specifications is pspace-complete, and for liveness specifications it is decidable in exptime. The latter result is proved using automata theory, rational linear programming, and geometric reasoning for solving certain reachability questions in a new variant of vector addition systems called "vector rendezvous systems". We believe these proof techniques are of independent interest and will be useful in solving related problems. For the case with a controller, we show that the parameterized model-checking problems for RB-systems and systems with asymmetric broadcast as a primitive are inter-reducible. This allows us to prove that for discrete timed-networks with a controller the parameterized model-checking problem is undecidable for liveness specifications. Our work exploits the intimate connection between parameterized discrete-timed systems and systems of processes communicating via broadcast, providing a rare and surprising decidability result for liveness properties of parameterized timed-systems, as well as extend work from untimed systems to timed systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04902v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study algorithms to analyze a particular class of Markov population processes that is often used in epidemiology. More specifically, Markov binomial chains are the model that arises from stochastic time-discretizations of classical compartmental models. In this work we formalize this class of Markov population processes and focus on the problem of computing the expected time to termination in a given such model. Our theoretical contributions include proving that Markov binomial chains whose flow of individuals through compartments is acyclic almost surely terminate. We give a PSPACE algorithm for the problem of approximating the time to termination and a direct algorithm for the exact problem in the Blum-Shub-Smale model of computation. Finally, we provide a natural encoding of Markov binomial chains into a common input language for probabilistic model checkers. We implemented the latter encoding and present some initial empirical results showcasing what formal methods can do for practicing epidemiologists.</description>

      <title>Total Outcome Logic: Unified Reasoning for a Taxonomy of Program Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While there is a long tradition of reasoning about (non)termination in program analysis, specialized logics are typically needed to give different termination criteria. This includes partial correctness, where termination is not guaranteed, and total correctness, where it is guaranteed. We present Total Outcome Logic (TOL), a single logic which can express the full spectrum of termination conditions and program properties offered by the aforementioned logics. TOL extends (non)termination and (in)correctness reasoning across different kinds of branching effects, so that a single metatheory powers this reasoning in different kinds of programs, including nondeterministic and probabilistic. We also show that TOL subsumes several recently created taxonomies of (in)correctness logics, so that many different kinds of properties can be proven with a single unified theory.</description>

      <title>Small Term Reachability and Related Problems for Terminating Term Rewriting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by an application where we try to make proofs for Description Logic inferences smaller by rewriting, we consider the following decision problem, which we call the small term reachability problem: given a term rewriting system $R$, a term $s$, and a natural number $n$, decide whether there is a term $t$ of size $\leq n$ reachable from $s$ using the rules of $R$. We investigate the complexity of this problem depending on how termination of $R$ can be established. We show that the problem is in general NP-complete for length-reducing term rewriting systems. Its complexity increases to N2ExpTime-complete (NExpTime-complete) if termination is proved using a (linear) polynomial order and to PSpace-complete for systems whose termination can be shown using a restricted class of Knuth-Bendix orders. Confluence reduces the complexity to P for the length-reducing case, but has no effect on the worst-case complexity in the other two cases. Finally, we consider the large term reachability problem, a variant of the problem where we are interested in reachability of a term of size $\geq n$. It turns out that this seemingly innocuous modification in some cases changes the complexity of the problem, which may also become dependent on whether the number $n$ is is represented in unary or binary encoding, whereas this makes no difference for the complexity of the small term reachability problem.</description>

      <title>Trees in Coalgebra from Generalized Reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An automaton is called reachable if every state is reachable from the initial state. This notion has been generalized coalgebraically in two ways: first, via a universal property on pointed coalgebras, namely, that a reachable coalgebra has no proper subcoalgebra; and second, a coalgebra is reachable if it arises as the union of an iterative computation of successor states, starting from the initial state.
  In the current paper, we present corresponding universal properties and iterative constructions for trees. The universal property captures when a coalgebra is a tree, namely, when it has no proper tree unravelling. The iterative construction unravels an arbitrary coalgebra to a tree. We show that this yields the expected notion of tree for a variety of standard examples.
  We obtain our characterization of trees by first generalizing the previous theory of reachable coalgebras. Surprisingly, both the universal property and the iterative construction for trees arise as an instance of this generalized notion of reachability.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Rewards in Markovian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the expected value of multiplicative rewards, where rewards obtained in each step are multiplied (instead of the usual addition), in Markov chains (MCs) and Markov decision processes (MDPs). One of the key differences to additive rewards is that the expected value may diverge to infinity not only due to recurrent, but also due to transient states. For MCs, computing the value is shown to be possible in polynomial time given an oracle for the comparison of succinctly represented integers (CSRI), which is only known to be solvable in polynomial time subject to number-theoretic conjectures. Interestingly, distinguishing whether the value is infinite or 0 is at least as hard as CSRI, while determining if it is one of these two can be done in polynomial time. In MDPs, the optimal value can be computed in polynomial space. Further refined complexity results and results on the complexity of optimal schedulers are presented. The techniques developed for MDPs additionally allow to solve the multiplicative variant of the stochastic shortest path problem. Finally, for MCs and MDPs where an absorbing state is reached almost surely, all considered problems are solvable in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>$\Delta$-Nets: Interaction-Based System for Optimal Parallel $\lambda$-Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present a model of universal parallel computation called $\Delta$-Nets, and a method to translate $\lambda$-terms into $\Delta$-nets and back. Together, the model and the method constitute an algorithm for optimal parallel $\lambda$-reduction, solving the longstanding enigma with groundbreaking clarity. I show that the $\lambda$-calculus can be understood as a projection of $\Delta$-Nets$-$one that severely restricts the structure of sharing, among other drawbacks. Unhindered by these restrictions, the $\Delta$-Nets model opens the door to new parallel programming language implementations and computer architectures that are more efficient and performant than previously possible.</description>

      <title>PREMAP: A Unifying PREiMage APproximation Framework for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most methods for neural network verification focus on bounding the image, i.e., set of outputs for a given input set. This can be used to, for example, check the robustness of neural network predictions to bounded perturbations of an input. However, verifying properties concerning the preimage, i.e., the set of inputs satisfying an output property, requires abstractions in the input space. We present a general framework for preimage abstraction that produces under- and over-approximations of any polyhedral output set. Our framework employs cheap parameterised linear relaxations of the neural network, together with an anytime refinement procedure that iteratively partitions the input region by splitting on input features and neurons. The effectiveness of our approach relies on carefully designed heuristics and optimization objectives to achieve rapid improvements in the approximation volume. We evaluate our method on a range of tasks, demonstrating significant improvement in efficiency and scalability to high-input-dimensional image classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Further, we showcase the application to quantitative verification and robustness analysis, presenting a sound and complete algorithm for the former and providing sound quantitative results for the latter.</description>

      <title>Lemmanaid: Neuro-Symbolic Lemma Conjecturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatically conjecturing useful, interesting and novel lemmas would greatly improve automated reasoning tools and lower the bar for formalizing mathematics in proof assistants. It is however a very challenging task for both neural and symbolic approaches. We present the first steps towards a practical neuro-symbolic lemma conjecturing tool, Lemmanaid, that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and symbolic methods, and evaluate it on proof libraries for the Isabelle proof assistant. We train an LLM to generate lemma templates that describe the shape of a lemma, and use symbolic methods to fill in the details. We compare Lemmanaid against an LLM trained to generate complete lemma statements as well as previous fully symbolic conjecturing methods. Lemmanaid outperforms both neural and symbolic methods on test sets from Isabelle's HOL library and from its Archive of Formal Proofs, discovering between 29-39.5% of the gold standard human written lemmas. This is 8-15% more lemmas than the neural-only method. By leveraging the best of both symbolic and neural methods we can generate useful lemmas for a wide range of input domains, facilitating computer-assisted theory development and formalization.</description>

      <title>Meaning as Use, Application, Employment, Purpose, Usefulness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arising from the whole body of Wittgenstein's writings is a picture of a (not necessarily straight, linear, but admittedly tireless) journey to come to terms with the mechanics of language as an instrument to conceive `reality' and to communicate an acquired conception of the `world'. The journey passes through mathematics, psychology, color perception, certainty, aesthetic, but, looking at it from a sort of birdview, it seems reasonable to say that these are all used as `test beds' for his reflections and `experimentations' towards an all encompassing perspective of such a fundamental gateway to human reasoning and life-revealing as language. Whatever labelling of Wittgenstein as a mystic, a logicist, a conventionalist, a skeptic, an anti-metaphysics, an anti-realist, a verificationist, a pragmatist, a behaviorist, and many others, does not seem to do justice to his absolute obsession with being a persistent `deep diver' into the nature of language. Working with an open and searchable account of the Nachlass has allowed us to identify important aspects of the philosopher's possible common line of thinking, in spite of changes of directions, some of them acknowledged by Wittgenstein himself. One of those aspects is the association of meaning with use, application, purpose, usefulness of symbols in language, which happens to show itself from the very beginning through to the very late writings. The German terms Gebrauch, Anwendung, \emph{Verwendung}, Zweck in relation to meaning, sense of signs, words, sentences, appear in several texts since the WW1 Notebooks (1914--1916) up until very late manuscripts from 1950--51.</description>
