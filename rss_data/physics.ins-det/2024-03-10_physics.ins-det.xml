      <title>Using Machine Learning to Separate Cherenkov and Scintillation Light in Hybrid Neutrino Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates the separation of Cherenkov and Scintillation light signals within a simulated Water-based Liquid Scintillator (WbLS) detector, utilizing the XGBoost machine learning algorithm. The simulation data were gathered using the Rat-Pac software, which was built on the Geant4 architecture. The use of the WbLS medium has the capability to generate both Scintillation and Cherenkov light inside a single detector. To show the separation power of these two physics events, we will use the supervised learning approach. The assessment utilized a confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve, with the ROC curve indicating a performance result of $0.96 \pm 1.2\times 10^{-4}$. The research also aimed to identify essential parameters for effectively distinguishing these physics events through machine learning. For this, the study also introduced the SHAP methodology, utilizing game theory to assess feature contributions. The findings demonstrated that the number of hits has a significant effect on the trained model, while the mean hit time has a somewhat smaller impact. This research advances the utilization of AI and simulation data for accurate Cherenkov and Scintillation light separation in neutrino detectors</description>

      <title>Rubidium and cesium ion-induced electron and ion signals for scanning ion microscopy applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning ion microscopy applications of novel focused ion beam (FIB) systems based on ultracold rubidium (Rb) and cesium (Cs) atoms were investigated via ion-induced electron and ion yields. Results measured on the Rb$^+$ and Cs$^+$ FIB systems were compared with results from commercially available gallium (Ga$^+$) systems to verify the merits of applying Rb$^+$ and Cs$^+$ for imaging. The comparison shows that Rb$^+$ and Cs$^+$ have higher secondary electron (SE) yields on a variety of pure element targets than Ga$^+$, which implies a higher signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved for the same dose in SE imaging using Rb$^+$/Cs$^+$ than Ga$^+$. In addition, analysis of the ion-induced ion signals reveals that secondary ions dominate Cs$^+$ induced ion signals while the Rb$^+$/Ga$^+$ induced signals contain more backscattered ions.</description>

      <title>High-energy extension of the gamma-ray band observable with an electron-tracking Compton camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the MeV gamma-ray band is a promising energy-band window in astrophysics, the current situation of MeV gamma-ray astronomy significantly lags behind those of the other energy bands in angular resolution and sensitivity. An electron-tracking Compton camera (ETCC), a next-generation MeV detector, is expected to revolutionize the situation. An ETCC tracks each Compton-recoil electron with a gaseous electron tracker and determines the incoming direction of each gamma-ray photon; thus, it has a strong background rejection power and yields a better angular resolution than classical Compton cameras. Here, we study ETCC events in which the Compton-recoil electrons do not deposit all energies to the electron tracker but escape and hit the surrounding pixel scintillator array (PSA). We developed an analysis method for this untapped class of events and applied it to laboratory and simulation data. We found that the energy spectrum obtained from the simulation agreed with that of the actual data within a factor of 1.2. We then evaluated the detector performance using the simulation data. The angular resolution for the new-class events was found to be twice as good as in the previous study at the energy range 1.0--2.0~MeV, where both analyses overlap. We also found that the total effective area is dominated by the contribution of the double-hit events above an energy of 1.5~MeV. Notably, applying this new method extends the sensitive energy range with the ETCC from 0.2--2.1 MeV in the previous studies to up to 3.5~MeV. Adjusting the PSA dynamic range should improve the sensitivity in even higher energy gamma-rays. The development of this new analysis method would pave the way for future observations by ETCC to fill the MeV-band sensitivity gap in astronomy.</description>

      <title>Free Space Optical Frequency Comparison Over Rapidly Moving Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The comparison of optical reference frequency signals over free-space optical links is limited by the relative motion between local and remote sites. Extreme Doppler shifts experienced in rapidly moving optical links, such as for ground-to-space, prevent the narrow-band detection required to compare or transfer optical frequencies at the highest levels of stability. We demonstrate a system capable of optical frequency comparison in the presence of extreme Doppler shifts, using an electro-optic phase modulator with an actuation bandwidth of 10 GHz, sufficient to enable ground-to-space frequency comparison. This system was demonstrated over a retro-reflected drone link, with a maximum line-of-sight velocity of 15 m/s and Doppler shift of 20 MHz. The best fractional frequency stability obtained was 2E-17 at an integration time of 2 s. These results suggest that optical frequency comparison between rapidly moving targets, as in ground-to-space applications, is possible with further system development.</description>

      <title>Signal Response Model in PandaX-4T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PandaX-4T experiment is a deep-underground dark matter direct search experiment that employs a dual-phase time projection chamber with a sensitive volume containing 3.7 tonne of liquid xenon. The detector of PandaX-4T is capable of simultaneously collecting the primary scintillation and ionization signals, utilizing their ratio to discriminate dark matter signals from background sources such as gamma rays and beta particles. The signal response model plays a crucial role in interpreting the data obtained by PandaX-4T. It describes the conversion from the deposited energy by dark matter interactions to the detectable signals within the detector. The signal response model is utilized in various PandaX-4T results. This work provides a comprehensive description of the procedures involved in constructing and parameter-fitting the signal response model for the energy range of approximately 1 keV to 25 keV for electronic recoils and 6 keV to 90 keV for nuclear recoils. It also covers the signal reconstruction, selection, and correction methods, which are crucial components integrated into the signal response model.</description>

      <title>Improved particle-flow event reconstruction with scalable neural networks for current and future particle detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06782v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate algorithms are necessary to reconstruct particles in the highly granular detectors anticipated at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider and the Future Circular Collider. We study scalable machine learning models for event reconstruction in electron-positron collisions based on a full detector simulation. Particle-flow reconstruction can be formulated as a supervised learning task using tracks and calorimeter clusters. We compare a graph neural network and kernel-based transformer and demonstrate that we can avoid quadratic operations while achieving realistic reconstruction. We show that hyperparameter tuning significantly improves the performance of the models. The best graph neural network model shows improvement in the jet transverse momentum resolution by up to 50% compared to the rule-based algorithm. The resulting model is portable across Nvidia, AMD and Habana hardware. Accurate and fast machine-learning based reconstruction can significantly improve future measurements at colliders.</description>

      <title>Vector-based feedback of continuous wave radiofrequency compression cavity for ultrafast electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The temporal resolution of ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) at weakly relativistic beam energies ($\lesssim$ 100 keV) suffers from space-charge induced electron pulse broadening. We describe the implementation of a radio frequency (RF) cavity operating in the continuous wave regime to compress high repetition rate electron bunches from a 40.4 kV DC photoinjector for ultrafast electron diffraction applications. Active stabilization of the RF amplitude and phase through a feedback loop based on the demodulated in-phase and quadrature components of the RF signal is demonstrated. This scheme yields 144$\pm$19 fs RMS temporal resolution in pump-probe studies.</description>

      <title>Energy and Time Histograms: Fluxes determination in calorimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-granularity calorimetry, as proposed for detectors at future Higgs factories, the requirements on electronics can have a strong impact on the design of the detector, especially via the cooling and acquisition systems. This project aims to establish the typical fluxes in the calorimeters: deposited energy, number of cells above the electronics threshold, additional heat, and associated data, etc. Here, a software package is presented which outputs histograms for different selections of the calorimeter components from fully simulated physics and background events. The ILD calorimeter system is taken as a specific example, upon which different histograms are obtained for representative parts of the calorimeter and for various machine configurations. Examples of histograms are shown, along with all details of the data used and the simulation.</description>
