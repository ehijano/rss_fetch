      <title>Uniform winning strategies for the synchronization games on subclasses of finite automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pseudovariety $\mathbf{DS}$ consists of all finite monoids whose regular $D$-classes form subsemigroups. We exhibit a uniform winning strategy for Synchronizer in the synchronization game on every synchronizing automaton whose transition monoid lies in $\mathbf{DS}$, and we prove that $\mathbf{DS}$ is the largest pseudovariety with this property.</description>

      <title>Proving DNSSEC Correctness: A Formal Approach to Secure Domain Name Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are critical for preventing DNS spoofing, yet its specifications contain ambiguities and vulnerabilities that elude traditional "break-and-fix" approaches. A holistic, foundational security analysis of the protocol has thus remained an open problem. This paper introduces DNSSECVerif, the first framework for comprehensive, automated formal security analysis of the DNSSEC protocol suite. Built on the SAPIC+ symbolic verifier, our high-fidelity model captures protocol-level interactions, including cryptographic operations and stateful caching with fine-grained concurrency control. Using DNSSECVerif, we formally prove four of DNSSEC's core security guarantees and uncover critical ambiguities in the standards--notably, the insecure coexistence of NSEC and NSEC3. Our model also automatically rediscovers three classes of known attacks, demonstrating fundamental weaknesses in the protocol design. To bridge the model-to-reality gap, we validate our findings through targeted testing of mainstream DNS software and a large-scale measurement study of over 2.2 million open resolvers, confirming the real-world impact of these flaws. Our work provides crucial, evidence-based recommendations for hardening DNSSEC specifications and implementations.</description>

      <title>Minimality Notions via Factorization Systems and Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.05701v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the minimization of state-based systems (i.e. the reduction of the number of states while retaining the system's semantics), there are two obvious aspects: removing unnecessary states of the system and merging redundant states in the system. In the present article, we relate the two minimization aspects on coalgebras by defining an abstract notion of minimality.
  The abstract notions minimality and minimization live in a general category with a factorization system. We will find criteria on the category that ensure uniqueness, existence, and functoriality of the minimization aspects. The proofs of these results instantiate to those for reachability and observability minimization in the standard coalgebra literature. Finally, we will see how the two aspects of minimization interact and under which criteria they can be sequenced in any order, like in automata minimization.</description>

      <title>Adding Reconfiguration to Zielonka's Asynchronous Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01425v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an extension of Zielonka's (fixed) asynchronous automata called reconfigurable asynchronous automata where processes can dynamically change who they communicate with. We show that reconfigurable asynchronous automata are not more expressive than fixed asynchronous automata by giving translations from one to the other. However, going from reconfigurable to fixed comes at the cost of disseminating communication (and knowledge) to all processes in the system. We then show that this is unavoidable by describing a language accepted by a reconfigurable automaton such that in every equivalent fixed automaton, every process must either be aware of all communication or be irrelevant.</description>

      <title>The Expressive Capacity of State Space Models: A Formal Language Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, recurrent models based on linear state space models (SSMs) have shown promising performance in language modeling (LM), competititve with transformers. However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for SSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.</description>
