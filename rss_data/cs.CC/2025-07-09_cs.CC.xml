      <title>Lineal Extensions of Kakeya Sets Missing Every ee-Random Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By effectivizing a Kakeya set construction, we prove the existence of lines in all directions that do not contain any double exponential time random points. This means each point on these lines has an algorithmically predictable location, to the extent that a gambler in an environment with fair payouts can, using double exponential time computing resources, amass unbounded capital placing bets on increasingly precise estimates of the point's location. Our result resolves an open question published by Lutz and Lutz (2015).</description>

      <title>Parameterized Restless Temporal Path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Bumpus and Meeks introduced a purely temporal parameter, called vertex-interval-membership-width, which is promising for the design of fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms for vertex reachability problems in temporal graphs. We study this newly introduced parameter for the problem of restless temporal paths, in which the waiting time at each node is restricted. In this article, we prove that, in the interval model, where arcs are present for entire time intervals, finding a restless temporal path is NP-hard even if the vertex-interval-membership-width is equal to three. We exhibit FPT algorithms for the point model, where arcs are present at specific points in time, both with uniform delay one and arbitrary positive delays. In the latter case, this comes with a slight additional computational cost.</description>

      <title>A Formal Refutation of the Blockchain Trilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The so-called blockchain trilemma asserts the impossibility of simultaneously achieving scalability, security, and decentralisation within a single blockchain protocol. In this paper, we formally refute that proposition. Employing predicate logic, formal automata theory, computational complexity analysis, and graph-theoretic measures of relay topology--specifically Baran's model of network path redundancy--we demonstrate that the trilemma constitutes a category error, conflates distinct analytical domains, and relies upon unproven causal assumptions. We further expose its reliance on composition fallacies drawn from flawed system implementations. A constructive counterexample is presented: a blockchain protocol exhibiting unbounded transaction throughput, cryptographic security under adversarial load, and multipath decentralised propagation. This example is not hypothetical but grounded in protocol design enabled by compact block relay, SPV verification, and IPv6 multicast. The trilemma is revealed not as a law of protocol architecture, but as a heuristic fallacy sustained by imprecision and design defeatism.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Problems on Graphs Defined on Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the complexity of graph problems on graphs defined on groups, especially power graphs. We observe that an isomorphism invariant problem, such as Hamiltonian Path, Partition into Cliques, Feedback Vertex Set, Subgraph Isomorphism, cannot be NP-complete for power graphs, commuting graphs, enhanced power graphs, directed power graphs, and bounded-degree Cayley graphs, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). An analogous result holds for isomorphism invariant group problems: no such problem can be NP-complete unless ETH is false. We show that the Weighted Max-Cut problem is NP-complete in power graphs. We also show that, unless ETH is false, the Graph Motif problem cannot be solved in quasipolynomial time on power graphs, even for power graphs of cyclic groups. We study the recognition problem of power graphs when the adjacency matrix or list is given as input and show that for abelian groups and some classes of nilpotent groups, it is solvable in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Generalized and Unified Equivalences between Hardness and Pseudoentropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudoentropy characterizations provide a quantitatively precise demonstration of the close relationship between computational hardness and computational randomness. We prove a unified pseudoentropy characterization that generalizes and strengthens previous results for both uniform and non-uniform models of computation. Our characterization holds for a general family of entropy notions that encompasses the common notions of Shannon entropy and min entropy as special cases. Moreover, we show that the characterizations for different entropy notions can be simultaneously achieved by a single, universal function that simultaneously witnesses computational hardness and computational randomness. A key technical insight of our work is that the notion of weight-restricted calibration from the recent literature on algorithm fairness, along with standard computational indistinguishability (known as multiaccuracy in the fairness literature), suffices for proving pseudoentropy characterizations for general entropy notions. This demonstrates the power of weight-restricted calibration to enhance the classic Complexity-Theoretic Regularity Lemma (Trevisan, Tulsiani, and Vadhan, 2009) and Leakage Simulation Lemma (Jetchev and Pietrzak, 2014) and allows us to achieve an exponential improvement in the complexity dependency on the alphabet size compared to the pseudoentropy characterizations by Casacuberta, Dwork, and Vadhan (2024) based on the much stronger notion of multicalibration. We show that the exponential dependency on the alphabet size is inevitable for multicalibration as well as for the weaker notion of calibrated multiaccuracy.</description>

      <title>Unitary designs in nearly optimal depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits in circuit depth $O(\log k \log \log n k / \varepsilon)$. The depth is exponentially improved over all known results in all three parameters $n$, $k$, $\varepsilon$. We further show that each dependence is optimal up to exponentially smaller factors. Our construction uses $\tilde{{O}}(nk)$ ancilla qubits and ${O}(nk)$ bits of randomness, which are also optimal up to $\log(n k)$ factors. An alternative construction achieves a smaller ancilla count $\tilde{{O}}(n)$ with circuit depth ${O}(k \log \log nk/\varepsilon)$. To achieve these efficient unitary designs, we introduce a highly-structured random unitary ensemble that leverages long-range two-qubit gates and low-depth implementations of random classical hash functions. We also develop a new analytical framework for bounding errors in quantum experiments involving many queries to random unitaries. As an illustration of this framework's versatility, we provide a succinct alternative proof of the existence of pseudorandom unitaries.</description>

      <title>Quantum PCPs: on Adaptivity, Multiple Provers and Reductions to Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04841v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a general formulation of quantum PCPs, which captures adaptivity and multiple unentangled provers, and give a detailed construction of the quantum reduction to a local Hamiltonian with a constant promise gap. The reduction turns out to be a versatile subroutine to prove properties of quantum PCPs, allowing us to show: (i) Non-adaptive quantum PCPs can simulate adaptive quantum PCPs when the number of proof queries is constant. In fact, this can even be shown to hold when the non-adaptive quantum PCP picks the proof indices simply uniformly at random from a subset of all possible index combinations, answering an open question by Aharonov, Arad, Landau and Vazirani (STOC '09). (ii) If the $q$-local Hamiltonian problem with constant promise gap can be solved in $\mathsf{QCMA}$, then $\mathsf{QPCP}[q] \subseteq \mathsf{QCMA}$ for any $q \in O(1)$. (iii) If $\mathsf{QMA}(k)$ has a quantum PCP for any $k \leq \text{poly}(n)$, then $\mathsf{QMA}(2) = \mathsf{QMA}$, connecting two of the longest-standing open problems in quantum complexity theory. Moreover, we also show that there exist (quantum) oracles relative to which certain quantum PCP statements are false. Hence, any attempt to prove the quantum PCP conjecture requires, just as was the case for the classical PCP theorem, (quantumly) non-relativizing techniques.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Model-Checking Quantum Pushdown Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18439v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of model-checking quantum pushdown systems from a computational complexity point of view. We arrive at the following equally important, interesting new results:
  We first extend the notions of the {\it probabilistic pushdown systems} and {\it Markov chains} to their quantum analogues and investigate the question of whether it is necessary to define a quantum analogue of {\it probabilistic computational tree logic} to describe the probabilistic and branching-time properties of the {\it quantum Markov chain}. We study its model-checking question and show that model-checking of {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems (qBPA)} against {\it probabilistic computational tree logic (PCTL)} is generally undecidable, i.e., there exists no algorithm for model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} against {\it probabilistic computational tree logic}.
  We then study in which case there exists an algorithm for model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} and show that the problem of model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} against {\it bounded probabilistic computational tree logic} (bPCTL) is decidable, and further show that this problem is in $NP$-hard. Our reduction is from the {\it bounded Post Correspondence Problem} for the first time, a well-known $NP$-complete problem.</description>
