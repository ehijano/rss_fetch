      <title>Inference of the degree of dissociation of weakly collisional hydrogen plasmas using collisional-radiative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new analysis technique for the inference of degree of dissociation of weakly collisional hydrogen plasmas was developed and tested with an experiment. Neutrals in low temperature plasmas are critical to a wide range of plasma-based technologies, and thus, it is important to investigate their properties. The most important physical parameter for neutrals in hydrogen plasmas is the degree of dissociation, and the technique for its inference was developed in this work. To improve the accuracy of the analysis, the collisional-radiative models for hydrogen atom and molecule were constructed and modified to handle bi-Maxwellian electron energy distribution and radiation trapping effect. An additional analysis of Fulcher-alpha transitions was conducted to obtain gas temperature and ground vibrational temperature from rotational-vibrational distribution of excited molecules. The technique involves multiple steps to generate calculated excited state distributions from experimental data, which are then compared to measured distributions to infer the most probable degree of dissociation. To test and verify the analysis technique, experiments were conducted. Hydrogen plasmas were generated in a large cylindrical chamber named MAXIMUS, by DC discharge with a hot cathode. Various diagnostics including the optical emission and absorption spectroscopy, and the Langmuir probe measurement were performed to obtain spectra and electron parameters. The degrees of dissociation for the generated plasmas were inferred, based on the measured data and the analysis technique. Several problems and implications were discussed and improvement strategies were outlined. Overall, the analysis technique developed in this work is expected to play a valuable role in future diagnostic and analytical studies of hydrogen plasmas.</description>

      <title>Predicting Plasma Temperature From Line Intensities Using ML Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, ML models were used to predict the plasma temperature using the dataset obtained by implementing the CR-model for Na-like Krypton. The models included in the study are: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, Multi-layer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Network. For evaluating the models we used Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error and R^2 Score as metrics, In our study Random Forest performed best as compared to other model considered, the study conclude that complex relation between the line-intensities and Plasma temperature can be capture by ML models and they can be used to predict the temperature with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Impact of magnetic field gradients on the development of the MRI: Applications to binary neutron star mergers and proto-planetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is widely believed to play a central role in generating large-scale, poloidal magnetic fields during binary neutron star mergers. However, the few simulations that begin with a weak seed magnetic field and capture its growth until saturation predominantly show the effects of small-scale turbulence and winding, but lack convincing evidence of MRI activity. In this work, we investigate how the MRI is affected by the complex magnetic field topologies characteristic of the post-merger phase, aiming to assess the actual feasibility of MRI in such environments. We first derive the MRI instability criterion, as well as expressions for the characteristic wavelength and growth timescale of the fastest-growing modes, under conditions that include significant magnetic field gradients. Our analysis reveals that strong radial magnetic field gradients can impact significantly on the MRI, slowing its growth or suppressing it entirely if large enough. We then apply this extended framework to both idealized analytical disk models and data from a numerical relativity simulation of a long-lived neutron star merger remnant. We find that conditions favourable to MRI growth on astrophysically relevant timescales may occur only in limited regions of the post-merger disk, and only at late times $t\gtrsim 100$ ms after the merger. These results suggest that the MRI plays a limited role in amplifying poloidal magnetic fields in post-merger environments during the first $\mathcal{O}(100)$ms.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Preheat Propagation in MagLIF-like Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The preheating and pre-magnetization of fusion fuel are key features in Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion (MagLIF) configurations. Typically, the energy of the preheat laser is deposited in a central region of the fuel and propagates outward, generating magneto-hydrodynamic structures that impact the fuel mass distribution and magnetic flux compression during the subsequent implosion. We present a theoretical analysis of preheat propagation in a magnetized plasma under conditions typical for MagLIF. The analysis is based on the acoustic time scale for the propagation of pressure disturbances being much shorter than the conductive time scale for heat diffusion. In this regime, the preheat-driven expansion induces the stratification of the fuel and magnetic field, which accumulate in a dense outer shelf bounded by the leading shock. We derive self-similar solutions of the model that describe the hydrodynamic profiles of the expansion, and evaluate the evolution of the magnetic field in this configuration. These solutions are supported by FLASH simulations of preheat propagation. Our analysis shows that, asymptotically in time, the regions where the magnetization of the fuel is significant tend to become localized at the interface separating the outer shelf from the inner hot core. We assess the implications of this stratification on the magnetic flux conservation and performance of fully integrated MagLIF FLASH simulations.</description>
