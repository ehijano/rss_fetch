      <title>Integrable Higher-Spin Deformations of Sigma Models from Auxiliary Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new infinite family of integrable deformations of the principal chiral model (PCM) parameterized by an interaction function of several variables, which extends the formalism of arXiv:2405.05899, and includes deformations of the PCM by functions of both the stress tensor and higher-spin conserved currents. We show in detail that every model in this class admits a Lax representation for its equations of motion, and that the Poisson bracket of the Lax connection takes the Maillet form, establishing the existence of an infinite set of Poisson-commuting conserved charges. We argue that the non-Abelian T-dual of any model in this family is classically integrable, and that T-duality "commutes" with a general deformation in this class, in a sense which we make precise. Finally, we demonstrate that these higher-spin auxiliary field deformations can be extended to accommodate the addition of a Wess-Zumino term, and we exhibit the Lax connection in this case.</description>

      <title>Inverse scattering transform for the discrete nonlocal PT symmetric nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonzero boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the inverse scattering transform for the integrable discrete nonlocal PT symmetric nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonzero boundary conditions is presented. According to the two different signs of symmetry reduction and two different values of the phase difference between plus and minus infinity, we discuss four cases with significant differences about analytical regions, symmetry, asymptotic behavior and the presence or absence of discrete eigenvalues, namely, the existence or absence of soliton solutions. Therefore, in all cases, we study the direct scattering and inverse scattering problem, separately. The Riemann-Hilbert problem is constructed and solved as well as the reconstruction formula of potential is derived, respectively. Finally, combining the time evolution, we provide the dark, bright, dark-bright soliton solutions on the nonzero background in difference cases under the reflectionless condition.</description>

      <title>Energy cascade and "Burgulence" in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of initial long-wavelength excitations of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain has been the subject of intense investigations since the pioneering work of Fermi and collaborators. We have recently found a new regime where the spectrum of the Fourier modes decays with a power-law and we have interpreted this regime as a transient turbulence associated with the Burgers equation. In this paper we present the full derivation of the latter equation from the lattice dynamics using a newly developed infinite dimensional Hamiltonian perturbation theory. This theory allows us to relate the time evolution of the Fourier spectrum $E_k$ of the Burgers equation to the one of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain. As a consequence, we derive analytically both the shock time and the power-law $-8/3$ of the spectrum at this time. Using the shock time as a unit, we follow numerically the time-evolution of the spectrum and observe the persistence of the power $-2$ over an extensive time window. The exponent $-2$ has been widely discussed in the literature on the Burgers equation. The analysis of the Burgers equation in Fourier space also gives information on the time evolution of the energy of each single mode which, at short time, is also a power-law depending on the $k$-th wavenumber $E_k \sim t^{2k-2}$. This approach to the FPUT dynamics opens the way to a wider study of scaling regimes arising from more general initial conditions.</description>
