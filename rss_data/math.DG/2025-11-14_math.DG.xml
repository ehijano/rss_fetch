      <title>Lie groups with a bi-invariant distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a Lie group $G$ admitting a bi-invariant distance must be the product $G=H\times K$ of an abelian group $H$ and a compact group $K$ with discrete center. Moreover, the distance in $G$ must come from the infima of lengths of paths for a unique infinitesimal metric (a Finsler norm) defined in the Lie algebra of $G$. From this we derive the distance minimizing paths which are left or right translations of one-parameter groups (though these are not the unique minizing paths if the norm is not smooth or strictly convex). Then we introduce a notion of sectional curvature $sec(\pi)$ for a bi-invariant distance, following Milnor's ideas, and we show that this curvature is bounded and non-negative, and it is null when the $2$-plane $\pi$ is an abelian Lie subalgebra of $Lie(G)$. We show that when the distance is strictly convex, our sectional curvature vanishes if and only if the $2$-plane is abelian. We give finer characterizations for the case of vanishing curvature, for the case of non-strictly convex norms</description>

      <title>Generalized Curvatures of Curves in $\mathbb{R}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a curve $\boldsymbol{\gamma}:I\to\mathbb{R}^n$ of order $n-1$, we prove that the generalized curvatures $\kappa_1, \ldots, \kappa_{n-1}$ can be expressed in terms of the leading principal minors of the matrix $\mathbf{A}(t)^T\mathbf{A}(t)$, where $\mathbf{A}(t)$ is the $n\times n$ matrix whose $i$-th column is $\boldsymbol{\gamma}^{(i)}(t)$. This gives an efficient algorithm to calculate the curvatures.</description>

      <title>On the structure of locally conformally flat orbifolds and ALE manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove several structure theorems for locally conformally flat, positive Yamabe orbifolds and nonnegative scalar curvature, ALE manifolds. These two kinds of spaces can be related by conformal blow-up and conformal compactification. For the orbifolds, we prove that such orbifolds admit a manifold cover. For the ALE manifolds, the homomorphism of the fundamental group for the ALE space induced by the embedding of the ALE end is always injective. Using these properties, several classifications of such ALE manifolds and orbifolds are given in low dimensions. As an application to the moduli space, we prove that the football orbifold $\mathbb{S}^4/\Gamma$ cannot be realized as the Gromov-Hausdorff limit. In addition, we prove the positive mass theorem of these ALE ends and give a simple proof for the optimal decay rate. Using the positive mass theorem, we can solve the orbifold Yamabe problem in the locally conformally flat case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proves the existence of $C^\infty$ equivariant isometric embeddings (into some Euclidean space) for every $C^\infty$-smooth, $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold which is diffeomorphic to $\RR^n$ and admit an action of a Bieberbach group. The dimension of this Euclidean space is the same as the optimal dimension of Matthias G\"unther's results, which is $ \max\{s_n+2n, s_n+n+5\} $.</description>

      <title>Generalized Berwald Projective Weyl metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new quantity in Finsler geometry, called the generalized Berwald projective Weyl ($GB\widetilde{W}$) metric. The $C$-projective invariance of these metrics is demonstrated, and it is shown that they constitute a proper subset of the class of generalized Douglas ($GDW$) metrics. The paper also proves that all $GDW$ metrics with vanishing Landsberg curvature are of R-quadratic type. The class of $GDW$ metrics contains all Finsler metrics of scalar curvature, which provides an extension of the well-known Numata's theorem.</description>

Abstract: The maximum principle for hyperbolic inversive distance circle packings on polyhedral surfaces is established,which unifies and generalizes existing maximum principles for various types of circle packings in the literature.As an application of this principle, a discrete Schwarz-Ahlfors lemma is established.Furthermore, an infinite rigidity theorem for weighted Delaunay triangulations of the Poincar\'{e} disk is proved,which generalizes He's hyperbolic rigidity result \cite{He2}.</description>

      <title>The polydisk theorem for Hartogs domains over symmetric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the polydisk theorem of [21], originally established for classical Cartan-Hartogs domains, to Hartogs domains over arbitrary (possibly reducible and exceptional) bounded symmetric domains. We further establish a dual counterpart of this result. As an application, we show that the dual of a Hartogs domain over a bounded symmetric domain admits no totally geodesic immersion into any compact Riemannian manifold, thereby broadening the rigidity phenomena obtained in [13].</description>

      <title>Non-K\"ahler Calabi-Yau manifolds and holomorphic geometric structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study holomorphic geometric structures on non-K\"ahler compact complex manifolds with trivial canonical line bundle. For Vaisman Calabi-Yau manifolds we prove that all holomorphic geometric structures of affine type on them are locally homogeneous. Moreover, if the geometric structure is rigid, then the Vaisman manifold must be a Kodaira manifold. The proof uses a Beauville-Bogomolov type decomposition from [Is] together with a weak form of Bochner principle for Vaisman Calabi-Yau manifolds that we prove here. Other results show that a compact complex manifold with self-dual holomorphic tangent bundle bearing a rigid holomorphic geometric structure of affine type have infinite fundamental group. We prove the same result for compact complex manifolds with trivial canonical line bundle having semistable holomorphic tangent bundle, with respect to some Gauduchon metric. We exhibit (non-K\"ahler) compact complex simply connected manifolds with trivial canonical line bundle that admit non-closed holomorphic one-forms.</description>

      <title>Spectral rigidity of Liouville tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Laplace isospectral deformations within a conformal class of generic Liouville metrics on the two-dimensional torus that are linear in the deformation parameter are necessarily trivial. Two of the main ingredients in our proof are a noncancellation result for the wave trace and an analysis of the second order variational formula for the energy functional associated to closed geodesics. Noncancellation allows us to detect parts of the length spectrum from the Laplace spectrum and conclude rational integrability for the deformed geodesic flow (Liouville metrics are folklorically conjectured to be the only Riemannian metrics with integrable geodesic flow on the torus). We then use the second variational formula to show how the preservation of a single rational torus is sufficient to conclude triviality of the deformation, assuming linearity. We also present some evidence that our hypothesis of linearity may indeed be necessary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a large family of conformally covariant tridifferential operators as tangential operators in the Fefferman--Graham ambient space. Our construction is analogous to the linear and bilinear constructions of Graham--Jenne--Mason--Sparling and Case--Lin--Yuan, respectively. We also show that the symmetrization of our ambient operators are formally self-adjoint when acting on densities of the correct weight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a dynamical energy functional on compact ancient asymptotically Ricci-flat Ricci flows with modest decay using limits of conjugate heat flows. This functional satisfies a steady Ricci breather-type rigidity and provides an upper bound for the ordinary $\lambda$-functional while retaining many of its properties. In addition, motivated by work of Colding and Minicozzi, we derive local eigenvalue estimates for normalized Ricci flows coupled with conjugate heat flows.</description>

      <title>On smooth approximation of integral cycles mod 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every mod 2 integral cycle $T$ in a Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{M}$ can be approximated in flat norm by a cycle which is a smooth submanifold $\Sigma$ of nearly the same area, up to a singular set of codimension 3; in addition, this estimate on the singular set can be refined depending on the codimension of the cycle. Moreover, if the mod 2 homology class $\tau$ admits a smooth embedded representative, then $\Sigma$ can be chosen free of singularities. This article provides the unoriented version of the smooth approximation theorem for integral cycles.</description>

      <title>Sign-changing solutions to the Escobar problem on manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M, g)$ be a $n-$dimensional compact Riemannian manifold with boundary. The Escobar problem concerning the existence of a metric conformally equivalent to $g$ having constant scalar curvature on $M$ and constant mean curvature on its boundary is equivalent, in analytic terms, to finding a positive solution to a nonlinear boundary-value problem with critical growth. While the existence of positive solutions to this problem is by now well understood, the existence of sign-changing (nodal) solutions remains largely open. In this work we establish the existence of least-energy sign-changing solutions in two particular cases: the scalar-flat problem, where the scalar curvature on $M$ is zero and the mean curvature of its boundary is constant, and the minimal boundary problem, where the mean curvature of the boundary vanishes and the scalar curvature of $M$ is constant. More precisely, we prove that if $n\ge7$ and $M$ has a nonumbilic boundary point, then both problems admit least-energy nodal solutions. In addition, we show that when $n\ge5$, the minimal boundary problem possesses infinitely many sign-changing solutions on the unit ball. Our approach is variational and relies on the analysis of suitable conformal invariants and sharp energy estimates derived from Escobar's work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by work of various authors on domination between surface group representations, harmonic maps, and $3$-dimensional anti-de Sitter geometry, we study a new domination problem between non-Fuchsian representations of closed surface groups. We solve the problem for representations that admit branched harmonic immersions, and we show that, outside of this case, the problem cannot always be solved. We then show that a dominating pair gives rise to an anti-de Sitter $3$-manifold with singularities, and we construct large families of branched anti-de Sitter $3$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>A model-free method for discovering symmetry in differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry in differential equations reveals invariances and offers a powerful means to reduce model complexity. Lie group analysis characterizes these symmetries through infinitesimal generators, which provide a local, linear criterion for invariance. However, identifying Lie symmetries directly from scattered data, without explicit knowledge of the governing equations, remains a significant challenge. This work introduces a numerical scheme that approximates infinitesimal generators from data sampled on an unknown smooth manifold, enabling the recovery of continuous symmetries without requiring the analytical form of the differential equations. We employ a manifold learning technique, Generalized Moving Least Squares, to prolongate the data, from which a linear system is constructed whose null space encodes the infinitesimal generators representing the symmetries. Convergence bounds for the proposed approach are derived. Several numerical experiments, including ordinary and partial differential equations, demonstrate the method's accuracy, robustness, and convergence, highlighting its potential for data-driven discovery of symmetries in dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Wasserstein geometry, one-dimensional location-scale models are flat both intrinsically and extrinsically-that is, they are curvature-free as well as totally geodesic in the space of probability distributions. In this study, we introduce a class of one-dimensional statistical models, termed the location-scale-shape model, which generalizes several distributions used in extreme-value theory. This model has a shape parameter that specifies the tail heaviness. We investigate the Wasserstein geometry of the location-scale-shape model and show that it is intrinsically flat but extrinsically curved.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove some Liouville-type theorems for positive harmonic functions on compact Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and strictly convex boundary, thereby confirming some cases of Wang's conjecture (J. Geom. Anal. 31, 2021).
  We further investigate Wang's conjecture on warped product manifolds and provide a partial verification of this conjecture, which also yields an alternative proof of Gu-Li's resolution of the conjecture in the $\mathbb{B}^n$ case (Math. Ann. 391, 2025). Our approach is based on a general principle of employing the P-function method to such Liouville-type results, with particular emphasis on the role of a closed conformal vector field inherent to such manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We know from previous work with Italiano and Migliorini that there exists some hyperbolic 5-manifold that fibers over the circle. Here we build one example where the monodromy is a "pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism" of the 4-dimensional fiber, in a way that is surprisingly similar to the familiar and beautiful two-dimensional picture of Nielsen and Thurston for surfaces. This fact has various consequences:
  (1) There is a compact smooth 4-manifold $M$ such that no non-trivial class in $H_2(M)$ is represented by immersed tori, and infinitely many classes are represented by smoothly embedded genus two surfaces.
  (2) There is a compact locally CAT(0) space $Y$ such that $\pi_1(Y)$ is not hyperbolic and does not contain $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$.
  The latter answers a question of Gromov, known as the Closing Flat Problem.</description>

      <title>A gluing construction of $D_{k}$ ALF gravitational instantons and existence of non-holomorphic minimal spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note extends the construction of $D_{k}$ ALF gravitational instantons in Schroers--Singer to a new case where the nonlinear superposition is given by the $D_{1}$ Atiyah--Hitchin metric and $k-1$ copies of $A_{0}$ Taub-NUT metrics. We then give a general class of ALF spaces such that each of them contains a non-holomorphic minimal sphere. Together with Foscolo's construction this gives a large class of $K3$ surfaces containing non-holomorphic minimal spheres.</description>

      <title>Almost Hermitian structures on virtual moduli spaces of non-Abelian monopoles and applications to the topology of symplectic four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13809v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to our previous monograph arXiv:2010.15789 (to appear in AMS Memoirs), where we initiated our program to prove that the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality holds for closed, symplectic four-manifolds and, more generally, for closed, smooth four-manifolds with a Seiberg-Witten basic class. This inequality was first proved for compact, complex surfaces of general type independently by Miyaoka and Yau in 1977. Our approach uses a version of Morse theory for a natural Hamiltonian, the square of the $L^2$ norm of the coupled spinors, for the circle action on the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles over a closed four-manifold. It has the aim of proving the existence of a projectively anti-self-dual connection on a rank-two Hermitian vector bundle over a blow-up of the four-manifold, where the first Pontrjagin number of the vector bundle is negative and greater than or equal to minus the Euler characteristic of the blown-up four-manifold. Our Morse theory argument relies on positivity of virtual Morse-Bott indices for critical points of Hamiltonians for circle actions on complex analytic spaces (or real analytic spaces that, locally, are sufficiently well-approximated by complex analytic model spaces), as developed by the first author in arXiv:2206.14710. In our application to the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles, the critical points are fixed points of the circle action and thus represented by Seiberg-Witten monopoles.</description>

      <title>Normal Holonomy of Complex Hyperbolic Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the restricted normal holonomy group of a K\"ahler submanifold of the complex hyperbolic space $\mathbb{C}H^{n}$ is always transitive, provided the index of relative nullity is zero. This contrasts with the case of $\mathbb{C}P^{n}$, where a Berger type result was proved by Console, Di Scala, and the second author. The proof is based on lifting the submanifold to the pseudo-Riemannian space $\mathbb{C}^{n,1}$ and developing new tools to handle the difficulties arising from possible degeneracies in holonomy tubes and associated distributions. In particular, we introduce the notion of weakly polar actions and a framework for dealing with degenerate submanifolds. These techniques could contribute to a broader understanding of submanifold geometry in spaces with indefinite signature, offering new insight into submanifolds in the dual setting of complex projective geometry.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Calibration and Curvature Constraints on Product Manifolds: A Topological Lower Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11834v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a quantitative relationship between mixed cohomology classes and the geometric complexity of cohomologically calibrated metric connections with totally skew torsion on product manifolds. We show that the dimension of the off-diagonal curvature subspace of a connection \( \nabla^C \) is bounded below by the sum of tensor ranks of the mixed K\"unneth components of its calibration class, minus the dimension of the space of harmonic parallel forms on the first factor. The bound depends only on the mixed class $[\omega]_{\mathrm{mixed}}\in H^{3}(M;\mathbb{R})$ and on the space of $g_{1}$-parallel harmonic $2$-forms on $M_{1}$; it is therefore independent of the factor metric $g_{2}$ and of any deformation of $g_{1}$ that preserves parallel $2$-forms, hence it is metric-invariant modulo parallel-form preserving deformations. This provides a computational criterion for geometric complexity and quantifies the interaction between topology and curvature, yielding a quantified version of ``forced irreducibility'' via the dimension of $\mathfrak{hol}_{p}^{\mathrm{off}}(\nabla^{C})$.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we answer positively a question of Yau by proving the existence of closed minimal surfaces with negative induced curvature in any sphere of large dimension. The proof follows the strategy of Song, applying it to closed Riemann surfaces with large automorphism groups, and obtaining almost hyperbolic minimal surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the geometric structure of {\delta}- almost Yamabe solitons on paracontact metric manifolds endowed with a quarter-symmetric non-metric connection {\nabla}. We establish a series of classification results under specific assumptions, including collinearity with the Reeb vector fields, infinitesimal contact transformations, torse- forming, conformal and {X}-Ric vector fields on the potential vector field. Furthermore, we derive conditions under which the soliton is expand- ing, steady, or shrinking based on the relationship among the scalar curvature {r}, the soliton function {\lambda} and the structure functions of the manifold. Finally, we present an example that illustrates our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.01118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an equivariant Cerf theory for Morse functions on finite-dimensional manifolds with group actions, and adapt the technique to the infinite-dimensional setting to study the moduli space of perturbed flat $SU(n)$-connections. As a consequence, we prove the existence of perturbative $SU(n)$ Casson invariants on integer homology spheres for all $n\ge 3$, and write down an explicit formula when $n=4$. This generalizes the previous works of Boden and Herald.</description>

      <title>Non-hyperbolicity of holomorphic symplectic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11411v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove non-hyperbolicity of primitive symplectic varieties with $b_2 \geq 5$ that satisfy the rational SYZ conjecture. If in addition $b_2 \geq 7$, we establish that the Kobayashi pseudometric vanishes identically. This in particular applies to all currently known examples of irreducible symplectic manifolds and thereby completes the results by Kamenova--Lu--Verbitsky. The key new contribution is that a projective primitive symplectic variety with a Lagrangian fibration has vanishing Kobayashi pseudometric. The proof uses ergodicity, birational contractions, and cycle spaces.</description>
