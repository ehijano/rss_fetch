      <title>On the Tameness of Power Series Space Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, it is shown that the tameness of the K\"othe space pair $(\lambda^p(A),\lambda^q(B))$ is determined solely by the tameness of the family of quasi-diagonal operators defined between the pair of spaces. We use this tool to fill the gaps in characterization of pairs of power series spaces, adding to the previously established results of Dubinsky, Vogt, Nyberg and etc., and summarize this complete characterization in Table 1. As a result, we also show that the range of every continuous tame operator defined between power series spaces of infinite type has a basis.</description>

      <title>On the duality of DW-compact operators and DW-DP operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a necessary condition and a sufficient condition on the Banach lattices E and F so that an operator from E to F is DW-compact whenever its adjoint is DW-compact. We do the same, with different conditions, for DW-DP operators. Moreover, we characterize the Banach lattices E and F for which the adjoint of every DW-compact operator from E to F is DW-compact.</description>

      <title>On some generalized geometric constants with two parameters in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we build upon the TX constant that was introduced by Alonso and Llorens-Fuster in 2008. Through the incorporation of suitable parameters, we have successfully generalized the aforementioned constant into two novel forms of geometric constants, which are denoted as T1({\lambda},\mu,X ) and T2(\k{appa},{\tau},X ). First, we obtained some basic properties of these two constants, such as the upper and lower bounds. Next, these two constants served as the basis for our characterization of Hilbert spaces. More significantly, our findings reveal that these two constants exhibit a profound and intricate interrelation with other well-known constants in Banach spaces. Finally, we characterized uniformly non-square spaces by means of these two constants.</description>

      <title>The skew generalized von Neumann-Jordan type constant in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the von Neumann-Jordan type constants C(X) has defined by Takahashi. A new skew generalized constant Cp({\lambda},\mu,X) based on C(X) constant is given in this paper. First, we will obtain some basic properties of this new constant. Moreover, some relations between this new constant and other constants are investigated. Specially, with the Banach-Mazur distance, we use this new constant to study isomorphic Banach spaces. Ultimately, by leveraging the connection between the newly introduced constant and the weak orthogonality coefficient {\omega}(X), a sufficient condition for normal structure is established.</description>

      <title>Generalized upper and lower Legendre conjugates for Braun-Meise-Taylor weight functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply recent knowledge and techniques of the new generalized upper and lower Legendre conjugates to the theory of weight functions in the sense of Braun-Meise-Taylor and study in detail the effects on the corresponding associated weight matrices. An immediate and concrete application of the main statements is also provided. More precisely, we generalize a very recent result concerning the continuity and the range of the resolvent operator when being considered on weighted spaces of globally defined functions of Gelfand-Shilov type.</description>

      <title>M*-categories: Where limits in analysis and category theory meet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces M*-categories: an abstraction of categories with similar algebraic and analytic properties to the categories of real, complex, and quaternionic Hilbert spaces and bounded linear maps. Other examples include categories of Hilbert W*-modules and of unitary group-representations. M*-categories are "analytically" complete in two ways: every bounded increasing sequence of Hermitian endomorphisms has a supremum, and every suitably bounded orthogonal family of parallel morphisms is summable. These "analytic" completeness properties are not assumed outright; rather, they are derived, respectively, from two new universal constructions: codirected $\ell^2$-limits of contractions and $\ell^2$-products. In turn, these universal constructions are built from directed colimits in the wide subcategory of isometries.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we first obtain the operator norms of the $n$-dimensional Hardy-Littlewood-P\'{o}lya operator $\mathcal{H}$ from weighted Lebesgue spaces $L^p( \mathbb{R} ^n,| x |^{\beta} ) $ to weighted weak Lebesgue spaces $L^{q,\infty}(\mathbb{R} ^n,|x|^{\gamma})$.

      <title>Shift invariant subspaces in the Bloch space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider weak-star closed invariant subspaces of the shift operator in the classical Bloch space. We prove that any bounded analytic function decomposes into two factors, one which is cyclic and another one generating a proper shift invariant subspace, satisfying a permanence property, which in a certain way is opposite to cyclicity. Singular inner functions play the crucial role in this decomposition. We show in several different ways that the description of shift invariant subspaces generated by inner functions in the Bloch spaces deviates substantially from the corresponding description in the Bergman spaces, provided by the celebrated Korenblum and Roberts Theorem. Furthermore, the relationship between invertibility and cyclicity is also investigated and we provide an invertible function in the Bloch space which is not cyclic therein. Our results answer several open questions stated in the early nineties.</description>

      <title>Fourier Multipliers on Quasi-Banach Orlicz Spaces and Orlicz Modulation Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find that if a Fourier multiplier is continuous from $L^{\Phi_1}$ to $L^{\Phi_2}$, then it is also continuous from $M^{\Phi_1,\Psi}$ to $M^{\Phi_2,\Psi}$, where $\Phi_1,\Phi_2,\Psi$ are quasi-Young functions and $\Phi_1$ fulfills the $\Delta_2$-condition. This result is applied to show that Mihlin's Fourier multiplier theorem and H\"ormander's improvement hold in certain Orlicz modulation spaces. Lastly, we show that the Fourier multiplier with symbol $m(\xi) = e^{i \mu(\xi)}$, where $\mu$ is homogeneous of order $\alpha$, is bounded on quasi-Banach Orlicz modulation spaces of order $r$, assuming $r\in\big(d/(d+2),1\big]$ and $\alpha\in\big(d(1-r)/r, 2\big]$.</description>

      <title>$C^*$-extreme contractive completely positive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we generalize a specific quantized convexity structure of the generalized state space of a $C^*$-algebra and examine the associated extreme points. We introduce the notion of $P$-$C^*$-convex subsets, where $P$ is any positive operator on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. These subsets are defined with in the set of all completely positive (CP) maps from a unital $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ into the algebra $B(\mathcal{H})$ of bounded linear maps on $\mathcal{H}$. In particular, we focus on certain $P$-$C^*$-convex sets, denoted by $\mathrm{CP}^{(P)}(\mathcal{A},B(\mathcal{H}))$, and analyze their extreme points with respect to this new convexity structure. This generalizes the existing notions of $C^*$-convex subsets and $C^*$-extreme points of unital completely positive maps. We significantly extend many of the known results regarding the $C^*$-extreme points of unital completely positive maps into the context of $P$-$C^*$-convex sets we are considering. This includes abstract characterization and structure of $P$-$C^*$-extreme points. Further, using these studies, we completely characterize the $C^*$-extreme points of the $C^*$-convex set of all contractive completely positive maps from $\mathcal{A}$ into $B(\mathcal{H})$, where $\mathcal{H}$ is finite-dimensional. Additionally, we discuss the connection between $P$-$C^*$-extreme points and linear extreme points of these convex sets, as well as Krein-Milman type theorems.</description>

      <title>Numerical Approximation of Delay Differential Equations via Operator Splitting in Fractional Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05483v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a rigorous framework for the numerical approximation of both autonomous and non-autonomous delay differential equations (DDEs), with a focus on the implicit Euler method and sequential operator splitting.
  To overcome the difficulty that the delay operator does not generate an analytic semigroup in the standard space \( L^1[\tau, 0] \), we embed the problem into the interpolation space \( \left(L^1[\tau, 0], W^{1,1}_0[\tau, 0]\right)_{\theta, 1} \) for \( 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1 \), where the differential operator becomes sectorial. This allows the full operator \( L = A + B \) to generate an analytic semigroup \( T_L(t) \), enabling the use of semigroup theory to derive sharp error estimates.
  We prove that the implicit Euler method achieves a global error of order \( \mathcal{O}(h) \), while the Lie--Trotter splitting method yields an error of order \( \mathcal{O}(h^{2\theta - 1}) \) in the interpolation norm. These theoretical rates are confirmed by numerical experiments, including comparisons with exact solutions obtained via semi-analytical Fourier-based methods in the non-autonomous setting.</description>
