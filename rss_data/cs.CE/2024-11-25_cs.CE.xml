      <title>Multi-objective Bayesian Optimisation of Spinodoid Cellular Structures for Crush Energy Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of designing safer and more efficient energy-absorbing structures, engineers must tackle the challenge of improving crush performance while balancing multiple conflicting objectives, such as maximising energy absorption and minimising peak impact forces. Accurately simulating real-world conditions necessitates the use of complex material models to replicate the non-linear behaviour of materials under impact, which comes at a significant computational cost. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a multi-objective Bayesian optimisation framework specifically developed to optimise spinodoid structures for crush energy absorption. Spinodoid structures, characterised by their scalable, non-periodic topologies and efficient stress distribution, offer a promising direction for advanced structural design. However, optimising design parameters to enhance crush performance is far from straightforward, particularly under realistic conditions. Conventional optimisation methods, although effective, often require a large number of costly simulations to identify suitable solutions, making the process both time-consuming and resource intensive. In this context, multi-objective Bayesian optimisation provides a clear advantage by intelligently navigating the design space, learning from each evaluation to reduce the number of simulations required, and efficiently addressing the complexities of non-linear material behaviour. By integrating finite element analysis with Bayesian optimisation, the framework developed in this study tackles the dual challenge of improving energy absorption and reducing peak force, particularly in scenarios where plastic deformation plays a critical role. The use of scalarisation and hypervolume-based techniques enables the identification of Pareto-optimal solutions, balancing these conflicting objectives.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing with error mitigation for data-driven computational homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a crossover frontier of physics and mechanics, quantum computing is showing its great potential in computational mechanics. However, quantum hardware noise remains a critical barrier to achieving accurate simulation results due to the limitation of the current hardware. In this paper, we integrate error-mitigated quantum computing in data-driven computational homogenization, where the zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) technique is employed to improve the reliability of quantum computing. Specifically, ZNE is utilized to mitigate the quantum hardware noise in two quantum algorithms for distance calculation, namely a Swap-based algorithm and an H-based algorithm, thereby improving the overall accuracy of data-driven computational homogenization. Multiscale simulations of a 2D composite L-shaped beam and a 3D composite cylindrical shell are conducted with the quantum computer simulator Qiskit, and the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We believe this work presents a promising step towards using quantum computing in computational mechanics.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Physics-based System Identification for Robotic Manipulation of Elastoplastic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation of volumetric elastoplastic deformable materials, from foods such as dough to construction materials like clay, is in its infancy, largely due to the difficulty of modelling and perception in a high-dimensional space. Simulating the dynamics of such materials is computationally expensive. It tends to suffer from inaccurately estimated physics parameters of the materials and the environment, impeding high-precision manipulation. Estimating such parameters from raw point clouds captured by optical cameras suffers further from heavy occlusions. To address this challenge, this work introduces a novel Differentiable Physics-based System Identification (DPSI) framework that enables a robot arm to infer the physics parameters of elastoplastic materials and the environment using simple manipulation motions and incomplete 3D point clouds, aligning the simulation with the real world. Extensive experiments show that with only a single real-world interaction, the estimated parameters, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield stress and friction coefficients, can accurately simulate visually and physically realistic deformation behaviours induced by unseen and long-horizon manipulation motions. Additionally, the DPSI framework inherently provides physically intuitive interpretations for the parameters in contrast to black-box approaches such as deep neural networks.</description>
