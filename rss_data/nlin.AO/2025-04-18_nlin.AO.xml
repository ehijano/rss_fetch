      <title>Kinetic simulated annealing optimization with entropy-based cooling rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a modified simulated annealing method with a dynamical choice of the cooling temperature. The latter is determined via a closed-loop control and is proven to yield exponential decay of the entropy of the particle system. The analysis is carried out through kinetic equations for interacting particle systems describing the simulated annealing method in an extended phase space. Decay estimates are derived under the quasi-invariant scaling of the resulting system of Boltzmann-type equations to assess the consistency with their mean-field limit. Numerical results are provided to illustrate and support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Mining higher-order triadic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex systems often involve higher-order interactions which require us to go beyond their description in terms of pairwise networks. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic interactions are found in a large variety of biological systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have so far been mostly neglected. In this article, we propose a theoretical model that demonstrates that triadic interactions can modulate the mutual information between the dynamical state of two linked nodes. Leveraging this result, we propose the Triadic Interaction Mining (TRIM) algorithm to mine triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data, finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions that are often ignored, yet can transform our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from biology to the climate.</description>

      <title>Optimizing disorder with machine learning to harness synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disorder is often considered detrimental to coherence. However, under specific conditions, it can enhance synchronization. We develop a machine-learning framework to design optimal disorder configurations that maximize phase synchronization. In particular, utilizing the system of coupled nonlinear pendulums with disorder and noise, we train a feedforward neural network (FNN), with the disorder parameters as input, to predict the Shannon entropy index that quantifies the phase synchronization strength. The trained FNN model is then deployed to search for the optimal disorder configurations in the high-dimensional space of the disorder parameters, providing a computationally efficient replacement of the stochastic differential equation solvers. Our results demonstrate that the FNN is capable of accurately predicting synchronization and facilitates an efficient inverse design solution to optimizing and enhancing synchronization.</description>

      <title>Supercritical Fokker-Planck equations for consensus dynamics: large-time behaviour and weighted Nash-type inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the main properties of the solution of a Fokker-Planck equation characterized by a variable diffusion coefficient and a polynomial superlinear drift, modeling the formation of consensus in a large interacting system of individuals. The Fokker-Planck equation is derived from the kinetic description of the dynamics of a quantum particle system, and in presence of a high nonlinearity in the drift operator, mimicking the effects of the mass in the alignment forces, allows for steady states similar to a Bose-Einstein condensate. The main feature of this Fokker-Planck equation is the presence of a variable diffusion coefficient, a nonlinear drift and boundaries, which introduce new challenging mathematical problems in the study of its long-time behavior. In particular, propagation of regularity is shown as a consequence of new weighted Nash and Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities.</description>

      <title>Governance as a complex, networked, democratic, satisfiability problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Democratic governments comprise a subset of a population whose goal is to produce coherent decisions, solving societal challenges while respecting the will of the people. New governance frameworks represent this as a social network rather than as a hierarchical pyramid with centralized authority. But how should this network be structured? We model the decisions a population must make as a satisfiability problem and the structure of information flow involved in decision-making as a social hypergraph. This framework allows to consider different governance structures, from dictatorships to direct democracy. Between these extremes, we find a regime of effective governance where small overlapping decision groups make specific decisions and share information. Effective governance allows even incoherent or polarized populations to make coherent decisions at low coordination costs. Beyond simulations, our conceptual framework can explore a wide range of governance strategies and their ability to tackle decision problems that challenge standard governments.</description>
