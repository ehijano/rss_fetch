      <title>Supercritical Size-Width Tree-Like Resolution Trade-Offs for Graph Isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the refutation complexity of graph isomorphism in the tree-like resolution calculus. Tor\'an and W\"orz (TOCL 2023) showed that there is a resolution refutation of narrow width $k$ for two graphs if and only if they can be distinguished in ($k+1$)-variable first-order logic (FO$^{k+1}$) and hence by a count-free variant of the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm. While DAG-like narrow width $k$ resolution refutations have size at most $n^k$, tree-like refutations may be much larger. We show that there are graphs of order n, whose isomorphism can be refuted in narrow width $k$ but only in tree-like size $2^{\Omega(n^{k/2})}$. This is a supercritical trade-off where bounding one parameter (the narrow width) causes the other parameter (the size) to grow above its worst case. The size lower bound is super-exponential in the formula size and improves a related supercritical width versus tree-like size trade-off by Razborov (JACM 2016). To prove our result, we develop a new variant of the $k$-pebble EF-game for FO$^k$ to reason about tree-like refutation size in a similar way as the Prover-Delayer games in proof complexity. We analyze this game on a modified variant of the compressed CFI graphs introduced by Grohe, Lichter, Neuen, and Schweitzer (FOCS 2023). Using a recent improved robust compressed CFI construction of Janett, Nordstr\"om, and Pang (unpublished manuscript), we obtain a similar bound for width $k$ (instead of the stronger but less common narrow width) and make the result more robust.</description>

      <title>C2P: Featuring Large Language Models with Causal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal reasoning is the primary bottleneck that Large Language Models (LLMs) must overcome to attain human-level intelligence. To address this, we introduce the Causal Chain of Prompting (C2P) as the first reasoning framework that equips current LLMs with causal reasoning capabilities. C2P operates autonomously, avoiding reliance on external tools or modules during both the causal learning and reasoning phases, and can be seamlessly implemented during the training or fine-tuning of LLMs. Experimental results across various benchmark datasets demonstrate a significant improvement in causal learning and subsequent reasoning accuracy of LLMs. We illustrate how C2P enhances LLMs' ability to causally reason in real-world scenarios, addressing complex problems in fields such as healthcare, medicine, economics, education, social sciences, environmental science, and marketing. With few-shot learning, GPT-4 Turbo using C2P with as few as six examples achieves significant performance improvements, boasting over a 33% increase in reasoning accuracy over the most state-of-the-art LLMs, which perform nearly randomly in similar circumstances. This demonstrates the transformative potential of integrating C2P into LLM training or fine-tuning processes, thereby empowering these models with advanced causal reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>A process algebraic framework for multi-agent dynamic epistemic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper combines the classical model of labeled transition systems with the epistemic model for reasoning about knowledge. The result is a unifying framework for modeling and analyzing multi-agent, knowledge-based, dynamic systems. On the modeling side, we propose a process algebraic, agent-oriented specification language that makes such a framework easy to use for practical purposes. On the verification side, we define a modal logic encompassing temporal and epistemic operators.</description>

      <title>Pruning Boolean d-DNNF Circuits Through Tseitin-Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boolean circuits in d-DNNF form enable tractable probabilistic inference. However, as a key insight of this work, we show that commonly used d-DNNF compilation approaches introduce irrelevant subcircuits. We call these subcircuits Tseitin artifacts, as they are introduced due to the Tseitin transformation step -- a well-established procedure to transform any circuit into the CNF format required by several d-DNNF knowledge compilers. We discuss how to detect and remove both Tseitin variables and Tseitin artifacts, leading to more succinct circuits. We empirically observe an average size reduction of 77.5% when removing both Tseitin variables and artifacts. The additional pruning of Tseitin artifacts reduces the size by 22.2% on average. This significantly improves downstream tasks that benefit from a more succinct circuit, e.g., probabilistic inference tasks.</description>

      <title>The Existential Theory of the Reals as a Complexity Class: A Compendium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey the complexity class $\exists \mathbb{R}$, which captures the complexity of deciding the existential theory of the reals. The class $\exists \mathbb{R}$ has roots in two different traditions, one based on the Blum-Shub-Smale model of real computation, and the other following work by Mn\"{e}v and Shor on the universality of realization spaces of oriented matroids. Over the years the number of problems for which $\exists \mathbb{R}$ rather than NP has turned out to be the proper way of measuring their complexity has grown, particularly in the fields of computational geometry, graph drawing, game theory, and some areas in logic and algebra. $\exists \mathbb{R}$ has also started appearing in the context of machine learning, Markov decision processes, and probabilistic reasoning.
  We have aimed at collecting a comprehensive compendium of problems complete and hard for $\exists \mathbb{R}$, as well as a long list of open problems. The compendium is presented in the third part of our survey; a tour through the compendium and the areas it touches on makes up the second part. The first part introduces the reader to the existential theory of the reals as a complexity class, discussing its history, motivation and prospects as well as some technical aspects.</description>

      <title>One is all you need: Second-order Unification without First-order Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10616v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a fragment of second-order unification, referred to as \emph{Second-Order Ground Unification (SOGU)}, with the following properties: (i) only one second-order variable is allowed, and (ii) first-order variables do not occur. We study an equational variant of SOGU where the signature contains \textit{associative} binary function symbols (ASOGU) and show that Hilbert's 10$^{th}$ problem is reducible to ASOGU unifiability, thus proving undecidability. Our reduction provides a new lower bound for the undecidability of second-order unification, as previous results required first-order variable occurrences, multiple second-order variables, and/or equational theories involving \textit{length-reducing} rewrite systems. Furthermore, our reduction holds even in the case when associativity of the binary function symbol is restricted to \emph{power associative}, i.e. f(f(x,x),x)= f(x,f(x,x)), as our construction requires a single constant.</description>

      <title>Model-bounded monitoring of hybrid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.07401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monitoring of hybrid systems attracts both scientific and practical attention. However, monitoring algorithms suffer from the methodological difficulty of only observing sampled discrete-time signals, while real behaviors are continuous-time signals. To mitigate this problem of sampling uncertainties, we introduce a model-bounded monitoring scheme, where we use prior knowledge about the target system to prune interpolation candidates. Technically, we express such prior knowledge by linear hybrid automata (LHAs) -- the LHAs are called bounding models. We introduce a novel notion of monitored language of LHAs, and we reduce the monitoring problem to the membership problem of the monitored language. We present two partial algorithms -- one is via reduction to reachability in LHAs and the other is a direct one using polyhedra -- and show that these methods, and thus the proposed model-bounded monitoring scheme, are efficient and practically relevant.</description>

      <title>History-deterministic Timed Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03183v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the notion of history-determinism in the context of timed automata (TA) over infinite timed words. History-deterministic (HD) automata are those in which nondeterminism can be resolved on the fly, based on the run constructed thus far. History-determinism is a robust property that admits different game-based characterisations, and HD specifications allow for game-based verification without an expensive determinization step.
  We show that the class of timed $\omega$-languages recognized by HD timed automata strictly extends that of deterministic ones, and is strictly included in those recognised by fully non-deterministic TA.
  For non-deterministic timed automata it is known that universality is already undecidable for safety/reachability TA. For history-deterministic TA with arbitrary parity acceptance, we show that timed universality, inclusion, and synthesis all remain decidable and are EXPTIME-complete.
  For the subclass of TA with safety or reachability acceptance, one can decide (in EXPTIME) whether such an automaton is history-deterministic. If so, it can effectively determinized without introducing new automata states.</description>
