      <title>qs$GW$ quasiparticle and $GW$-BSE excitation energies of 133,885 molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning applications in the chemical sciences, especially when based on neural networks, critically depend on the availability of large quantities of high quality data. As they provide excellent accuracy for both charged and neutral excitations, a large dataset containing quasiparticle self-consistent GW (qs$GW$) and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) data would be highly desirable to model excited state energies and properties. In this work, we introduce a dataset for qs$GW$-BSE excitation energies and qs$GW$ quasiparticle energies of unprecedented size. Our dataset, denoted QM9GWBSE, supplies $GW$-BSE singlet-singlet and singlet-triplet excitation energies, corresponding transition dipole moments and oscillator strengths as well as qs$GW$ quasiparticle energies for all molecules from the popular QM9 dataset. We anticipate that QM9GWBSE will provide a solid foundation to train highly accurate machine learning models for the prediction of molecular excited state properties.</description>

      <title>Basic requirements for potential differences across solid--fluid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At model water--vapor and water--solid interfaces, molecular ordering leads to charge oscillations and, thereby, to a spatially varying electrostatic potential. Atomistic simulations indicate that such ordering leads to an electric potential difference $\chi$, the surface potential, of about $-0.5\,\mathrm{V}$ across the first few molecular layers. Here, we calculate surface potentials at interfaces between a simple model fluids and a solid, with Molecular Dynamics simulations. The fluids are made up of either diatomic, dipolar molecules or a single Lennard-Jones particle with a dipole moment. All fluids show some structuring near the interface, but charge oscillations and a non-zero surface potential are present only for asymmetric molecules (unequal diameters of the atoms) or molecules with an off-center dipole. We condense this finding into the criterion that the geometric and dipolar centers of a molecule must differ for the fluid to exhibit a surface potential. Remarkably, while the solid--fluid interaction strength strongly affects the magnitude of charge oscillations, it hardly affects the potential drop $\chi$. Further, our results demonstrate that changing the diameter of the smaller atom can flip the sign of the surface potential, thus highlighting the importance of steric effects.</description>

      <title>Excitation energies and UV-Vis absorption spectra from INDO/s+ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The semi-empirical INDO/s method is popular for studies of excitation energies and absorption of molecules due to its low computational requirement, making it possible to make predictions for large systems. However, its accuracy is generally low, particularly, when compared with the typical accuracy of other methods such as time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Here, we present machine learning (ML) models that correct the INDO/s results with negligible increases in the amount of computing resources needed. While INDO/s excitations energies have an average error of about 1.1 eV relative to TDDFT energies, the added ML corrections reduce the error to 0.2 eV. Furthermore, this combination of INDO/s and ML produces UV-Vis absorption spectra that are in good agreement with the TDDFT predictions.</description>

      <title>An Extended Mixed Quantum/Classical Approach for Quantitative Calculation of Complex Refractive Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mixed quantum/classical approach of Skinner and co-workers has been widely used to calculate the line shapes of the infrared spectra of water (H2O), but less attention has been paid to the use of this approach in quantitatively calculating spectral intensity, thereby limiting direct comparisons of calculated and experimental spectra. Here, we extend this theoretical framework to facilitate direct computation of the full complex refractive index of water, replacing the normalized ordinate used in previous studies. Our results for the OH stretching region of H2O capture both the shapes and intensities of the experimental spectra. They reveal that inclusion of the local field effect is crucial to the accurate reproduction of spectral intensity. This extended approach enables new areas of analysis of the bulk, thin-film, and cluster spectra of water.</description>

      <title>Topological Engineering of a Frustrated Antiferromagnetic Triradical in Aza-Triangulene Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-shell nanographenes provide a versatile platform to host unconventional magnetic states within their {\pi}-conjugated networks. Particularly appealing are graphene architectures that incorporate spatially separated radicals and tunable interactions, offering a scalable route toward spin-based quantum architectures. Triangulenes are ideal for this purpose, as their radical count scales with size, although strong hybridization prevents individual spin control. Here, we realize a radical reconfiguration strategy that transforms a single-radical aza-triangulene into a frustrated antiferromagnetic triradical by covalently extending it with armchair anthene moieties of increasing length. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy reveals edge-localized Kondo resonances and a doublet-to-quartet spin excitation, evidencing the emergence of correlated spins. Multi-reference electronic-structure calculations trace the progressive increase in polyradical character with anthene length, driven by the clustering of frontier states within a narrow energy window. Consequently, the initial single-radical doublet reorganizes into a frustrated triradical with weakly coupled edge spins, a molecular analog of a three-qubit quantum register.</description>

      <title>Metatensor and metatomic: foundational libraries for interoperable atomistic machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incorporation of machine learning (ML) techniques into atomic-scale modeling has proven to be an extremely effective strategy to improve the accuracy and reduce the computational cost of simulations. It also entails conceptual and practical challenges, as it involves combining very different mathematical foundations, as well as software ecosystems that are very well developed in their own right, but do not share many commonalities. To address these issues and facilitate the adoption of ML in atomistic simulations, we introduce two dedicated software libraries. The first one, metatensor, provides multi-platform and multi-language storage and manipulation of arrays with many potentially sparse indices, designed from the ground up for atomistic ML applications. By combining the actual values with metadata that describes their nature and that facilitates the handling of geometric information and gradients with respect to the atomic positions, metatensor provides a common framework to enable data sharing between ML software -- typically written in Python -- and established atomistic modeling tools -- typically written in Fortran, C or C++. The second library, metatomic, provides an interface to store an atomistic ML model and metadata about this model in a portable way, facilitating the implementation, training and distribution of models, and their use across different simulation packages. We showcase a growing ecosystem of tools, including low-level libraries, training utilities, and interfaces with existing software packages that demonstrate the effectiveness of metatensor and metatomic in bridging the gap between traditional simulation software and modern ML frameworks.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional electronic spectra from trajectory-based dynamics: pure-state Ehrenfest, spin-mapping, and mean classical path approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) provides a detailed picture of electronically nonadiabatic dynamics that can be interpreted with the aid of simulations. Here, we develop and contrast trajectory-based nonadiabatic dynamics approaches for simulating 2DES spectra. First, we argue that an improved pure-state Ehrenfest approach can be constructed by decomposing the initial coherence into a sum of equatorial pure states that contain equal contributions from the states in the coherence. We then use this framework to show how one can obtain a more accurate, but computationally more expensive, approximation to the third-order 2DES response function by replacing Ehrenfest dynamics with spin mapping during the pump-probe delay time. We end by comparing and contrasting the accuracy of these methods and the simpler mean classical path approximation in reproducing the exact linear, pump-probe, and 2DES spectra of two Frenkel exciton models: a coupled dimer system and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex.</description>

      <title>Enhancing NMR Shielding Predictions of Atoms-in-Molecules Machine Learning Models with Neighborhood-Informed Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shielding with machine learning (ML) models remains a central challenge for data-driven spectroscopy. We present atomic variants of the Coulomb matrix (aCM) and bag-of-bonds (aBoB) descriptors, and extend them using radial basis functions (RBFs) to yield smooth, per-atom representations (aCM-RBF, aBoB-RBF). Local structural information is incorporated by augmenting each atomic descriptor with contributions from the n nearest neighbors, resulting in the family of descriptors, aCM-RBF(n) and aBoB-RBF(n). For 13C shielding prediction on the QM9NMR dataset (831,925 shielding values across 130,831 molecules), aBoB-RBF(4) achieves an out-of-sample mean error of 1.69 ppm, outperforming models reported in previous studies. While explicit three-body descriptors further reduce errors at a higher cost, aBoB-RBF(4) offers the best balance of accuracy and efficiency. Benchmarking on external datasets comprising larger molecules (GDBm, Drug12/Drug40, and pyrimidinone derivatives) confirms the robustness and transferability of aBoB-RBF(4), establishing it as a practical tool for ML-based NMR shielding prediction.</description>

      <title>Non-Resonant Raman Optical Activity From Phase-Space Electronic Structure Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to model experimental non-resonant Raman optical activity, chemists must compute a host of second-order response tensors, (e.g. the electric-dipole magnetic-dipole polarizability) and their nuclear derivatives along a set of vibrational modes. While these response functions are almost always computed within a Born-Oppenheimer (BO) framework, here we provide a natural interpretation of the electric-dipole magnetic-dipole polarizability within phase space electronic structure theory, a beyond-BO model whereby the electronic structure depends on nuclear momentum (P) in addition to nuclear position (R). By coupling to nuclear momentum, phase space electronic structure theory is able to capture the asymmetric response of the electronic properties to an external field, in sofar as for a vibrating (non-stationary) molecule, dmu/dB \ne dm/dF, where mu and m are the electrical linear and magnetic dipoles, and F and B are electric and magnetic fields. As an example, for a prototypical methyloxirane molecule, we show that phase space electronic structure theory is able to deliver a reasonably good match with experimental results in a manner that is invariant to gauge origin G0.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Simulation of Non-Adiabatic Molecular Dynamics with Precise Electronic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study of non-adiabatic chemical processes such as photocatalysis and photosynthesis, non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) is an indispensable theoretical tool, which requires precise potential energy surfaces (PESs) of ground and excited states. Quantum computing offers promising potential for calculating PESs that are intractable for classical computers. However, its realistic application poses significant challenges to the development of quantum algorithms that are sufficiently general to enable efficient and precise PES calculations across chemical systems with diverse properties, as well as to seamlessly adapt existing NAMD theories to quantum computing. In this work, we introduce a quantum-adapted extension to the Landau-Zener-Surface-Hopping (LZSH) NAMD. This extension incorporates curvature-driven hopping corrections that protect the population evolution while maintaining the efficiency gained from avoiding the computation of non-adiabatic couplings (NACs), as well as preserving the trajectory independence that enables parallelization. Furthermore, to ensure the high-precision PESs required for surface hopping dynamics, we develop a sub-microhartree-accurate PES calculation protocol. This protocol supports active space selection, enables parallel acceleration either on quantum or classical clusters, and demonstrates adaptability to diverse chemical systems - including the charged H3+ ion and the C2H4 molecule, a prototypical multi-reference benchmark. This work paves the way for practical application of quantum computing in NAMD, showcasing the potential of parallel simulation on quantum-classical heterogeneous clusters for ab-initio computational chemistry.</description>

Abstract: Delocalization error prevents density functional theory (DFT) from reaching its full potential, causing problems like systematically underestimated band gaps and misaligned energy levels at interfaces. We introduce lrLOSC to correct delocalization error in materials over a wide range of band gaps. We predict eleven materials' fundamental gaps to within 0.22 eV, while offering a nonzero total energy correction; molecular properties are improved with a parallel implementation of the same theory [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 16, 2492 (2025)]. lrLOSC is an essential step toward modeling molecules, materials, and their interfaces within the same DFT framework.</description>

      <title>Efficient absolute interface energy calculations for heterostructures: Synergy between localized basis sets and surface passivation techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures combining diverse physico-chemical properties are increasingly in demand for a wide range of applications in modern science and technology. However, despite their importance in materials science, accurately determining absolute interface energies remains a major challenge. Here, we present a computationally efficient framework for determining interface energies by incorporating a surface passivation technique, demonstrated using pseudo H passivation with a localized basis set method and an explicit chemical potential. This framework is applied to calculate absolute interface energies and analyze the electronic properties of quasi lattice matched and lattice mismatched III and V on Si interfaces, with results compared to conventional reconstructed surface calculations. By combining localized basis sets with surface passivation techniques, this framework allows for accurate estimation of absolute interface energies in heterogeneous material systems. This approach effectively addresses issues associated with surface reconstructions while significantly reducing computational costs within the framework of density functional theory, and moreover offers considerable potential for calculating interface energies across diverse material systems.</description>

      <title>RoFt-Mol: Benchmarking Robust Fine-Tuning with Molecular Graph Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of foundation models, fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific downstream tasks has become crucial. This drives the need for robust fine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse labeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties that complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training datasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which require enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse objectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better understand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based, representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on downstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and self-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive evaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined robust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble fine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types while maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.</description>

      <title>Practical protein-pocket hydration-site prediction for drug discovery on a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Demonstrating the practical utility of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware for recurrent tasks in Computer-Aided Drug Discovery is of paramount importance. We tackle this challenge by performing three-dimensional protein pockets hydration-site prediction on a quantum computer. Formulating the water placement problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), we use a hybrid approach coupling a classical three-dimensional reference-interaction site model (3D-RISM) to an efficient quantum optimization solver, to run various hardware experiments up to 123 qubits. Matching the precision of classical approaches, our results reproduced experimental predictions on real-life protein-ligand complexes. Furthermore, through a detailed resource estimation analysis, we show that accuracy can be systematically improved with increasing number of qubits, indicating that full quantum utility is in reach. Finally, we provide evidence that advantageous situations could be found for systems where classical optimization struggles to provide optimal solutions. The method has potential for assisting simulations of protein-ligand complexes for drug lead optimization and setup of docking calculations.</description>

Abstract: We present a fully analytical integration of the Maxwell stress tensor and derive exact relations for interparticle forces in systems of multiple dielectric spheres immersed in a polarizable ionic solvent, within the framework of the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann theory. Building upon the screening-ranged (in ascending orders of Debye screening) expansions of the potentials developed and rigorously analyzed in the accompanying works arXiv:2512.08407, arXiv:2512.08684, arXiv:2512.09421, we construct exact screening-ranged many-body expansions for electrostatic forces in explicit analytical form. These results establish a rigorous foundation for evaluating screened electrostatic interactions in complex particle systems and provide direct analytical connections to, and systematic improvements upon, various earlier approximate or limited-case formulations available in the literature, both at zero and finite ionic strength.</description>

      <title>Many interacting particles in solution. III. Spectral analysis of the associated Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of particles in an electrolytic medium can be calculated by solving the Poisson equation inside the solutes and the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation in the solvent, with suitable boundary conditions at the interfaces. Analytical approaches often expand the potentials in spherical harmonics, relating interior and exterior coefficients and eliminating some coefficients in favor of others, but a rigorous spectral analysis of the corresponding formulations is still lacking. Here, we introduce pertinent composite many-body Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators and prove that they are compact with spectral radii strictly less than one. These results provide the foundation for systematic screening-ranged expansions, in powers of the Debye screening parameters, of electrostatic potentials, interaction energies, and forces, and establish the analytical framework for the accompanying works arXiv:2512.09421, arXiv:2512.08407, arXiv:2512.08682.</description>

      <title>Exact Screening-Ranged Expansions for Many-Body Electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact many-body framework for electrostatic interactions among $N$ arbitrarily charged spheres in an electrolyte, modeled by the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation. Building on a spectral analysis of nonstandard Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators introduced in a companion mathematical work arXiv:2512.08684, we construct convergent screening-ranged series for the potential, interaction energy, and forces, where each term is associated with a well-defined Debye--H\"uckel screening order and can be obtained evaluating an analytical expression rather than numerically solving an infinitely dimensional linear system. This formulation unifies and extends classical and recent approaches, providing a rigorous basis for electrostatic interactions among heterogeneously charged particles (including Janus colloids) and yielding many-body generalizations of analytical explicit-form results previously available only for two-body systems. The framework captures and clarifies complex effects such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, and like-charge attraction, which remain largely analytically elusive in existing treatments. Beyond its fundamental significance, the method leads to numerically efficient schemes, offering a versatile tool for modeling colloids and soft/biological matter in electrolytic solution.</description>
