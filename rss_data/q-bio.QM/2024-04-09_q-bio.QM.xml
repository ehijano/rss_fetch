      <title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence in Predicting Adverse Drug Reactions among Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adverse drug reactions considerably impact patient outcomes and healthcare costs in cancer therapy. Using artificial intelligence to predict adverse drug reactions in real time could revolutionize oncology treatment. This study aims to assess the performance of artificial intelligence models in predicting adverse drug reactions in patients with cancer. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis. Scopus, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library databases were searched for studies in English, French, and Arabic from January 1, 2018, to August 20, 2023. The inclusion criteria were: (1) peer-reviewed research articles; (2) use of artificial intelligence algorithms (machine learning, deep learning, knowledge graphs); (3) study aimed to predict adverse drug reactions (cardiotoxicity, neutropenia, nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity); (4) study was on cancer patients. The data were extracted and evaluated by three reviewers for study quality. Of the 332 screened articles, 17 studies (5%) involving 93,248 oncology patients from 17 countries were included in the systematic review, of which ten studies synthesized the meta-analysis. A random-effects model was created to pool the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of the included studies. The pooled results were 0.82 (95% CI:0.69, 0.9), 0.84 (95% CI:0.75, 0.9), and 0.83 (95% CI:0.77, 0.87) for sensitivity, specificity, and AUC, respectively, of ADR predictive models. Biomarkers proved their effectiveness in predicting ADRs, yet they were adopted by only half of the reviewed studies. The use of AI in cancer treatment shows great potential, with models demonstrating high specificity and sensitivity in predicting ADRs. However, standardized research and multicenter studies are needed to improve the quality of evidence. AI can enhance cancer patient care by bridging the gap between data-driven insights and clinical expertise.</description>

      <title>Martinize2 and Vermouth: Unified Framework for Topology Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ongoing advances in force field and computer hardware development enable the use of molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate increasingly complex systems with the ultimate goal of reaching cellular complexity. At the same time, rational design by high-throughput (HT) simulations is another forefront of MD. In these areas, the Martini coarse-grained force field, especially the latest version (i.e. v3), is being actively explored because it offers enhanced spatial-temporal resolution. However, the automation tools for preparing simulations with the Martini force field, accompanying the previous version, were not designed for HT simulations or studies of complex cellular systems. Therefore, they become a major limiting factor. To address these shortcomings, we present the open-source vermouth python library. Vermouth is designed to become the unified framework for developing programs, which prepare, run, and analyze Martini simulations of complex systems. To demonstrate the power of the vermouth library, the martinize2 program is showcased as a generalization of the martinize script, originally aimed to set up simulations of proteins. In contrast to the previous version, martinize2 automatically handles protonation states in proteins and post-translation modifications, offers more options to fine-tune structural biases such as the elastic network, and can convert non-protein molecules such as ligands. Finally, martinize2 is used in two high-complexity benchmarks. The entire I-TASSER protein template database as well as a subset of 200,000 structures from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database are converted to CG resolution and we illustrate how the checks on input structure quality can safeguard HT applications.</description>

      <title>Transformer-based de novo peptide sequencing for data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) stands as the predominant high-throughput technique for comprehensively analyzing protein content within biological samples. This methodology is a cornerstone driving the advancement of proteomics. In recent years, substantial strides have been made in Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) strategies, facilitating impartial and non-targeted fragmentation of precursor ions. The DIA-generated MS/MS spectra present a formidable obstacle due to their inherent high multiplexing nature. Each spectrum encapsulates fragmented product ions originating from multiple precursor peptides. This intricacy poses a particularly acute challenge in de novo peptide/protein sequencing, where current methods are ill-equipped to address the multiplexing conundrum. In this paper, we introduce DiaTrans, a deep-learning model based on transformer architecture. It deciphers peptide sequences from DIA mass spectrometry data. Our results show significant improvements over existing STOA methods, including DeepNovo-DIA and PepNet. Casanovo-DIA enhances precision by 15.14% to 34.8%, recall by 11.62% to 31.94% at the amino acid level, and boosts precision by 59% to 81.36% at the peptide level. Integrating DIA data and our DiaTrans model holds considerable promise to uncover novel peptides and more comprehensive profiling of biological samples.
