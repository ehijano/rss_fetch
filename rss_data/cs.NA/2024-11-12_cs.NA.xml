      <title>A novel study on the MUSIC-type imaging of small electromagnetic inhomogeneities in the limited-aperture inverse scattering problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm for the location reconstruction of a set of {two-dimensional circle-like} small inhomogeneities in the limited-aperture inverse scattering problem. Compared with the full- or limited-view inverse scattering problem, the collected multi-static response (MSR) matrix is no more symmetric (thus not Hermitian), and therefore, it is difficult to define the projection operator onto the noise subspace through the traditional approach. With the help of an asymptotic expansion formula in the presence of small inhomogeneities and the structure of the MSR-matrix singular vector associated with nonzero singular values, we define an alternative projection operator onto the noise subspace and the corresponding MUSIC imaging function. To demonstrate the feasibility of the designed MUSIC, we show that the imaging function can be expressed by an infinite series of integer-order Bessel functions of the first kind and the range of incident and observation directions. Furthermore, we identify that the main factors of the imaging function for the permittivity and permeability contrast cases are the Bessel function of order zero and one, respectively. This further implies that the imaging performance significantly depends on the range of incident and observation directions; peaks of large magnitudes appear at the location of inhomogeneities for permittivity contrast case, and for the permeability contrast case, peaks of large magnitudes appear at the location of inhomogeneities when the range of such directions are narrow, while two peaks of large magnitudes appear in the neighborhood of the location of inhomogeneities when the range is wide enough. The numerical simulation results via noise-corrupted synthetic data also show that the designed MUSIC algorithm can address both permittivity and permeability contrast cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of explicit tamed Euler--Maruyama (TEM) schemes, which can preserve the same Lyapunov structure for super-linear stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs) driven by multiplicative noise.These TEM schemes are shown to inherit the geometric ergodicity of the considered SODEs and converge with optimal strong convergence orders.

      <title>Predicting band structures for 2D Photonic Crystals via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic crystals (PhCs) are periodic dielectric structures that exhibit unique electromagnetic properties, such as the creation of band gaps where electromagnetic wave propagation is inhibited. Accurately predicting dispersion relations, which describe the frequency and direction of wave propagation, is vital for designing innovative photonic devices. However, traditional numerical methods, like the Finite Element Method (FEM), can encounter significant computational challenges due to the multiple scales present in photonic crystals, especially when calculating band structures across the entire Brillouin zone. To address this, we propose a supervised learning approach utilizing U-Net, along with transfer learning and Super-Resolution techniques, to forecast dispersion relations for 2D PhCs. Our model reduces computational expenses by producing high-resolution band structures from low-resolution data, eliminating the necessity for fine meshes throughout the Brillouin zone. The U-Net architecture enables the simultaneous prediction of multiple band functions, enhancing efficiency and accuracy compared to existing methods that handle each band function independently. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed model achieves high accuracy in predicting the initial band functions of 2D PhCs, while also significantly enhancing computational efficiency. This amalgamation of data-driven and traditional numerical techniques provides a robust framework for expediting the design and optimization of photonic crystals. The approach underscores the potential of integrating deep learning with established computational physics methods to tackle intricate multiscale problems, establishing a new benchmark for future PhC research and applications.</description>

      <title>On the convection boundedness of numerical schemes across discontinuities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note introduces a novel diagnostic tool for evaluating the convection boundedness properties of numerical schemes across discontinuities. The proposed method is based on the convection boundedness criterion and the normalised variable diagram. By utilising this tool, we can determine the CFL conditions for numerical schemes to satisfy the convection boundedness criterion, identify the locations of over- and under-shoots, optimize the free parameters in the schemes, and develop strategies to prevent numerical oscillations across the discontinuity. We apply the diagnostic tool to assess representative discontinuity-capturing schemes, including THINC, fifth-order WENO, and fifth-order TENO, and validate the conclusions drawn through numerical tests. We further demonstrate the application of the proposed method by formulating a new THINC scheme with less stringent CFL conditions.</description>

      <title>Improved Convergence and Approximation properties of Baskakov-Durrmeyer Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe two novel changes to the Baskakov-Durrmeyer operators that improve their approximation performance. These improvements are especially designed to produce higher rates of convergence, with orders of one or two. This is a major improvement above the linear rate of convergence commonly associated with conventional Baskakov-Durrmeyer operators. Our research goes thoroughly into the approximation features of these modified operators, providing a thorough examination of their convergence behavior. We concentrate on calculating precise convergence rates, providing thorough error estimates that demonstrate the new operators' efficiency as compared to the classical version. In addition, we construct Voronovskaja-type formulae for these operators, which provide insights into the asymptotic behavior of the approximation process as the operator's degree grows. By exploring these aspects, we demonstrate that the proposed modifications not only surpass the classical operators in terms of convergence speed but also offer a more refined approach to error estimation, making them a powerful tool for approximation theory.</description>

      <title>A Natural Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient Method for Adversarial Neural Network Training on Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scalable preconditioned primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). We multiply the PDE with a dual test function to obtain an inf-sup problem whose loss functional involves lower-order differential operators. The Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) algorithm is then leveraged for this saddle point problem. By introducing suitable precondition operators to the proximal steps in the PDHG algorithm, we obtain an alternative natural gradient ascent-descent optimization scheme for updating the neural network parameters. We apply the Krylov subspace method (MINRES) to evaluate the natural gradients efficiently. Such treatment readily handles the inversion of precondition matrices via matrix-vector multiplication. A posterior convergence analysis is established for the time-continuous version of the proposed method. The algorithm is tested on various types of PDEs with dimensions ranging from $1$ to $50$, including linear and nonlinear elliptic equations, reaction-diffusion equations, and Monge-Amp\`ere equations stemming from the $L^2$ optimal transport problems. We compare the performance of the proposed method with several commonly used deep learning algorithms such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), the DeepRitz method, weak adversarial networks (WANs), etc, for solving PDEs using the Adam and L-BFGS optimizers. The numerical results suggest that the proposed method performs efficiently and robustly and converges more stably.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the systematic design of compliant morphing structures composed of materials reacting to an external stimulus. We add a perimeter penalty term to ensure existence of solutions. We propose a phase-field approximation of this sharp interface problem, prove its convergence as the regularization length approaches 0 and present an efficient numerical implementation. We illustrate the strengths of our approach through a series of numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Eigen-componentwise convergence of SGD for quadratic programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a workhorse algorithm for solving large-scale optimization problems in data science and machine learning. Understanding the convergence of SGD is hence of fundamental importance. In this work we examine the SGD convergence (with various step sizes) when applied to unconstrained convex quadratic programming (essentially least-squares (LS) problems), and in particular analyze the error components respect to the eigenvectors of the Hessian. The main message is that the convergence depends largely on the corresponding eigenvalues (singular values of the coefficient matrix in the LS context), namely the components for the large singular values converge faster in the initial phase. We then show there is a phase transition in the convergence where the convergence speed of the components, especially those corresponding to the larger singular values, will decrease. Finally, we show that the convergence of the overall error (in the solution) tends to decay as more iterations are run, that is, the initial convergence is faster than the asymptote.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of the cross-diffusion Cahn-Hilliard model in lymphangiogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a fully discrete finite element numerical scheme with a stabilizer for the cross-diffusion Cahn--Hilliard model arising in modeling the pre-pattern in lymphangiogenesis is proposed and analysed. The discrete energy dissipation stability and existence of the numerical solution for the scheme are proven. The rigorous error estimate analysis is carried out based on establishing one new $L^{\frac43}(0,T;L^{\frac65}(\Omega))$ norm estimate for nonlinear cross-diffusion term in the error system uniformly in time and spacial step sizes. The convergence of the numerical solution to the solution of the continuous problem is also proven by establishing one new $L^{\frac43}(0,T;W^{1,\frac65}(\Omega))$ norm estimate for the approximating chemical potential sequence, which overcomes the difficulty that here we can not obtain $l^2(0,T;H^1(\Omega))$ estimate for the numerical chemical potential uniformly in time and spacial step sizes because of the nonlinear cross-diffusion characterization of the Cahn--Hilliard cross-diffusion model. Our investigation reveals the connection between this cross-diffusion model and the Cahn--Hilliard equation and verifies the effectiveness of the numerical method. In addition, numerical results are presented to illustrate our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Variational derivation and compatible discretizations of the Maxwell-GLM system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel variational derivation of the Maxwell-GLM system, which augments the original vacuum Maxwell equations via a generalized Lagrangian multiplier approach (GLM) by adding two supplementary acoustic subsystems and which was originally introduced by Munz et al. for purely numerical purposes in order to treat the divergence constraints of the magnetic and the electric field in the vacuum Maxwell equations within general-purpose and non-structure-preserving numerical schemes for hyperbolic PDE. Among the many mathematically interesting features of the model are: i) its symmetric hyperbolicity, ii) the extra conservation law for the total energy density and, most importantly, iii) the very peculiar combination of the basic differential operators, since both, curl-curl and div-grad combinations are mixed within this kind of system. A similar mixture of Maxwell-type and acoustic-type subsystems has recently been also forwarded by Buchman et al. in the context of a reformulation of the Einstein field equations of general relativity in terms of tetrads. This motivates our interest in this class of PDE, since the system is by itself very interesting from a mathematical point of view and can therefore serve as useful prototype system for the development of new structure-preserving numerical methods. Up to now, to the best of our knowledge, there exists neither a rigorous variational derivation of this class of hyperbolic PDE systems, nor do exactly energy-conserving and asymptotic-preserving schemes exist for them. The objectives of this paper are to derive the Maxwell-GLM system from an underlying variational principle, show its consistency with Hamiltonian mechanics and special relativity, extend it to the general nonlinear case and to develop new exactly energy-conserving and asymptotic-preserving finite volume schemes for its discretization.</description>

      <title>On the optimal choice of the illumination function in photoacoustic tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the inverse problem of photoacoustic tomography (more precisely, the acoustic subproblem) as the identification of a space-dependent source parameter. The model consists of a wave equation involving a time-fractional damping term to account for power law frequency dependence of the attenuation, as relevant in ultrasonics. We solve the inverse problem in a Bayesian framework using a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate, and for this purpose derive an explicit expression for the adjoint operator. On top of this, we consider optimization of the choice of the laser excitation function, which is the time-dependent part of the source in this model, to enhance the reconstruction result. The method employs the $A$-optimality criterion for Bayesian optimal experimental design with Gaussian prior and Gaussian noise. To efficiently approximate the cost functional, we introduce an approximation scheme based on projection onto finite-dimensional subspaces. Finally, we present numerical results that illustrate the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kaczmarz method is a way to iteratively solve a linear system of equations $Ax = b$. One interprets the solution $x$ as the point where hyperplanes intersect and then iteratively projects an approximate solution onto these hyperplanes to get better and better approximations. We note a somewhat related idea: one could take two random hyperplanes and project one into the orthogonal complement of the other. This leads to a sequence of linear systems $A^{(k)} x = b^{(k)}$ which is fast to compute, preserves the original solution and whose small singular values grow like $\sigma_{\ell}(A^{(k)}) \sim \exp(k/n^2) \cdot \sigma_{\ell}(A)$.</description>

      <title>A dual-pairing summation-by-parts finite difference framework for nonlinear conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust and stable high order numerical methods for solving partial differential equations are attractive because they are efficient on modern and next generation hardware architectures. However, the design of provably stable numerical methods for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws pose a significant challenge. We present the dual-pairing (DP) and upwind summation-by-parts (SBP) finite difference (FD) framework for accurate and robust numerical approximations of nonlinear conservation laws. The framework has an inbuilt "limiter" whose goal is to detect and effectively resolve regions where the solution is poorly resolved and/or discontinuities are found. The DP SBP FD operators are a dual-pair of backward and forward FD stencils, which together preserve the SBP property. In addition, the DP SBP FD operators are designed to be upwind, that is they come with some innate dissipation everywhere, as opposed to traditional SBP and collocated discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods which can only induce dissipation through numerical fluxes acting at element interfaces. We combine the DP SBP operators together with skew-symmetric and upwind flux splitting of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. Our semi-discrete approximation is provably entropy-stable for arbitrary nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. The framework is high order accurate, provably entropy-stable, convergent, and avoids several pitfalls of current state-of-the-art high order methods. We give specific examples using the in-viscid Burger's equation, nonlinear shallow water equations and compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics. Numerical experiments are presented to verify accuracy and demonstrate the robustness of our numerical framework.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of time-splitting projection method for nonlinear quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes and analyzes an efficient numerical method for solving the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with quasiperiodic potential, where the projection method is applied in space to account for the quasiperiodic structure and the Strang splitting method is used in time.While the transfer between spaces of low-dimensional quasiperiodic and high-dimensional periodic functions and its coupling with the nonlinearity of the operator splitting scheme make the analysis more challenging. Meanwhile, compared to conventional numerical analysis of periodic Schr\"odinger systems, many of the tools and theories are not applicable to the quasiperiodic case. We address these issues to prove the spectral accuracy in space and the second-order accuracy in time. Numerical experiments are performed to substantiate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A stable multiplicative dynamical low-rank discretization for the linear Boltzmann-BGK equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical method of dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA) has recently been applied to various kinetic equations showing a significant reduction of the computational effort. In this paper, we apply this concept to the linear Boltzmann-Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (Boltzmann-BGK) equation which due its high dimensionality is challenging to solve. Inspired by the special structure of the non-linear Boltzmann-BGK problem, we consider a multiplicative splitting of the distribution function. We propose a rank-adaptive DLRA scheme making use of the basis update &amp; Galerkin integrator and combine it with an additional basis augmentation to ensure numerical stability, for which an analytical proof is given and a classical hyperbolic Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition is derived. This allows for a further acceleration of computational times and a better understanding of the underlying problem in finding a suitable discretization of the system. Numerical results of a series of different test examples confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the numerical solution of the full system.</description>

      <title>A priori error estimates for finite element discretization of semilinear elliptic equations with non-Lipschitz nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop numerical analysis for finite element discretization of semilinear elliptic equations with potentially non-Lipschitz nonlinearites. The nonlinearity is essecially assumed to be continuous and monotonically decreasing including the case of non-Lipschitz or even non-H\"older continuous nonlinearities. For a direct discretization (without any regularization) with linear finite elements we derive error estimates with respect to various norms and illustrate these results with a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of many numerical schemes for phase-field modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent breakthrough work \cite{xu2023lack}, a rigorous numerical analysis was conducted on the numerical solution of a scalar ODE containing a cubic polynomial derived from the Allen-Cahn equation. It was found that only the implicit Euler method converge to the correct steady state for any given initial value $u_0$ under the unique solvability and energy stability. But all the other commonly used second-order numerical schemes exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions and may converge to an incorrect equilibrium state as $t_n\to\infty$. This indicates that energy stability may not be decisive for the long-term qualitative correctness of numerical solutions. We found that using another fundamental property of the solution, namely monotonicity instead of energy stability, is sufficient to ensure that many common numerical schemes converge to the correct equilibrium state. This leads us to introduce the critical step size constant $h^*=h^*(u_0,\epsilon)$ that ensures the monotonicity and unique solvability of the numerical solutions, where the scaling parameter $\epsilon \in(0,1)$. We prove that the implicit Euler scheme $h^*=h^*(\epsilon)$, which is independent of $u_0$ and only depends on $\epsilon$. Hence regardless of the initial value taken, the simulation can be guaranteed to be correct when $h&lt;h^*$. But for various other numerical methods, no mater how small the step size $h$ is in advance, there will always be initial values that cause simulation errors. In fact, for these numerical methods, we prove that $\inf_{u_0\in \mathbb{R}}h^*(u_0,\epsilon)=0$. Various numerical experiments are used to confirm the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many paintings from the 19th century have exhibited signs of fading and discoloration, often linked to cadmium yellow, a pigment widely used by artists during that time. In this work, we develop a mathematical model of the cadmium sulfide photocatalytic reaction responsible for these damages. By employing non-local integral operators, we capture the interplay between chemical processes and environmental factors, offering a detailed representation of the degradation mechanisms. Furthermore, we present a second order positivity-preserving numerical method designed to accurately simulate the phenomenon and ensure reliable predictions across different scenarios, along with a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the model.</description>

      <title>A stable one-synchronization variant of reorthogonalized block classical Gram--Schmidt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The block classical Gram--Schmidt (BCGS) algorithm and its reorthogonalized variant are widely-used methods for computing the economic QR factorization of block columns $X$ due to their lower communication cost compared to other approaches such as modified Gram--Schmidt and Householder QR. To further reduce communication, i.e., synchronization, there has been a long ongoing search for a variant of reorthogonalized BCGS variant that achieves $O(u)$ loss of orthogonality while requiring only \emph{one} synchronization point per block column, where $u$ represents the unit roundoff. Utilizing Pythagorean inner products and delayed normalization techniques, we propose the first provably stable one-synchronization reorthogonalized BCGS variant, demonstrating that it has $O(u)$ loss of orthogonality under the condition $O(u) \kappa^2(X) \leq 1/2$, where $\kappa(\cdot)$ represents the condition number.
  By incorporating one additional synchronization point, we develop a two-synchronization reorthogonalized BCGS variant which maintains $O(u)$ loss of orthogonality under the improved condition $O(u) \kappa(X) \leq 1/2$. An adaptive strategy is then proposed to combine these two variants, ensuring $O(u)$ loss of orthogonality while using as few synchronization points as possible under the less restrictive condition $O(u) \kappa(X) \leq 1/2$. As an example of where this adaptive approach is beneficial, we show that using the adaptive orthogonalization variant, $s$-step GMRES achieves a backward error comparable to $s$-step GMRES with BCGSI+, also known as BCGS2, both theoretically and numerically, but requires fewer synchronization points.</description>

      <title>Slice sampling tensor completion for model order reduction of parametric dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper addresses the problem of finding a low-rank approximation of a multi-dimensional tensor, $\Phi $, using a subset of its entries. A distinctive aspect of the tensor completion problem explored here is that entries of the $d$-dimensional tensor $\Phi$ are reconstructed via $C$-dimensional slices, where $C &lt; d - 1$. This setup is motivated by, and applied to, the reduced-order modeling of parametric dynamical systems. In such applications, parametric solutions are often reconstructed from space-time slices through sparse sampling over the parameter domain. To address this non-standard completion problem, we introduce a novel low-rank tensor format called the hybrid tensor train. Completion in this format is then incorporated into a Galerkin reduced order model (ROM), specifically an interpolatory tensor-based ROM. We demonstrate the performance of both the completion method and the ROM on several examples of dynamical systems derived from finite element discretizations of parabolic partial differential equations with parameter-dependent coefficients or boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Re-anchoring Quantum Monte Carlo with Tensor-Train Sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for calculating the ground-state energy of quantum many-body systems by combining auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) with tensor-train sketching. In AFQMC, having a good trial wavefunction to guide the random walk is crucial for avoiding sign problems. Typically, this trial wavefunction is fixed throughout the simulation. Our proposed method iterates between determining a new trial wavefunction in the form of a tensor train, derived from the current walkers, and using this updated trial wavefunction to anchor the next phase of AFQMC. Numerical results demonstrate that our algorithm is highly accurate for large spin systems, achieving a relative error of \(10^{-5}\) in estimating ground-state energies. Additionally, the overlap between our estimated trial wavefunction and the ground-state wavefunction achieves a high-fidelity. We provide a convergence proof, highlighting how an effective trial wavefunction can reduce the variance in the AFQMC energy estimate.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the cellular determinants of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship of the heart via computational modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVr) is a key indicator of cardiac contractility. Despite its established importance, several studies suggested that the mechanical mode of contraction, such as isovolumetric or ejecting contractions, may affect the ESPVr, challenging the traditional notion of a single, consistent relationship. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether the observed effects of ejection on force generation are inherent to the ventricular chamber itself or are a fundamental property of the myocardial tissue, with the underlying mechanisms remaining poorly understood. We investigated these aspects by using a multiscale in silico model that allowed us to elucidate the links between subcellular mechanisms and organ-level function. Simulations of ejecting and isovolumetric beats with different preload and afterload resistance were performed by modulating calcium and cross-bridge kinetics. The results suggest that the ESPVr is not a fixed curve but depends on the mechanical history of the contraction, with potentially both positive and negative effects of ejection. Isolated tissue simulations suggest that these phenomena are intrinsic to the myocardial tissue, rather than properties of the ventricular chamber. Our results suggest that the ESPVr results from the balance of positive and negative effects of ejection, respectively related to a memory effect of the increased apparent calcium sensitivity at high sarcomere length, and to the inverse relationship between force and velocity. Numerical simulations allowed us to reconcile conflicting results in the literature and suggest translational implications for clinical conditions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, where altered calcium dynamics and cross-bridge kinetics may impact the ESPVr.</description>

      <title>RandNet-Parareal: a time-parallel PDE solver using Random Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel-in-time (PinT) techniques have been proposed to solve systems of time-dependent differential equations by parallelizing the temporal domain. Among them, Parareal computes the solution sequentially using an inaccurate (fast) solver, and then "corrects" it using an accurate (slow) integrator that runs in parallel across temporal subintervals. This work introduces RandNet-Parareal, a novel method to learn the discrepancy between the coarse and fine solutions using random neural networks (RandNets). RandNet-Parareal achieves speed gains up to x125 and x22 compared to the fine solver run serially and Parareal, respectively. Beyond theoretical guarantees of RandNets as universal approximators, these models are quick to train, allowing the PinT solution of partial differential equations on a spatial mesh of up to $10^5$ points with minimal overhead, dramatically increasing the scalability of existing PinT approaches. RandNet-Parareal's numerical performance is illustrated on systems of real-world significance, such as the viscous Burgers' equation, the Diffusion-Reaction equation, the two- and three-dimensional Brusselator, and the shallow water equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid inverse problems such as Acousto-Electric Tomography, Current Density Imaging or Magnetic Resonance Electric Impedance Tomography are concerned with reconstructing the electrical conductivity from interior measurements. For a two-dimensional object the measurements correspond to two different functions imposed as the Neumann boundary condition to an elliptic PDE. In limited view these functions are only non-zero on the part of the boundary that one can control. In this paper we address how to choose such boundary functions in limited view such that the reconstruction procedure is feasible. This is related to the corresponding Jacobian being non-zero. We supplement the theoretical results by numerical reconstructions following the approach of Acousto-Electric Tomography.</description>

      <title>SPIKANs: Separable Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in scientific computing. While PINNs typically use multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) as their underlying architecture, recent advancements have explored alternative neural network structures. One such innovation is the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), which has demonstrated benefits over traditional MLPs, including faster neural scaling and better interpretability. The application of KANs to physics-informed learning has led to the development of Physics-Informed KANs (PIKANs), enabling the use of KANs to solve PDEs. However, despite their advantages, KANs often suffer from slower training speeds, particularly in higher-dimensional problems where the number of collocation points grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the system. To address this challenge, we introduce Separable Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (SPIKANs). This novel architecture applies the principle of separation of variables to PIKANs, decomposing the problem such that each dimension is handled by an individual KAN. This approach drastically reduces the computational complexity of training without sacrificing accuracy, facilitating their application to higher-dimensional PDEs. Through a series of benchmark problems, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SPIKANs, showcasing their superior scalability and performance compared to PIKANs and highlighting their potential for solving complex, high-dimensional PDEs in scientific computing.</description>

Abstract: In this article we consider likelihood-based estimation of static parameters for a class of partially observed McKean-Vlasov (POMV) diffusion process with discrete-time observations over a fixed time interval. In particular, using the framework of [5] we develop a new randomized multilevel Monte Carlo method for estimating the parameters, based upon Markovian stochastic approximation methodology. New Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for the POMV model are introduced facilitating the application of [5]. We prove, under assumptions, that the expectation of our estimator is biased, but with expected small and controllable bias. Our approach is implemented on several examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the approximation of functions by 2-layer neural networks with a small number of hidden weights based on the squared loss and small datasets. Due to the highly non-convex energy landscape, gradient-based training often suffers from local minima. As a remedy, we initialize the hidden weights with samples from a learned proposal distribution, which we parameterize as a deep generative model. To train this model, we exploit the fact that with fixed hidden weights, the optimal output weights solve a linear equation. After learning the generative model, we refine the sampled weights with a gradient-based post-processing in the latent space. Here, we also include a regularization scheme to counteract potential noise. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Randomized Forward Mode Gradient for Spiking Neural Networks in Scientific Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) represent a promising approach in machine learning, combining the hierarchical learning capabilities of deep neural networks with the energy efficiency of spike-based computations. Traditional end-to-end training of SNNs is often based on back-propagation, where weight updates are derived from gradients computed through the chain rule. However, this method encounters challenges due to its limited biological plausibility and inefficiencies on neuromorphic hardware. In this study, we introduce an alternative training approach for SNNs. Instead of using back-propagation, we leverage weight perturbation methods within a forward-mode gradient framework. Specifically, we perturb the weight matrix with a small noise term and estimate gradients by observing the changes in the network output. Experimental results on regression tasks, including solving various PDEs, show that our approach achieves competitive accuracy, suggesting its suitability for neuromorphic systems and potential hardware compatibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a powerful and general method to provide arbitrarily accurate rigorous upper and lower bounds for Lyapunov exponents of stochastic flows. Our approach is based on computer-assisted tools, the adjoint method and established results on the ergodicity of diffusion processes. We do not require any structural assumptions on the stochastic system and work under mild hypoellipticity conditions outside of perturbative regimes. Therefore, our method allows for the treatment of systems that were so far inaccessible from existing mathematical tools. We demonstrate our method to exhibit the chaotic nature of three non-Hamiltonian systems. Finally, we show that our approach is robust to continuation methods to produce bounds on Lyapunov exponents for large parameter regions.</description>

Abstract: We study a deterministic particle scheme to solve a scalar balance equation with nonlocal interaction and nonlinear mobility used to model congested dynamics. The main novelty with respect to "Radici-Stra [SIAM J.Math.Anal 55.3 (2023)]" is the presence of a source term; this causes the solutions to no longer be probability measures, thus requiring a suitable adaptation of the numerical scheme and of the estimates leading to compactness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a mixed precision Jacobi algorithm for computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a dense matrix. After appropriate preconditioning, the proposed algorithm computes the SVD in a lower precision as an initial guess, and then performs one-sided Jacobi rotations in the working precision as iterative refinement. By carefully transforming a lower precision solution to a higher precision one, our algorithm achieves about 2 times speedup on the x86-64 architecture compared to the usual one-sided Jacobi SVD algorithm in LAPACK, without sacrificing the accuracy.</description>

      <title>Finite element approximation of time-dependent mean field games with nondifferentiable Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13174v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard formulation of the PDE system of Mean Field Games (MFG) requires the differentiability of the Hamiltonian. However in many cases, the structure of the underlying optimal problem leads to a convex but nondifferentiable Hamiltonian. For time-dependent MFG systems, we introduce a generalization of the problem as a Partial Differential Inclusion (PDI) by interpreting the derivative of the Hamiltonian in terms of the subdifferential set. In particular, we prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to the resulting MFG PDI system under standard assumptions in the literature. We propose a monotone stabilized finite element discretization of the problem, using conforming affine elements in space and an implicit Euler discretization in time with mass-lumping. We prove the strong convergence in $L^2(H^1)$ of the value function approximations, and strong convergence in $L^p(L^2)$ of the density function approximations, together with strong $L^2$-convergence of the value function approximations at the initial time.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-based Edge Multiscale Finite Element Methods for Singularly Perturbed Convection-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel efficient and robust Wavelet-based Edge Multiscale Finite Element Method (WEMsFEM) motivated by \cite{MR3980476,GL18} to solve the singularly perturbed convection-diffusion equations. The main idea is to first establish a local splitting of the solution over a local region by a local bubble part and local Harmonic extension part, and then derive a global splitting by means of Partition of Unity. This facilitates a representation of the solution as a summation of a global bubble part and a global Harmonic extension part, where the first part can be computed locally in parallel. To approximate the second part, we construct an edge multiscale ansatz space locally with hierarchical bases as the local boundary data that has a guaranteed approximation rate \noteLg{both inside and outside of the layers}. The key innovation of this proposed WEMsFEM lies in a provable convergence rate with little restriction on the mesh size. Its convergence rate with respect to the computational degree of freedom is rigorously analyzed, which is verified by extensive 2-d and 3-d numerical tests.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss adaptive approximations of an elliptic eigenvalue optimization problem in a phase-field setting by a conforming finite element method. An adaptive algorithm is proposed and implemented in several two dimensional numerical examples for illustration of efficiency and accuracy. Theoretical findings consist in the vanishing limit of a subsequence of estimators and the convergence of the relevant subsequence of adaptively-generated solutions to a solution to the continuous optimality system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing an unknown function $u$ from a finite set of measurements, under the assumption that $u$ is the trajectory of a transport-dominated problem with unknown input parameters. We propose an algorithm based on the Parameterized Background Data-Weak method (PBDW) where dynamical sensor placement is combined with approximation spaces that evolve in time. We prove that the method ensures an accurate reconstruction at all times and allows to incorporate relevant physical properties in the reconstructed solutions by suitably evolving the dynamical approximation space. As an application of this strategy we consider Hamiltonian systems modeling wave-type phenomena, where preservation of the geometric structure of the flow plays a crucial role in the accuracy and stability of the reconstructed trajectory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01112v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first establish the unique ergodicity of the stochastic theta method (STM) with $\theta \in [1/2, 1]$ for monotone SODEs, without growth restriction on the coefficients, driven by nondegenerate multiplicative noise. The main ingredient of the arguments lies in constructing new Lyapunov functions involving the coefficients, the stepsize, and $\theta$ and deriving a minorization condition for the STM. We then generalize the arguments to the Galerkin-based full discretizations for a class of monotone SPDEs driven by infinite-dimensional nondegenerate multiplicative trace-class noise. Applying these results to the stochastic Allen--Cahn equation indicates that its Galerkin-based full discretizations are uniquely ergodic for any interface thickness. Numerical experiments verify our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On enforcing non-negativity in polynomial approximations in high dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polynomial approximations of functions are widely used in scientific computing. In certain applications, it is often desired to require the polynomial approximation to be non-negative (resp. non-positive), or bounded within a given range, due to constraints posed by the underlying physical problems. Efficient numerical methods are thus needed to enforce such conditions. In this paper, we discuss effective numerical algorithms for polynomial approximation under non-negativity constraints. We first formulate the constrained optimization problem, its primal and dual forms, and then discuss efficient first-order convex optimization methods, with a particular focus on high dimensional problems. Numerical examples are provided, for up to $200$ dimensions, to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient solution of ill-posed integral equations through averaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16250v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses the error and cost aspects of ill-posed integral equations when given discrete noisy point evaluations on a fine grid. Standard solution methods usually employ discretization schemes that are directly induced by the measurement points. Thus, they may scale unfavorably with the number of evaluation points, which can result in computational inefficiency. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm that achieves the same level of accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs. Our approach involves an initial averaging procedure to sparsify the underlying grid. To keep the exposition simple, we focus only on one-dimensional ill-posed integral equations that have sufficient smoothness. However, the approach can be generalized to more complicated two- and three-dimensional problems with appropriate modifications.</description>

      <title>The geometric error is less than the pollution error when solving the high-frequency Helmholtz equation with high-order FEM on curved domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the $h$-version of the finite-element method, where accuracy is increased by decreasing the meshwidth $h$ while keeping the polynomial degree $p$ constant, applied to the Helmholtz equation. Although the question "how quickly must $h$ decrease as the wavenumber $k$ increases to maintain accuracy?" has been studied intensively since the 1990s, none of the existing rigorous wavenumber-explicit analyses take into account the approximation of the geometry. In this paper we prove that for nontrapping problems solved using straight elements the geometric error is order $kh$, which is then less than the pollution error $k(kh)^{2p}$ when $k$ is large; this fact is then illustrated in numerical experiments. More generally, we prove that, even for problems with strong trapping, using degree four (in 2-d) or degree five (in 3-d) polynomials and isoparametric elements ensures that the geometric error is smaller than the pollution error for most large wavenumbers.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an adaptive finite element method for computing the first eigenpair of the $p$-Laplacian problem. We prove that starting from a fine initial mesh our proposed adaptive algorithm produces a sequence of discrete first eigenvalues that converges to the first eigenvalue of the continuous problem and the distance between discrete eigenfunctions and the normalized eigenfunction set corresponding to the first eigenvalue in $W^{1,p}$-norm also tends to zero. Extensive numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Improving the accuracy of the Newmark method through backward error analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use backward error analysis for differential equations to obtain modified or distorted equations describing the behaviour of the Newmark scheme applied to the transient structural dynamics equation. Based on the newly derived distorted equations, we give expressions for the numerically or algorithmically distorted stiffness and damping matrices of a system simulated using the Newmark scheme. Using these results, we show how to construct compensation terms from the original parameters of the system, which improve the performance of Newmark simulations. The required compensation terms turn out to be slight modifications to the original system parameters (e.g. the damping or stiffness matrices), and can be applied without changing the time step or modifying the scheme itself. Two such compensations are given: one eliminates numerical damping, while the other achieves fourth-order accurate calculations using the traditionally second-order Newmark method. The performance of both compensation methods is evaluated numerically to demonstrate their validity, and they are compared to the uncompensated Newmark method, the generalized-$\alpha$ method and the 4th-order Runge--Kutta scheme.</description>

Abstract: Mixed methods for linear elasticity with strongly symmetric stresses of lowest order are studied in this paper. On each simplex, the stress space has piecewise linear components with respect to its Alfeld split (which connects the vertices to barycenter), generalizing the Johnson-Mercier two-dimensional element to higher dimensions. Further reductions in the stress space in the three-dimensional case (to 24 degrees of freedom per tetrahedron) are possible when the displacement space is reduced to local rigid displacements. Proofs of optimal error estimates of numerical solutions and improved error estimates via postprocessing and the duality argument are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In data assimilation, an ensemble provides a way to propagate the probability density of a system described by a nonlinear prediction model. Although a large ensemble size is required for statistical accuracy, the ensemble size is typically limited to a small number due to the computational cost of running the prediction model, which leads to a sampling error. Several methods, such as localization and inflation, exist to mitigate the sampling error, often requiring problem-dependent fine-tuning and design. This work introduces a nonintrusive sampling error mitigation method that modifies the ensemble to ensure a smooth turbulent spectrum. It turns out that the ensemble modification to satisfy the smooth spectrum leads to inhomogeneous localization and inflation, which apply spatially varying localization and inflation levels at different locations. The efficacy of the new idea is validated through a suite of stringent test regimes of the Lorenz 96 turbulent model.</description>

Abstract: We propose nodal auxiliary space preconditioners for facet and edge virtual elements of lowest order by deriving discrete regular decompositions on polytopal grids and generalizing the Hiptmair-Xu preconditioner to the virtual element framework. The preconditioner consists of solving a sequence of elliptic problems on the nodal virtual element space, combined with appropriate smoother steps. Under assumed regularity of the mesh, the preconditioned system is proven to have bounded spectral condition number independent of the mesh size and this is verified by numerical experiments on a sequence of polygonal meshes. Moreover, we observe numerically that the preconditioner is robust on meshes containing elements with high aspect ratios.</description>

Abstract: Solving parametric Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) for a broad range of parameters is a critical challenge in scientific computing. To this end, neural operators, which \textcolor{black}{predicts the PDE solution with variable PDE parameter inputs}, have been successfully used. However, the training of neural operators typically demands large training datasets, the acquisition of which can be prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, physics-informed training can offer a cost-effective strategy. However, current physics-informed neural operators face limitations, either in handling irregular domain shapes or in in generalizing to various discrete representations of PDE parameters. In this research, we introduce a novel physics-informed model architecture which can generalize to various discrete representations of PDE parameters and irregular domain shapes. Particularly, inspired by deep operator neural networks, our model involves a discretization-independent learning of parameter embedding repeatedly, and this parameter embedding is integrated with the response embeddings through multiple compositional layers, for more expressivity. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to design a local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method for the Benjamin-Ono equation. We analyze the stability and error estimates for the semi-discrete LDG scheme. We prove that the scheme is $L^2$-stable and it converges at a rate $\mathcal{O}(h^{k+1/2})$ for general nonlinear flux. Furthermore, we develop a fully discrete LDG scheme using the four-stage fourth order Runge-Kutta method and ensure the devised scheme is strongly stable in case of linear flux using two-step and three-step stability approach under an appropriate time step constraint. Numerical examples are provided to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study optimization problems of numerical differentiation and summation methods on classes of univariate functions. Sharp estimates (in order) of the optimal recovery error and information complexity are calculated for these classes. Algorithms are constructed based on the truncation method and Chebyshev polynomials to implement these estimates. Moreover, we establish under what conditions the summation problem is well-posed.</description>

      <title>MsFEM for advection-dominated problems in heterogeneous media: Stabilization via nonconforming variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the numerical approximation of advection-diffusion equations with highly oscillatory coefficients and possibly dominant advection terms by means of the Multiscale Finite Element Method. The latter method is a now classical, finite element type method that performs a Galerkin approximation on a problem-dependent basis set, itself pre-computed in an offline stage. The approach is implemented here using basis functions that locally resolve both the diffusion and the advection terms. Variants with additional bubble functions and possibly weak inter-element continuity are proposed. Some theoretical arguments and a comprehensive set of numerical experiments allow to investigate and compare the stability and the accuracy of the approaches. The best approach constructed is shown to be adequate for both the diffusion- and advection-dominated regimes, and does not rely on an auxiliary stabilization parameter that would have to be properly adjusted.</description>

      <title>Annealing-based approach to solving partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using an annealing-based approach involves solving generalized eigenvalue problems. Discretizing a PDE yields a system of linear equations (SLE). Solving an SLE can be formulated as a general eigenvalue problem, which can be transformed into an optimization problem with an objective function given by a generalized Rayleigh quotient. The proposed algorithm requires iterative computations. However, it enables efficient annealing-based computation of eigenvectors to arbitrary precision without increasing the number of variables. Investigations using simulated annealing demonstrate how the number of iterations scales with system size and annealing time. Computational performance depends on system size, annealing time, and problem characteristics.</description>

      <title>Monolithic convex limiting and implicit pseudo-time stepping for calculating steady-state solutions of the Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we use the monolithic convex limiting (MCL) methodology to enforce relevant inequality constraints in implicit finite element discretizations of the compressible Euler equations. In this context, preservation of invariant domains follows from positivity preservation for intermediate states of the density and internal energy. To avoid spurious oscillations, we additionally impose local maximum principles on intermediate states of the density, velocity components, and specific total energy. For the backward Euler time stepping, we show the invariant domain preserving (IDP) property of the fully discrete MCL scheme by constructing a fixed-point iteration that meets the requirements of a Krasnoselskii-type theorem. Our iterative solver for the nonlinear discrete problem employs a more efficient fixed-point iteration. The matrix of the associated linear system is a robust low-order Jacobian approximation that exploits the homogeneity property of the flux function. The limited antidiffusive terms are treated explicitly. We use positivity preservation as a stopping criterion for nonlinear iterations. The first iteration yields the solution of a linearized semi-implicit problem. This solution possesses the discrete conservation property but is generally not IDP. Further iterations are performed if any non-IDP states are detected. The existence of an IDP limit is guaranteed by our analysis. To facilitate convergence to steady-state solutions, we perform adaptive explicit underrelaxation at the end of each time step. The calculation of appropriate relaxation factors is based on an approximate minimization of nodal entropy residuals. The performance of proposed algorithms and alternative solution strategies is illustrated by the convergence history for standard two-dimensional test problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper considers grad-div stabilized equal-order finite elements (FE) methods for the linearized Navier-Stokes equations. A block triangular preconditioner for the resulting system of algebraic equations is proposed which is closely related to the Augmented Lagrangian (AL) preconditioner. A field-of-values analysis of a preconditioned Krylov subspace method shows convergence bounds that are independent of the mesh parameter variation. Numerical studies support the theory and demonstrate the robustness of the approach also with respect to the viscosity parameter variation, as is typical for AL preconditioners when applied to inf-sup stable FE pairs. The numerical experiments also address the accuracy of grad-div stabilized equal-order FE method for the steady state Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While much attention of neural network methods is devoted to high-dimensional PDE problems, in this work we consider methods designed to work for elliptic problems on domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R} ^d, $ $d=1,2,3$ in association with more standard finite elements. We suggest to connect finite elements and neural network approximations through training, i.e., using finite element spaces to compute the integrals appearing in the loss functionals. This approach, retains the simplicity of classical neural network methods for PDEs, uses well established finite element tools (and software) to compute the integrals involved and it gains in efficiency and accuracy. We demonstrate that the proposed methods are stable and furthermore, we establish that the resulting approximations converge to the solutions of the PDE. Numerical results indicating the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithms are presented.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gradient descent in continuous time for drift identification in multiscale diffusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the setting of multiscale overdamped Langevin stochastic differential equations, and study the problem of learning the drift function of the homogenized dynamics from continuous-time observations of the multiscale system. We decompose the drift term in a truncated series of basis functions, and employ the stochastic gradient descent in continuous time to infer the coefficients of the expansion. Due to the incompatibility between the multiscale data and the homogenized model, the estimator alone is not able to reconstruct the exact drift. We therefore propose to filter the original trajectory through appropriate kernels and include filtered data in the stochastic differential equation for the estimator, which indeed solves the misspecification issue. Several numerical experiments highlight the accuracy of our approach. Moreover, we show theoretically in a simplified framework the asymptotic unbiasedness of our estimator in the limit of infinite data and when the multiscale parameter describing the fastest scale vanishes.</description>

      <title>Symmetric similarity 3D coordinate transformation based on dual quaternion algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21217v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, we have seen that dual quaternion algorithms are used in 3D coordinate transformation problems due to their advantages. 3D coordinate transformation problem is one of the important problems in geodesy. This transformation problem is encountered in many application areas other than geodesy. Although there are many coordinate transformation methods (similarity, affine, projective, etc.), similarity transformation is used because of its simplicity. The asymmetric transformation is preferred to the symmetric coordinate transformation because of its ease of use. In terms of error theory, the symmetric transformation should be preferred. In this study, the topic of symmetric similarity 3D coordinate transformation based on the dual quaternion algorithm is discussed, and the bottlenecks encountered in solving the problem and the solution method are discussed. A new iterative algorithm based on the dual quaternion is presented. The solution is implemented in two different models: with constraint equations and without constraint equations. The advantages and disadvantages of the two models compared to each other are also evaluated. Not only the transformation parameters but also the errors of the transformation parameters are determined. The detailed derivation of the formulas for estimating the symmetric similarity of 3D transformation parameters is presented step by step. Since symmetric transformation is the general form of asymmetric transformation, we can also obtain asymmetric transformation results with a simple modification of the model we developed for symmetric transformation. The proposed algorithm is capable of performing both 2D and 3D symmetric and asymmetric similarity transformations. For the 2D transformation, it is sufficient to replace the z and Z coordinates in both systems with zero.</description>

      <title>GoRINNs: Godunov-Riemann Informed Neural Networks for Learning Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present GoRINNs: numerical analysis-informed (shallow) neural networks for the solution of inverse problems of non-linear systems of conservation laws. GoRINNs is a hybrid/blended machine learning scheme based on high-resolution Godunov schemes for the solution of the Riemann problem in hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). In contrast to other existing machine learning methods that learn the numerical fluxes or just parameters of conservative Finite Volume methods, relying on deep neural networks (that may lead to poor approximations due to the computational complexity involved in their training), GoRINNs learn the closures of the conservation laws per se based on "intelligently" numerical-assisted shallow neural networks. Due to their structure, in particular, GoRINNs provide explainable, conservative schemes, that solve the inverse problem for hyperbolic PDEs, on the basis of approximate Riemann solvers that satisfy the Rankine-Hugoniot condition. The performance of GoRINNs is assessed via four benchmark problems, namely the Burgers', the Shallow Water, the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards and the Payne-Whitham traffic flow models. The solution profiles of these PDEs exhibit shock waves, rarefactions and/or contact discontinuities at finite times. We demonstrate that GoRINNs provide a very high accuracy both in the smooth and discontinuous regions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to multi-modal optimization by enhancing the recently developed kinetic-based optimization (KBO) method with genetic dynamics (GKBO). The proposed method targets objective functions with multiple global minima, addressing a critical need in fields like engineering design, machine learning, and bioinformatics. By incorpo rating leader-follower dynamics and localized interactions, the algorithm efficiently navigates high-dimensional search spaces to detect multiple optimal solutions. After providing a binary description, a mean-field approximation is derived, and different numerical experiments are conducted to validate the results.</description>

      <title>Bisparse Blind Deconvolution through Hierarchical Sparse Recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hierarchical sparsity framework, and in particular the HiHTP algorithm, has been successfully applied to many relevant communication engineering problems recently, particularly when the signal space is hierarchically structured. In this paper, the applicability of the HiHTP algorithm for solving the bi-sparse blind deconvolution problem is studied. The bi-sparse blind deconvolution setting here consists of recovering $h$ and $b$ from the knowledge of $h*(Qb)$, where $Q$ is some linear operator, and both $b$ and $h$ are both assumed to be sparse. The approach rests upon lifting the problem to a linear one, and then applying HiHTP, through the \emph{hierarchical sparsity framework}. %In particular, the efficient HiHTP algorithm is proposed for performing the recovery.
  Then, for a Gaussian draw of the random matrix $Q$, it is theoretically shown that an $s$-sparse $h \in \mathbb{K}^\mu$ and $\sigma$-sparse $b \in \mathbb{K}^n$ with high probability can be recovered when $\mu \succcurlyeq s\log(s)^2\log(\mu)\log(\mu n) + s\sigma \log(n)$.</description>

Abstract: Interpolatory necessary optimality conditions for $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal reduced-order modeling of non-parametric linear time-invariant (LTI) systems are known and well-investigated. In this work, using the general framework of $\mathcal{L}_2$-optimal reduced-order modeling of parametric stationary problems, we derive interpolatory $\mathcal{H}_2 \otimes \mathcal{L}_2$-optimality conditions for parametric LTI systems with a general pole-residue form. We then specialize this result to recover known conditions for systems with parameter-independent poles and develop new conditions for a certain class of systems with parameter-dependent poles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning to optimize is an approach that leverages training data to accelerate the solution of optimization problems. Many approaches use unrolling to parametrize the update step and learn optimal parameters. Although L2O has shown empirical advantages over classical optimization algorithms, memory restrictions often greatly limit the unroll length and learned algorithms usually do not provide convergence guarantees. In contrast, we introduce a novel method employing a greedy strategy that learns iteration-specific parameters by minimizing the function value at the next iteration. This enables training over significantly more iterations while maintaining constant memory usage. We parameterize the update such that parameter learning corresponds to solving a convex optimization problem at each iteration. In particular, we explore preconditioned gradient descent with multiple parametrizations including a novel convolutional preconditioner. With our learned algorithm, convergence in the training set is proven even when the preconditioner is neither symmetric nor positive definite. Convergence on a class of unseen functions is also obtained, ensuring robust performance and generalization beyond the training data. We test our learned algorithms on two inverse problems, image deblurring and Computed Tomography, on which learned convolutional preconditioner demonstrates improved empirical performance over classical optimization algorithms such as Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient Method and the quasi-Newton method L-BFGS.</description>

Abstract: Engineering design problems often involve solving parametric Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) under variable PDE parameters and domain geometry. Recently, neural operators have shown promise in learning PDE operators and quickly predicting the PDE solutions. However, training these neural operators typically requires large datasets, the acquisition of which can be prohibitively expensive. To overcome this, physics-informed training offers an alternative way of building neural operators, eliminating the high computational costs associated with Finite Element generation of training data. Nevertheless, current physics-informed neural operators struggle with limitations, either in handling varying domain geometries or varying PDE parameters. In this research, we introduce a novel method, the Physics-Informed Geometry-Aware Neural Operator (PI-GANO), designed to simultaneously generalize across both PDE parameters and domain geometries. We adopt a geometry encoder to capture the domain geometry features, and design a novel pipeline to integrate this component within the existing DCON architecture. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

      <title>On the Limit of the Tridiagonal Model for $\beta$-Dyson Brownian Motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work, a description of the result of applying the Householder tridiagonalization algorithm to a G$\beta$E random matrix is provided by Edelman and Dumitriu. The resulting tridiagonal ensemble makes sense for all $\beta&gt;0$, and has spectrum given by the $\beta$-ensemble for all $\beta&gt;0$. Moreover, the tridiagonal model has useful stochastic operator limits which was introduced and analyzed in subsequent studies.
  In this work, we analogously study the result of applying the Householder tridiagonalization algorithm to a G$\beta$E process which has eigenvalues governed by $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion. We propose an explicit limit of the upper left $k \times k$ minor of the $n \times n$ tridiagonal process as $n \to \infty$ and $k$ remains fixed. We prove the result for $\beta=1$, and also provide numerical evidence for $\beta=1,2,4$. This leads us to conjecture the form of a dynamical $\beta$-stochastic Airy operator with smallest $k$ eigenvalues evolving according to the $n \to \infty$ limit of the largest, centered and re-scaled, $k$ eigenvalues of $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion.</description>
