      <title>FlockVote: LLM-Empowered Agent-Based Modeling for Simulating U.S. Presidential Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling complex human behavior, such as voter decisions in national elections, is a long-standing challenge for computational social science. Traditional agent-based models (ABMs) are limited by oversimplified rules, while large-scale statistical models often lack interpretability. We introduce FlockVote, a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to build a "computational laboratory" of LLM agents for political simulation. Each agent is instantiated with a high-fidelity demographic profile and dynamic contextual information (e.g. candidate policies), enabling it to perform nuanced, generative reasoning to simulate a voting decision. We deploy this framework as a testbed on the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, focusing on seven key swing states. Our simulation's macro-level results successfully replicate the real-world outcome, demonstrating the high fidelity of our "virtual society". The primary contribution is not only the prediction, but also the framework's utility as an interpretable research tool. FlockVote moves beyond black-box outputs, allowing researchers to probe agent-level rationale and analyze the stability and sensitivity of LLM-driven social simulations.</description>

      <title>Comparison between Idealized and Realized Accessibility Measures in GIScience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measures of access, defined as the ease with which people can reach opportunities or services, are often based on proximity. Proximity measures of access are often unrealistic or idealized, ignoring many of the real barriers to access including social and economic barriers. There is a need to develop GIS measures of access that incorporate all aspects of access, which we term realized access. Our goal is to develop a conceptual framework of realized accessibility in active transportation, and compare idealized and realized measures of access to bicycling. We apply the framework to measure realized accessibility in a case study focusing on bicycling access in Santa Barbara County, and compare idealized and realized measures of access for four cities in Santa Barbara County in California (Santa Maria, Lompoc, Santa Barbara, and Goleta). Differences in measures from idealized access to realized access are greatly increased in cities with lower median household income and a higher proportion of people identifying as Hispanic. Studies aiming to understand equity and access can benefit from more nuanced and realized access measures, as idealized access measures may overestimate accessibility in underserved communities. In GIScience, especially as new data on mobility become more widely available, nuanced measures of accessibility should be the standards in analysis.</description>

      <title>A few ideas to promote inclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Promoting diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) is both a legal and professional responsibility in French research institutions. This paper presents practical strategies to foster inclusive work environments within French research units. We summarize the regulatory context, key findings from the INSU-AA prospective on discrimination, and fundamental principles for promoting equity. We discuss approaches to mitigate implicit biases across all career stages, from early education to retirement, and outline strategies for equitable recruitment and career advancement. Concrete initiatives in one of our units (LESIA/LIRA) are described, including internal communications, exhibitions, and accessible pedagogical activities. The creation of a dedicated commission within the unit council ensures coordinated DEIA efforts, legitimized by institutional support and methodical planning. By sharing these experiences, we provide actionable guidance for research units seeking to advance DEIA in science.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effect of adaptive optimal control function in epidemic dynamics: predictions and strategy evolution based on SIR/V game theoretic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an adaptive optimal control problem for an SIR/V epidemic model with human behavioral effects.We develop a model where effective management of infectious diseases are monitored by the means of non pharmaceutical interventions.This study develops an adaptive optimal control function within an SIR/V framework embedding a non cooperative game theoretic mechanism to capture the dynamic interplay between individual vaccination behavior and population level transmission. We derive analytical expression for the optimal control trajectory under resource constrain and heterogeneous susceptibility and we validate our model using numerical simulations,calibrated with the real world epidemic parameters. We find that for the adaptive optimal policy for a generally known SIR/V model depending on the game theoretic epidemic state leads to substantial reduction in expenses compared to non adaptive policies. Moreover, our results demonstrate that, adaptive strategies significantly outperform the static policies by achieving lower peak infections and faster epidemic extinctions while evolutionary game dynamics identify critical behavioral thresholds that drive strategy evolution and inform timely policy adaptation</description>

      <title>Extending Integrated Assessment Model scenarios until 2150 using an emulation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whereas there is growing interest in exploring longer-term climate, including tipping elements, beyond 2100, most Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) generate emissions scenarios only till 2100. Here we propose a framework to extend scenarios until 2150 using an emulator of IAMs. Our framework offers a potential interim solution for developing very long-term scenarios, such as the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP), circumventing the challenges of fully simulating IAMs beyond 2100.</description>

      <title>PoliFi Tokens and the Trump Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptoassets launched by political figures, e.g., political finance (PoliFi) tokens, have recently attracted attention. Chief among them are the eponymous tokens backed by the 47th president and first lady of the United States, TRUMPandMELANIA. We empirically analyze both, and study their impact on the broad decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Via a comparative longitudinal study, we uncover a "Trump Effect": the behavior of these tokens correlates positively with presidential approval ratings, whereas the same tight coupling does not extend to other cryptoassets and administrations. We additionally quantify the ecosystemic impact, finding that the fervor surrounding the two assets was accompanied by capital flows towards associated platforms like the Solana blockchain, which also enjoyed record volumes and fee expenditure.</description>

      <title>Quantum, Diplomacy, and Geopolitics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies -- spanning communication, sensing, computing, and cryptography -- are rapidly emerging as critical paths of geopolitical competition and strategic defence innovation. Unlike traditional technological advances, quantum introduces novel capabilities that fundamentally disrupt established norms of security, intelligence, and diplomatic engagement. This strategic analysis explores the evolving quantum landscape through the dual lenses of diplomacy and geopolitics, with specific implications for defence leaders, policymakers, and industry stakeholders. The benefits and challenges of quantum technologies are examined from a diplomatic and geopolitical perspective to help leaders make informed strategic decisions. Leading powers now recognise quantum as a domain where technological leadership directly translates to geopolitical influence, compelling an intense race for dominance alongside new forms of multilateral diplomacy aimed at managing both risks and opportunities. Quantum technologies do not all have the same operational maturity, but technological progress is accelerating. Post-quantum cryptography demands immediate action -- every encrypted communication created today may be harvested and decrypted within the decade by adversaries equipped with quantum capabilities.</description>

      <title>On the Effect of Missing Transmission Chain Information in Agent-Based Models: Outcomes of Superspreading Events and Workplace Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) have emerged as distinguished tools for epidemic modeling due to their ability to capture detailed human contact patterns. ABMs can support decision-makers in times of outbreaks and epidemics substantially. However, as a result of missing correspondingly resolved data transmission events are often modeled based on simplified assumptions. In this article, we present a framework to assess the impact of these simplifications on epidemic prediction outcomes, considering superspreading and workplace transmission events. We couple the VADERE microsimulation model with the large-scale MEmilio-ABM and compare the outcomes of four outbreak events after 10 days of simulation in a synthetic city district generated from German census data. In a restaurant superspreading event, where up to four households share tables, we observe 17.2~\% more infections on day 10 after the outbreak. The difference increases to 46.0 % more infections when using the simplified initialization in a setting where only two households share tables. We observe similar outcomes (41.3 % vs. 9.3 % more infections) for two workplace settings with different mixing patterns between teams at work. In addition to the aggregated difference, we show differences in spatial dynamics and transmission trees obtained with complete or reduced outbreak information. We observe differences between simplified and fully detailed initializations that become more pronounced when the subnetworks in the outbreak setting are mixing less. In consequence and aside from classical calibration of models, the significant outcome differences should drive us to develop a more profound understanding of how and where simplified assumptions about transmission events are adequate.</description>

      <title>How Conflict Aversion Can Enable Authoritarianism: An Evolutionary Dynamics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use evolutionary game theory to examine how conflict-averse centrism can unintentionally facilitate authoritarian success in polarized political conflicts. Many such conflicts are asymmetric: authoritarian actors can employ norm-breaking or coercive tactics, while democratic resistance faces stronger constraints on what counts as normatively acceptable behavior. Yet formal models typically treat opposing sides symmetrically and rarely examine conflict-averse behavior. Drawing on empirical research on protest backlash, civility norms, and authoritarian resilience, we model these dynamics as a three-strategy evolutionary game in which resistance, authoritarianism, and conflict-averse centrism interact under replicator dynamics. This framework yields two distinct outcomes -- cyclic resurgence of authoritarian strength through a heteroclinic cycle and a stable centrist-authoritarian coalition that excludes resistance -- depending on how actors respond to confrontation. The analysis shows how payoff differences can reorganize long-run dynamics in asymmetric conflicts. Our contribution is to demonstrate how an established dynamical framework, combined with empirically grounded behavioral assumptions, clarifies the strategic conditions under which conflict aversion can diminish the effectiveness of democratic resistance.</description>

      <title>Demographic Dependence of Vaccine Adoption under Opinion Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by contagion models of social belief formation, we develop an epistemically-informed modeling framework, SIS-Vo, in which vaccine-related information propagates on a signed opinion network. Our model allows for heterogeneous treatment effects of policy messages across subpopulations through demographic-specific responses. We derive fixed-point characterizations of the healthy (disease-free) and endemic equilibria of this model, and obtain conditions for local stability of the healthy state in terms of the contact network and opinion-dependent vaccination capacities. Using numerical simulations, we illustrate how suitably targeted policy interventions, acting through opinion dynamics, can stabilize the epidemic process by moving the system towards the healthy regime. The SIS-Vo framework thus provides a natural basis for control-theoretic analysis of vaccination policies that remain robust even when misinformation targets specific subgroups.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Link Prediction Methods Integrating Network Topological Features and Embedding Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link prediction, as a frontier task in complex network topology analysis, aims to infer the existence of latent links between node pairs based on observed nodes and structural information. We propose an ensemble link prediction model that integrates network topology features and embedding representations (TELP), designed to overcome the limitations of conventional heuristic methods in capturing node attributes and deep structural patterns, as well as the weak interpretability and limited generalization of learning-based approaches. TELP leverages a multi-stage architecture. Local connectivity patterns are captured through network-type-aware selection of homogeneous and heterogeneous topology features, which also promotes interpretability. To incorporate global structure, Node2Vec embeddings are generated and fused with these topology features, resulting in comprehensive multi-dimensional representations. Building on this enriched feature space, an ensemble of logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models is deployed to maximize predictive performance and robustness. Experiments on nine classical benchmark networks demonstrate that TELP achieves superior AUC and AP performance compared with traditional heuristic approaches and mainstream graph neural network models, while ablation studies further confirm that feature fusion and ensemble strategies are essential for optimal performance.</description>

      <title>Social welfare optimisation in well-mixed and structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on promoting cooperation among autonomous, self-regarding agents has often focused on the bi-objective optimisation problem: minimising the total incentive cost while maximising the frequency of cooperation. However, the optimal value of social welfare under such constraints remains largely unexplored. In this work, we hypothesise that achieving maximal social welfare is not guaranteed at the minimal incentive cost required to drive agents to a desired cooperative state. To address this gap, we adopt to a single-objective approach focused on maximising social welfare, building upon foundational evolutionary game theory models that examined cost efficiency in finite populations, in both well-mixed and structured population settings. Our analytical model and agent-based simulations show how different interference strategies, including rewarding local versus global behavioural patterns, affect social welfare and dynamics of cooperation. Our results reveal a significant gap in the per-individual incentive cost between optimising for pure cost efficiency or cooperation frequency and optimising for maximal social welfare. Overall, our findings indicate that incentive design, policy, and benchmarking in multi-agent systems and human societies should prioritise welfare-centric objectives over proxy targets of cost or cooperation frequency.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of Weak Signals in Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study proposes a methodology that combines the 'Duffing oscillator system' and the 'Kuramoto oscillator network' to explore the synchronization of weak signals in dynamic systems. The first step of the procedure is to detect weak periodic or quasi-periodic signals in noisy data collected from the quantifiable processes of any dynamical system using the Duffing oscillator system. The second step is to investigate how the interaction of these weak signals can be synchronized using the Kuramoto oscillator network model. This methodology was applied to seismic signals. The present study has shown that this methodology has great potential for investigating the weak signal synchronisation present within dynamic systems, as evidenced by the analysis of seismic data.</description>

      <title>Wealth Thermalization Hypothesis and Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17720v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1955 Fermi, Pasta, Ulam and Tsingou performed first numerical studies with the aim to obtain the thermalization in a chain of nonlinear oscillators from dynamical equations of motion. This model happend to have several specific features and the dynamical thermalization was established only later in other studies. In this work we study more generic models based on Random Matrix Theory and social networks with a nonlinear perturbation leading to dynamical thermalization above a certain chaos border. These systems have two integrals of motion being total energy and norm so that the theoretical Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution depends on temperature and chemical potential. We introduce the wealth thermalization hypothesis according to which the society wealth is associated with energy in the Rayleigh-Jeans distribution. At relatively small values of total wealth or energy there is a formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, well studied in physical systems such as multimode optical fibers. This condensation leads to a huge fraction of poor households at low wealth and a small oligarchic fraction which monopolizes a dominant fraction of total wealth thus generating a strong inequality in human society. We show that this thermalization gives a good description of real data of Lorenz curves of US, UK, the whole world and capitalization of companies at Stock Exchange of New York SE (NYSE), London and Hong Kong. It is also shown that above a chaos border the dynamical Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization takes place also in social networks with the Lorenz curves being similar to those of wealth distribution in world countries. Possible actions for inequality reduction are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Potential of Scientific Literature: A Network-Based Approach to Identifying Paradigm-Shifting Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces the Disruption Index as a superior citation-based metric. This index quantitatively assesses the degree to which a publication redirects subsequent scholarly attention away from its preceding literature, thus measuring its novelty and disruptive impact. We tested the D metric's efficacy using a rigorous dataset comprising seminal publications by Nobel Prize winners across Physics, Chemistry, and Physiology or Medicine, benchmarked against control papers with comparable citation counts but non-transformative influence. Our analysis conclusively demonstrates that the D metric effectively distinguishes these prize-worthy, field-redefining works from highly cited but merely incremental research. Furthermore, we explore two contextual variables associated with high disruptive potential: (i) the scale of collaboration (author team size) and (ii) the linguistic structure of the article's title and summary text. The results reveal a strong positive correlation between larger collaborative teams and elevated average D scores, suggesting that extensive collaboration may be a facilitator for generating paradigm shifts. Additionally, publications with high D values tend to feature more expansive titles and greater density of specialized, technical jargon in their abstracts. These findings validate the D metric as a reliable and scalable instrument for both historical and predictive identification of transformative research. They also furnish empirical evidence concerning the team structures and communication patterns that optimize for the production of groundbreaking scientific knowledge.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic description of world GDP distribution over countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the concept of Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization of classical fields for a description of the world Gross Domestic Product (GDP) distribution over countries. The thermalization appears due to a variety of interactions between countries with conservation of two integrals being total GDP and probability (norm). In such a case there is an emergence of Rayleigh-Jeans condensation at states with low GDP. This phenomenon has been studied theoretically and experimentally in multimode optical fibers and we argue that it is at the origin of emergence of poverty and oligarchic phases for GDP of countries. A similar phenomenon has been discussed recently in the framework of the Wealth Thermalization Hypothesis to explain the high inequality of wealth distribution in human society and companies at Stock Exchange markets. We show that the Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization well describes the GDP distribution during the last 50 years.</description>

      <title>Prediction and inference in complex networks: a brief review and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inference and prediction are fundamental to the study of complex systems, where network data are often incomplete, inaccurate or obtained indirectly. In this paper, we review recent advances in network sampling and comparison, as well as in link prediction and network reconstruction from time series. We summarise key methodological developments and emerging approaches that integrate statistical and machine learning perspectives. We also outline promising research directions for enhancing the inference and prediction of complex networked systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling diffusion in networks with communities: a multitype branching process approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of diffusion in complex networks are widely studied to understand how entities, such as information, diseases, or behaviors, spread in an interconnected environment. Complex networks often present community structure, and tools to analyze diffusion processes on networks with communities are needed. In this paper, we develop theoretical tools using multi-type branching processes to model and analyze diffusion processes, following a simple contagion mechanism, across a broad class of networks with community structure. We show how, by using limited information about the network -- the degree distribution within and between communities -- we can calculate standard statistical characteristics of propagation dynamics, such as the extinction probability, hazard function, and cascade size distribution. These properties can be estimated not only for the entire network but also for each community separately.
  Furthermore, we estimate the probability of spread crossing from one community to another where it is not currently spreading. We demonstrate the accuracy of our framework by applying it to two specific examples: the Stochastic Block Model and a log-normal network with community structure. We show how the initial seeding location affects the observed cascade size distribution on a heavy-tailed network and that our framework accurately captures this effect.</description>

      <title>The Neuroticism Paradox: How Emotional Instability Fuels Collective Feelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective emotions shape organizations, communities, and societies, yet the traits that determine who drives them remain unknown. Conventional wisdom holds that stable, extraverted individuals act as emotional leaders, calming and coordinating the feelings of others. Here we challenge this view by analyzing a 30.5-month longitudinal dataset of daily emotions from 38 co-located professionals (733,534 records). Using Granger-causality network reconstruction, we find that emotionally unstable individuals -- those high in neuroticism (r = 0.478, p = 0.002) and low in conscientiousness (r = -0.512, p = 0.001) -- are the true "emotional super-spreaders," while extraversion shows no effect (r = 0.238, p = 0.150). This "Neuroticism Paradox" reveals that emotional volatility, not stability, drives contagion. Emotions propagate with a reproduction rate (R_0 = 15.58) comparable to measles, yet the system avoids collapse through high clustering (C = 0.705) that creates "emotional quarantine zones." Emotional variance increased 22.9% over time, contradicting homeostasis theories and revealing entropy-driven dynamics. We propose an Affective Epidemiology framework showing that collective emotions are governed by network position and volatility rather than personality stability -- transforming how we understand emotional leadership in human systems.</description>

      <title>Correlation-Weighted Communicability Curvature as a Structural Driver of Dengue Spread: A Bayesian Spatial Analysis of Recife (2015-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether the structural connectivity of urban road networks helps explain dengue incidence in Recife, Brazil (2015--2024). For each neighborhood, we compute the average \emph{communicability curvature}, a graph-theoretic measure capturing the ability of a locality to influence others through multiple network paths. We integrate this metric into Negative Binomial models, fixed-effects regressions, SAR/SAC spatial models, and a hierarchical INLA/BYM2 specification. Across all frameworks, curvature is the strongest and most stable predictor of dengue risk. In the BYM2 model, the structured spatial component collapses ($\phi \approx 0$), indicating that functional network connectivity explains nearly all spatial dependence typically attributed to adjacency-based CAR terms. The results show that dengue spread in Recife is driven less by geographic contiguity and more by network-mediated structural flows.</description>

      <title>A Behaviour and Disease Model of Testing and Isolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been interest in the interactions between infectious disease dynamics and behaviour for most of the history of mathematical epidemiology. This has included consideration of which mathematical models best capture each phenomenon, as well as their interaction, but typically in a manner that is agnostic to the exact behaviour in question. Here, we investigate interacting behaviour and disease dynamics specifically related to decisions around testing and isolation. To carry out our investigation we extend an existing "behaviour and disease" (BaD) model by incorporating the dynamics of symptomatic testing and isolation, including the influence of positive tests on perception of infection risk. We provide a dynamical systems analysis of the ordinary differential equations that define this model, providing theoretical results on its behaviour early in a new outbreak (particularly its basic reproduction number) and endemicity of the system (its steady states and associated stability criteria). We then supplement these findings with a numerical analysis to inform how temporal and cumulative outbreak metrics depend on the model parameter values for epidemic and endemic regimes. We observe novel model outputs such as epidemics that have more observed cases detected through increased testing, but are less objectively severe in terms of total number of infections.</description>

      <title>Projections of Earth's Technosphere: Strategies for Observing Technosignatures on Terrestrial Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for technosignatures--remotely detectable evidence of extraterrestrial technology--draws upon examples from the recent history of Earth as well as projections of Earth's technosphere. Facilities like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will significantly advance the feasibility of characterizing the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, while other future mission concepts could extend this search to mid-infrared wavelengths. We draw upon a recently developed set of 10 self-consistent scenarios for future Earth technospheres as analogs for extraterrestrial technospheres, which we use to outline a stepwise technosignature search strategy, beginning with HWO and followed by other missions. We find that HWO could reveal elevated abundances of a CO$_2$ + NO$_2$ pair on planets with combustion and other large-scale industry, which could be observable in up to eight of the 10 scenarios. Follow-up radio observations could reveal narrowband directed transmissions, as occur in two of the scenarios. Further study involving direct detections at mid-infrared wavelengths with the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets could reveal spectral features from industry, such as the combinations of CO$_2$ + CFC-11/12 in four scenarios and CO$_2$ + CFC-11/12 + CF$_4$ in one scenario; two of these also include the N$_2$O + CH$_4$ + NH$_3$ triple from large-scale agriculture. Other mission concepts, such as a solar-gravitational-lens mission, could reveal large-scale surface features in two scenarios that would otherwise show no detectable technosignatures, while an interplanetary flyby or probe mission would be the most conclusive way to reveal the presence of technology on terrestrial exoplanets.</description>
