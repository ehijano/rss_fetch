      <title>QuCLEAR: Clifford Extraction and Absorption for Significant Reduction in Quantum Circuit Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing carries significant potential for addressing practical problems. However, currently available quantum devices suffer from noisy quantum gates, which degrade the fidelity of executed quantum circuits. Therefore, quantum circuit optimization is crucial for obtaining useful results. In this paper, we present QuCLEAR, a compilation framework designed to optimize quantum circuits. QuCLEAR significantly reduces both the two-qubit gate count and the circuit depth through two novel optimization steps. First, we introduce the concept of Clifford Extraction, which extracts Clifford subcircuits to the end of the circuit while optimizing the gates. Second, since Clifford circuits are classically simulatable, we propose Clifford Absorption, which efficiently processes the extracted Clifford subcircuits classically. We demonstrate our framework on quantum simulation circuits, which have wide-ranging applications in quantum chemistry simulation, many-body physics, and combinatorial optimization problems. Near-term algorithms such as VQE and QAOA also fall within this category. Experimental results across various benchmarks show that QuCLEAR achieves up to a $77.7\%$ reduction in CNOT gate count and up to an $84.1\%$ reduction in entangling depth compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Generative Blockchain: Transforming Blockchain from Transaction Recording to Transaction Generation through Proof-of-Merit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new paradigm: generative blockchain, which aims to transform conventional blockchain technology by combining transaction generation and recording, rather than focusing solely on transaction recording. Central to our design is a novel consensus mechanism, Proof-of-Merit (PoM), specifically crafted for environments where businesses must solve complex problems before transactions can be recorded. PoM integrates the generation and recording of transactions within a unified blockchain system, fundamentally differing from prevailing consensus mechanisms that primarily record existing transactions. We demonstrate PoM on a ride service on-demand platform, where the task of solving complex transaction-generating problems is delegated to a pool of independent problem solvers. These solvers generate transactions, and their solutions are selected based on merit. The winning solvers then register these transactions onto the blockchain and are rewarded accordingly. We introduce a Decentralized Control Parameter (DCP) to balance two key performance metrics: efficiency and equity. The applicability of our generative blockchain is illustrated through a ridesharing context, where matchers (solvers) are tasked with matching riders to drivers. We demonstrate PoM's performance and nuanced properties using agent-based simulation, exploring how to find the optimal DCP value to achieve a desirable balance of efficiency and equity in a generative blockchain.</description>

      <title>ReCon: Reconfiguring Analog Rydberg Atom Quantum Computers for Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has shown theoretical promise of speedup in several machine learning tasks, including generative tasks using generative adversarial networks (GANs). While quantum computers have been implemented with different types of technologies, recently, analog Rydberg atom quantum computers have been demonstrated to have desirable properties such as reconfigurable qubit (quantum bit) positions and multi-qubit operations. To leverage the properties of this technology, we propose ReCon, the first work to implement quantum GANs on analog Rydberg atom quantum computers. Our evaluation using simulations and real-computer executions shows 33% better quality (measured using Frechet Inception Distance (FID)) in generated images than the state-of-the-art technique implemented on superconducting-qubit technology.</description>

      <title>An Open, Cross-Platform, Web-Based Metaverse Using WebXR and A-Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The metaverse has received much attention in the literature and industry in the last few years, but the lack of an open and cross-platform architecture has led to many distinct metaverses that cannot communicate with each other. This work proposes a WebXR-based cross-platform architecture for developing spatial web apps using the A-Frame and Networked-Aframe frameworks with a view to an open and interoperable metaverse, accessible from both the web and extended reality devices. A prototype was implemented and evaluated, supporting the capability of the technology stack to enable immersive experiences across different platforms and devices. Positive feedback on ease of use of the immersive environment further corroborates the proposed approach, underscoring its effectiveness in facilitating engaging and interactive virtual spaces. By adhering to principles of interoperability and inclusivity, it lives up to Tim Berners-Lee's vision of the World Wide Web as an open platform that transcends geographical and technical boundaries.</description>

      <title>Multi-Faceted Evaluation of Modeling Languages for Augmented Reality Applications -- The Case of ARWFML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of modeling languages for augmented reality applications poses particular challenges due to the three-dimensional environment they target. The previously introduced Augmented Reality Workflow Modeling Language (ARWFML) enables the model-based creation of augmented reality scenarios without programming knowledge. Building upon the first design cycle of the language's specification, this paper presents two further design iterations for refining the language based on multi-faceted evaluations. These include a comparative evaluation of implementation options and workflow capabilities, the introduction of a 3D notation, and the development of a new 3D modeling environment. On this basis, a comprehensibility study of the language was conducted. Thereby, we show how modeling languages for augmented reality can be evolved towards a maturity level suitable for empirical evaluations.</description>

      <title>Brain Inspired Probabilistic Occupancy Grid Mapping with Hyperdimensional Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time robotic systems require advanced perception, computation, and action capability. However, the main bottleneck in current autonomous systems is the trade-off between computational capability, energy efficiency and model determinism. World modeling, a key objective of many robotic systems, commonly uses occupancy grid mapping (OGM) as the first step towards building an end-to-end robotic system with perception, planning, autonomous maneuvering, and decision making capabilities. OGM divides the environment into discrete cells and assigns probability values to attributes such as occupancy and traversability. Existing methods fall into two categories: traditional methods and neural methods. Traditional methods rely on dense statistical calculations, while neural methods employ deep learning for probabilistic information processing. Recent works formulate a deterministic theory of neural computation at the intersection of cognitive science and vector symbolic architectures. In this study, we propose a Fourier-based hyperdimensional OGM system, VSA-OGM, combined with a novel application of Shannon entropy that retains the interpretability and stability of traditional methods along with the improved computational efficiency of neural methods. Our approach, validated across multiple datasets, achieves similar accuracy to covariant traditional methods while approximately reducing latency by 200x and memory by 1000x. Compared to invariant traditional methods, we see similar accuracy values while reducing latency by 3.7x. Moreover, we achieve 1.5x latency reductions compared to neural methods while eliminating the need for domain-specific model training.</description>
