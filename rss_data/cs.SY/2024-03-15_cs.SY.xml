      <title>Time-Quantitatively Nonblocking Supervisory Control of Timed Discrete-Event Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently we proposed an automaton property of quantitative nonblockingness in supervisory control of discrete-event systems, which quantifies the standard nonblocking property by capturing the practical requirement that all tasks be completed within a bounded number of steps. However, in practice tasks may be further required to be completed in specific time; this requirement cannot be fulfilled by the quantitatively nonblocking supervisor. To meet this new requirement, in this paper we introduce the concept of time-quantitative nonblockingness, which extends the concept of quantitative nonblockingness from untimed discrete-event systems (DES) to timed DES. This property requires that each task must be completed within a bounded time. Accordingly, we formulate a new time-quantitatively nonblocking supervisory control problem of TDES, and characterize its solvability in terms of a new concept of time-quantitative language completability. It is proved that there exists a unique supremal time-quantitatively completable sublanguage of a given language, and we develop an automaton-based algorithm to compute the supremal sublanguage. Finally, we present an approach to compute a maximally permissive supervisory control solution to the new time-quantitative nonblocking supervisory control problem.</description>

      <title>Rollover Prevention for Mobile Robots with Control Barrier Functions: Differentiator-Based Adaptation and Projection-to-State Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops rollover prevention guarantees for mobile robots using control barrier function (CBF) theory, and demonstrates these formal results experimentally. To this end, we consider a safety measure based on the zero moment point to provide conditions on the control input through the lens of CBFs. However, these conditions depend on time-varying and noisy parameters. To address this, we present a differentiator-based safety-critical controller that estimates these parameters and pairs Input-to-State Stable (ISS) differentiator dynamics with CBFs to achieve rigorous guarantees of safety. Additionally, to ensure safety in the presence of disturbance, we utilize a time-varying extension of Projection-to-State Safety (PSSf). The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments on a tracked robot with a rollover potential on steep slopes.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the True Power of Age-of-Information: Service Aggregation in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) rely heavily upon time-sensitive information update services to ensure the safety of people and assets, and satisfactory entertainment applications. Therefore, the freshness of information is a crucial performance metric for CAV services. However, information from roadside sensors and nearby vehicles can get delayed in transmission due to the high mobility of vehicles. Our research shows that a CAV's relative distance and speed play an essential role in determining the Age-of-Information (AoI). With an increase in AoI, incremental service aggregation issues are observed with out-of-sequence information updates, which hampers the performance of low-latency applications in CAVs. In this paper, we propose a novel AoI-based service aggregation method for CAVs, which can process the information updates according to their update cycles. First, the AoI for sensors and vehicles is modeled, and a predictive AoI system is designed. Then, to reduce the overall service aggregation time and computational load, intervals are used for periodic AoI prediction, and information sources are clustered based on the AoI value. Finally, the system aggregates services for CAV applications using the predicted AoI. We evaluate the system performance based on data sequencing success rate (DSSR) and overall system latency. Lastly, we compare the performance of our proposed system with three other state-of-the-art methods. The evaluation and comparison results show that our proposed predictive AoI-based service aggregation system maintains satisfactory latency and DSSR for CAV applications and outperforms other existing methods.</description>

      <title>Model-free Resilient Controller Design based on Incentive Feedback Stackelberg Game and Q-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the swift evolution of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) within intelligent environments, especially in the industrial domain shaped by Industry 4.0, the surge in development brings forth unprecedented security challenges. This paper explores the intricate security issues of Industrial CPSs (ICPSs), with a specific focus on the unique threats presented by intelligent attackers capable of directly compromising the controller, thereby posing a direct risk to physical security. Within the framework of hierarchical control and incentive feedback Stackelberg game, we design a resilient leading controller (leader) that is adaptive to a compromised following controller (follower) such that the compromised follower acts cooperatively with the leader, aligning its strategies with the leader's objective to achieve a team-optimal solution. First, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of an incentive Stackelberg solution when system dynamics are known. Then, we propose a Q-learning-based Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) approach, and corresponding algorithms for the online resolution of the incentive Stackelberg solution without requiring prior knowledge of system dynamics. Last but not least, we prove the convergence of our approach to the optimum.</description>

      <title>Ventilation and Temperature Control for Energy-efficient and Healthy Buildings: A Differentiable PDE Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for building learning and control, focusing on ventilation and thermal management to enhance energy efficiency. We validate the performance of the proposed framework in system model learning via two case studies: a synthetic study focusing on the joint learning of temperature and CO2 fields, and an application to a real-world dataset for CO2 field learning. For building control, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can optimize the control actions and significantly reduce the energy cost while maintaining a comfort and healthy indoor environment. When compared to existing traditional methods, an optimization-based method with ODE models and reinforcement learning, our approach can significantly reduce the energy consumption while guarantees all the safety-critical air quality and control constraints. Promising future research directions involve validating and improving the proposed PDE models through accurate estimation of airflow fields within indoor environments. Additionally, incorporating uncertainty modeling into the PDE framework for HVAC control presents an opportunity to enhance the efficiency and reliability of building HVAC system management.</description>

      <title>Fault Detection and Tolerant Control for Aero2 2D0F Two-rotor Helicopter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability and satisfactory performance are critical control requirements for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications. While conventional control systems for UAVs aim to ensure flight stability and safe operation while accomplishing tasks, UAVs may experience various flight faults that can degrade performance or, in severe cases, lead to instability. Unsatisfactory performance or instability of a UAV poses risks to lives, properties, and the flying environment. Therefore, it's essential to design a system capable of detecting faults, pinpointing their location, assessing their severity, and using this information to mitigate them, enabling the vehicle to continue operating satisfactorily. Despite the importance of analysing fault performance to select optimal fault detection and tolerance strategies, limited research has been conducted, especially with real systems. This study examines the performance of a 2-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) bi-rotor helicopter's control system in the presence of various actuator faults. Results from different fault conditions demonstrate that faults degrade the performance of conventional control systems on UAVs and introduce vibrations into the system, particularly when faults cause asymmetry or imbalance. However, additional experiments reveal that effective fault diagnosis and accommodation methods can help maintain satisfactory system performance despite the presence of faults.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Approach to Resilient Distributed Consensus Accounting for State Imprecision and Adversarial Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for resilient distributed consensus in multiagent networks when dealing with adversarial agents imprecision in states observed by normal agents. Traditional resilient distributed consensus algorithms often presume that agents have exact knowledge of their neighbors' states, which is unrealistic in practical scenarios. We show that such existing methods are inadequate when agents only have access to imprecise states of their neighbors. To overcome this challenge, we adapt a geometric approach and model an agent's state by an `imprecision region' rather than a point in $\mathbb{R}^d$. From a given set of imprecision regions, we first present an efficient way to compute a region that is guaranteed to lie in the convex hull of true, albeit unknown, states of agents. We call this region the \emph{invariant hull} of imprecision regions and provide its geometric characterization. Next, we use these invariant hulls to identify a \emph{safe point} for each normal agent. The safe point of an agent lies within the convex hull of its \emph{normal} neighbors' states and hence is used by the agent to update it's state. This leads to the aggregation of normal agents' states to safe points inside the convex hull of their initial states, or an approximation of consensus. We also illustrate our results through simulations. Our contributions enhance the robustness of resilient distributed consensus algorithms by accommodating state imprecision without compromising resilience against adversarial agents.</description>

      <title>Confidence-Aware Safe and Stable Control of Control-Affine Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing control inputs that satisfy safety requirements is crucial in safety-critical nonlinear control, and this task becomes particularly challenging when full-state measurements are unavailable. In this work, we address the problem of synthesizing safe and stable control for control-affine systems via output feedback (using an observer) while reducing the estimation error of the observer. To achieve this, we adapt control Lyapunov function (CLF) and control barrier function (CBF) techniques to the output feedback setting. Building upon the existing CLF-CBF-QP (Quadratic Program) and CBF-QP frameworks, we formulate two confidence-aware optimization problems and establish the Lipschitz continuity of the obtained solutions. To validate our approach, we conduct simulation studies on two illustrative examples. The simulation studies indicate both improvements in the observer's estimation accuracy and the fulfillment of safety and control requirements.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Masking Protocol for Secure Communication and Attack Detection in Remote Estimation of Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In remote estimation of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), sensor measurements transmitted through network may be attacked by adversaries, leading to leakage risk of privacy (e.g., the system state), and/or failure of the remote estimator. To deal with this problem, a chaotic masking protocol is proposed in this paper to secure the sensor measurements transmission. In detail, at the plant side, a chaotic dynamic system is deployed to encode the sensor measurement, and at the estimator side, an estimator estimates both states of the physical plant and the chaotic system. With this protocol, no additional secure communication links is needed for synchronization, and the masking effect can be perfectly removed when the estimator is in steady state. Furthermore, this masking protocol can deal with multiple types of attacks, i.e., eavesdropping attack, replay attack, and stealthy false data injection attack.</description>

      <title>Partitioning Distribution Networks for Integrated Electrification Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many developing countries, access to electricity remains a significant challenge. Electrification planners in these countries often have to make important decisions on the mode of electrification and the planning of electrical networks for those without access, while under resource constraints. An integrated approach to electrification planning in which traditional grid electrification is complemented off-the-grid technologies such as off-grid microgrids and stand-alone systems can enable the economic provision of electricity access in these regions. This integrated planning approach can be facilitated by determining the least-cost mode of electrification - i.e by electric grid extension or off-grid systems - for non-electrified consumers in a region under analysis, while considering technical, economic and environmental constraints. Computational clustering methods the identification of consumer clusters (either as clusters of off-grid microgrids, stand-alone systems or grid-extension projects) can be undertaken using computational clustering methods. This paper presents a novel computational approach to achieve this purpose. This methodology involves exploiting the grid network that connects all consumers, by greedily partitioning the network to identify clusters of consumers to be electrified by grid-extension and off-grid microgrid systems. Using test cases and sensitivity analyses, we implement and benchmark this top-down approach with those obtained from a bottom-up clustering methodology used by the Reference Electrification Model, a model obtainable in literature. Results presented show that the alternative top-down methodology proposed can compare favorably, in terms of global electrification costs, with a bottom-up approach to rural electrification planning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as chatbots have drawn remarkable attention thanks to their versatile capability in natural language processing as well as in a wide range of tasks. While there has been great enthusiasm towards adopting such foundational model-based artificial intelligence tools in all sectors possible, the capabilities and limitations of such LLMs in improving the operation of the electric energy sector need to be explored, and this article identifies fruitful directions in this regard. Key future research directions include data collection systems for fine-tuning LLMs, embedding power system-specific tools in the LLMs, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG)-based knowledge pool to improve the quality of LLM responses and LLMs in safety-critical use cases.</description>

      <title>Optimal Pinning Control for Synchronization over Temporal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the finite time synchronization of a network of dynamical systems with time-varying interactions modeled using temporal networks. We synchronize a few nodes initially using external control inputs. These nodes are termed as pinning nodes. The other nodes are synchronized by interacting with the pinning nodes and with each other. We first provide sufficient conditions for the network to be synchronized. Then we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the number of pinning nodes for synchronizing the entire network. Finally, we address the problem of maximizing the number of synchronized nodes when there are constraints on the number of nodes that could be pinned. We show that this problem belongs to the class of NP-hard problems and propose a greedy heuristic. We illustrate the results using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Fairness-Aware Multi-Server Federated Learning Task Delegation over Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly advancing field of federated learning (FL), ensuring efficient FL task delegation while incentivising FL client participation poses significant challenges, especially in wireless networks where FL participants' coverage is limited. Existing Contract Theory-based methods are designed under the assumption that there is only one FL server in the system (i.e., the monopoly market assumption), which in unrealistic in practice. To address this limitation, we propose Fairness-Aware Multi-Server FL task delegation approach (FAMuS), a novel framework based on Contract Theory and Lyapunov optimization to jointly address these intricate issues facing wireless multi-server FL networks (WMSFLN). Within a given WMSFLN, a task requester products multiple FL tasks and delegate them to FL servers which coordinate the training processes. To ensure fair treatment of FL servers, FAMuS establishes virtual queues to track their previous access to FL tasks, updating them in relation to the resulting FL model performance. The objective is to minimize the time-averaged cost in a WMSFLN, while ensuring all queues remain stable. This is particularly challenging given the incomplete information regarding FL clients' participation cost and the unpredictable nature of the WMSFLN state, which depends on the locations of the mobile clients. Extensive experiments comparing FAMuS against five state-of-the-art approaches based on two real-world datasets demonstrate that it achieves 6.91% higher test accuracy, 27.34% lower cost, and 0.63% higher fairness on average than the best-performing baseline.</description>

      <title>Synchronisation-Oriented Design Approach for Adaptive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a synchronisation-oriented perspective towards adaptive control which views model-referenced adaptation as synchronisation between actual and virtual dynamic systems. In the context of adaptation, model reference adaptive control methods make the state response of the actual plant follow a reference model. In the context of synchronisation, consensus methods involving diffusive coupling induce a collective behaviour across multiple agents. We draw from the understanding about the two time-scale nature of synchronisation motivated by the study of blended dynamics. The synchronisation-oriented approach consists in the design of a coupling input to achieve desired closed-loop error dynamics followed by the input allocation process to shape the collective behaviour. We suggest that synchronisation can be a reasonable design principle allowing a more holistic and systematic approach to the design of adaptive control systems for improved transient characteristics. Most notably, the proposed approach enables not only constructive derivation but also substantial generalisation of the previously developed closed-loop reference model adaptive control method. Practical significance of the proposed generalisation lies at the capability to improve the transient response characteristics and mitigate the unwanted peaking phenomenon at the same time.</description>

      <title>Learning Algorithms for Verification of Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general framework for applying learning algorithms and heuristical guidance to the verification of Markov decision processes (MDPs), based on the ideas of Br\'azdil, T. et al. (2014). Verification of Markov Decision Processes Using Learning Algorithms. The primary goal of the techniques presented in that work is to improve performance by avoiding an exhaustive exploration of the state space, guided by heuristics. This approach is significantly extended in this work. Several details of the base theory are refined and errors are fixed. Section 1.3 provides an overview of all differences.
  The presented framework focuses on probabilistic reachability, which is a core problem in verification, and is instantiated in two distinct scenarios. The first assumes that full knowledge of the MDP is available, in particular precise transition probabilities. It performs a heuristic-driven partial exploration of the model, yielding precise lower and upper bounds on the required probability. The second tackles the case where we may only sample the MDP without knowing the exact transition dynamics. Here, we obtain probabilistic guarantees, again in terms of both the lower and upper bounds, which provides efficient stopping criteria for the approximation. In particular, the latter is an extension of statistical model-checking (SMC) for unbounded properties in MDPs. In contrast to other related approaches, we do not restrict our attention to time-bounded (finite-horizon) or discounted properties, nor assume any particular structural properties of the MDP.</description>

      <title>Synchronized states of power grids and oscillator networks by convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization is essential for the operation of AC power systems: All generators in the power grid must rotate with fixed relative phases to enable a steady flow of electric power. Understanding the conditions for and the limitations of synchronization is of utmost practical importance. In this article, we propose a novel approach to compute and analyze the stable stationary states of a power grid or an oscillator network in terms of a convex optimization problem. This approach allows to systematically compute \emph{all} stable states where the phase difference across an edge does not exceed $\pi/2$.Furthermore, the optimization formulation allows to rigorously establish certain properties of synchronized states and to bound the error in the widely used linear power flow approximation.</description>

      <title>Learning to optimize with convergence guarantees using nonlinear system theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing reliance on numerical methods for controlling dynamical systems and training machine learning models underscores the need to devise algorithms that dependably and efficiently navigate complex optimization landscapes. Classical gradient descent methods offer strong theoretical guarantees for convex problems; however, they demand meticulous hyperparameter tuning for non-convex ones. The emerging paradigm of learning to optimize (L2O) automates the discovery of algorithms with optimized performance leveraging learning models and data - yet, it lacks a theoretical framework to analyze convergence and robustness of the learned algorithms. In this paper, we fill this gap by harnessing nonlinear system theory. Specifically, we propose an unconstrained parametrization of all convergent algorithms for smooth non-convex objective functions. Notably, our framework is directly compatible with automatic differentiation tools, ensuring convergence by design while learning to optimize.</description>

      <title>The Development of Investment Planning Models for the United Kingdoms Wind and Solar Fleets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work has resulted in the development of an energy model able to calculate wind and solar fleet efficiencies. However, for investment planning purposes, it is necessary to calculate from the lowest economically acceptable efficiencies how much wind and solar generation would be economically justified. The paper explains how this objective has been achieved with arrays (investment planning tables) created after carrying out a structured investigation of the behaviour of the electricity system over the whole of its operational range. The tables are then applied to National Grid prediction of the size and composition of the system in the year 2035. A conclusion is reached that wind and solar generation will only be able to supply about 70% of electrical demand, the other 30% being provided by dispatchable sources of generation, which must be sufficiently fast acting to maintain electricity system stability, such as the use of combined cycle gas turbines. This limit on deployment of wind and solar generation restricts their ability to decarbonise the electricity system and is likely to lead in 2035 to a residual of 72 million tonnes per annum of carbon dioxide emissions which wind and solar generations will be unable to address</description>

      <title>Is Data All That Matters? The Role of Control Frequency for Learning-Based Sampled-Data Control of Uncertain Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning models or control policies from data has become a powerful tool to improve the performance of uncertain systems. While a strong focus has been placed on increasing the amount and quality of data to improve performance, data can never fully eliminate uncertainty, making feedback necessary to ensure stability and performance. We show that the control frequency at which the input is recalculated is a crucial design parameter, yet it has hardly been considered before. We address this gap by combining probabilistic model learning and sampled-data control. We use Gaussian processes (GPs) to learn a continuous-time model and compute a corresponding discrete-time controller. The result is an uncertain sampled-data control system, for which we derive robust stability conditions. We formulate semidefinite programs to compute the minimum control frequency required for stability and to optimize performance. As a result, our approach enables us to study the effect of both control frequency and data on stability and closed-loop performance. We show in numerical simulations of a quadrotor that performance can be improved by increasing either the amount of data or the control frequency, and that we can trade off one for the other. For example, by increasing the control frequency by 33%, we can reduce the number of data points by half while still achieving similar performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent application of Federated Learning algorithms in IOT and Wireless vehicular networks have given rise to newer cyber threats in the mobile environment which hitherto were not present in traditional fixed networks. These threats arise due to the intrinsic nature of wireless transmission medium and other inherent characteristics of mobile networks such as high-node mobility and rapidly changing topology. This paper investigates the robustness of Vehicular AttestedFL defense strategies against falsified information attacks by tracking the behavior. We show that the defense strategies are capable of detecting and eliminating malicious nodes in the wireless mobile setting of the future smart road networks.</description>

      <title>Mixed Algorithm of SINDy and HAVOK for Measure-Based Analysis of Power System with Inverter-based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning is enhancing electric grids by offering data analysis tools that can be used to operate the power grid more reliably. However, the complex nonlinear dynamics, particularly when coupled with multi-scale interactions among Inverter-based renewable energy Resources, calls for effective algorithms for power system application. This paper presents affective novel algorithm to detect various nonlinear dynamics, which is built upon: the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics method for nonlinear dynamics detection; and Hankel Alternative View of Koopman method for multi-scale decomposition. We show that, by an appropriate integration of the strengths of the two, the mixed algorithm not only can detect the nonlinearity, but also it distinguishes the nonlinearity caused by coupled Inverter-based resources from the more familiar ones caused synchronous generators. This shows that the proposal algorithm can be a promising application of artificial intelligence and machine learning for data measure-based analysis to support operation of power system with integrated renewables.</description>

      <title>Learning High-Order Control Barrier Functions for Safety-Critical Control with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) have recently introduced a systematic tool to ensure system safety by establishing set invariance. When combined with a nominal control strategy, they form a safety-critical control mechanism. However, the effectiveness of CBFs is closely tied to the system model. In practice, model uncertainty can compromise safety guarantees and may lead to conservative safety constraints, or conversely, allow the system to operate in unsafe regions. In this paper, we use Gaussian processes to mitigate the adverse effects of uncertainty on high-order CBFs (HOCBFs). A properly structured covariance function enables us to convert the chance constraints of HOCBFs into a second-order cone constraint. This results in a convex constrained optimization as a safety filter. We analyze the feasibility of the resulting optimization and provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for feasibility. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated through two numerical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design a concept for an autonomous underground freight transport system for Hanover, Germany. To evaluate the resulting system changes in overall traffic flows from an environmental perspective, we carried out an agent-based traffic simulation with MATSim. Our simulations indicate comparatively low impacts on network-wide traffic volumes. Local CO2 emissions, on the other hand, could be reduced by up to 32 %. In total, the shuttle system can replace more than 18 % of the vehicles in use with conventional combustion engines. Thus, an autonomous underground freight transportation system can contribute to environmentally friendly and economical transportation of urban goods on the condition of cooperative use of the system.</description>

      <title>Interpolatory model order reduction of large-scale dynamical systems with root mean squared error measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The root mean squared error is an important measure used in a variety of applications such as structural dynamics and acoustics to model averaged deviations from standard behavior. For large-scale systems, simulations of this quantity quickly become computationally prohibitive. Classical model order reduction techniques attempt to resolve this issue via the construction of surrogate models that emulate the root mean squared error measure using an intermediate linear system. However, this approach requires a potentially large number of linear outputs, which can be disadvantageous in the design of reduced-order models. In this work, we consider directly the root mean squared error as the quantity of interest using the concept of quadratic-output models and propose several new model reduction techniques for the construction of appropriate surrogates. We test the proposed methods on a model for the vibrational response of a plate with tuned vibration absorbers.</description>

      <title>Handoffs in User-Centric Cell-Free MIMO Networks: A POMDP Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of managing handoffs (HOs) in user-centric cell-free massive MIMO (UC-mMIMO) networks. Motivated by the importance of controlling the number of HOs and by the correlation between efficient HO decisions and the temporal evolution of the channel conditions, we formulate a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with the state space representing the discrete versions of the large-scale fading and the action space representing the association decisions of the user with the access points (APs). We develop a novel algorithm that employs this model to derive a HO policy for a mobile user based on current and future rewards. To alleviate the high complexity of our POMDP, we follow a divide-and-conquer approach by breaking down the POMDP formulation into sub-problems, each solved separately. Then, the policy and the candidate pool of APs for the sub-problem that produced the best total expected reward are used to perform HOs within a specific time horizon. We then introduce modifications to our algorithm to decrease the number of HOs. The results show that half of the number of HOs in the UC-mMIMO networks can be eliminated. Namely, our novel solution can control the number of HOs while maintaining a rate guarantee, where a 47%-70% reduction of the cumulative number of HOs is observed in networks with a density of 125 APs per km2. Most importantly, our results show that a POMDP-based HO scheme is promising to control HOs.</description>

      <title>The indoor agriculture industry: a promising player in demand response services</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Demand response (DR) programs currently cover about 2\% of the average annual global demand, which is far from contributing to the International Energy Agency's ``Net Zero by 2050'' roadmap's 20\% target. While aggregation of many small flexible loads such as individual households can help reaching this target, increasing the participation of industries that are major electricity consumers is certainly a way forward. The indoor agriculture sector currently experiences a significant growth to partake in the sustainable production of high-quality food world-wide. As energy-related costs, up to 40\% of the total expenses, may preclude full maturity of this industry, DR participation can result in a win-win situation. Indeed, the agriculture system must transform and become a sustainable source of food for an increasing number of people worldwide under the constraints of preservation of soils and water, carbon footprint, and energy efficiency. We considered the case of the Russian Federation where indoor farming is burgeoning and already represents a load of several thousand megawatts. To show the viability of the indoor farming industry participation in implicit and explicit DR programs, we built a physical model of a vertical farm inside a phytotron with complete control of environmental parameters including ambient temperature, relative humidity, CO$_2$ concentration, and photosynthetic photon flux density. This phytotron was used as a model greenhouse. We grew different varieties of leafy plants under simulated DR conditions and control conditions on the same setup. Our results show that the indoor farming dedicated to greens can participate in DR without adversely affecting plant production and that this presents an economic advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a control solution to achieve collision-free platooning control of input-constrained mobile robots. The platooning policy is based on a leader-follower approach where the leader tracks a reference trajectory while followers track the leader's pose with an inter-agent delay. First, the leader and the follower kinematic models are feedback linearized and the platoon's error dynamics and input constraints characterized. Then, a set-theoretic model predictive control strategy is proposed to address the platooning trajectory tracking control problem. An ad-hoc collision avoidance policy is also proposed to guarantee collision avoidance amongst the agents. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control architecture is validated through experiments performed on a formation of Khepera IV differential drive robots</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop several necessary conditions of turnpike property for generalizaid linear-quadratic (LQ) optimal control problem in infinite dimensional setting. The term 'generalized' here means that both quadratic and linear terms are considered in the running cost. The turnpike property reflects the fact that over a sufficiently large time horizon, the optimal trajectories and optimal controls stay for most of the time close to a steady state of the system. We show that the turnpike property is strongly connected to certain system theoretical properties of the control system. We provide suitable conditions to characterize the turnpike property in terms of the detectability and stabilizability of the system. Subsequently, we show the equivalence between the exponential turnpike property for generalized LQ and LQ optimal control problems.</description>

Abstract: In this work, a theorem is first proved which presents a game theoretic formulation of a necessary and sufficient sustainizability over a set condition for a general system described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Then, two additional theorems are proved for the n-species Gause-Lotka-Volterra (GLV) population model, establishing necessary and sufficient sustainability and sustainizability conditions over rectangular sets. Three case studies on the May-Leonard, 3-species, GLV model are then presented to illustrate the power of the above Theorems. In two of these case studies (2 and 3), it is shown that a particular instance of the 3-species, GLV model is unsustainable but sustainizable through allowable action.</description>

      <title>A Constrained Tracking Controller for Ramp and Sinusoidal Reference Signals using Robust Positive Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an output feedback controller capable of ensuring steady-state offset-free tracking for ramp and sinusoidal reference signals while ensuring local stability and state and input constraints fulfillment. The proposed solution is derived by jointly exploiting the internal model principle, polyhedral robust positively invariant arguments, and the Extended Farkas' Lemma. In particular, by considering a generic class of output feedback controller equipped with a feedforward term, a proportional effect, and a double integrator, we offline design the controller's gains by means of a single bilinear optimization problem. A peculiar feature of the proposed design is that the sets of all the admissible reference signals and the plant's initial conditions are also offline determined. Simulation results are provided to testify to the effectiveness of the proposed tracking controller and its capability to deal with both state and input constraints.</description>

      <title>SINDy-RL: Interpretable and Efficient Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown significant promise for uncovering sophisticated control policies that interact in environments with complicated dynamics, such as stabilizing the magnetohydrodynamics of a tokamak fusion reactor or minimizing the drag force exerted on an object in a fluid flow. However, these algorithms require an abundance of training examples and may become prohibitively expensive for many applications. In addition, the reliance on deep neural networks often results in an uninterpretable, black-box policy that may be too computationally expensive to use with certain embedded systems. Recent advances in sparse dictionary learning, such as the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), have shown promise for creating efficient and interpretable data-driven models in the low-data regime. In this work we introduce SINDy-RL, a unifying framework for combining SINDy and DRL to create efficient, interpretable, and trustworthy representations of the dynamics model, reward function, and control policy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on benchmark control environments and challenging fluids problems. SINDy-RL achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL algorithms using significantly fewer interactions in the environment and results in an interpretable control policy orders of magnitude smaller than a deep neural network policy.</description>

      <title>MPC without Terminal Ingredients Tailored to the SEIR Compartmental Epidemic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the SEIR epidemic model subject to state and input constraints (a cap on the proportion of infectuous individuals and limits on the allowed social distancing and quarantining measures, respectively). We present a model predictive control (MPC) formulation tailored to this system without terminal conditions in the recursively solved finite-horizon optimal control problem. We rigorously show recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium w.r.t. the MPC closed loop for suitably designed quadratic running cost and a sufficiently long prediction horizon (forecast window). Moreover, we establish the viability kernel (a.k.a. the admissible set) as domain of attraction provided that the infection numbers that are not too small at the beginning, which corresponds to infection numbers noticeable by, e.g., policy makers or the general public.</description>

      <title>A Modified da Vinci Surgical Instrument for OCE based Elasticity Estimation with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robot-assisted surgery has advantages compared to conventional laparoscopic procedures, e.g., precise movement of the surgical instruments, improved dexterity, and high-resolution visualization of the surgical field. However, mechanical tissue properties may provide additional information, e.g., on the location of lesions or vessels. While elastographic imaging has been proposed, it is not readily available as an online modality during robot-assisted surgery. We propose modifying a da~Vinci surgical instrument to realize optical coherence elastography (OCE) for quantitative elasticity estimation. The modified da~Vinci instrument is equipped with piezoelectric elements for shear wave excitation and we employ fast optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to track propagating wave fields, which are directly related to biomechanical tissue properties. All high-voltage components are mounted at the proximal end outside the patient. We demonstrate that external excitation at the instrument shaft can effectively stimulate shear waves, even when considering damping. Comparing conventional and deep learning-based signal processing, resulting in mean absolute errors of 19.27 kPa and 6.29 kPa, respectively. These results illustrate that precise quantitative elasticity estimates can be obtained. We also demonstrate quantitative elasticity estimation on ex-vivo tissue samples of heart, liver and stomach, and show that the measurements can be used to distinguish soft and stiff tissue types.</description>

      <title>Solvability of the Inverse Optimal Control problem based on the minimum principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the solvability of the Inverse Optimal Control (IOC) problem based on two existing minimum principal methods, is analysed. The aim of this work is to answer the question regarding what kinds of trajectories, that is depending on the initial conditions of the closed-loop system and system dynamics, of the original optimal control problem, will result in the recovery of the true weights of the reward function for both the soft and the hard-constrained methods [1], [2]. Analytical conditions are provided which allow to verify if a trajectory is sufficiently conditioned, that is, holds sufficient information to recover the true weights of an optimal control problem. It was found that the open-loop system of the original optimal problem has a stronger influence on the solvability of the Inverse Optimal Control problem for the hard-constrained method as compared to the soft-constrained method. These analytical results were validated via simulation.</description>

      <title>An Industrial Experience Report about Challenges from Continuous Monitoring, Improvement, and Deployment for Autonomous Driving Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using continuous development, deployment, and monitoring (CDDM) to understand and improve applications in a customer's context is widely used for non-safety applications such as smartphone apps or web applications to enable rapid and innovative feature improvements. Having demonstrated its potential in such domains, it may have the potential to also improve the software development for automotive functions as some OEMs described on a high level in their financial company communiqus. However, the application of a CDDM strategy also faces challenges from a process adherence and documentation perspective as required by safety-related products such as autonomous driving systems (ADS) and guided by industry standards such as ISO-26262 and ISO21448. There are publications on CDDM in safety-relevant contexts that focus on safety-critical functions on a rather generic level and thus, not specifically ADS or automotive, or that are concentrating only on software and hence, missing out the particular context of an automotive OEM: Well-established legacy processes and the need of their adaptations, and aspects originating from the role of being a system integrator for software/software, hardware/hardware, and hardware/software. In this paper, particular challenges from the automotive domain to better adopt CDDM are identified and discussed to shed light on research gaps to enhance CDDM, especially for the software development of safe ADS. The challenges are identified from today's industrial well-established ways of working by conducting interviews with domain experts and complemented by a literature study.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Electrical Interface for Large-Scale Color-Center Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum processors based on color centers in diamond are promising candidates for future large-scale quantum computers thanks to their flexible optical interface, (relatively) high operating temperature, and high-fidelity operation. Similar to other quantum-computing platforms, the electrical interface required to control and read out such qubits may limit both the performance of the whole system and its scalability. To address this challenge, this work analyzes the requirements of the electrical interface and investigates how to efficiently implement the electronic controller in a scalable architecture comprising a large number of identical unit cells. Among the different discussed functionalities, a specific focus is devoted to the generation of the static and dynamic magnetic fields driving the electron and nuclear spins, because of their major impact on fidelity and scalability. Following the derived requirements, different system architectures, such as a qubit frequency-multiplexing scheme, are considered to identify the most power efficient approach, especially in the presence of inhomogeneity of the qubit Larmor frequency across the processor. As a result, a non-frequency-multiplexed, 1-mm$^2$ unit-cell architecture is proposed as the optimal solution, able to address up to one electron-spin qubit and 9 nuclear-spin qubits within a 3-mW average power consumption, thus establishing the baseline for the scalable electrical interface for future large-scale color-center quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In fifth generation (5G) wireless cellular networks, millimeter wave spectrum opens room for several potential improvements in throughput, reliability, latency, among other aspects. However, it also brings challenges, such as a higher influence of blockage which may significantly limit the coverage. In this context, network-controlled repeaters (NCRs) are network nodes with low complexity that represent a technique to overcome coverage problems. In this paper, we introduce the NCR concept and study its performance gains and deployment options. Particularly, presenting the main specifications of NCR as agreed in 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) Rel-18, we analyze different NCR deployments in an urban scenario and compare its performance with alternative deployments. As demonstrated, with a proper network planning and beamforming design, NCR is an attractive solution to cover blind spots the base stations (BSs) may have.</description>

      <title>In-Field Gyroscope Autocalibration with Iterative Attitude Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.11097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient in-field calibration method tailored for low-cost triaxial MEMS gyroscopes often used in healthcare applications. Traditional calibration techniques are challenging to implement in clinical settings due to the unavailability of high-precision equipment. Unlike the auto-calibration approaches used for triaxial MEMS accelerometers, which rely on local gravity, gyroscopes lack a reliable reference since the Earth's self-rotation speed is insufficient for accurate calibration. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method that uses manual rotation of the MEMS gyroscope to a specific angle (360{\deg}) as the calibration reference. This approach iteratively estimates the sensor's attitude without requiring any external equipment. Numerical simulations and empirical tests validate that the calibration error is low and that parameter estimation is unbiased. The method can be implemented in real-time on a low-energy microcontroller and completed in under 30 seconds. Comparative results demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving scale factor and bias errors of less than $2.5\times10^{-2}$ for LSM9DS1 and less than $1\times10^{-2}$ for ICM20948.</description>

      <title>Stability of Linear Set-Membership Filters With Respect to Initial Conditions: An Observation-Information Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.13966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The issue of filter stability with respect to (w.r.t.) the initial condition refers to the unreliable filtering process caused by improper prior information of the initial state. This paper focuses on analyzing and resolving the stability issue w.r.t. the initial condition of the classical Set-Membership Filters (SMFs) for linear time-invariance systems, which has not yet been well understood in the literature. To this end, we propose a new concept -- the Observation-Information Tower (OIT), which describes how the measurements affect the estimate in a set-intersection manner without relying on the initial condition. The proposed OIT enables a rigorous stability analysis, a new SMFing framework, as well as an efficient filtering algorithm. Specifically, based on the OIT, explicit necessary and sufficient conditions for stability w.r.t. the initial condition are provided for the classical SMFing framework. Furthermore, the OIT inspires a stability-guaranteed SMFing framework, which fully handles the stability issue w.r.t. the initial condition. Finally, with the OIT-inspired framework, we develop a fast and stable constrained zonotopic SMF, which significantly overcomes the wrapping effect.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Algebraic Framework for Verification and Synthesis of Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety is a critical property for control systems in medicine, transportation, manufacturing, and other applications, and can be defined as ensuring positive invariance of a predefined safe set. This paper investigates the problems of verifying positive invariance of a semi-algebraic set as well as synthesizing sets that can be made positive invariant through Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based control. The key to our approach consists of mapping conditions for positive invariance to sum-of-squares constraints via the Positivstellensatz from real algebraic geometry. Based on these conditions, we propose a framework for verifying safety of CBF-based control including single CBFs, high-order CBFs, multi-CBFs, and systems with trigonometric dynamics and actuation constraints.
  In the area of synthesis, we propose algorithms for constructing CBFs, namely, an alternating-descent approach and a local CBF approach. We evaluate our approach through a case study on a linearized quadrotor model with actuation constraints.</description>

Abstract: We analyse the conservatism and regret of distributionally robust (DR) stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) when using moment-based ambiguity sets for modeling unknown uncertainties. To quantify the conservatism, we compare the deterministic constraint tightening while taking a DR approach against the optimal tightening when the exact distributions of the stochastic uncertainties are known. Furthermore, we quantify the regret by comparing the performance when the distributions of the stochastic uncertainties are known and unknown. Analysing the accumulated sub-optimality of SMPC due to the lack of knowledge about the true distributions of the uncertainties marks the novel contribution of this work.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the Value of Flexibility in AC Security-Constrained Transmission Expansion Planning via a Cooperative Game Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Security-constrained transmission expansion planning (SCTEP) is an inherently complex problem that requires simultaneously solving multiple contingency states of the system (usually corresponding to N-1 security criterion). Existing studies focus on effectively finding optimal solutions; however, single optimal solutions are not sufficient to interpret the value of flexibility (e.g., from energy storage systems) and support system planners in well-informed decision making. In view of planning uncertainties, it is necessary to estimate the contributions of flexibility to various objectives and prioritise the most effective investments. In this regard, this work introduces a SCTEP tool that enables interpreting the value of flexibility in terms of contributions to avoided load curtailment and total expected system cost reduction. Inspired by cooperative game theory, the tool ranks the contributions of flexibility providers and compares them against traditional line reinforcements. This information can be used by system planners to prioritise investments with higher contributions and synergistic capabilities.</description>

      <title>Linking intra- and extra-cellular metabolic domains via neural-network surrogates for dynamic metabolic control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17179v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We outline a modeling and optimization strategy for investigating dynamic metabolic engineering interventions. Our framework is particularly useful at the early stages of research and development, often constrained by limited knowledge and experimental data. Elucidating a priori optimal trajectories of manipulatable intracellular fluxes can guide the design of suitable control schemes, e.g., cyber(ge)netic or in-cell approaches, and the selection of appropriate actuators, e.g., at the transcriptional or post-translational levels. Model-based dynamic optimization is proposed to predict optimal trajectories of target manipulatable intracellular fluxes. A challenge emerges as existing models are often oversimplified, lacking insights into metabolism, or excessively complex, making them difficult to build and implement. Here, we use surrogates derived from steady-state solutions of constraint-based metabolic models to link manipulatable intracellular fluxes to the process exchange rates of structurally simple hybrid dynamic models. The latter can be conveniently used in optimal control problems of metabolism. As a proof of concept, we apply our method to a reduced metabolic network of $\textit{Escherichia coli}$ considering two different scenarios of dynamic metabolic engineering.</description>

      <title>Repairing Learning-Enabled Controllers While Preserving What Works</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning-enabled controllers have been adopted in various cyber-physical systems (CPS). When a learning-enabled controller fails to accomplish its task from a set of initial states, researchers leverage repair algorithms to fine-tune the controller's parameters. However, existing repair techniques do not preserve previously correct behaviors. Specifically, when modifying the parameters to repair trajectories from a subset of initial states, another subset may be compromised. Therefore, the repair may break previously correct scenarios, introducing new risks that may not be accounted for. Due to this issue, repairing the entire initial state space may be hard or even infeasible. As a response, we formulate the Repair with Preservation (RwP) problem, which calls for preserving the already-correct scenarios during repair. To tackle this problem, we design the Incremental Simulated Annealing Repair (ISAR) algorithm, which leverages simulated annealing on a barriered energy function to safeguard the already-correct initial states while repairing as many additional ones as possible. Moreover, formal verification is utilized to guarantee the repair results. Case studies on an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) and OpenAI Gym Mountain Car (MC) show that ISAR not only preserves correct behaviors from previously verified initial state regions, but also repairs 81.4% and 23.5% of broken state spaces in the two benchmarks. Moreover, the average signal temporal logic (STL) robustnesses of the ISAR repaired controllers are larger than those of the controllers repaired using baseline methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have been developing human-sized biped robots based on passive dynamic mechanisms. In human locomotion, the muscles activate at the same rate relative to the gait cycle during running. To achieve adaptive running for robots, such characteristics should be reproduced to yield the desired effect, In this study, we designed a central pattern generator (CPG) involving fast and slow adaptation to achieve human-like running using a simple spring-mass model and our developed bipedal robot, which is equipped with actuators that imitate the human musculoskeletal system. Our results demonstrate that the CPG-based controller with fast and slow adaptations, and a adjustable actuator control timing can reproduce human-like running. The results suggest that the CPG contributes to the adjustment of the muscle activation timing in human running.</description>

      <title>Multi-robot Motion Planning based on Nets-within-Nets Modeling and Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on designing motion plans for a heterogeneous team of robots that has to cooperate in fulfilling a global mission. The robots move in an environment containing some regions of interest, and the specification for the whole team can include avoidances, visits, or sequencing when entering these regions of interest. The specification is expressed in terms of a Petri net corresponding to an automaton, while each robot is also modeled by a state machine Petri net. With respect to existing solutions for related problems, the current work brings the following contributions. First, we propose a novel model, denoted {High-Level robot team Petri Net (HLPN) system, for incorporating the specification and the robot models into the Nets-within-Nets paradigm. A guard function, named Global Enabling Function (gef), is designed to synchronize the firing of transitions such that the robot motions do not violate the specification. Then, the solution is found by simulating the HPLN system in a specific software tool that accommodates Nets-within-Nets. An illustrative example based on a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) mission is described throughout the paper, complementing the proposed rationale of the framework.</description>

      <title>Collision-Resilient Passive Deformable Quadrotors for Exploration, Mapping and Swift Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce XPLORER, a passive deformable quadrotor optimized for performing contact-rich tasks by utilizing collision-induced deformation. We present a novel external force estimation technique, and advanced planning and control algorithms that exploit the compliant nature of XPLORER's chassis. These algorithms enable three distinct flight behaviors: static-wrench application, where XPLORER can exert desired forces and torque on surfaces for precise manipulation; disturbance rejection, wherein the quadrotor actively mitigates external forces and yaw disturbances to maintain its intended trajectory; and yielding to disturbance, enabling XPLORER to dynamically adapt its position and orientation to evade undesired forces, ensuring stable flight amidst unpredictable environmental factors. Leveraging these behaviors, we develop innovative mission strategies including tactile-traversal, tactile-turning, and collide-to-brake for contact-based exploration of unknown areas, contact-based mapping and swift navigation. Through experimental validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies in enabling efficient exploration and rapid navigation in unknown environments, leveraging collisions as a means for feedback and control. This study contributes to the growing field of aerial robotics by showcasing the potential of passive deformable quadrotors for versatile and robust interaction tasks in real-world scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Comparing graphs by means of optimal transport has recently gained significant attention, as the distances induced by optimal transport provide both a principled metric between graphs as well as an interpretable description of the associated changes between graphs in terms of a transport plan. As the lack of symmetry introduces challenges in the typically considered formulations, optimal transport distances for graphs have mostly been developed for undirected graphs. Here, we propose two distance measures to compare directed graphs based on variants of optimal transport: (i) an earth movers distance (Wasserstein) and (ii) a Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance. We evaluate these two distances and discuss their relative performance for both simulated graph data and real-world directed cell-cell communication graphs, inferred from single-cell RNA-seq data.</description>

      <title>Prosumers Participation in Markets: A Scalar-Parameterized Function Bidding Approach</title>

Abstract: In uniform-price markets, suppliers compete to supply a resource to consumers, resulting in a single market price determined by their competition. For sufficient flexibility, producers and consumers prefer to commit to a function as their strategies, indicating their preferred quantity at any given market price. Producers and consumers may wish to act as both, i.e., prosumers. In this paper, we examine the behavior of profit-maximizing prosumers in a uniform-price market for resource allocation with the objective of maximizing the social welfare. We propose a scalar-parameterized function bidding mechanism for the prosumers, in which we establish the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, we provide an efficient way to compute the Nash equilibrium through the computation of the market allocation at the Nash equilibrium. Finally, we present a case study to illustrate the welfare loss under different variations of market parameters, such as the market's supply capacity and inelastic demand.</description>

      <title>Stable Training of Probabilistic Models Using the Leave-One-Out Maximum Log-Likelihood Objective</title>

Abstract: Probabilistic modelling of power systems operation and planning processes depends on data-driven methods, which require sufficiently large datasets. When historical data lacks this, it is desired to model the underlying data generation mechanism as a probability distribution to assess the data quality and generate more data, if needed. Kernel density estimation (KDE) based models are popular choices for this task, but they fail to adapt to data regions with varying densities. In this paper, an adaptive KDE model is employed to circumvent this, where each kernel in the model has an individual bandwidth. The leave-one-out maximum log-likelihood (LOO-MLL) criterion is proposed to prevent the singular solutions that the regular MLL criterion gives rise to, and it is proven that LOO-MLL prevents these. Relying on this guaranteed robustness, the model is extended by adjustable weights for the kernels. In addition, a modified expectation-maximization algorithm is employed to accelerate the optimization speed reliably. The performance of the proposed method and models are exhibited on two power systems datasets using different statistical tests and by comparison with Gaussian mixture models. Results show that the proposed models have promising performance, in addition to their singularity prevention guarantees.</description>
