      <title>Safe-VAR: Safe Visual Autoregressive Model for Text-to-Image Generative Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the success of autoregressive learning in large language models, it has become a dominant approach for text-to-image generation, offering high efficiency and visual quality. However, invisible watermarking for visual autoregressive (VAR) models remains underexplored, despite its importance in misuse prevention. Existing watermarking methods, designed for diffusion models, often struggle to adapt to the sequential nature of VAR models. To bridge this gap, we propose Safe-VAR, the first watermarking framework specifically designed for autoregressive text-to-image generation. Our study reveals that the timing of watermark injection significantly impacts generation quality, and watermarks of different complexities exhibit varying optimal injection times. Motivated by this observation, we propose an Adaptive Scale Interaction Module, which dynamically determines the optimal watermark embedding strategy based on the watermark information and the visual characteristics of the generated image. This ensures watermark robustness while minimizing its impact on image quality. Furthermore, we introduce a Cross-Scale Fusion mechanism, which integrates mixture of both heads and experts to effectively fuse multi-resolution features and handle complex interactions between image content and watermark patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that Safe-VAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing existing counterparts regarding image quality, watermarking fidelity, and robustness against perturbations. Moreover, our method exhibits strong generalization to an out-of-domain watermark dataset QR Codes.</description>

      <title>TA-V2A: Textually Assisted Video-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) continues to evolve, video-to-audio (V2A) generation has emerged as a key area with promising applications in multimedia editing, augmented reality, and automated content creation. While Transformer and Diffusion models have advanced audio generation, a significant challenge persists in extracting precise semantic information from videos, as current models often lose sequential context by relying solely on frame-based features. To address this, we present TA-V2A, a method that integrates language, audio, and video features to improve semantic representation in latent space. By incorporating large language models for enhanced video comprehension, our approach leverages text guidance to enrich semantic expression. Our diffusion model-based system utilizes automated text modulation to enhance inference quality and efficiency, providing personalized control through text-guided interfaces. This integration enhances semantic expression while ensuring temporal alignment, leading to more accurate and coherent video-to-audio generation.</description>

      <title>Error Analyses of Auto-Regressive Video Diffusion Models: A Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of Auto-Regressive Video Diffusion Models (ARVDM) have achieved remarkable successes in generating realistic long-form videos. However, theoretical analyses of these models remain scant. In this work, we develop theoretical underpinnings for these models and use our insights to improve the performance of existing models. We first develop Meta-ARVDM, a unified framework of ARVDMs that subsumes most existing methods. Using Meta-ARVDM, we analyze the KL-divergence between the videos generated by Meta-ARVDM and the true videos. Our analysis uncovers two important phenomena inherent to ARVDM -- error accumulation and memory bottleneck. By deriving an information-theoretic impossibility result, we show that the memory bottleneck phenomenon cannot be avoided. To mitigate the memory bottleneck, we design various network structures to explicitly use more past frames. We also achieve a significantly improved trade-off between the mitigation of the memory bottleneck and the inference efficiency by compressing the frames. Experimental results on DMLab and Minecraft validate the efficacy of our methods. Our experiments also demonstrate a Pareto-frontier between the error accumulation and memory bottleneck across different methods.</description>

      <title>MAVFlow: Preserving Paralinguistic Elements with Conditional Flow Matching for Zero-Shot AV2AV Multilingual Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) models, audio-visual to audio-visual (AV2AV) translation still faces a critical challenge: maintaining speaker consistency between the original and translated vocal and facial features. To address this issue, we propose a conditional flow matching (CFM) zero-shot audio-visual renderer that utilizes strong dual guidance from both audio and visual modalities. By leveraging multi-modal guidance with CFM, our model robustly preserves speaker-specific characteristics and significantly enhances zero-shot AV2AV translation abilities. For the audio modality, we enhance the CFM process by integrating robust speaker embeddings with x-vectors, which serve to bolster speaker consistency. Additionally, we convey emotional nuances to the face rendering module. The guidance provided by both audio and visual cues remains independent of semantic or linguistic content, allowing our renderer to effectively handle zero-shot translation tasks for monolingual speakers in different languages. We empirically demonstrate that the inclusion of high-quality mel-spectrograms conditioned on facial information not only enhances the quality of the synthesized speech but also positively influences facial generation, leading to overall performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Learning for Music-to-Music-Video Description Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music-to-music-video generation is a challenging task due to the intrinsic differences between the music and video modalities. The advent of powerful text-to-video diffusion models has opened a promising pathway for music-video (MV) generation by first addressing the music-to-MV description task and subsequently leveraging these models for video generation. In this study, we focus on the MV description generation task and propose a comprehensive pipeline encompassing training data construction and multimodal model fine-tuning. We fine-tune existing pre-trained multimodal models on our newly constructed music-to-MV description dataset based on the Music4All dataset, which integrates both musical and visual information. Our experimental results demonstrate that music representations can be effectively mapped to textual domains, enabling the generation of meaningful MV description directly from music inputs. We also identify key components in the dataset construction pipeline that critically impact the quality of MV description and highlight specific musical attributes that warrant greater focus for improved MV description generation.</description>

      <title>MMS-LLaMA: Efficient LLM-based Audio-Visual Speech Recognition with Minimal Multimodal Speech Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) achieves robust speech recognition in noisy environments by combining auditory and visual information. However, recent Large Language Model (LLM) based AVSR systems incur high computational costs due to the high temporal resolution of audio-visual speech processed by LLMs. In this work, we introduce an efficient multimodal speech LLM framework that minimizes token length while preserving essential linguistic content. Our approach employs an early av-fusion module for streamlined feature integration, an audio-visual speech Q-Former that dynamically allocates tokens based on input duration, and a refined query allocation strategy with a speech rate predictor to adjust token allocation according to speaking speed of each audio sample. Extensive experiments on the LRS3 dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a WER of 0.74% while using only 3.5 tokens per second. Moreover, our approach not only reduces token usage by 86% compared to the previous multimodal speech LLM framework, but also improves computational efficiency by reducing FLOPs by 35.7%.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Few-Shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models in Two Stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An old-school recipe for training a classifier is to (i) learn a good feature extractor and (ii) optimize a linear layer atop. When only a handful of samples are available per category, as in Few-Shot Adaptation (FSA), data are insufficient to fit a large number of parameters, rendering the above impractical. This is especially true with large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which motivated successful research at the intersection of Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) and FSA. In this work, we start by analyzing the learning dynamics of PEFT techniques when trained on few-shot data from only a subset of categories, referred to as the ``base'' classes. We show that such dynamics naturally splits into two distinct phases: (i) task-level feature extraction and (ii) specialization to the available concepts. To accommodate this dynamic, we then depart from prompt- or adapter-based methods and tackle FSA differently. Specifically, given a fixed computational budget, we split it to (i) learn a task-specific feature extractor via PEFT and (ii) train a linear classifier on top. We call this scheme Two-Stage Few-Shot Adaptation (2SFS). Differently from established methods, our scheme enables a novel form of selective inference at a category level, i.e., at test time, only novel categories are embedded by the adapted text encoder, while embeddings of base categories are available within the classifier. Results with fixed hyperparameters across two settings, three backbones, and eleven datasets, show that 2SFS matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art, while established methods degrade significantly across settings.</description>

      <title>TreeMeshGPT: Artistic Mesh Generation with Autoregressive Tree Sequencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce TreeMeshGPT, an autoregressive Transformer designed to generate high-quality artistic meshes aligned with input point clouds. Instead of the conventional next-token prediction in autoregressive Transformer, we propose a novel Autoregressive Tree Sequencing where the next input token is retrieved from a dynamically growing tree structure that is built upon the triangle adjacency of faces within the mesh. Our sequencing enables the mesh to extend locally from the last generated triangular face at each step, and therefore reduces training difficulty and improves mesh quality. Our approach represents each triangular face with two tokens, achieving a compression rate of approximately 22% compared to the naive face tokenization. This efficient tokenization enables our model to generate highly detailed artistic meshes with strong point cloud conditioning, surpassing previous methods in both capacity and fidelity. Furthermore, our method generates mesh with strong normal orientation constraints, minimizing flipped normals commonly encountered in previous methods. Our experiments show that TreeMeshGPT enhances the mesh generation quality with refined details and normal orientation consistency.</description>

      <title>Quality Over Quantity? LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains challenging. We present Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA), which aligns audiovisual (AV) scene content beyond mere temporal synchronization via a Large Language Model (LLM)-based data curation pipeline. Specifically, AVVA scores and selects high-quality training clips using Whisper (speech-based audio foundation model) for audio and DINOv2 for video within a dual-encoder contrastive learning framework. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate that this approach can achieve significant accuracy gains with substantially less curated data. For instance, AVVA yields a 7.6% improvement in top-1 accuracy for audio-to-video retrieval on VGGSound compared to ImageBind, despite training on only 192 hours of carefully filtered data (vs. 5800+ hours). Moreover, an ablation study highlights that trading data quantity for data quality improves performance, yielding respective top-3 accuracy increases of 47.8, 48.4, and 58.0 percentage points on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound over uncurated baselines. While these results underscore AVVA's data efficiency, we also discuss the overhead of LLM-driven curation and how it may be scaled or approximated in larger domains. Overall, AVVA provides a viable path toward more robust, text-free audiovisual learning with improved retrieval accuracy.</description>

      <title>Hiding Local Manipulations on SAR Images: a Counter-Forensic Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vast accessibility of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images through online portals has propelled the research across various fields. This widespread use and easy availability have unfortunately made SAR data susceptible to malicious alterations, such as local editing applied to the images for inserting or covering the presence of sensitive targets. Vulnerability is further emphasized by the fact that most SAR products, despite their original complex nature, are often released as amplitude-only information, allowing even inexperienced attackers to edit and easily alter the pixel content. To contrast malicious manipulations, in the last years the forensic community has begun to dig into the SAR manipulation issue, proposing detectors that effectively localize the tampering traces in amplitude images. Nonetheless, in this paper we demonstrate that an expert practitioner can exploit the complex nature of SAR data to obscure any signs of manipulation within a locally altered amplitude image. We refer to this approach as a counter-forensic attack. To achieve the concealment of manipulation traces, the attacker can simulate a re-acquisition of the manipulated scene by the SAR system that initially generated the pristine image. In doing so, the attacker can obscure any evidence of manipulation, making it appear as if the image was legitimately produced by the system. This attack has unique features that make it both highly generalizable and relatively easy to apply. First, it is a black-box attack, meaning it is not designed to deceive a specific forensic detector. Furthermore, it does not require a training phase and is not based on adversarial operations. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed counter-forensic approach across diverse scenarios, examining various manipulation operations.</description>
