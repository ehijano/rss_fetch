      <title>OffRAMPS: An FPGA-based Intermediary for Analysis and Modification of Additive Manufacturing Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cybersecurity threats in Additive Manufacturing (AM) are an increasing concern as AM adoption continues to grow. AM is now being used for parts in the aerospace, transportation, and medical domains. Threat vectors which allow for part compromise are particularly concerning, as any failure in these domains would have life-threatening consequences. A major challenge to investigation of AM part-compromises comes from the difficulty in evaluating and benchmarking both identified threat vectors as well as methods for detecting adversarial actions. In this work, we introduce a generalized platform for systematic analysis of attacks against and defenses for 3D printers. Our "OFFRAMPS" platform is based on the open-source 3D printer control board "RAMPS." OFFRAMPS allows analysis, recording, and modification of all control signals and I/O for a 3D printer. We show the efficacy of OFFRAMPS by presenting a series of case studies based on several Trojans, including ones identified in the literature, and show that OFFRAMPS can both emulate and detect these attacks, i.e., it can both change and detect arbitrary changes to the g-code print commands.</description>

      <title>Armored Core of PKI: Remove Signing Keys for CA via Physically Unclonable Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The protection of CA's signing keys is one of the most crucial security concerns in PKI. However, these keys can still be exposed today by human errors or various carefully designed attacks. Traditional protections like TEE and HSM fail to eliminate this risk since they can be bypassed by skilled attackers. This dilemma motivates us to consider removing CA' signing keys and propose Armored Core, a PKI security extension applying the physically trusted binding provided by Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) for CA.
  CAs in Armored Core issue PUF-based X509v3 TLS certificates, where they use PUF instead of signing algorithms to generate endorsements for domain public keys. The new transparency logging mechanism, built upon CT, will record the PUF calling behaviors of CA, ensuring the monitoring of PUF usage. We provide a formal cryptographic proof of Armored Core's main functions. We also implement it on the real-world PKI codebase. The results show that the incorporation of Armored Core into original systems do not cause any extra overhead, but instead improves computing efficiency by &gt;4.9% and saves &gt;20% of certificate storage.</description>

      <title>Security Analysis of WiFi-based Sensing Systems: Threats from Perturbation Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning technologies are pivotal in enhancing the performance of WiFi-based wireless sensing systems. However, they are inherently vulnerable to adversarial perturbation attacks, and regrettably, there is lacking serious attention to this security issue within the WiFi sensing community. In this paper, we elaborate such an attack, called WiIntruder, distinguishing itself with universality, robustness, and stealthiness, which serves as a catalyst to assess the security of existing WiFi-based sensing systems. This attack encompasses the following salient features: (1) Maximizing transferability by differentiating user-state-specific feature spaces across sensing models, leading to a universally effective perturbation attack applicable to common applications; (2) Addressing perturbation signal distortion caused by device synchronization and wireless propagation when critical parameters are optimized through a heuristic particle swarm-driven perturbation generation algorithm; and (3) Enhancing attack pattern diversity and stealthiness through random switching of perturbation surrogates generated by a generative adversarial network. Extensive experimental results confirm the practical threats of perturbation attacks to common WiFi-based services, including user authentication and respiratory monitoring.</description>

      <title>PoisonedFL: Model Poisoning Attacks to Federated Learning via Multi-Round Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model poisoning attacks are critical security threats to Federated Learning (FL). Existing model poisoning attacks suffer from two key limitations: 1) they achieve suboptimal effectiveness when defenses are deployed, and/or 2) they require knowledge of the model updates or local training data on genuine clients. In this work, we make a key observation that their suboptimal effectiveness arises from only leveraging model-update consistency among malicious clients within individual training rounds, making the attack effect self-cancel across training rounds. In light of this observation, we propose PoisonedFL, which enforces multi-round consistency among the malicious clients' model updates while not requiring any knowledge about the genuine clients. Our empirical evaluation on five benchmark datasets shows that PoisonedFL breaks eight state-of-the-art defenses and outperforms seven existing model poisoning attacks. Moreover, we also explore new defenses that are tailored to PoisonedFL, but our results show that we can still adapt PoisonedFL to break them. Our study shows that FL systems are considerably less robust than previously thought, underlining the urgency for the development of new defense mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Automated Creation of Source Code Variants of a Cryptographic Hash Function Implementation Using Generative Pre-Trained Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT's) are a type of large language machine learning model that are unusually adept at producing novel, and coherent, natural language. In this study the ability of GPT models to generate novel and correct versions, and notably very insecure versions, of implementations of the cryptographic hash function SHA-1 is examined. The GPT models Llama-2-70b-chat-h, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1, and zephyr-7b-alpha are used. The GPT models are prompted to re-write each function using a modified version of the localGPT framework and langchain to provide word embedding context of the full source code and header files to the model, resulting in over 130,000 function re-write GPT output text blocks, approximately 40,000 of which were able to be parsed as C code and subsequently compiled. The generated code is analyzed for being compilable, correctness of the algorithm, memory leaks, compiler optimization stability, and character distance to the reference implementation. Remarkably, several generated function variants have a high implementation security risk of being correct for some test vectors, but incorrect for other test vectors. Additionally, many function implementations were not correct to the reference algorithm of SHA-1, but produced hashes that have some of the basic characteristics of hash functions. Many of the function re-writes contained serious flaws such as memory leaks, integer overflows, out of bounds accesses, use of uninitialised values, and compiler optimization instability. Compiler optimization settings and SHA-256 hash checksums of the compiled binaries are used to cluster implementations that are equivalent but may not have identical syntax - using this clustering over 100,000 novel and correct versions of the SHA-1 codebase were generated where each component C function of the reference implementation is different from the original code.</description>

      <title>Noise Variance Optimization in Differential Privacy: A Game-Theoretic Approach Through Per-Instance Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of differential privacy (DP) can quantitatively measure privacy loss by observing the changes in the distribution caused by the inclusion of individuals in the target dataset. The DP, which is generally used as a constraint, has been prominent in safeguarding datasets in machine learning in industry giants like Apple and Google. A common methodology for guaranteeing DP is incorporating appropriate noise into query outputs, thereby establishing statistical defense systems against privacy attacks such as membership inference and linkage attacks. However, especially for small datasets, existing DP mechanisms occasionally add excessive amount of noise to query output, thereby discarding data utility. This is because the traditional DP computes privacy loss based on the worst-case scenario, i.e., statistical outliers. In this work, to tackle this challenge, we utilize per-instance DP (pDP) as a constraint, measuring privacy loss for each data instance and optimizing noise tailored to individual instances. In a nutshell, we propose a per-instance noise variance optimization (NVO) game, framed as a common interest sequential game, and show that the Nash equilibrium (NE) points of it inherently guarantee pDP for all data instances. Through extensive experiments, our proposed pDP algorithm demonstrated an average performance improvement of up to 99.53% compared to the conventional DP algorithm in terms of KL divergence.</description>

      <title>Replacing Cryptopuzzles with Useful Computation in Blockchain Proof-of-Work Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains have emerged as a robust and effective consensus mechanism in open environments like the Internet, leading to widespread deployment with numerous cryptocurrency platforms and substantial investments. However, the current PoW implementation primarily focuses on validating the discovery of a winning nonce. Exploring the notion of replacing cryptographic puzzles with useful computing tasks becomes compelling, given the substantial computational capacity of blockchain networks and the global pursuit of a more sustainable IT infrastructure. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the prerequisites for alternative classes of tasks, examining proposed designs from existing literature in light of these requirements. We distill pertinent techniques and address gaps in the current state-of-the-art, providing valuable insights into the evolution of consensus mechanisms beyond traditional PoW.</description>

      <title>CLAD: Robust Audio Deepfake Detection Against Manipulation Attacks with Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of audio deepfakes poses significant security threats, necessitating robust detection methods. While existing detection systems exhibit promise, their robustness against malicious audio manipulations remains underexplored. To bridge the gap, we undertake the first comprehensive study of the susceptibility of the most widely adopted audio deepfake detectors to manipulation attacks. Surprisingly, even manipulations like volume control can significantly bypass detection without affecting human perception. To address this, we propose CLAD (Contrastive Learning-based Audio deepfake Detector) to enhance the robustness against manipulation attacks. The key idea is to incorporate contrastive learning to minimize the variations introduced by manipulations, therefore enhancing detection robustness. Additionally, we incorporate a length loss, aiming to improve the detection accuracy by clustering real audios more closely in the feature space. We comprehensively evaluated the most widely adopted audio deepfake detection models and our proposed CLAD against various manipulation attacks. The detection models exhibited vulnerabilities, with FAR rising to 36.69%, 31.23%, and 51.28% under volume control, fading, and noise injection, respectively. CLAD enhanced robustness, reducing the FAR to 0.81% under noise injection and consistently maintaining an FAR below 1.63% across all tests. Our source code and documentation are available in the artifact repository (https://github.com/CLAD23/CLAD).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covert channel networks are a well-known method for circumventing the security measures organizations put in place to protect their networks from adversarial attacks. This paper introduces a novel method based on bit-rate modulation for implementing covert channels between devices connected over a wide area network. This attack can be exploited to exfiltrate sensitive information from a machine (i.e., covert sender) and stealthily transfer it to a covert receiver while evading network security measures and detection systems. We explain how to implement this threat, focusing specifically on covert channel networks and their potential security risks to network information transmission. The proposed method leverages bit-rate modulation, where a high bit rate represents a '1' and a low bit rate represents a '0', enabling covert communication. We analyze the key metrics associated with covert channels, including robustness in the presence of legitimate traffic and other interference, bit-rate capacity, and bit error rate. Experiments demonstrate the good performance of this attack, which achieved 5 bps with excellent robustness and a channel capacity of up to 0.9239 bps/Hz under different noise sources. Therefore, we show that bit-rate modulation effectively violates network security and compromises sensitive data.</description>

      <title>Secure and Privacy-Preserving Authentication for Data Subject Rights Enforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of the GDPR, data controllers (DC) need to allow data subjects (DS) to exercise certain data subject rights. A key requirement here is that DCs can reliably authenticate a DS. Due to a lack of clear technical specifications, this has been realized in different ways, such as by requesting copies of ID documents or by email address verification. However, previous research has shown that this is associated with various security and privacy risks and that identifying DSs can be a non-trivial task. In this paper, we review different authentication schemes and propose an architecture that enables DCs to authenticate DSs with the help of independent Identity Providers in a secure and privacy-preserving manner by utilizing attribute-based credentials and eIDs. Our work contributes to a more standardized and privacy-preserving way of authenticating DSs, which will benefit both DCs and DSs.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Billing for Local Energy Markets (Long Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a privacy-preserving billing protocol for local energy markets (PBP-LEMs) that takes into account market participants' energy volume deviations from their bids. PBP-LEMs enables a group of market entities to jointly compute participants' bills in a decentralized and privacy-preserving manner without sacrificing correctness. It also mitigates risks on individuals' privacy arising from any potential internal collusion. We first propose a novel, efficient, and privacy-preserving individual billing scheme, achieving information-theoretic security, which serves as a building block. PBP-LEMs utilizes this scheme, along with other techniques such as multiparty computation, Pedersen commitments and inner product functional encryption, to ensure data confidentiality and accuracy. Additionally, we present three approaches, resulting in different levels of privacy and performance. We prove that the protocol meets its security and privacy requirements and is feasible for deployment in real LEMs. Our analysis also shows variations in overall performance and identifies areas where overhead is concentrated based on the applied approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of sixth-generation (6G) communication technology, global communication networks are moving towards the goal of comprehensive and seamless coverage. In particular, low earth orbit (LEO) satellites have become a critical component of satellite communication networks. The emergence of LEO satellites has brought about new computational resources known as the \textit{LEO satellite edge}, enabling ground users (GU) to offload computing tasks to the resource-rich LEO satellite edge. However, existing LEO satellite computational offloading solutions primarily focus on optimizing system performance, neglecting the potential issue of malicious satellite attacks during task offloading. In this paper, we propose the deployment of LEO satellite edge in an integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTN) structure to support \textit{security-sensitive computing task offloading}. We model the task allocation and offloading order problem as a joint optimization problem to minimize task offloading delay, energy consumption, and the number of attacks while satisfying reliability constraints. To achieve this objective, we model the task offloading process as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a security-sensitive task offloading strategy optimization algorithm based on proximal policy optimization (PPO). Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms other benchmark methods in terms of performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven deep learning (DL) techniques developed for automatic modulation classification (AMC) of wireless signals are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This poses a severe security threat to the DL-based wireless systems, specifically for edge applications of AMC. In this work, we address the joint problem of developing optimized DL models that are also robust against adversarial attacks. This enables efficient and reliable deployment of DL-based AMC on edge devices. We first propose two optimized models using knowledge distillation and network pruning, followed by a computationally efficient adversarial training process to improve the robustness. Experimental results on five white-box attacks show that the proposed optimized and adversarially trained models can achieve better robustness than the standard (unoptimized) model. The two optimized models also achieve higher accuracy on clean (unattacked) samples, which is essential for the reliability of DL-based solutions at edge applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a sample- and time-efficient differentially private algorithm for ordinary least squares, with error that depends linearly on the dimension and is independent of the condition number of $X^\top X$, where $X$ is the design matrix. All prior private algorithms for this task require either $d^{3/2}$ examples, error growing polynomially with the condition number, or exponential time. Our near-optimal accuracy guarantee holds for any dataset with bounded statistical leverage and bounded residuals. Technically, we build on the approach of Brown et al. (2023) for private mean estimation, adding scaled noise to a carefully designed stable nonprivate estimator of the empirical regression vector.</description>

      <title>VulEval: Towards Repository-Level Evaluation of Software Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL)-based methods have proven to be effective for software vulnerability detection, with a potential for substantial productivity enhancements for detecting vulnerabilities. Current methods mainly focus on detecting single functions (i.e., intra-procedural vulnerabilities), ignoring the more complex inter-procedural vulnerability detection scenarios in practice. For example, developers routinely engage with program analysis to detect vulnerabilities that span multiple functions within repositories. In addition, the widely-used benchmark datasets generally contain only intra-procedural vulnerabilities, leaving the assessment of inter-procedural vulnerability detection capabilities unexplored.
  To mitigate the issues, we propose a repository-level evaluation system, named \textbf{VulEval}, aiming at evaluating the detection performance of inter- and intra-procedural vulnerabilities simultaneously. Specifically, VulEval consists of three interconnected evaluation tasks: \textbf{(1) Function-Level Vulnerability Detection}, aiming at detecting intra-procedural vulnerability given a code snippet; \textbf{(2) Vulnerability-Related Dependency Prediction}, aiming at retrieving the most relevant dependencies from call graphs for providing developers with explanations about the vulnerabilities; and \textbf{(3) Repository-Level Vulnerability Detection}, aiming at detecting inter-procedural vulnerabilities by combining with the dependencies identified in the second task. VulEval also consists of a large-scale dataset, with a total of 4,196 CVE entries, 232,239 functions, and corresponding 4,699 repository-level source code in C/C++ programming languages. Our analysis highlights the current progress and future directions for software vulnerability detection.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning with Only Positive Labels by Exploring Label Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning aims to collaboratively learn a model by using the data from multiple users under privacy constraints. In this paper, we study the multi-label classification problem under the federated learning setting, where trivial solution and extremely poor performance may be obtained, especially when only positive data w.r.t. a single class label are provided for each client. This issue can be addressed by adding a specially designed regularizer on the server-side. Although effective sometimes, the label correlations are simply ignored and thus sub-optimal performance may be obtained. Besides, it is expensive and unsafe to exchange user's private embeddings between server and clients frequently, especially when training model in the contrastive way. To remedy these drawbacks, we propose a novel and generic method termed Federated Averaging by exploring Label Correlations (FedALC). Specifically, FedALC estimates the label correlations in the class embedding learning for different label pairs and utilizes it to improve the model training. To further improve the safety and also reduce the communication overhead, we propose a variant to learn fixed class embedding for each client, so that the server and clients only need to exchange class embeddings once. Extensive experiments on multiple popular datasets demonstrate that our FedALC can significantly outperform existing counterparts.</description>

      <title>MISLEAD: Manipulating Importance of Selected features for Learning Epsilon in Evasion Attack Deception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging vulnerabilities in machine learning (ML) models due to adversarial attacks raise concerns about their reliability. Specifically, evasion attacks manipulate models by introducing precise perturbations to input data, causing erroneous predictions. To address this, we propose a methodology combining SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for feature importance analysis with an innovative Optimal Epsilon technique for conducting evasion attacks. Our approach begins with SHAP-based analysis to understand model vulnerabilities, crucial for devising targeted evasion strategies. The Optimal Epsilon technique, employing a Binary Search algorithm, efficiently determines the minimum epsilon needed for successful evasion. Evaluation across diverse machine learning architectures demonstrates the technique's precision in generating adversarial samples, underscoring its efficacy in manipulating model outcomes. This study emphasizes the critical importance of continuous assessment and monitoring to identify and mitigate potential security risks in machine learning systems.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Vulnerability Detection: A Counterfactual Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vulnerability detection is crucial for ensuring the security and reliability of software systems. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a prominent code embedding approach for vulnerability detection, owing to their ability to capture the underlying semantic structure of source code. However, GNNs face significant challenges in explainability due to their inherently black-box nature. To this end, several factual reasoning-based explainers have been proposed. These explainers provide explanations for the predictions made by GNNs by analyzing the key features that contribute to the outcomes. We argue that these factual reasoning-based explanations cannot answer critical what-if questions: What would happen to the GNN's decision if we were to alter the code graph into alternative structures? Inspired by advancements of counterfactual reasoning in artificial intelligence, we propose CFExplainer, a novel counterfactual explainer for GNN-based vulnerability detection. Unlike factual reasoning-based explainers, CFExplainer seeks the minimal perturbation to the input code graph that leads to a change in the prediction, thereby addressing the what-if questions for vulnerability detection. We term this perturbation a counterfactual explanation, which can pinpoint the root causes of the detected vulnerability and furnish valuable insights for developers to undertake appropriate actions for fixing the vulnerability. Extensive experiments on four GNN-based vulnerability detection models demonstrate the effectiveness of CFExplainer over existing state-of-the-art factual reasoning-based explainers.</description>

      <title>A General Black-box Adversarial Attack on Graph-based Fake News Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based fake news detectors apply various methods to construct graphs, aiming to learn distinctive news embeddings for classification. Since the construction details are unknown for attackers in a black-box scenario, it is unrealistic to conduct the classical adversarial attacks that require a specific adjacency matrix. In this paper, we propose the first general black-box adversarial attack framework, i.e., General Attack via Fake Social Interaction (GAFSI), against detectors based on different graph structures. Specifically, as sharing is an important social interaction for GNN-based fake news detectors to construct the graph, we simulate sharing behaviors to fool the detectors. Firstly, we propose a fraudster selection module to select engaged users leveraging local and global information. In addition, a post injection module guides the selected users to create shared relations by sending posts. The sharing records will be added to the social context, leading to a general attack against different detectors. Experimental results on empirical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GAFSI.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Heterogeneous Causal Inference Beyond Meta-analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaboration between different data centers is often challenged by heterogeneity across sites. To account for the heterogeneity, the state-of-the-art method is to re-weight the covariate distributions in each site to match the distribution of the target population. Nevertheless, this method could easily fail when a certain site couldn't cover the entire population. Moreover, it still relies on the concept of traditional meta-analysis after adjusting for the distribution shift.
  In this work, we propose a collaborative inverse propensity score weighting estimator for causal inference with heterogeneous data. Instead of adjusting the distribution shift separately, we use weighted propensity score models to collaboratively adjust for the distribution shift. Our method shows significant improvements over the methods based on meta-analysis when heterogeneity increases. To account for the vulnerable density estimation, we further discuss the double machine method and show the possibility of using nonparametric density estimation with d&lt;8 and a flexible machine learning method to guarantee asymptotic normality. We propose a federated learning algorithm to collaboratively train the outcome model while preserving privacy. Using synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of our method.</description>

      <title>FEDSTR: Money-In AI-Out | A Decentralized Marketplace for Federated Learning and LLM Training on the NOSTR Protocol</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NOSTR is a communication protocol for the social web, based on the w3c websockets standard. Although it is still in its infancy, it is well known as a social media protocol, thousands of trusted users and multiple user interfaces, offering a unique experience and enormous capabilities. To name a few, the NOSTR applications include but are not limited to direct messaging, file sharing, audio/video streaming, collaborative writing, blogging and data processing through distributed AI directories. In this work, we propose an approach that builds upon the existing protocol structure with end goal a decentralized marketplace for federated learning and LLM training. In this proposed design there are two parties: on one side there are customers who provide a dataset that they want to use for training an AI model. On the other side, there are service providers, who receive (parts of) the dataset, train the AI model, and for a payment as an exchange, they return the optimized AI model. The decentralized and censorship resistant features of the NOSTR enable the possibility of designing a fair and open marketplace for training AI models and LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryptocurrencies have evolved into an important asset class, providing a variety of benefits. However, they also present significant risks, such as market volatility and the potential for misuse in illegal activities. These risks underline the urgent need for a comprehensive regulatory framework to ensure consumer protection, market integrity, and financial stability. Yet, the global landscape of cryptocurrency regulation remains complex, marked by substantial variations in regulatory frameworks among different countries. This paper aims to study these differences by investigating the regulatory landscapes across various jurisdictions. We first discuss regulatory challenges and considerations, and then conduct a comparative analysis of international regulatory stances, approaches, and measures. We hope our study offers practical insights to enhance the understanding of global trends in cryptocurrency regulation.</description>

Abstract: The cyber terrain contains devices, network services, cyber personas, and other network entities involved in network operations. Designing a method that automatically identifies key network entities to network operations is challenging. However, such a method is essential for determining which cyber assets should the cyber defense focus on. In this paper, we propose an approach for the classification of IP addresses belonging to cyber key terrain according to their network position using the PageRank centrality computation adjusted by machine learning. We used hill climbing and random walk algorithms to distinguish PageRank's damping factors based on source and destination ports captured in IP flows. The one-time learning phase on a static data sample allows near-real-time stream-based classification of key hosts from IP flow data in operational conditions without maintaining a complete network graph. We evaluated the approach on a dataset from a cyber defense exercise and on data from the campus network. The results show that cyber key terrain identification using the adjusted computation of centrality is more precise than its original version.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is a widely used driver assistance technology for maintaining the desired speed and safe distance to the leading vehicle. This paper evaluates the security of the deep neural network (DNN) based ACC systems under runtime stealthy perception attacks that strategically inject perturbations into camera data to cause forward collisions. We present a context-aware strategy for the selection of the most critical times for triggering the attacks and a novel optimization-based method for the adaptive generation of image perturbations at runtime. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed attack using an actual vehicle, a publicly available driving dataset, and a realistic simulation platform with the control software from a production ACC system, a physical-world driving simulator, and interventions by the human driver and safety features such as Advanced Emergency Braking System (AEBS). Experimental results show that the proposed attack achieves 142.9 times higher success rate in causing hazards and 89.6% higher evasion rate than baselines, while being stealthy and robust to real-world factors and dynamic changes in the environment. This study highlights the role of human drivers and basic safety mechanisms in preventing attacks.</description>

      <title>Abusing Processor Exception for General Binary Instrumentation on Bare-metal Embedded Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing the security of closed-source drivers and libraries in embedded systems holds significant importance, given their fundamental role in the supply chain. Unlike x86, embedded platforms lack comprehensive binary manipulating tools, making it difficult for researchers and developers to effectively detect and patch security issues in such closed-source components. Existing works either depend on full-fledged operating system features or suffer from tedious corner cases, restricting their application to bare-metal firmware prevalent in embedded environments. In this paper, we present PIFER (Practical Instrumenting Framework for Embedded fiRmware) that enables general and fine-grained static binary instrumentation for embedded bare-metal firmware. By abusing the built-in hardware exception-handling mechanism of the embedded processors, PIFER can perform instrumentation on arbitrary target addresses. Additionally, We propose an instruction translation-based scheme to guarantee the correct execution of the original firmware after patching. We evaluate PIFER against real-world, complex firmware, including Zephyr RTOS, CoreMark benchmark, and a close-sourced commercial product. The results indicate that PIFER correctly instrumented 98.9% of the instructions. Further, a comprehensive performance evaluation was conducted, demonstrating the practicality and efficiency of our work.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based image-generative models, the quality of generated images has become increasingly photorealistic. Moreover, with the release of high-quality pre-trained image-generative models, a growing number of users are downloading these pre-trained models to fine-tune them with downstream datasets for various image-generation tasks. However, employing such powerful pre-trained models in downstream tasks presents significant privacy leakage risks. In this paper, we propose the first reconstruction-based membership inference attack framework, tailored for recent diffusion models, and in the more stringent black-box access setting. Considering four distinct attack scenarios and three types of attacks, this framework is capable of targeting any popular conditional generator model, achieving high precision, evidenced by an impressive AUC of $0.95$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain generalization focuses on leveraging knowledge from multiple related domains with ample training data and labels to enhance inference on unseen in-distribution (IN) and out-of-distribution (OOD) domains. In our study, we introduce a two-phase representation learning technique using multi-task learning. This approach aims to cultivate a latent space from features spanning multiple domains, encompassing both native and cross-domains, to amplify generalization to IN and OOD territories. Additionally, we attempt to disentangle the latent space by minimizing the mutual information between the prior and latent space, effectively de-correlating spurious feature correlations. Collectively, the joint optimization will facilitate domain-invariant feature learning. We assess the model's efficacy across multiple cybersecurity datasets, using standard classification metrics on both unseen IN and OOD sets, and juxtapose the results with contemporary domain generalization methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptor signatures can be viewed as a generalized form of the standard digital signature schemes where a secret randomness is hidden within a signature. Adaptor signatures are a recent cryptographic primitive and are becoming an important tool for blockchain applications such as cryptocurrencies to reduce on-chain costs, improve fungibility, and contribute to off-chain forms of payment in payment-channel networks, payment-channel hubs, and atomic swaps. However, currently used adaptor signature constructions are vulnerable to quantum adversaries due to Shor's algorithm. In this work, we introduce $\mathsf{SQIAsignHD}$, a new quantum-resistant adaptor signature scheme based on isogenies of supersingular elliptic curves, using SQIsignHD - as the underlying signature scheme - and exploiting the idea of the artificial orientation on the supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, SIDH, as the underlying hard relation. We, furthermore, show that our scheme is secure in the Quantum Random Oracle Model (QROM).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present two novel methods in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The first approach, Scattering Transform with E-GraphSAGE (STEG), utilizes the scattering transform to conduct multi-resolution analysis of edge feature vectors. This provides a detailed representation that is essential for identifying subtle anomalies in network traffic. The second approach improves node representation by initiating with Node2Vec, diverging from standard methods of using uniform values, thereby capturing a more accurate and holistic network picture. Our methods have shown significant improvements in performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in benchmark NIDS datasets.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the challenges of ensuring security and privacy for users from diverse demographic backgrounds. We propose a threat modeling approach to identify potential risks and countermeasures for product inclusion in security and privacy. We discuss various factors that can affect a user's ability to achieve a high level of security and privacy, including low-income demographics, poor connectivity, shared device usage, ML fairness, etc. We present results from a global security and privacy user experience survey and discuss the implications for product developers. Our work highlights the need for a more inclusive approach to security and privacy and provides a framework for researchers and practitioners to consider when designing products and services for a diverse range of users.</description>

      <title>Leverage Variational Graph Representation For Model Poisoning on Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper puts forth a new training data-untethered model poisoning (MP) attack on federated learning (FL). The new MP attack extends an adversarial variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) to create malicious local models based solely on the benign local models overheard without any access to the training data of FL. Such an advancement leads to the VGAE-MP attack that is not only efficacious but also remains elusive to detection. VGAE-MP attack extracts graph structural correlations among the benign local models and the training data features, adversarially regenerates the graph structure, and generates malicious local models using the adversarial graph structure and benign models' features. Moreover, a new attacking algorithm is presented to train the malicious local models using VGAE and sub-gradient descent, while enabling an optimal selection of the benign local models for training the VGAE. Experiments demonstrate a gradual drop in FL accuracy under the proposed VGAE-MP attack and the ineffectiveness of existing defense mechanisms in detecting the attack, posing a severe threat to FL.</description>

      <title>Can LLM-Generated Misinformation Be Detected?</title>

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has made a transformative impact. However, the potential that LLMs such as ChatGPT can be exploited to generate misinformation has posed a serious concern to online safety and public trust. A fundamental research question is: will LLM-generated misinformation cause more harm than human-written misinformation? We propose to tackle this question from the perspective of detection difficulty. We first build a taxonomy of LLM-generated misinformation. Then we categorize and validate the potential real-world methods for generating misinformation with LLMs. Then, through extensive empirical investigation, we discover that LLM-generated misinformation can be harder to detect for humans and detectors compared to human-written misinformation with the same semantics, which suggests it can have more deceptive styles and potentially cause more harm. We also discuss the implications of our discovery on combating misinformation in the age of LLMs and the countermeasures.</description>

      <title>Talk Too Much: Poisoning Large Language Models under Token Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mainstream poisoning attacks on large language models (LLMs) typically set a fixed trigger in the input instance and specific responses for triggered queries. However, the fixed trigger setting (e.g., unusual words) may be easily detected by human detection, limiting the effectiveness and practicality in real-world scenarios. To enhance the stealthiness of the trigger, we present a poisoning attack against LLMs that is triggered by a generation/output condition-token limitation, which is a commonly adopted strategy by users for reducing costs. The poisoned model performs normally for output without token limitation, while becomes harmful for output with limited tokens. To achieve this objective, we introduce BrieFool, an efficient attack framework. It leverages the characteristics of generation limitation by efficient instruction sampling and poisoning data generation, thereby influencing the behavior of LLMs under target conditions. Our experiments demonstrate that BrieFool is effective across safety domains and knowledge domains. For instance, with only 20 generated poisoning examples against GPT-3.5-turbo, BrieFool achieves a 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a 9.28/10 average Harmfulness Score (HS) under token limitation conditions while maintaining the benign performance.</description>
