      <title>Hybrid Near-Far Field 6D Movable Antenna Design Exploiting Directional Sparsity and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) has been identified as a new disruptive technology for future wireless systems to support a large number of users with only a few antennas. However, the intricate relationships between the signal carrier wavelength and the transceiver region size lead to inaccuracies in traditional far-field 6DMA channel model, causing discrepancies between the model predictions and the hybrid-field channel characteristics in practical 6DMA systems, where users might be in the far-field region relative to the antennas on the same 6DMA surface, while simultaneously being in the near-field region relative to different 6DMA surfaces. Moreover, due to the high-dimensional channel and the coupled position and rotation constraints, the estimation of the 6DMA channel and the joint design of the 6DMA positions and rotations and the transmit beamforming at the base station (BS) incur extremely high computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose an efficient hybrid-field generalized 6DMA channel model, which accounts for planar-wave propagation within individual 6DMA surfaces and spherical-wave propagation among different 6DMA surfaces. Furthermore, by leveraging directional sparsity, we propose a low-overhead channel estimation algorithm that efficiently constructs a complete channel map for all potential antenna position-rotation pairs while limiting the training overhead incurred by antenna movement. In addition, we propose a low-complexity design leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which facilitates the joint design of the 6DMA positions, rotations, and beamforming in a unified manner. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid-field channel model and channel estimation algorithm outperform existing approaches and that the DRL-enhanced 6DMA system significantly surpasses flexible antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Code Rate Optimization via Neural Polar Decoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method to optimize communication code rates via the application of neural polar decoders (NPDs). Employing this approach enables simultaneous optimization of code rates over input distributions while providing a practical coding scheme within the framework of polar codes. The proposed approach is designed for scenarios where the channel model is unknown, treating the channel as a black box that produces output samples from input samples. We employ polar codes to achieve our objectives, using NPDs to estimate mutual information (MI) between the channel inputs and outputs, and optimize a parametric model of the input distribution. The methodology involves a two-phase process: a training phase and an inference phase. In the training phase, two steps are repeated interchangeably. First, the estimation step estimates the MI of the channel inputs and outputs via NPDs. Second, the improvement step optimizes the input distribution parameters to maximize the MI estimate obtained by the NPDs. In the inference phase, the optimized model is used to construct polar codes. This involves incorporating the Honda-Yamamoto (HY) scheme to accommodate the optimized input distributions and list decoding to enhance decoding performance. Experimental results on memoryless and finite-state channels (FSCs) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in cases where the channel's capacity-achieving input distribution is non-uniform. For these cases, we show significant improvements in MI and bit error rates (BERs) over those achieved by uniform and independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) input distributions, validating our method for block lengths up to 1024. This scalable approach has potential applications in real-world communication systems, bridging theoretical capacity estimation and practical coding performance.</description>

      <title>Link Priority Buffer-Aided Relay Selection with Energy Storage from Energy Harvest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel relay selection scheme for buffer-aided wireless networks with relays equipped with both data buffers and energy storage. While buffer-aided relay networks have demonstrated significantly improved performance, energy harvesting has become an attractive solution in many wireless systems, garnering considerable attention when applied to buffer-aided relay networks. It is known that state-dependent selection rules must be used to achieve full diversity order in buffer-aided relay networks, requiring link priorities for data transmission to be set based on system states. This task becomes challenging when both data buffers and energy storage are involved. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for setting link priorities, which forms the basis for a new selection rule. The outage probability of the proposed selection scheme is derived. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm which achieves full diversity in buffer-aided relay selection with energy storage, and consistently outperforms baseline approaches across various metrics.</description>

      <title>Information-computation trade-offs in non-linear transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the interplay between information and computation in non-linear transform-based compression for broad classes of modern information-processing tasks. We first investigate two emerging nonlinear data transformation frameworks for image compression: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and 2D Gaussian Splatting (GS). We analyze their representational properties, behavior under lossy compression, and convergence dynamics. Our results highlight key trade-offs between INR's compact, resolution-flexible neural field representations and GS's highly parallelizable, spatially interpretable fitting, providing insights for future hybrid and compression-aware frameworks. Next, we introduce the textual transform that enables efficient compression at ultra-low bitrate regimes and simultaneously enhances human perceptual satisfaction. When combined with the concept of denoising via lossy compression, the textual transform becomes a powerful tool for denoising tasks. Finally, we present a Lempel-Ziv (LZ78) "transform", a universal method that, when applied to any member of a broad compressor family, produces new compressors that retain the asymptotic universality guarantees of the LZ78 algorithm. Collectively, these three transforms illuminate the fundamental trade-offs between coding efficiency and computational cost. We discuss how these insights extend beyond compression to tasks such as classification, denoising, and generative AI, suggesting new pathways for using non-linear transformations to balance resource constraints and performance.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Learning of Probabilistic Constellation Shaping through Importance Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic constellation shaping enables easy rate adaption and has been proven to reduce the gap to Shannon capacity. Constellation point probabilities are optimized to maximize either the mutual information or the bit-wise mutual information. The optimization problem is however challenging even for simple channel models. While autoencoder-based machine learning has been applied successfully to solve this problem [1], it requires manual computation of additional terms for the gradient which is an error-prone task. In this work, we present novel loss functions for autoencoder-based learning of probabilistic constellation shaping for coded modulation systems using automatic differentiation and importance sampling. We show analytically that our proposed approach also uses exact gradients of the constellation point probabilities for the optimization. In simulations, our results closely match the results from [1] for the additive white Gaussian noise channel and a simplified model of the intensity-modulation direct-detection channel.</description>

      <title>All Kolmogorov complexity functions are optimal, but are some more optimal?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov (1965) defined the complexity of a string $x$ as the minimal length of a program generating $x$. Obviously this definition depends on the choice of the programming language. Kolmogorov noted that there exist \emph{optimal} programming languages that make the complexity function minimal up to $O(1)$ additive terms, and we should take one of them -- but which one?
  Is there a chance to agree on some specific programming language in this definition? Or at least should we add some other requirements to optimality? What can we achieve in this way?
  In this paper we discuss different suggestions of this type that appeared since 1965, specifically a stronger requirement of universality (and show that in many cases this does not change the set of complexity functions).</description>

      <title>Data Compression with Relative Entropy Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last few years, machine learning unlocked previously infeasible features for compression, such as providing guarantees for users' privacy or tailoring compression to specific data statistics (e.g., satellite images or audio recordings of animals) or users' audiovisual perception. This, in turn, has led to an explosion of theoretical investigations and insights that aim to develop new fundamental theories, methods and algorithms better suited for machine learning-based compressors.
  In this thesis, I contribute to this trend by investigating relative entropy coding, a mathematical framework that generalises classical source coding theory. Concretely, relative entropy coding deals with the efficient communication of uncertain or randomised information. One of its key advantages is that it extends compression methods to continuous spaces and can thus be integrated more seamlessly into modern machine learning pipelines than classical quantisation-based approaches. Furthermore, it is a natural foundation for developing advanced compression methods that are privacy-preserving or account for the perceptual quality of the reconstructed data.
  The thesis considers relative entropy coding at three conceptual levels: After introducing the basics of the framework, (1) I prove results that provide new, maximally tight fundamental limits to the communication and computational efficiency of relative entropy coding; (2) I use the theory of Poisson point processes to develop and analyse new relative entropy coding algorithms, whose performance attains the theoretic optima and (3) I showcase the strong practical performance of relative entropy coding by applying it to image, audio, video and protein data compression using small, energy-efficient, probabilistic neural networks called Bayesian implicit neural representations.</description>

      <title>Covert Communication over Physically-Degraded Alarm Two-Way Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study covert communications over binary-input discrete memoryless alarm two-way channels, in which two users interact through a two-way channel and attempt to hide the presence of their communication from an eavesdropping receiver. The alarm two-way channel is one in which simultaneous transmissions by both users trigger an alarm at the eavesdropper, which captures the challenges and opportunities of cooperation beyond interference management. In particular, by characterizing the covert capacity region of two-way channels when using public time sharing, we show how cooperation strictly improves achievable covert communication throughputs. While our analysis falls short of characterizing the two-way covert capacity region for all two-way channels, we provide general achievable and converse bounds that illuminate the cooperation mechanisms that benefit covertness and are tight for a physically-degraded alarm two-way channels. Because of the unique nature of covert communications, our analysis also shows that the coordination required to avoid triggering alarms comes asymptotically "for free". The key technical challenge that we address is how to appropriately design auxiliary random variables in a multi-user covert communication setting subject to the square root law.</description>

      <title>Maximal Achievable Service Rates of Codes and Connections to Combinatorial Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the service-rate region (SRR) of distributed storage systems that employ linear codes. We focus on systems where each server stores one code symbol, and a user recovers a data symbol by accessing any of its recovery groups, subject to per-server capacity limits. The SRR--the convex polytope of simultaneously achievable request rates--captures system throughput and scalability. We first derive upper and lower bounds on the maximum request rate of each data object. These bounds hold for all linear codes and depend only on the number of parity checks orthogonal to a particular set of codeword coordinates associated with that object, i.e., the equations used in majority-logic decoding, and on code parameters. We then check the bound saturation for 1) all non-systematic codes whose SRRs are already known and 2) systematic codes. For the former, we prove the bounds are tight. For systematic codes, we show that the upper bound is achieved whenever the supports of minimum-weight dual codewords form a 2-design. As an application, we determine the exact per-object demand limits for binary Hamming codes. Our framework provides a new lens to address the SRR problem through combinatorial design theory.</description>

      <title>Neural Polar Decoders for DNA Data Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization errors, such as insertions and deletions, present a fundamental challenge in DNA-based data storage systems, arising from both synthesis and sequencing noise. These channels are often modeled as insertion-deletion-substitution (IDS) channels, for which designing maximum-likelihood decoders is computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach based on neural polar decoders (NPDs) to design low-complexity decoders for channels with synchronization errors. The proposed architecture enables decoding over IDS channels with reduced complexity $O(AN log N )$, where $A$ is a tunable parameter independent of the channel. NPDs require only sample access to the channel and can be trained without an explicit channel model. Additionally, NPDs provide mutual information (MI) estimates that can be used to optimize input distributions and code design. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NPDs on both synthetic deletion and IDS channels. For deletion channels, we show that NPDs achieve near-optimal decoding performance and accurate MI estimation, with significantly lower complexity than trellis-based decoders. We also provide numerical estimates of the channel capacity for the deletion channel. We extend our evaluation to realistic DNA storage settings, including channels with multiple noisy reads and real-world Nanopore sequencing data. Our results show that NPDs match or surpass the performance of existing methods while using significantly fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art. These findings highlight the promise of NPDs for robust and efficient decoding in DNA data storage systems.</description>

      <title>Codeword-Segmentation Rate-Splitting Multiple Access and Evaluation under Suboptimal Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has been recognized as a promising multiple access technique. We propose a novel architecture for downlink RSMA, namely Codeword-Segmentation RSMA (CS-RSMA). Different from conventional RSMA which splits users' messages into common and private parts before encoding, CS-RSMA encodes the users' messages directly, segments the codewords into common and private parts, and transmits the codeword segments using common and private streams. In addition to the principle of CS-RSMA, a novel performance analysis framework is proposed. This framework utilizes a recent discovery in mismatched decoding under finite-alphabet input and interference, and can better capture the receiver's complexity limits. Precoder optimization under finite alphabets and suboptimal decoders for conventional RSMA and CS-RSMA to maximize the Sum-Rate (SR) and the Max-Min Fairness (MMF) is also addressed. The numerical results reveal the theoretical performance of conventional RSMA and CS-RSMA. We observe that CS-RSMA leads to better performance than conventional RSMA in SR, and similar performance in MMF. Furthermore, a physical-layer implementation of CS-RSMA is proposed and evaluated through link-level simulations. Aside performance benefits, we also demonstrate that CS-RSMA brings significant benefits on the encoding/decoding, control signaling, and retransmission process compared to conventional RSMA.</description>

      <title>The Optimality of a Nested Generalized Pairwise Group Testing Procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of identifying defective units in a finite population of \( n \) units, where each unit \( i \) is independently defective with known probability \( p_i \). This setting is referred to as the \emph{Generalized Group Testing Problem}. A testing procedure is called optimal if it minimizes the expected number of tests. It has been conjectured that, when all probabilities \( p_i \) lie within the interval \( \left[1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\, \frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right] \), the \emph{generalized pairwise testing {algorithm}}, applied to the \( p_i \) arranged in nondecreasing order, constitutes the optimal nested testing strategy among all such order-preserving nested strategies. In this work, we confirm this conjecture and establish the optimality of the procedure within the specified regime. Additionally, we provide a complete structural characterization of the procedure and derive a closed-form expression for its expected number of tests. These results offer new insights into the theory of optimal nested strategies in generalized group testing.</description>

      <title>Competing Bandits in Matching Markets via Super Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bandit learning in matching markets with two-sided reward uncertainty, extending prior research primarily focused on single-sided uncertainty. Leveraging the concept of `super-stability' from Irving (1994), we demonstrate the advantage of the Extended Gale-Shapley (GS) algorithm over the standard GS algorithm in achieving true stable matchings under incomplete information. By employing the Extended GS algorithm, our centralized algorithm attains a logarithmic pessimal stable regret dependent on an instance-dependent admissible gap parameter. This algorithm is further adapted to a decentralized setting with a constant regret increase. Finally, we establish a novel centralized instance-dependent lower bound for binary stable regret, elucidating the roles of the admissible gap and super-stable matching in characterizing the complexity of stable matching with bandit feedback.</description>

      <title>SEP-GCN: Leveraging Similar Edge Pairs with Temporal and Spatial Contexts for Location-Based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems play a crucial role in enabling personalized content delivery amidst the challenges of information overload and human mobility. Although conventional methods often rely on interaction matrices or graph-based retrieval, recent approaches have sought to exploit contextual signals such as time and location. However, most existing models focus on node-level representation or isolated edge attributes, underutilizing the relational structure between interactions. We propose SEP-GCN, a novel graph-based recommendation framework that learns from pairs of contextually similar interaction edges, each representing a user-item check-in event. By identifying edge pairs that occur within similar temporal windows or geographic proximity, SEP-GCN augments the user-item graph with contextual similarity links. These links bridge distant but semantically related interactions, enabling improved long-range information propagation. The enriched graph is processed via an edge-aware convolutional mechanism that integrates contextual similarity into the message-passing process. This allows SEP-GCN to model user preferences more accurately and robustly, especially in sparse or dynamic environments. Experiments on benchmark data sets show that SEP-GCN consistently outperforms strong baselines in both predictive accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <title>Graph-Cover-based Characterization of the Bethe Partition Function of Double-Edge Factor Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For standard factor graphs (S-FGs) with non-negative real-valued local functions, Vontobel provided a combinatorial characterization of the Bethe approximation of the partition function, also known as the Bethe partition function, using finite graph covers. The proof of this characterization, i.e., the graph-cover theorem for S-FGs, heavily relied on the method of types.
  In this paper, we study double-edge factor graphs (DE-FGs), a class of factor graphs where each local function takes complex values and satisfies some positive semi-definiteness constraints. DE-FGs and their partition functions are particularly relevant for quantum information processing. Approximating the partition function of a DE-FG is more difficult than for an S-FG, as it involves summing complex values instead of non-negative real values. We develop the sum-product algorithm (SPA) fixed-point-based Bethe approximation of the partition function. However, one cannot directly apply the method of types to prove a similar combinatorial characterization as in the case of S-FGs.
  We provide a combinatorial characterization of the Bethe partition function in terms of finite graph covers for a class of DE-FGs that satisfy a specific, easily checkable condition. Towards proving this characterization, we apply a suitable loop-calculus transform (LCT) to these graphs. Originally, the LCT was introduced by Chertkov and Chernyak as a special linear transform for S-FGs and later extended by Mori. Our proposed LCT is applicable for both DE-FGs and S-FGs and generalizes prior versions by handling zero-valued SPA fixed-point message components, which are common in DE-FGs.
  Supported by numerical results, we conjecture that this combinatorial characterization of the Bethe partition function in terms of finite graph covers holds more broadly for DE-FGs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Online Bookmaking for Any Number of Outcomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Online Bookmaking problem, where a bookmaker dynamically updates betting odds on the possible outcomes of an event. In each betting round, the bookmaker can adjust the odds based on the cumulative betting behavior of gamblers, aiming to maximize profit while mitigating potential loss. We show that for any event and any number of betting rounds, in a worst-case setting over all possible gamblers and outcome realizations, the bookmaker's optimal loss is the largest root of a simple polynomial. Our solution shows that bookmakers can be as fair as desired while avoiding financial risk, and the explicit characterization reveals an intriguing relation between the bookmaker's regret and Hermite polynomials. We develop an efficient algorithm that computes the optimal bookmaking strategy: when facing an optimal gambler, the algorithm achieves the optimal loss, and in rounds where the gambler is suboptimal, it reduces the achieved loss to the optimal opportunistic loss, a notion that is related to subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. The key technical contribution to achieve these results is an explicit characterization of the Bellman-Pareto frontier, which unifies the dynamic programming updates for Bellman's value function with the multi-criteria optimization framework of the Pareto frontier in the context of vector repeated games.</description>

      <title>A Generic Construction of $q$-ary Near-MDS Codes Supporting 2-Designs with Lengths Beyond $q+1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A linear code with parameters $[n, k, n - k + 1]$ is called maximum distance separable (MDS), and one with parameters $[n, k, n - k]$ is called almost MDS (AMDS). A code is near-MDS (NMDS) if both it and its dual are AMDS. NMDS codes supporting combinatorial $t$-designs have attracted growing interest, yet constructing such codes remains highly challenging. In 2020, Ding and Tang initiated the study of NMDS codes supporting 2-designs by constructing the first infinite family, followed by several other constructions for $t &gt; 2$, all with length at most $q + 1$. Although NMDS codes can, in principle, exceed this length, known examples supporting 2-designs and having length greater than $q + 1$ are extremely rare and limited to a few sporadic binary and ternary cases. In this paper, we present the first \emph{generic construction} of $q$-ary NMDS codes supporting 2-designs with lengths \emph{exceeding $q + 1$}. Our method leverages new connections between elliptic curve codes, finite abelian groups, subset sums, and combinatorial designs, resulting in an infinite family of such codes along with their weight distributions.</description>

      <title>Empowering Near-Field Communications in Low-Altitude Economy with LLM: Fundamentals, Potentials, Solutions, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is gaining significant attention from academia and industry. Fortunately, LAE naturally aligns with near-field communications in extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems. By leveraging near-field beamfocusing, LAE can precisely direct beam energy to unmanned aerial vehicles, while the additional distance dimension boosts overall spectrum efficiency. However, near-field communications in LAE still face several challenges, such as the increase in signal processing complexity and the necessity of distinguishing between far and near-field users. Inspired by the large language models (LLM) with powerful ability to handle complex problems, we apply LLM to solve challenges of near-field communications in LAE. The objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive analysis and discussion on LLM-empowered near-field communications in LAE. Specifically, we first introduce fundamentals of LLM and near-field communications, including the key advantages of LLM and key characteristics of near-field communications. Then, we reveal the opportunities and challenges of near-field communications in LAE. To address these challenges, we present a LLM-based scheme for near-field communications in LAE, and provide a case study which jointly distinguishes far and near-field users and designs multi-user precoding matrix. Finally, we outline and highlight several future research directions and open issues.</description>

      <title>Searching for a Hidden Markov Anomaly over Multiple Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of detecting an anomalous process among a large number of processes. At each time t, normal processes are in state zero (normal state), while the abnormal process may be in either state zero (normal state) or state one (abnormal state), with the states being hidden. The transition between states for the abnormal process is governed by a Markov chain over time. At each time step, observations can be drawn from a selected subset of processes. Each probed process generates an observation depending on its hidden state, either a typical distribution under state zero or an abnormal distribution under state one. The objective is to design a sequential search strategy that minimizes the expected detection time, subject to an error probability constraint. In contrast to prior works that assume i.i.d. observations, we address a new setting where anomalies evolve according to a hidden Markov model. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm, dubbed Anomaly Detection under Hidden Markov model (ADHM), which dynamically adapts the probing strategy based on accumulated statistical evidence and predictive belief updates over hidden states. ADHM effectively leverages temporal correlations to focus sensing resources on the most informative processes. The algorithm is supported by an asymptotic theoretical foundation, grounded in an oracle analysis that characterizes the fundamental limits of detection under the assumption of a known distribution of the hidden states. In addition, the algorithm demonstrates strong empirical performance, consistently outperforming existing methods in extensive simulations.</description>

      <title>On The Decoding Error Weight of One or Two Deletion Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper tackles two problems that fall under the study of coding for insertions and deletions. These problems are motivated by several applications, among them is reconstructing strands in DNA-based storage systems. Under this paradigm, a word is transmitted over some fixed number of identical independent channels and the goal of the decoder is to output the transmitted word or some close approximation of it. The first part of the paper studies optimal decoding for a special case of the deletion channel, referred by the $k$-deletion channel, which deletes exactly $k$ symbols of the transmitted word uniformly at random. In this part, the goal is to understand how an optimal decoder operates in order to minimize the expected normalized distance. A full characterization of an efficient optimal decoder for this setup, referred to as the maximum likelihood* (ML*) decoder, is given for a channel that deletes one or two symbols. The second part of this paper studies the deletion channel that deletes a symbol with some fixed probability $p$, while focusing on two instances of this channel. Since operating the maximum likelihood (ML) decoder, in this case, is computationally unfeasible, we study a slightly degraded version of this decoder for two channels and study its expected normalized distance. We observe that the dominant error patterns are deletions in the same run or errors resulting from alternating sequences. Based on these observations, we derive lower bounds on the expected normalized distance of the degraded ML decoder for any transmitted $q$-ary sequence of length $n$ and any deletion probability $p$. We further show that as the word length approaches infinity and the channel's deletion probability $p$ approaches zero, these bounds converge to approximately $\frac{3q - 1}{q - 1} p^2$. These theoretical results are verified by corresponding simulations.</description>

      <title>Weakly Private Information Retrieval from Heterogeneously Trusted Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of weakly private information retrieval (PIR) when there is heterogeneity in servers' trustworthiness under the maximal leakage (Max-L) metric and mutual information (MI) metric. A user wishes to retrieve a desired message from N non-colluding servers efficiently, such that the identity of the desired message is not leaked in a significant manner; however, some servers can be more trustworthy than others. We propose a code construction for this setting and optimize the probability distribution for this construction. For the Max-L metric, it is shown that the optimal probability allocation for the proposed scheme essentially separates the delivery patterns into two parts: a completely private part that has the same download overhead as the capacity-achieving PIR code, and a non-private part that allows complete privacy leakage but has no download overhead by downloading only from the most trustful server. The optimal solution is established through a sophisticated analysis of the underlying convex optimization problem and a reduction between the homogeneous setting and the heterogeneous setting. For the MI metric, the homogeneous case is studied first for which the code can be optimized with an explicit probability assignment, while a closed-form solution becomes intractable for the heterogeneous case. Numerical results are provided for both cases to corroborate the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Boosting Ordered Statistics Decoding of Short LDPC Codes with Simple Neural Network Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14165v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ordered statistics decoding has been instrumental in addressing decoding failures that persist after normalized min-sum decoding in short low-density parity-check codes. Despite its benefits, the high computational complexity of effective ordered statistics decoding has limited its application in complexity-sensitive scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel variant of the ordered statistics decoder. This approach begins with the design of a neural network model that refines the measurement of codeword bits, utilizing iterative information from normalized min-sum decoding failures. Subsequently, a fixed decoding path is established, comprising a sequence of blocks, each featuring a variety of test error patterns. The introduction of a sliding window-assisted neural model facilitates early termination of the ordered statistics decoding process along this path, aiming to balance performance and computational complexity. Comprehensive simulations and complexity analyses demonstrate that the proposed hybrid method matches state-of-the-art approaches across various metrics, particularly excelling in reducing latency.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Age of Information in Internet of Vehicles Over Error-Prone Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), Age of Information (AoI) has become a vital performance metric for evaluating the freshness of information in communication systems. Although many studies aim to minimize the average AoI of the system through optimized resource scheduling schemes, they often fail to adequately consider the queue characteristics. Moreover, the vehicle mobility leads to rapid changes in network topology and channel conditions, making it difficult to accurately reflect the unique characteristics of vehicles with the calculated AoI under ideal channel conditions. This paper examines the impact of Doppler shifts caused by vehicle speeds on data transmission in error-prone channels. Based on the M/M/1 and D/M/1 queuing theory models, we derive expressions for the Age of Information and optimize the system's average AoI by adjusting the data extraction rates of vehicles (which affect system utilization). We propose an online optimization algorithm that dynamically adjusts the vehicles' data extraction rates based on environmental changes to ensure optimal AoI. Simulation results have demonstrated that adjusting the data extraction rates of vehicles can significantly reduce the system's AoI. Additionally, in the network scenario of this work, the AoI of the D/M/1 system is lower than that of the M/M/1 system.</description>

      <title>Effective Application of Normalized Min-Sum Decoding for Short BCH Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20828v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an enhanced normalized min-sum decoder designed to address the performance and complexity challenges associated with developing parallelizable decoders for short BCH codes in high-throughput applications. The decoder optimizes the standard parity-check matrix using heuristic binary summation and random cyclic row shifts, resulting in a Tanner graph with low density, controlled redundancy, and minimized length-4 cycles. The impact of row redundancy and rank deficiency in the dual code's minimum-weight codewords on decoding performance is analyzed. To improve convergence, three random automorphisms are applied simultaneously to the inputs, with the resulting messages merged at the end of each iteration. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, for BCH codes with block lengths of 63 and 127, the enhanced normalized min-sum decoder achieves a 1-2 dB performance gain and 100X faster convergence compared to existing parallel and iterative decoders. Additionally, a hybrid decoding scheme is proposed, which selectively activates order statistics decoding when the enhanced normalized min-sum decoder fails. This hybrid approach is shown to approach maximum-likelihood performance while retaining the advantages of the normalized min-sum decoder across a broad SNR range.</description>

Abstract: When users make personal privacy choices, correlation between their data can cause inadvertent leakage about users who do not want to share their data by other users sharing their data. As a solution, we consider local redaction mechanisms. As prior works proposed data-independent privatization mechanisms, we study the family of data-independent local redaction mechanisms and upper-bound their utility when data correlation is modeled by a stationary Markov process. In contrast, we derive a novel data-dependent mechanism, which improves the utility by leveraging a data-dependent leakage measure.</description>

      <title>Online Neural Model Fine-Tuning in Massive MIMO CSI Feedback: Taming The Communication Cost of Model Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient channel state information (CSI) compression is essential in frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems due to the significant feedback overhead. Recently, deep learning-based compression techniques have demonstrated superior performance across various data types, including CSI. However, these methods often suffer from performance degradation when the data distribution shifts, primarily due to limited generalization capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose an online model fine-tuning approach for CSI feedback in massive MIMO systems. We consider full-model fine-tuning, where both the encoder and decoder are jointly updated using recent CSI samples. A key challenge in this setup is the transmission of updated decoder parameters, which introduces additional feedback overhead. To mitigate this bottleneck, we incorporate the bit-rate of model updates into the fine-tuning objective and entropy code the updates jointly with the compressed CSI. To reduce the bit-rate, we design an efficient prior distribution that encourages the network to update only the most significant weights, thereby minimizing the overall model update cost. Our results show that full-model fine-tuning significantly enhances the rate-distortion (RD) performance of neural CSI compression despite the additional communication cost of model updates. Moreover, we investigate the impact of update frequency in dynamic wireless environments and identify an optimal fine-tuning interval that achieves the best RD trade-off.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $(t, n)$-threshold secret sharing, a secret $S$ is distributed among $n$ participants such that any subset of size $t$ can recover $S$, while any subset of size $t-1$ or fewer learns nothing about it. For information-theoretic secret sharing, it is known that the share size must be at least as large as the secret, i.e., $|S|$. When computational security is employed using cryptographic encryption with a secret key $K$, previous work has shown that the share size can be reduced to $\tfrac{|S|}{t} + |K|$.
  In this paper, we present a construction achieving a share size of $\tfrac{|S| + |K|}{t}$. Furthermore, we prove that, under reasonable assumptions on the encryption scheme -- namely, the non-compressibility of pseudorandom encryption and the non-redundancy of the secret key -- this share size is optimal.</description>

      <title>Benford's Law from Turing Ensembles and Integer Partitions</title>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the information-theoretic and mathematical foundations of Benford's law, an important case of a statistical relationship that appears to constrain the information-theoretic behavior of numbers. In the present analysis we seek to deduce a general cause for Benford-like distributions to arise. We posit that they both follow from optimality and renormalization as applied to information-theoretical functionals. We also perform computational experiments that corroborate our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Receivers for Multi-Band Communications and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Harnessing multi-level electron transitions, Rydberg Atomic REceivers (RAREs) can detect wireless signals across a wide range of frequency bands, from Megahertz to Terahertz, enabling multi-band communications and sensing (CommunSense). Current research on multi-band RAREs primarily focuses on experimental demonstrations, lacking a tractable model to mathematically characterize their mechanisms. This issue leaves the multi-band RARE as a black box, posing challenges in its practical CommunSense applications. To fill in this gap, this paper investigates the underlying mechanism of multi-band RAREs and explores their optimal performance. For the first time, the closed-form expression of the transfer function of a multi-band RARE is derived by solving the quantum response of Rydberg atoms excited by multi-band signals. The function reveals that a multi-band RARE simultaneously serves as both a multi-band atomic mixer for down-converting multi-band signals and a multi-band atomic amplifier that reflects its sensitivity to each band. Further analysis of the atomic amplifier unveils that the gain factor at each frequency band can be decoupled into a global gain term and a Rabi attention term. The former determines the overall sensitivity of a RARE to all frequency bands of wireless signals. The latter influences the allocation of the overall sensitivity to each frequency band, representing a unique attention mechanism of multi-band RAREs. The optimal design of the global gain is provided to maximize the overall sensitivity of multi-band RAREs. Subsequently, the optimal Rabi attentions are also derived to maximize the practical multi-band CommunSense performance. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the derived transfer function and the superiority of multi-band RAREs.</description>

      <title>Golden Partition Zone: Rethinking Neural Network Partitioning Under Inversion Threats in Collaborative Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In collaborative inference, intermediate features transmitted from edge devices can be exploited by adversaries to reconstruct original inputs via model inversion attacks (MIA). While existing defenses focus on shallow layer protection, they often incur significant utility loss. A key open question is how to partition the edge cloud model to maximize resistance to MIA while minimizing accuracy degradation. We firest overturn the common belief that increasing model depth can resist MIA. Through theoretical analysis, we show that representational transitions in neural networks cause sharp changes in conditional entropy $H(x\mid z)$, intra class mean squared radius ($R_c^2$) and feature dimensionality being critical factors. Experiments on three representative deep vision models show that partitioning at the representational transition or decision level layers yields over 4 times higher mean square error compared to shallow splits, indicating significantly stronger resistance to MIA. Positive label smoothing further enhances robustness by compressing $R_c^2$ and improving generalization. We also validate the resilience of decision level features under feature and inversion model enhancements, and observe that auxiliary data types influence both transition boundaries and reconstruction behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe properties of the characteristic polynomial of a weighted lattice and show that it has a recursive description, which we use to obtain results on the critical exponent of $q$-polymatroids. We give a Critical Theorem for representable $q$-polymatroids and we provide a lower bound on the critical exponent. We show that $q$-polymatroids arising from certain families of rank-metric codes attain this lower bound.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically good CSS-T codes and a new construction of triorthogonal codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new systematic construction of CSS-T codes from any given CSS code using a map $\phi$. When $\phi$ is the identity map $I$, we retrieve the construction of [1] and use it to prove the existence of asymptotically good binary CSS-T codes, resolving a previously open problem in the literature, and of asymptotically good quantum LDPC CSS-T codes. We analyze the structure of the logical operators corresponding to certain non-Clifford gates supported by the quantum codes obtained from this construction ($\phi = I$), concluding that they always result in the logical identity. An immediate application of these codes in dealing with coherent noise is discussed. We then develop a new doubling transformation for obtaining triorthogonal codes, which generalizes the doubling construction presented in [2]. Our approach permits using self-orthogonal codes, instead of only doubly-even codes, as building blocks for triorthogonal codes. This broadens the range of codes available for magic state distillation.</description>

      <title>Extendible quantum measurements and limitations on classical communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unextendibility of quantum states and channels is inextricably linked to the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics, it has played an important role in understanding and quantifying entanglement, and more recently it has found applications in providing limitations on quantum error correction and entanglement distillation. Here we generalize the framework of unextendibility to quantum measurements and define $k$-extendible measurements for every integer $k\ge 2$. Our definition provides a hierarchy of semidefinite constraints that specify a set of measurements containing every measurement that can be realized by local operations and one-way classical communication. Furthermore, the set of $k$-extendible measurements converges to the set of measurements that can be realized by local operations and one-way classical communication as $k\to \infty$. To illustrate the utility of $k$-extendible measurements, we establish a semidefinite programming upper bound on the one-shot classical capacity of a channel, which outperforms the best known efficiently computable bound from [Matthews and Wehner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 60, pp. 7317-7329 (2014)] and also leads to efficiently computable upper bounds on the $n$-shot classical capacity of a channel.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Multi-Target DOA Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing technologies have experienced rapid progresses since entering the `second quantum revolution'. Among various candidates, schemes relying on Rydberg atoms exhibit compelling advantages for detecting radio frequency signals. Based on this, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution to classical wireless communication and sensing. To harness the advantages and exploit the potential of RAQRs in wireless sensing, we investigate the realization of the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation by RAQRs. Specifically, we first conceive a Rydberg atomic quantum uniform linear array (RAQ-ULA) aided wireless receiver for multi-target DOA detection and propose the corresponding signal model of this sensing system. Our model reveals that the presence of the radio-frequency local oscillator in the RAQ-ULA creates sensor gain mismatches, which degrade the DOA estimation significantly by employing the classical Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT). To solve this sensor gain mismatch problem, we propose the Rydberg atomic quantum ESPRIT (RAQ-ESPRIT) relying on our model. Lastly, we characterize our scheme through numerical simulations, where the results exhibit that it is capable of reducing the estimation error of its classical counterpart on the order of $&gt; 400$-fold and $&gt; 9000$-fold in the PSL and SQL, respectively.</description>

      <title>A new measure of dependence: Integrated $R^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new measure of dependence that quantifies the degree to which a random variable $Y$ depends on a random vector $X$. This measure is zero if and only if $Y$ and $X$ are independent, and equals one if and only if $Y$ is a measurable function of $X$. We introduce a simple and interpretable estimator that is comparable in ease of computation to classical correlation coefficients such as Pearson's, Spearman's, or Chatterjee's. Building on this coefficient, we develop a model-free variable selection algorithm, feature ordering by dependence (FORD), inspired by FOCI. FORD requires no tuning parameters and is provably consistent under suitable sparsity assumptions. We demonstrate its effectiveness and improvements over FOCI through experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>The maximum-average subtensor problem: equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the Maximum-Average Subtensor ($p$-MAS) problem, in which one wants to find a subtensor of size $k$ of a given random tensor of size $N$, both of order $p$, with maximum sum of entries. We are motivated by recent work on the matrix case of the problem in which several equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties have been characterized analytically in the asymptotic regime $1 \ll k \ll N$, and a puzzling phenomenon was observed involving the coexistence of a clustered equilibrium phase and an efficient algorithm which produces submatrices in this phase. Here we extend previous results on equilibrium and algorithmic properties for the matrix case to the tensor case. We show that the tensor case has a similar equilibrium phase diagram as the matrix case, and an overall similar phenomenology for the considered algorithms. Additionally, we consider out-of-equilibrium landscape properties using Overlap Gap Properties and Franz-Parisi analysis, and discuss the implications or lack-thereof for average-case algorithmic hardness.</description>
