      <title>Physics Faculty and Empathy in Academic Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to emotionally or intellectually understand another person's thoughts and feelings-empathy-can foster critical connections that facilitate learning and collaboration. We present a case study of physics faculty that examines their experiences empathizing with students, both in and outside of the classroom. We expand on frameworks for understanding the empathy process by identifying key mediating factors, and note various barriers that faculty express as preventing them from taking empathetic action. Our analysis unpacks the mechanisms of communication and contextual information, which play key roles in the empathetic process, with implications for programs that rely on empathy to develop more inclusive STEM academic spaces.</description>

      <title>A home-lab to study uncertainties using smartphone sensors and determine the optimal number of measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00590v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a home-lab experimental activity, successfully proposed to our students during covid19 pandemic, based on \textit{state-of-the-art} technologies to teach error analysis and uncertainties to science and engineering students. In the last decade the appearance of smartphones considerably affected our daily life. Thanks to their built-in sensors, this revolution has impacted in many areas and, in particular, the educational field. Here we show how to use smartphone sensors to teach fundamental concepts for science students such as any measurement is useless unless a confidence interval is specified or how to determine if a result agrees with a model, or to discern a new phenomenon from others already known. We explain how to obtain and analyse experimental fluctuations and discuss in relation with the Gaussian distribution. In another application we show how to determine the optimal number of measurements as a function of the standard error and the digital resolution of a given sensor.</description>

      <title>The process of constructing new knowledge: an undergraduate laboratory exercise facilitated by a vacuum capacitor-resistor circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process of constructing knowledge is typically taught to students by having them reproduce established results (e.g., homework problems). An alternative pedagogical strategy is to illustrate this process using an open problem, such as voltage decay in an RC circuit as described below. Analyzing data from this circuit in an undergraduate physics laboratory course reveals a discrepancy between the data and the exponential decay model found in textbooks. As students attempt to reconcile this discrepancy, the instructor can provide guidance in the process of validating data, modeling, and experimental design. This undergraduate laboratory exercise also provides an engaging transition from classroom learning to real world experience.</description>
