      <title>Exploiting Euclidean Distance Field Properties for Fast and Safe 3D planning with a modified Lazy Theta*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph search planners have been widely used for 3D path planning in the literature, and Euclidean Distance Fields (EDFs) are increasingly being used as a representation of the environment. However, to the best of our knowledge, the integration of EDFs into heuristic planning has been carried out in a loosely coupled fashion, dismissing EDF properties that can be used to accelerate/improve the planning process and enhance the safety margins of the resultant trajectories. This paper presents a fast graph search planner based on a modified Lazy Theta* planning algorithm for aerial robots in challenging 3D environments that exploits the EDF properties. The proposed planner outperforms classic graph search planners in terms of path smoothness and safety. It integrates EDFs as environment representation and directly generates fast and smooth paths avoiding the use of post-processing methods; it also considers the analytical properties of EDFs to obtain an approximation of the EDF cost along the line-of-sight segments and to reduce the number of visibility neighbours, which directly impacts the computation time. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed EDF-based cost function satisfies the triangle inequality, which reduces calculations during exploration and, hence, computation time. Many experiments and comparatives are carried out in 3D challenging indoor and outdoor simulation environments to evaluate and validate the proposed planner. The results show an efficient and safe planner in these environments.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Oscillatory Response of Automated Vehicle Car-following: Theoretical Analysis with Traffic State and Control Input Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework grounded in the theory of describing function (DF) and incremental-input DF to theoretically analyze the nonlinear oscillatory response of automated vehicles (AVs) car-following (CF) amidst traffic oscillations, considering the limits of traffic state and control input. While prevailing approaches largely ignore these limits (i.e., saturation of acceleration/deceleration and speed) and focus on linear string stability analysis, this framework establishes a basis for theoretically analyzing the frequency response of AV systems with nonlinearities imposed by these limits. To this end, trajectories of CF pairs are decomposed into nominal and oscillatory trajectories, subsequently, the controlled AV system is repositioned within the oscillatory trajectory coordinates. Built on this base, DFs are employed to approximate the frequency responses of nonlinear saturation components by using their first harmonic output, thereby capturing the associated amplification ratio and phase shift. Considering the closed-loop nature of AV control systems, where system states and control input mutually influence each other, amplification ratios and phase shifts are balanced within the loop to ensure consistency. This balancing process may render multiple solutions, hence the incremental-input DF is further applied to identify the reasonable ones. The proposed method is validated by estimations from Simulink, and further comparisons with prevailing methods are conducted. Results confirm the alignment of our framework with Simulink results and exhibit its superior accuracy in analysis compared to the prevailing methods. Furthermore, the framework proves valuable in string stability analysis, especially when conventional linear methods offer misleading insights.</description>

      <title>A Hetero-functional Graph Theory Perspective of Engineering Management of Mega-Projects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Megaprojects are large-scale, complex, and one-off engineering endeavors that require significant investments from a public or private sector. Such projects generally cost more than a billion dollars, take many years to develop and construct, involve stakeholders both in the public and private sectors, and impact millions of people. Most of the extant megaproject research is concerned with understanding why the engineering management of megaprojects fails so frequently and which dimensions make them so difficult to manage, including size, uncertainty, complexity, urgency, and institutional structure \cite{denicol:2020:00}. Recently, the literature on mega-projects has advocated for a convergence of the engineering management and production system management literature. To that end, this paper proposes the use of Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) and Hetero-Functional Graph Theory (HFGT), where the latter, quite interestingly, finds its origins in the mass-customized production system literature. More specifically, HFGT was developed so that the physical and informatic parts of production system planning, operations, and decision-making are readily reconfigured to support production customization at scale. As the literature on megaprojects is rapidly evolving with a significant amount of divergence between authors, this report builds upon the recent and extensive megaproject literature review provided by Denicol et. al. \cite{denicol:2020:00}. The paper concludes that MBSE and HFGT provide a means for addressing many of the concluding recommendations provided by Denicol et. al. MBSE and HFGT not only align with current research on megaprojects but also push the boundaries of how the engineering management of megaprojects can gain a unified theoretical foundation.</description>

      <title>A Conceptual Introduction to Hetero-functional Graph Theory for Systems-of-Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A defining feature of twenty first century engineering challenges is their inherent complexity, demanding the convergence of knowledge across diverse disciplines. Establishing consistent methodological foundations for engineering systems remains a challenge -- one that both systems engineering and network science have sought to address. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) has recently emerged as a practical, interdisciplinary approach for developing complex systems from concept through implementation. In contrast, network science focuses on the quantitative analysis of networks present within engineering systems. This paper introduces hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT) as a conceptual bridge between these two fields, serving as a tutorial for both communities. For systems engineers, HFGT preserves the heterogeneity of conceptual and ontological constructs in MBSE, including system form, function, and concept. For network scientists, it provides multiple graph-based data structures enabling matrix-based quantitative analysis. The modeling process begins with ontological foundations, defining an engineering system as an abstraction and representing it with a model. Model fidelity is assessed using four linguistic properties: soundness, completeness, lucidity, and laconicity. A meta-architecture is introduced to manage the convergence challenges between domain-specific reference architectures and case-specific instantiations. Unlike other meta-architectures, HFGT is rooted in linguistic structures, modeling resources as subjects, system processes as predicates, and operands-such as matter, energy, organisms, information, and money-as objects. These elements are integrated within a system meta-architecture expressed in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). The paper concludes by offering guidance for further reading.</description>

      <title>Controller Design for Bilinear Neural Feedback Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a class of bilinear systems with a neural network in the loop. These arise naturally when employing machine learning techniques to approximate general, non-affine in the input, control systems. We propose a controller design framework that combines linear fractional representations and tools from linear parameter varying control to guarantee local exponential stability of a desired equilibrium. The controller is obtained from the solution of linear matrix inequalities, which can be solved offline, making the approach suitable for online applications. The proposed methodology offers tools for stability and robustness analysis of deep neural networks interconnected with dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Deception in Oligopoly Games via Adaptive Nash Seeking Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the theory of multi-agent systems, deception refers to the strategic manipulation of information to influence the behavior of other agents, ultimately altering the long-term dynamics of the entire system. Recently, this concept has been examined in the context of model-free Nash equilibrium seeking (NES) algorithms for noncooperative games. Specifically, it was demonstrated that players can exploit knowledge of other players' exploration signals to drive the system toward a ``deceptive" Nash equilibrium, while maintaining the stability of the closed-loop system. To extend this insight beyond the duopoly case, in this paper we conduct a comprehensive study of deception mechanisms in N-player oligopoly markets. By leveraging the structure of these games and employing stability techniques for nonlinear dynamical systems, we provide game-theoretic insights into deception and derive specialized results, including stability conditions. These results allow players to systematically adjust their NES dynamics by tuning gains and signal amplitudes, all while ensuring closed-loop stability. Additionally, we introduce novel sufficient conditions to demonstrate that the (practically) stable equilibrium point of the deceptive dynamics corresponds to a true Nash equilibrium of a different game, which we term the ``deceptive game." Our results show that, under the proposed adaptive dynamics with deception, a victim firm may develop a distorted perception of its competitors' product appeal, which could lead to setting suboptimal prices.</description>

      <title>A Causation-Based Framework for Pricing and Cost Allocation of Energy, Reserves, and Transmission in Modern Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing vulnerability of power systems has heightened the need for operating reserves to manage contingencies such as generator outages, line failures, and sudden load variations. Unlike energy costs, driven by consumer demand, operating reserve costs arise from addressing the most critical credible contingencies - prompting the question: how should these costs be allocated through efficient pricing mechanisms? As an alternative to previously reported schemes, this paper presents a new causation-based pricing framework for electricity markets based on contingency-constrained energy and reserve scheduling models. Major salient features include a novel security charge mechanism along with the explicit definition of prices for up-spinning reserves, down-spinning reserves, and transmission services. These features ensure more comprehensive and efficient cost-reflective market operations. Moreover, the proposed nodal pricing scheme yields revenue adequacy and neutrality while promoting reliability incentives for generators based on the cost-causation principle. An additional salient aspect of the proposed framework is the economic incentive for transmission assets, which are remunerated based on their use to deliver energy and reserves across all contingency states. Numerical results from two case studies illustrate the performance of the proposed pricing scheme.</description>

      <title>Damping LFOs: Grid Following with Power Oscillation Damping vs. Grid Forming vs. PSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) present a significant challenge to the stability and reliability of power systems, especially in grids with a high penetration of renewable energy sources. Traditional grid-following (GFL) inverters have proven less effective in damping such oscillations. This paper presents a GFL-power plant controller with an auxiliary power oscillation damping control for damping LFOs. This approach is compared with a traditional power system stabilizer (PSS) for a two-area power system. Next, the research is extended by deploying grid forming (GFM) controls, which by actively controlling the voltage and frequency dynamics emulate the behavior of traditional synchronous generators. The paper analyzes two GFM control strategies: virtual synchronous machine (VSM) and droop control, and demonstrates their effectiveness in damping LFOs in the test system. The simulation results reveal that the performance of the proposed GFM-VSM rivals that of the PSS and is better than the GFL-power oscillation damper.</description>

      <title>2D PZT MEMS Resonant Scanner Using a Three-Mask Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the design, simulation, fabrication, and characterization of a novel architectural compact two-dimensional (2D) resonant MEMS scanning mirror actuated by thin-film lead zirconate titanate (PZT). The device employs an innovative mechanically coupled dual-axis architecture fabricated using a three-mask process on an SOI-PZT deposited wafer, significantly reducing system complexity while achieving high performance. The scanner integrates a 1 $\times$ 1.4 mm oval mirror within a 7 $\times$ 4.7 mm die, actuated by PZT thin-film elements optimized for resonant operation at 3.6 kHz (vertical) and 54.2 kHz (horizontal) under 12 V$_{\mathrm{p-p}}$ periodic pulse driving. The system achieves optical scan angles of 4.8$^\circ$ and 11.5$^\circ$ in vertical and horizontal directions, respectively, with quality factors of 750 (vertical) and 1050 (horizontal). These values contribute to high scanning bandwidth-efficiency products of 24.2 deg$\cdot$mm$\cdot$kHz (vertical) and 623 deg$\cdot$mm$\cdot$kHz (horizontal), among the higher values reported for 2D PZT-MEMS scanners. Finite element analysis confirmed minimal stress and mirror deformation, and experimental validation demonstrated excellent agreement with simulation results. This architecture demonstrates the feasibility of high-resolution laser scanning, as required in applications such as OCT, LiDAR, and displays, by achieving performance levels in line with those used in such systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Distribution Network Reconfiguration Using Mapping-based Column-and-Constraint Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of intermittent renewable energy sources into distribution networks introduces significant uncertainties and fluctuations, challenging their operational security, stability, and efficiency. This paper considers robust distribution network reconfiguration (RDNR) with renewable generator resizing, modeled as a two-stage robust optimization (RO) problem with decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU). Our model optimizes resizing decisions as the upper bounds of renewable generator outputs, while also optimizing the network topology. We design a mapping-based column-and-constraint generation (C&amp;CG) algorithm to address the computational challenges raised by DDU. Sensitivity analyses further explore the impact of uncertainty set parameters on optimal solutions. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in reducing computational complexity while ensuring solution optimality.</description>

      <title>Input-Power-to-State Stability of Time-Varying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the state of a system may remain bounded even if both the input amplitude and energy are unbounded, then the state bounds given by the standard input-to-state stability (ISS) and integral-ISS (iISS) properties may provide no useful information. This paper considers an ISS-related concept suitable in such a case: input-power-to-state stability (IPSS). Necessary and sufficient conditions for IPSS are developed for time-varying systems under very mild assumptions on the dynamics. More precisely, it is shown that (a) the existence of a dissipation-form ISS-Lyapunov function implies IPSS, but not necessarily that of an implication-form one, (b) iISS with exponential class-$\KL$ function implies IPSS, and (c) ISS and stronger assumptions on the dynamics imply the existence of a dissipation-form ISS-Lyapunov function and hence IPSS. The latter result is based on a converse Lyapunov theorem for time-varying systems whose dynamics (i.e. state derivative) is not necessarily continuous with respect to time.</description>

Abstract: A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) testbed serves as a powerful platform for testing and validating cyber intrusion detection and mitigation strategies in substations. This study presents the design and development of a CPS testbed that can effectively assess the real-time dynamics of a substation. Cyber attacks exploiting IEC 61850-based SV and GOOSE protocols are demonstrated using the testbed, along with an analysis on attack detection. Realistic timing measurements are obtained, and the time frames for deploying detection and mitigation strategies are evaluated.</description>

      <title>A Benchmark Reference for ESP32-CAM Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ESP32-CAM is one of the most widely adopted open-source modules for prototyping embedded vision applications. Since its release in 2019, it has gained popularity among both hobbyists and professional developers due to its affordability, versatility, and integrated wireless capabilities. Despite its widespread use, comprehensive documentation of the performance metrics remains limited. This study addresses this gap by collecting and analyzing over six hours of real-time video streaming logs across all supported resolutions of the OV2640 image sensor, tested under five distinct voltage conditions via an HTTP-based WiFi connection. A long standing bug in the official Arduino ESP32 driver, responsible for inaccurate frame rate logging, was fixed. The resulting analysis includes key performance metrics such as instantaneous and average frame rate, total streamed data, transmission count, and internal chip temperature. The influence of varying power levels was evaluated to assess the reliability of the module.</description>

      <title>Humanoid Loco-Manipulations Pattern Generation and Stabilization Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order for a humanoid robot to perform loco-manipulation such as moving an object while walking, it is necessary to account for sustained or alternating external forces other than ground-feet reaction, resulting from humanoid-object contact interactions. In this letter, we propose a bipedal control strategy for humanoid loco-manipulation that can cope with such external forces. First, the basic formulas of the bipedal dynamics, i.e., linear inverted pendulum mode and divergent component of motion, are derived, taking into account the effects of external manipulation forces. Then, we propose a pattern generator to plan center of mass trajectories consistent with the reference trajectory of the manipulation forces, and a stabilizer to compensate for the error between desired and actual manipulation forces. The effectiveness of our controller is assessed both in simulation and loco-manipulation experiments with real humanoid robots.</description>

      <title>Incremental Gain Computation and Regulation of Discrete-time Positive Lur\'e Systems using Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work approaches the problem of computing incremental $\ell_1$ and $\ell_\infty$ gains for discrete-time positive systems in \lure feedback with static memoryless nonlinearities, and regulating the $\ell_\infty$ gain through the design of a state-feedback controller. Finite incremental gains provide a quantitative measure of robustness for trajectories, and will ensure that all pairs of trajectories will converge to a fixed point or will diverge together in the absence of an applied input. Upper-bounds on these incremental gains can be computed through linear programming. Computation and regulation of the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_\infty$ incremental gains are verified by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Distributed Intelligence in the Computing Continuum with Active Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Computing Continuum (CC) is an emerging Internet-based computing paradigm that spans from local Internet of Things sensors and constrained edge devices to large-scale cloud data centers. Its goal is to orchestrate a vast array of diverse and distributed computing resources to support the next generation of Internet-based applications. However, the distributed, heterogeneous, and dynamic nature of CC platforms demands distributed intelligence for adaptive and resilient service management. This article introduces a distributed stream processing pipeline as a CC use case, where each service is managed by an Active Inference (AIF) agent. These agents collaborate to fulfill service needs specified by SLOiDs, a term we introduce to denote Service Level Objectives that are aware of its deployed devices, meaning that non-functional requirements must consider the characteristics of the hosting device. We demonstrate how AIF agents can be modeled and deployed alongside distributed services to manage them autonomously. Our experiments show that AIF agents achieve over 90% SLOiD fulfillment when using tested transition models, and around 80% when learning the models during deployment. We compare their performance to a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, finding that while both approaches yield similar results, MARL requires extensive training, whereas AIF agents can operate effectively from the start. Additionally, we evaluate the behavior of AIF agents in offloading scenarios, observing a strong capacity for adaptation. Finally, we outline key research directions to advance AIF integration in CC platforms.</description>

      <title>Convex Approximations of Random Constrained Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) are used as a decision-making framework to study the long-run performance of a stochastic system. It is well-known that a stationary optimal policy of a CMDP problem under discounted cost criterion can be obtained by solving a linear programming problem when running costs and transition probabilities are exactly known. In this paper, we consider a discounted cost CMDP problem where the running costs and transition probabilities are defined using random variables. Consequently, both the objective function and constraints become random. We use chance constraints to model these uncertainties and formulate the uncertain CMDP problem as a joint chance-constrained Markov decision process (JCCMDP). Under random running costs, we assume that the dependency among random constraint vectors is driven by a Gumbel-Hougaard copula. Using standard probability inequalities, we construct convex upper bound approximations of the JCCMDP problem under certain conditions on random running costs. In addition, we propose a linear programming problem whose optimal value gives a lower bound to the optimal value of the JCCMDP problem. When both running costs and transition probabilities are random, we define the latter variables as a sum of their means and random perturbations. Under mild conditions on the random perturbations and random running costs, we construct convex upper and lower bound approximations of the JCCMDP problem. We analyse the quality of the derived bounds through numerical experiments on a queueing control problem for random running costs. For the case when both running costs and transition probabilities are random, we choose randomly generated Markov decision problems called Garnets for numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic Error Analysis of Subspace Identification for Deterministic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subspace identification method (SIM) has been extensively employed in the identification of discrete-time multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. This paper focuses on the analysis of perturbation errors for the system matrices in state-space models and the corresponding system poles, under two unified SIMs, based on a single finite-length input/output sample trajectory. Specifically, we derive non-asymptotic upper bounds on these errors, providing a unified perspective across various SIM variants. Furthermore, we prove that SIMs become ill-conditioned for MIMO systems when the state-to-output dimensionality ratio $n/m$ is large, regardless of system parameters. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the non-asymptotic results and the ill-conditionedness of SIMs.</description>

      <title>Online ResNet-Based Adaptive Control for Nonlinear Target Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalized ResNet architecture for adaptive control of nonlinear systems with black box uncertainties is developed. The approach overcomes limitations in existing methods by incorporating pre-activation shortcut connections and a zeroth layer block that accommodates different input-output dimensions. The developed Lyapunov-based adaptation law establishes exponential convergence to a neighborhood of the target state despite unknown dynamics and disturbances. Furthermore, the theoretical results are validated through a comparative experiment.</description>

      <title>Distributed RISE-based Control for Exponential Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Target Tracking of Second-Order Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A distributed implementation of a Robust Integral of the Sign of the Error (RISE) controller is developed for multi-agent target tracking problems with exponential convergence guarantees. Previous RISE-based approaches for multi-agent systems required 2-hop communication, limiting practical applicability. New insights from a Lyapunov-based design-analysis approach are used to eliminate the need for multi-hop communication required in previous literature, while yielding exponential target tracking. The new insights include the development of a new P-function that works in tandem with the graph interaction matrix in the Lyapunov function. Nonsmooth Lyapunov-based stability analysis methods are used to yield semi-global exponential convergence to the target agent state despite the presence of bounded disturbances with bounded derivatives. The resulting outcome is a controller that achieves exponential target tracking with only local information exchange between neighboring agents.</description>

      <title>Efficient Gaussian Mixture Filters based on Transition Density Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian mixture filters for nonlinear systems usually rely on severe approximations when calculating mixtures in the prediction and filtering step. Thus, offline approximations of noise densities by Gaussian mixture densities to reduce the approximation error have been proposed. This results in exponential growth in the number of components, requiring ongoing component reduction, which is computationally complex. In this paper, the key idea is to approximate the true transition density by an axis-aligned Gaussian mixture, where two different approaches are derived. These approximations automatically ensure a constant number of components in the posterior densities without the need for explicit reduction. In addition, they allow a trade-off between estimation quality and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Risk-Sensitive Model Predictive Control for Interaction-Aware Planning -- A Sequential Convexification Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers risk-sensitive model predictive control for stochastic systems with a decision-dependent distribution. This class of systems is commonly found in human-robot interaction scenarios. We derive computationally tractable convex upper bounds to both the objective function, and to frequently used penalty terms for collision avoidance, allowing us to efficiently solve the generally nonconvex optimal control problem as a sequence of convex problems. Simulations of a robot navigating a corridor demonstrate the effectiveness and the computational advantage of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Dexterous Control of an 11-DOF Redundant Robot for CT-Guided Needle Insertion With Task-Oriented Weighted Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computed tomography (CT)-guided needle biopsies are critical for diagnosing a range of conditions, including lung cancer, but present challenges such as limited in-bore space, prolonged procedure times, and radiation exposure. Robotic assistance offers a promising solution by improving needle trajectory accuracy, reducing radiation exposure, and enabling real-time adjustments. In our previous work, we introduced a redundant robotic platform designed for dexterous needle insertion within the confined CT bore. However, its limited base mobility restricts flexible deployment in clinical settings. In this study, we present an improved 11-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic system that integrates a 6-DOF robotic base with a 5-DOF cable-driven end-effector, significantly enhancing workspace flexibility and precision. With the hyper-redundant degrees of freedom, we introduce a weighted inverse kinematics controller with a two-stage priority scheme for large-scale movement and fine in-bore adjustments, along with a null-space control strategy to optimize dexterity. We validate our system through both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating superior tracking accuracy and enhanced manipulability in CT-guided procedures. The study provides a strong case for hyper-redundancy and null-space control formulations for robot-assisted needle biopsy scenarios.</description>

      <title>Iterative Joint Detection of Kalman Filter and Channel Decoder for Sensor-to-Controller Link in Wireless Networked Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose an iterative joint detection algorithm of Kalman filter (KF) and channel decoder for the sensor-to-controller link of wireless networked control systems, which utilizes the prior information of control system to improve control and communication performance. In this algorithm, we first use the KF to estimate the probability density of the control system outputs and calculate the prior probability of received signals to assist decoder. Then, the possible outputs of the control system are traversed to update the prior probability in order to implement iterative detection. The simulation results show that the prior information and the iterative structure can reduce the block error rate performance of communications while improving the root mean square error performance of controls.</description>

      <title>Learning Dynamics under Environmental Constraints via Measurement-Induced Bundle Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning unknown dynamics under environmental (or external) constraints is fundamental to many fields (e.g., modern robotics), particularly challenging when constraint information is only locally available and uncertain. Existing approaches requiring global constraints or using probabilistic filtering fail to fully exploit the geometric structure inherent in local measurements (by using, e.g., sensors) and constraints. This paper presents a geometric framework unifying measurements, constraints, and dynamics learning through a fiber bundle structure over the state space. This naturally induced geometric structure enables measurement-aware Control Barrier Functions that adapt to local sensing (or measurement) conditions. By integrating Neural ODEs, our framework learns continuous-time dynamics while preserving geometric constraints, with theoretical guarantees of learning convergence and constraint satisfaction dependent on sensing quality. The geometric framework not only enables efficient dynamics learning but also suggests promising directions for integration with reinforcement learning approaches. Extensive simulations demonstrate significant improvements in both learning efficiency and constraint satisfaction over traditional methods, especially under limited and uncertain sensing conditions.</description>
