      <title>Magnetic field amplification during a turbulent collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of whether a dynamo can be triggered by gravitational collapse is of great interest, especially for the early Universe. Here, we employ supercomoving coordinates to study the magnetic field amplification from decaying turbulence during gravitational collapse. We perform three-dimensional simulations and show that for large magnetic Reynolds numbers, there can be exponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time before the decay of turbulence impedes further amplification. The collapse dynamics only affects the nonlinear feedback from the Lorentz force, which diminishes more rapidly for shorter collapse times, allowing nearly kinematic continued growth. We also confirm that helical turbulence is more efficient in driving dynamo action than nonhelical turbulence, but this difference decreases for larger collapse times. We also show that for nearly irrotational flows, dynamo amplification is still possible, but it is always associated with a growth of vorticity -- even if it still remains very small. In nonmagnetic runs, the growth of vorticity is associated with viscosity and grows with the Mach number. In the presence of magnetic fields, vorticity emerges from the curl of the Lorentz force.</description>

      <title>Dilatation-driven spurious dissipation in weakly compressible methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weakly compressible methods to simulate incompressible flows are in a state of rapid development, owing to the envisaged efficiency they offer for parallel computing. The pressure waves in such methods travel at finite speeds, and hence they yield non-solenoidal velocity fields. This inherent inability to satisfy mass conservation corresponding to incompressible flows is a crucial concern for weakly compressible methods. Another widely reported observation is the progressive enhancement of non-physical dissipation with the increase in the artificial compressibility parameter. By scrutinizing the dilatation terms appearing in the kinetic energy equation, we provide vital insights into the influence of mass conservation error on the accuracy of these methods, and explain the mechanism behind the dissipative nature of the compressibility. Analysing transient laminar and turbulent flows, we show that the dilatation-driven dissipation terms, not the mass conservation error alone, govern the accuracy of weakly compressible methods. The insights provided in this work are not only of fundamental importance but will be of considerable value in aiding the development of weakly compressible methods that can allow a larger artificial Mach number, thus alleviating the stringent time step restriction in such methods.</description>

      <title>Understanding large-scale dynamos in unstratified rotating shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine simulations with new analyses that overcome previous pitfalls to explicate how nonhelical mean-field dynamos grow and saturate in unstratified, magnetorotationally driven turbulence. Shear of the mean radial magnetic field amplifies the azimuthal component. Radial fields are regenerated by velocity fluctuations that induce shear of radial magnetic fluctuations, followed by Lorentz and Coriolis forces that source a negative off-diagonal component in the turbulent diffusivity tensor. We present a simple schematic to illustrate this dynamo growth. A different part of the Lorentz force forms a third-order correlator in the mean electromotive force that saturates the dynamo.</description>

      <title>Droplet coalescence kinetics: Coalescence mechanisms and thermodynamic non-equilibrium effects under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the droplet coalescence mechanisms and the interplay between various thermodynamic non-equilibrium (TNE) effects under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions kinetically. The main findings include: (1) Coalescence initiation and cut-through mechanisms: In non-isothermal conditions, the temperature rise caused by the release of latent heat during phase transition slightly increases the surface tension gradient (driving force) near the contact point of the two droplets, while significantly enhancing the pressure gradient (resistance). This results in a significantly prolonged coalescence initiation time compared to the isothermal case. In both cases, pressure extends the liquid-vapor interface in opposite directions, promoting the growth of the liquid bridge. (2) TNE effects: Latent heat-induced temperature rise significantly refrains the TNE intensity in thermal case. Before and after droplet contact, non-equilibrium quantities driven by the temperature gradient and those driven by the velocity gradient, alternate in dominating the coalescence process. This competition and interplay result in a more complex spatial and spatiotemporal evolution of TNE effects compared to the isothermal case. (3) Entropy production mechanisms: In the non-isothermal case, entropy production is contributed not only by $\bm {\Delta}^{\ast}_2$ but also by $\bm {\Delta}^{\ast}_{3,1}$, with the former being the dominant contributor. The temperature field reduces the entropy production rate, while extends its duration, and increases the total entropy production. This research provides kinetic insights for dynamic, cross-scale regulation and multifunctional integration of coalescence processes in industrial applications.</description>
