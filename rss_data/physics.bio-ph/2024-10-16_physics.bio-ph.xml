      <title>Multidomain Model for Optic Nerve Potassium Clearance: Roles of Glial Cells and Perivascular Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accumulation of potassium in the extracellular space surrounding nerve cells is a fundamental aspect of biophysics that has garnered significant attention in recent research. This phenomenon holds implications for various neurological conditions, including spreading depression, migraine, certain types of epilepsy, and potentially, learning processes. A quantitative analysis is essential for understanding the dynamics of potassium clearance following a series of action potentials. This clearance process involves multiple structures along the nerve, including glia, the extracellular space, axons, and the perivascular space, necessitating a spatially distributed systems approach akin to the cable equations of nerve physiology. In this study, we propose a multi-domain model for the optic nerve to investigate potassium accumulation and clearance dynamics. The model accounts for the convection, diffusion, and electrical migration of fluid and ions, revealing the significant roles of glia and the perivascular space in potassium buffering. Specifically, our findings suggest that potassium clearance primarily occurs through convective flow within the syncytia of glia, driven by osmotic pressure differences. Additionally, the perivascular space serves as a crucial pathway for potassium buffering and fluid circulation, further contributing to the overall clearance process. Importantly, our model's adaptability allows for its application to diverse structures with distinct channel and transporter distributions across the six compartments, extending its utility beyond the optic nerve.</description>

      <title>Flagellar damage and recovery in soil bacteria exposed to shear in long microchannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outermost structure of the bacterial flagellar motor is a long helicoidal filament, whose protein building blocks are produced and injected from the base, progressively elongating the filament and regenerating it in case it breaks. Here, we study the evolution of flagellar filaments in the soil bacterium $\textit{Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens}$ after being exposed to shear flows, for shear rates between 1 s$^{-1}$ and $10^5$ s$^{-1}$, and for durations between tens of milliseconds and minutes. We demonstrate that the average swimming speed and fraction of swimming cells decrease after exposition to shear, but both parameters can recover, at least partially, with time. These observations support the hypothesis that flagellar filaments are cut by shear flows, but that reversibly damaged flagellar motors can be restored thanks to filament regeneration. By fitting our observations with phenomenological expressions, we obtain the individual growth rates of the two different flagellar filaments that $\textit{B. diazoefficiens}$ possesses, showing that the lateral filaments have a recovery time of about 40 min while the subpolar one requires more than 4.5 h to regrow. Our work demonstrates that a simple monitoring of bacterial motility after exposition to shear can be used to characterise the process of flagellar filament growth.</description>

      <title>Role of Delay in Brain Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant variations of delays among connecting neurons cause an inevitable disadvantage of asynchronous brain dynamics compared to synchronous deep learning. However, this study demonstrates that this disadvantage can be converted into a computational advantage using a network with a single output and M multiple delays between successive layers, thereby generating a polynomial time-series outputs with M. The proposed role of delay in brain dynamics (RoDiB) model, is capable of learning increasing number of classified labels using a fixed architecture, and overcomes the inflexibility of the brain to update the learning architecture using additional neurons and connections. Moreover, the achievable accuracies of the RoDiB system are comparable with those of its counterpart tunable single delay architectures with M outputs. Further, the accuracies are significantly enhanced when the number of output labels exceeds its fully connected input size. The results are mainly obtained using simulations of VGG-6 on CIFAR datasets and also include multiple label inputs. However, currently only a small fraction of the abundant number of RoDiB outputs is utilized, thereby suggesting its potential for advanced computational power yet to be discovered.</description>

      <title>Stronger when wet: Water-resistant chitinous objects via zero-waste coordination with metal ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plastics have become integral to our society due to their durability and water stability, which is achieved through strong intermolecular interactions. However, these properties also make them persistent disruptors of ecological cycles, in contrast with biological structures, which work with their environments to achieve both excellent mechanical properties and ecological integration. This study takes inspiration from the arthropod cuticle to adapt Earth's second most abundant organic molecule for use in water. The process involves the vitrification of chitosan with small traces of nickel to create a dynamic network of intermolecular bonds using environmental water, resulting in a material that increases its strength to values well above commodity plastics when wet. The approach preserves the molecule's original chemistry and therefore its seamless integration into Earth's metabolism while avoiding the use of the strong organic solvents typically associated with biomolecules. The method demonstrates the potential for a paradigm shift in manufacturing, with zero waste production of both consumables and large objects that could meet the global demand for plastic.</description>

      <title>Cotunneling assisted nonequilibrium thermodynamics of a photosynthetic junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a photosystem II-based reaction center modeled as a nonequilibrium quantum junction. We specifically focus on the electron-electron interactions that enable cotunneling events to be captured through quantum mechanical rates due to the inclusion of a negatively charged manybody state. Using a master equation framework with realistic spectral profiles, we analyze the cotunneling assisted current, power, and work. Amplification of the cotunneling assisted current and power occurs over a narrower bias range, reflecting a trade-off where higher flux is compensated by a reduced work window. We further report that the cotunneling-enhanced thermodynamic variables, particularly within specific bias windows, depends on the interplay between cotunneling amplitudes, electron transition rates, and interaction energy. Both attractive and repulsive electronic interactions can enhance cotunneling, but this effect is sensitive to the energy balance between states and the tunneling strength asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Spatially Selective Acoustic Pressure Reporting Using Antibubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound offers promising applications in biology and chemistry, but quantifying local ultrasound conditions remains challenging due to the lack of non-invasive measurement tools. We introduce antibubbles as novel optical reporters of local ultrasound pressure. These liquid-core, air-shell structures encapsulate fluorescent payloads, releasing them upon exposure to low-intensity ultrasound. We demonstrate their versatility by fabricating antibubbles with hydrophilic and hydrophobic payloads, revealing payload-dependent encapsulation efficiency and release dynamics. Using acoustic holograms, we showcase precise spatial control of payload release, enabling visualization of complex ultrasound fields. High-speed fluorescence imaging reveals a gentle, single-shot release mechanism occurring within 20-50 ultrasound cycles. It is thus possible to determine via an optical fluorescence marker what the applied ultrasound pressure was. This work thereby introduces a non-invasive method for mapping ultrasound fields in complex environments, potentially accelerating research in ultrasound-based therapies and processes. The long-term stability and versatility of these antibubble reporters suggest broad applicability in studying and optimizing ultrasound effects across various biological and chemical systems.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Principles for Biophysics and Neuroscience: Entropy Production, Bayesian Mechanics &amp; the Free-Energy Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis focuses on three fundamental aspects of biological systems; namely, entropy production, Bayesian mechanics, and the free-energy principle. The contributions are threefold: 1) We compute the entropy production for a greater class of systems than before, including almost any stationary diffusion process, such as degenerate diffusions where the driving noise does not act on all coordinates of the system. Importantly, this class of systems encompasses Markovian approximations of stochastic differential equations driven by colored noise, which is significant since biological systems at the macro- and meso-scale are generally subject to colored fluctuations. 2) We develop a Bayesian mechanics for biological and physical entities that interact with their environment in which we give sufficient and necessary conditions for the internal states of something to infer its external states, consistently with variational Bayesian inference in statistics and theoretical neuroscience. 3) We refine the constraints on Bayesian mechanics to obtain a description that is more specific to biological systems, called the free-energy principle. This says that active and internal states of biological systems unfold as minimising a quantity known as free energy. The mathematical foundation to the free-energy principle, presented here, unlocks a first principles approach to modeling and simulating behavior in neurobiology and artificial intelligence, by minimising free energy given a generative model of external and sensory states.</description>

      <title>Mind the memory: Artefactual scaling of energy dissipation rate due to inconsistent time reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been recently proposed that an observed inverse power-law dependence of the Markovian estimate for the steady-state dissipation rate on the coarse-graining scale in self-similar networks reflects a scale-dependent energy dissipation. By explicit examples, it is demonstrated here that there are in general no relations between such an apparent power-law dependence and the actual dissipation on different length scales. We construct fractal networks with a single dissipative scale and networks with a true inverse energy-dissipation cascade, and show that they display the same scaling behavior. Moreover, it is shown that a self-similar network structure does not imply an inverse power-law scaling but may be mistaken for one in practice. When no dissipative cycles become hidden by the coarse graining, any scale dependence of the dissipation estimate vanishes if the memory is correctly accounted for in the time-reversal operation. A scale dependence of higher-order dissipation estimators signifies hidden dissipative cycles. Our results underscore the importance of accounting for memory effects in analyzing coarse observations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic inference of correlations in nonequilibrium collective dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of stochastic thermodynamics has revealed many useful fluctuation relations, with the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) being a theorem of major interest. When many nonequilibrium currents interact with each other, a naive application of the TUR to an individual current can result in an apparent violation of the TUR bound. Here, we explore how such an apparent violation can be used to put a lower bound on the strength of correlations $C$ as well as the number $N$ of interacting currents in collective dynamics. This lower bound is a combined bound on $C(N-1)$ if only one current is measured, or a bound on $N$ if two currents are measured. Our proposed protocol allows for the inference of hidden correlations in experiment, for example when a team of molecular motors pulls on the same cargo but only one or a subset of them is fluorescently tagged. By solving analytically and numerically several models of many-body nonequilibrium dynamics, we ascertain under which conditions this strategy can be applied and the inferred bound on correlations becomes tight.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Interactions Govern Self-Organized Ordering in Two-Dimensional Bacterial Colonies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of mechanical interactions on the growth and self-organization of rod-shaped bacteria confined within square and circular geometries. Our results reveal that mechanical interactions are crucial in constraining cell growth and shaping the degree of ordering within bacterial colonies. Colonies with larger aspect ratios exhibit higher levels of nematic ordering, while the geometry of confinements significantly impacts colony organization. Compression influences force magnitudes within colonies, with larger division lengths encountering greater forces. These findings enhance our understanding of bacterial self-organization in confined environments, with implications for microbial ecology and biotechnology.</description>
