      <title>Finding the convex hull of a set using the flow by minimal curvature with an obstacle. A game theoretical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we look for the convex hull of a set using the geometric evolution by minimal curvature of a hypersurface that surrounds the set. To find the convex hull, we study the large time behavior of solutions to an obstacle problem for the level set formulation of the geometric flow driven by the minimum of the principal curvatures (that coincides with the mean curvature flow only in two dimensions). We prove that the superlevel set where the solution to this obstacle problem is positive converges as time goes to infinity to the convex hull of the obstacle. Our approach is based on a game-theoretic approximation for this geometric flow that is inspired by previous results for the mean curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Deep-water and shallow-water limits of statistical equilibria for the intermediate long wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the construction of invariant measures associated with higher order conservation laws of the intermediate long wave equation (ILW) and their convergence properties in the deep-water and shallow-water limits. By exploiting its complete integrability, we first carry out detailed analysis on the construction of appropriate conservation laws of ILW at the $H^\frac k2$-level for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$, and establish their convergence to those of the Benjamin-Ono equation (BO) in the deep-water limit and to those of the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) in the shallow-water limit. In particular, in the shallow-water limit, we prove rather striking 2-to-1 collapse of the conservation laws of ILW to those of KdV. Such 2-to-1 collapse is novel in the literature and, to our knowledge, this is the first construction of a complete family of shallow-water conservation laws with non-trivial shallow-water limits. We then construct an infinite sequence of generalized Gibbs measures for ILW associated with these conservation laws and prove their convergence to the corresponding (invariant) generalized Gibbs measures for BO and KdV in the respective limits. Finally, for $k \ge 3$, we establish invariance of these measures under ILW dynamics, and also convergence in the respective limits of the ILW dynamics at each equilibrium state to the corresponding invariant dynamics for BO and KdV constructed by Deng, Tzvetkov, and Visciglia (2010-2015) and Zhidkov (1996), respectively. In particular, in the shallow-water limit, we establish 2-to-1 collapse at the level of the generalized Gibbs measures as well as the invariant ILW dynamics. As a byproduct of our analysis, we also prove invariance of the generalized Gibbs measure associated with the $H^2$-conservation law of KdV, which seems to be missing in the literature.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of bound states to $\Delta u-u+|u|^{p-1}u= 0$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\ge 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a positive answer to a conjecture of Berestycki and Lions in 1983 on the uniqueness of bound states to $\Delta u +f(u)=0$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $u\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$, $u\not\equiv 0$, $n\ge 3$. For the model nonlinearity $f(u)=-u+|u|^{p-1}u$, $1&lt;p&lt;(n+2)/(n-2)$, arisen from finding standing waves of Klein-Gordon equation or nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, we show that, for each integer $k\ge 1$, the problem has a unique solution $u=u(|x|)$, $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$, up to translation and reflection, that has precisely $k$ zeros for $|x|&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Existence and Regularity Results for a Nonlinear Fluid-Structure Interaction Problem with Three-Dimensional Structural Displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a nonlinear fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem involving the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the flow of an incompressible, viscous fluid in a 3D domain interacting with a thin viscoelastic lateral wall. The wall's elastodynamics is modeled by a two-dimensional plate equation with fractional damping, accounting for displacement in all three directions. The system is nonlinearly coupled through kinematic and dynamic conditions imposed at the time-varying fluid-structure interface, whose location is not known a priori. We establish three key results, particularly significant for FSI problems that account for vector displacements of thin structures. Specifically, we first establish a hidden spatial regularity for the structure displacement, which forms the basis for proving that self-contact of the structure will not occur within a finite time interval. Secondly, we demonstrate temporal regularity for both the structure and fluid velocities, which enables a new compactness result for three-dimensional structural displacements. Finally, building on these regularity results, we prove the existence of a local-in-time weak solution to the FSI problem. This is done through a constructive proof using time discretization via the Lie operator splitting method. These results are significant because they address the well-known issues associated with the analysis of nonlinearly coupled FSI problems capturing vector displacements of elastic/viscoelastic structures in 3D, such as spatial and temporal regularity of weak solutions and their well-posedness.</description>

      <title>Log-type ultra-analyticity of elliptic equations with gradient terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that every solution of an elliptic equation is analytic if its coefficients are analytic. However, less is known about the ultra-analyticity of such solutions. This work addresses the problem of elliptic equations with lower-order terms, where the coefficients are entire functions of exponential type. We prove that every solution satisfies a quantitative logarithmic ultra-analytic bound and demonstrate that this bound is sharp. The results suggest that the ultra-analyticity of solutions to elliptic equations cannot be expected to achieve the same level of ultra-analyticity as the coefficients.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions to a model for phase separation coupled with finite-strain viscoelasticity subject to external distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the coupling of a viscoelastic deformation governed by a Kelvin-Voigt model at equilibrium, based on the concept of second-grade nonsimple materials, with a plastic deformation due to volumetric swelling, described via a phase-field variable subject to a Cahn-Hilliard model expressed in a Lagrangian frame. Such models can be used to describe the time evolution of hydrogels in terms of phase separation within a deformable substrate. The equations are mainly coupled via a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into both contributions and via a Korteweg term in the Eulerian frame. To treat time-dependent Dirichlet conditions for the deformation, an auxiliary variable with fixed boundary values is introduced, which results in another multiplicative structure. Imposing suitable growth conditions on the elastic and viscous potentials, we construct weak solutions to this quasistatic model as the limit of time-discrete solutions to incremental minimization problems. The limit passage is possible due to additional regularity induced by the hyperelastic and viscous stresses.</description>

      <title>Homogenisation for Maxwell and Friends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refine the understanding of continuous dependence on coefficients of solution operators under the nonlocal $H$-topology viz Schur topology in the setting of evolutionary equations in the sense of Picard. We show that certain components of the solution operators converge strongly. The weak convergence behaviour known from homogenisation problems for ordinary differential equations is recovered on the other solution operator components. The results are underpinned by a rich class of examples that, in turn, are also treated numerically, suggesting a certain sharpness of the theoretical findings. Analytic treatment of an example that proves this sharpness is provided too. Even though all the considered examples contain local coefficients, the main theorems and structural insights are of operator-theoretic nature and, thus, also applicable to nonlocal coefficients. The main advantage of the problem class considered is that they contain mixtures of type, potentially highly oscillating between different types of PDEs; a prototype can be found in Maxwell's equations highly oscillating between the classical equations and corresponding eddy current approximations.</description>

      <title>The radiation condition for Helmholtz equations above locally perturbed periodic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiation condition is the key question in the mathematical modelling for scattering problems in unbounded domains. Mathematically, it plays the role as the "boundary condition" at the infinity, which guarantees the well-posedness of the mathematical problem; physically, it describes the behaviour of the physical waves. In this paper, we focus on the radiation conditions for scattering problems with periodic media embedded in two dimensional half-spaces. According to Hu et al. (2021), the radiating solution satisfies the Sommerfeld radiation condition: $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}-i k u=o(r^{-1/2}).$$
  Although there are literature which have studied this problem, there is no specific method for dealing with periodic structures. Due to this reason, the important properties for the periodic structures are always ignored. Moreover, the existing method is not extendable to bi-periodic structures in three dimensional spaces.
  In this paper, we study the radiation condition for the scattering problem with periodic medium, which is modelled by the Helmholtz equation. We introduce a novel method based on the Floquet-Bloch transform, which, to the best of the author's knowledge, is the first method that works particularly for periodic media. With this method, we improve the Sommerfeld radiation condition for the scattered field from periodic surface to: $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}-i k u=O(r^{-3/2}).$$
  Moreover, the prospect of extending this method to 3D cases is optimistic.</description>

      <title>The Least Action Admissibility Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07191v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a new admissibility criterion for choosing physically relevant weak solutions of the equations of Lagrangian and continuum mechanics when non-uniqueness of solutions to the initial value problem occurs. The criterion is motivated by the classical least action principle but is now applied to initial value problems which exhibit non-unique solutions. Examples are provided to Lagrangian mechanics and the Euler equations of barotropic fluid mechanics. In particular an example is provided which shows the least action admissibility principle prefers the classical two shock solution to the Riemann initial value problem to solutions generated by convex integration, yet for the same example Dafermos's entropy rate criterion prefers the convex integration solutions to the two shock solution.</description>

      <title>Existence of higher degree minimizers in the magnetic skyrmion problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate existence of topologically nontrivial energy minimizing maps of a given positive degree from bounded domains in the plane to $\mathbb S^2$ in a variational model describing magnetizations in ultrathin ferromagnetic films with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Our strategy is to insert tiny truncated Belavin-Polyakov profiles in carefully chosen locations of lower degree objects such that the total energy increase lies strictly below the expected Dirichlet energy contribution, ruling out loss of degree in the limits of minimizing sequences. The argument requires that the domain be either sufficiently large or sufficiently slender to accommodate a prescribed degree. We also show that these higher degree minimizers concentrate on point-like skyrmionic configurations in a suitable parameter regime.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the $k$-Hessian curvature flow of noncompact spacelike hypersurfaces in Minkowski space. We first prove the existence of translating solutions with given asymptotic behavior. Then, we prove that for strictly convex initial hypersurface satisfying certain conditions, the curvature flow exists for all time, and the normalized flow converges to a translating solution.</description>

      <title>Global existence and asymptotic behavior for diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi equations with Neumann boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi equation $$u_t-\Lap u = |\nabla u|^p$$ with $p&gt;1$, in a smooth bounded domain of $\RN$ with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions and $W^{1,\infty}$ initial data. We show that all solutions exist globally, are bounded and converge in $W^{1,\infty}$ norm to a constant as $t\to\infty$, with a uniform exponential rate of convergence given by the second Neumann eigenvalue. This improves previously known results, which provided only an upper polynomial bound on the rate of convergence and required the convexity of the domain. Furthermore, we extend these results to a rather large class of nonlinearities $F(\nabla u)$ instead of~$|\nabla u|^p$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a boundary observability result for a $1$d wave equation with a potential. We then deduce with a Schauder fixed-point argument the existence of a Neumann boundary control for a semi-linear wave equation $\partial_{tt}y - \partial_{xx}y + f(y) = 0$ under an optimal growth assumption at infinity on $f$ of the type $s\ln^2s$. Moreover, assuming additional assumption on $f'$, we construct a minimizing sequence which converges to a control. Numerical experiments illustrate the results. This work extends to the Neumann boundary control case the work of Zuazua in $1993$ and the work of M\"unch and Tr\'elat in $2022$.</description>

      <title>On The large Time Asymptotics of Schr\"odinger type equations with General Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.00724v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the Schr\"odinger equation with a general interaction term, which may be linear or nonlinear, time dependent and including charge transfer potentials, we prove the global solutions are asymptotically given by a free wave and a weakly localized part. The proof is based on constructing in a new way the Free Channel Wave Operator, and further tools from the recent works \cite{Liu-Sof1,Liu-Sof2,SW2020}. This work generalizes the results of the first part of \cite{Liu-Sof1,Liu-Sof2} to arbitrary dimension, and non-radial data.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness of the Primitive Equations of Large-Scale Ocean Dynamics with the Gent-McWilliams-Redi Eddy Parametrization Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove global well-posedness of the ocean primitive equations coupled to advection-diffusion equations of the oceanic tracers temperature and salinity that are supplemented by the eddy parametrization model due to Gent-McWilliams and Redi. This parametrization forms a milestone in global ocean modelling and constitutes a central part of any general ocean circulation model computation. The eddy parametrization adds a secondary transport velocity to the tracer equation and renders the original Laplacian operators in the advection-diffusion equations nonlinear, with a diffusion matrix that depends via the equation of state in a nonlinear fashion on both tracers simultaneously. The eddy parametrization of Gent-McWilliams-Redi augments the complexity of the mathematical analysis of the whole system which we present here. We show first that weak solutions exist globally in time, provided the parametrization uses a regularized density. Then we prove by a detailed analysis of the eddy operators the global well-posedness. Our results apply also to the ``small-slope approximation'' that is commonly used in global ocean simulations.</description>

      <title>A remark on randomization of a general function of negative regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study of partial differential equations (PDEs) with random initial data and singular stochastic PDEs with random forcing, we typically decompose a classically ill-defined solution map into two steps, where, in the first step, we use stochastic analysis to construct various stochastic objects. The simplest kind of such stochastic objects is the Wick powers of a basic stochastic term (namely a random linear solution, a stochastic convolution, or their sum). In the case of randomized initial data of a general function of negative regularity for studying nonlinear wave equations (NLW), we show necessity of imposing additional Fourier-Lebesgue regularity for constructing Wick powers by exhibiting examples of functions slightly outside $L^2(\mathbb T^d)$ such that the associated Wick powers do not exist. This shows that probabilistic well-posedness theory for NLW with general randomized initial data fails in negative Sobolev spaces (even with renormalization). Similar examples also apply to stochastic NLW and stochastic nonlinear heat equations with general white-in-time stochastic forcing, showing necessity of appropriate Fourier-Lebesgue $\gamma$-radonifying regularity in the construction of the Wick powers of the associated stochastic convolution.</description>

      <title>On Choquet integrals and Sobolev type inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider integrals in the sense of Choquet with respect to the $\delta$-dimensional Hausdorff content for continuously differentiable functions defined on open, connected sets in the Euclidean $n$-space, $n\geq 2$, $0&lt;\delta\le n$. In particular, for these functions we prove Sobolev inequalities in the limiting case $p=\delta /n$ and in the case $p&gt;\delta$, here $p$ is the integrability exponent of the absolute value of the gradient of any given function. The results complement previously known Poincar\'e-Sobolev and Morrey inequalities.</description>

      <title>Weighted Trudinger-Moser inequalities in the subcritical Sobolev spaces and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study boundedness, optimality and attainability of Trudinger-Moser type maximization problems in the radial and the subcritical homogeneous Sobolev spaces $\dot{W}^{1,p}_{0, \text{rad}}(B_R^N)\,(p&lt;N)$. Our results give a revision of an error in \cite[Theorem C]{HL}. Also, our inequality converges to the original Trudinger-Moser inequality as $p \nearrow N$ including optimal exponent and concentration limit. Finally, we consider an application of our inequality to elliptic problems with exponential nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>A variational formulation of a Multi-Population Mean Field Games with non-local interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a MFG model with quadratic Hamiltonian involving $N$ populations. This results in a system of $N$ Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and $N$ Fokker-Planck equations with non-local interactions. As in the classical case we introduce an Eulerian variational formulation which, despite the non convexity of the interaction, still gives a weak solution to the MFG model. The problem can be reformulated in Lagrangian terms and solved numerically by a Sinkhorn-like scheme. We present numerical results based on this approach, these simulations exhibit different behaviours depending on the nature (repulsive or attractive) of the non-local interaction.</description>

      <title>Near soliton evolution for $2$-equivariant Schr\"odinger Maps in two space dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider equivariant solutions for the Schr\"odinger Map equation in $2+1$ dimensions, with values into $\mathbb{S}^2$. Within each equivariance class $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ this admits a lowest energy nontrivial steady state $Q^m$, which extends to a two dimensional family of steady states by scaling and rotation. If $|m| \geq 3$ then these ground states are known to be stable in the energy space $\dot H^1$, whereas instability and even finite time blow-up along the ground state family may occur if $|m| = 1$. In this article we consider the most delicate case $|m| = 2$. Our main result asserts that small $\dot H^1$ perturbations of the ground state $Q^2$ yield global in time solutions, which satisfy global dispersive bounds. Unlike the higher equivariance classes, here we expect solutions to move arbitrarily far along the soliton family; however, we are able to provide a time dependent bound on the growth of the scale modulation parameter. We also show that within the equivariant class the ground state is stable in a slightly stronger topology $X \subset \dot H^1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the real parts of equivariant (but non-invariant) eigenfunctions of generic bundle metrics on nontrivial principal $S^1$ bundles over manifolds of any dimension have connected nodal sets and exactly 2 nodal domains. This generalizes earlier results of the authors in the $3$-dimensional case. The failure of the results on for non-free $S^1$ actions is illustrated on even dimensional spheres by one-parameter subgroups of rotations whose fixed point set consists of two antipodal points.</description>

      <title>A Policy Iteration Method for Inverse Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a policy iteration method to solve an inverse problem for a mean-field game (MFG) model, specifically to reconstruct the obstacle function in the game from the partial observation data of value functions, which represent the optimal costs for agents. The proposed approach decouples this complex inverse problem, which is an optimization problem constrained by a coupled nonlinear forward and backward PDE system in the MFG, into several iterations of solving linear PDEs and linear inverse problems. This method can also be viewed as a fixed-point iteration that simultaneously solves the MFG system and inversion. We prove its linear rate of convergence. In addition, numerical examples in 1D and 2D, along with performance comparisons to a direct least-squares method, demonstrate the superior efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method for solving inverse MFGs.</description>
