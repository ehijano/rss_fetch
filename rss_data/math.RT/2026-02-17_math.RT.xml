      <title>Unitary Invariants of the Finite Heisenberg Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polynomial invariants of a group action often appear only in high degree, and in many representations the invariant ring imposes severe degree constraints before any nontrivial invariants can occur. In contrast, the larger class of unitary invariants -- polynomials in both the variables and their conjugates -- typically exhibits very different behavior, and their separating power is comparatively unexplored.
  We highlight this contrast in the setting of the finite Heisenberg group $H_N$. Although the polynomial invariant ring $\mathbb{C}[V]^{H_N}$ contains no nontrivial elements below degree $N$, we show that degree-six unitary invariants are already sufficient to separate generic $H_N$-orbits up to a global phase factor. These invariants arise from cubic equations involving the magnitudes of a vector and its discrete Fourier transform. A single polynomial invariant in degree $N$ then resolves the remaining global phase, yielding full generic orbit separation. Our proof utilizes fundamental results from phase retrieval. Along the way we will also explore the utility of unitary invariants in obtaining improved degree bounds for representations of cyclic groups.
  This paper provides a concrete example in which the minimal separating degree for unitary invariants is dramatically lower than the minimal degree for polynomial invariants.</description>

      <title>Integrable Representations for Toroidal Lie Algebras Co-ordinated by Rational Quantum Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify irreducible integrable modules with finite-dimensional weight spaces for toroidal Lie algebras coordinated by rational quantum torus with trivial central action. Let $\mathbb{C}_q$ denote the rational quantum torus associated with a rational quantum matrix $q$, and let $\hat{\tau}(d,q)$ be the toroidal Lie algebra coordinated by rational quantum torus obtained by adjoining the derivation space $D$ to the universal central extension $\tilde{\tau}(d,q)=\mathfrak{sl}_d(\mathbb{C}_q)\oplus HC_1(\mathbb{C}_q)$ of $\mathfrak{sl}_d(\mathbb{C}_q)$. The case of nontrivial central action was previously classified by S. Eswara Rao and K. Zhao. The present work completes the classification by describing all irreducible integrable $\hat{\tau}(d,q)$-modules with finite-dimensional weight spaces in the case where the $n$-dimensional center $C$ acts trivially on the modules.</description>

      <title>On silting complexes associated to n-silting modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any (n+1)-term silting complex whose intermediate cohomology vanishes gives rise to an n-silting module, as recently introduced by Mao. Specializing to commutative noetherian rings, we show that this assignment induces a bijection on the respective equivalence classes. Furthermore, we prove in the same setting that the n-silting modules always correspond to a tilting complex, that is, the associated t-structure is of derived type. We use this to exhibit new examples of tilting complexes in the setting of Commutative Algebra and also to show that the finite type property for n-silting modules, as formulated by Mao, can in general fail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define linear degenerations of Schubert varieties via a special class of quiver Grassmannians. To do so, we restrict our study to an appropriate subvariety in the variety of representations of the considered quiver and describe a base change action on this subvariety. We provide two explicit parametrisations for the orbits of this action, one of which encodes the partial order relations on such orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $G$ a complex reductive group and $B \subseteq G$ a Borel subgroup, we provide a reduction rule for certain weight multiplicities in Demazure modules $V_\lambda^w$: given a weight $\mu$ on a face of the associated weight polytope $P_\lambda^w$, we reduce the computation of the dimension of the weight space $V_\lambda^w(\mu)$ to a similar problem of computing the weight space dimension for a Demazure module of a Levi subgroup of $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, in residue characteristic 2 and 3, we extend the construction of epipelagic representations of Reeder--Yu to produce new supercuspidals of higher depth, building on work of Gastineau. In particular, we produce examples of epipelagic representations that do not arise from the construction of Reeder--Yu.</description>

Abstract: We consider a new correspondence between representations of algebras with radical square zero and
  representations of species. We show that the stable category of representations of such algebra embeds
  into the representation category of the corresponding species and show how one reconstruct the Auslander-Reiten
  quiver of the algebra from the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the species.</description>

      <title>Triangulated categories with a compact silting object, Brown-Comenetz duality and Brown representability theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a dual framework for Neeman's results concerning triangulated categories with compact silting objects by employing Brown--Comenetz duality. This framework introduces an intrinsic non-compact subcategory, provides its characterization, and demonstrates representability theorems for both the low-bounded and bounded subcategories. Additionally, it elucidates how recollements are restricted to short exact sequences on the dual (non-compact) side. Several localization results and specific applications are also derived.</description>

      <title>Relative Character Asymptotics Beyond Stability for $\mathrm{PGL}_2 \times \mathrm{GL}_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotics of relative characters for real Lie groups were studied for representations $(\pi, \sigma)$ arising from Gan-Gross-Prasad pairs $(G,H)$ by Nelson and Venkatesh. They successfully compute the asymptotics of relative characters whenever the conductor of the associated Rankin-Selberg $L$-function $L(\pi \boxtimes \sigma^\vee)$ lies in a stable locus, i.e. away from conductor dropping. In this paper, we express asymptotics for relative characters in the non-archimedean setting for $(\mathrm{PGL}_2, \mathrm{GL}_1)$. The key new innovation is that our method overcomes the stability hypothesis and allows for significant conductor dropping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G/K$ be a Hermitian symmetric space and $V_\tau$ an irreducible representation of $K$. We study the ring $\mathcal D^G(G/K, V_\tau)$ of $G$-invariant differential operators on sections of vector bundles $G\times_{(K, \tau)} V_\tau$ over $G/K$ defined by a finite-dimensional representation $(V_\tau, \tau)$ of $K$. We classify irreducible representations $(V_\tau, \tau)$ such that $\mathcal D^G(G/K, V_\tau)$ is commutative. We construct eigenfunctions for the differential operators and study the invariance property of the eigenvalues under the Weyl group for the restricted real root system of $G$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that a recent condition of Lyons--Mart\'inez--Navarro--Tiep, regarding the field of values of extensions of characters in principal blocks, is satisfied for all finite simple groups, which when combined with their results gives a new characterization of finite groups with a normal $\ell$-complement for a prime $\ell$. This leads us to study the distribution of characters in unipotent blocks of disconnected reductive groups and show that this is well-behaved under a generalization of $d$-Harish-Chandra theory. We go on to study the blockwise Galois--McKay (also known as the Alperin--McKay--Navarro) conjecture for the blocks of almost (quasi-)simple groups above unipotent blocks.</description>

      <title>Rook placements and coadjoint orbits for maximal unipotent subgroups of finite symplectic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $U$ be a maximal unipotent subgroup in a symplectic group over a finite field of sufficiently large characteristic $p$. According to the Kirillov's orbit method, the coadjoint orbits of the group $U$ play the key role in the description of irreducible complex characters of $U$. Almost all important classes of orbits and characters studied to the moment can be uniformly described as the orbits and characters associated with so-called orthogonal rook placements. In the paper, we construct a semi-direct decomposition for the corresponding irreducible characters in the spirit of the Mackey little group method. As a corollary, we present an explicit formula for the character corresponding to an orbit of maximal possible dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive group defined and split over a non-archimedean local field $F$. We give a new geometric proof of a special case of a recent theorem of Solleveld. Namely, we show that the class of standard Iwahori-spherical $G(F)$-representations, a notion a priori dependent on the coefficient field being the complex numbers, is actually defined over $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$.
  An unpublished theorem of Clozel, proven with global techniques, says that the class of essentially square-integrable representations is also defined over $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$. As an application of our main result, we give a local proof of this theorem for $G=\mathrm{GL}_n$.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic tensor products and a Ganea-type extension of the five-term exact sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03951v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a right-exactness theorem for the cross-effects of bifunctors, and consequently for cosmash products, in Janelidze-M\'arki-Tholen semi-abelian categories. This result motivates an intrinsic definition of a symmetric bilinear, actually bi-right exact and for varieties even bi-cocontinuous product, a tensor-like operation on objects of a category, constructed in terms of limits and colimits. Given two objects in the category, their bilinear product is the abelian object obtained as the cosmash product in the category of two-nilpotent objects of the reflections of these objects. In many concrete cases, this operation, applied to a pair of abelian objects, captures a classical tensor product. We explain this by proving a recognition theorem, which states that any symmetric, bi-cocontinuous bifunctor on an abelian variety of algebras can be recovered as the bilinear product within a suitable semi-abelian variety, namely of algebras over a certain 2-nilpotent symmetric operad. In other words, the extra structure carried by such a bifunctor on the abelian variety (for instance, a tensor product, known in the literature) is encoded by means of a surrounding semi-abelian variety whose abelian core is the original variety.
  We illustrate the construction with several examples, develop its basic properties, and compare it to the semi-abelian analogue of the Brown-Loday non-abelian tensor product. As an application, we present a categorical version of Ganea's six-term exact homology sequence. Finally, we characterise abelian extensions via internal action cores, yielding explicit descriptions of cosmash products and bilinear products in certain categories of representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove one direction of a conjecture of Navarro-Rizo-Schaeffer Fry-Vallejo positing an algorithm to determine from the character table whether a finite group has $2$-generated Sylow $3$-subgroups. This gives further evidence of the blockwise version of the Galois-McKay conjecture (also known as the Alperin-McKay-Navarro conjecture). A key step involves proving the Isaacs-Navarro Galois conjecture for principal blocks for finite groups with a certain structure.</description>

      <title>Jucys--Murphy Elements for Wreath Products and Their Application to Dynamical Random Multi-Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equivalence classes of irreducible representations of wreath product $\mathfrak{S}_n(T) = T^n \rtimes \mathfrak{S}_n$ of finite group $T$ with respect to symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ are parametrized by $\mathbb{Y}_n(\widehat{T})$, the $\lvert \widehat{T}\rvert$-tuple Young diagrams with total size $n$. We show a formula connecting the Kerov transition measures of these Young diagrams with the Jucys--Murphy elements of $\mathfrak{S}_n(T)$. This formula is due to Biane in the case of symmetric groups. The formula enables us to investigate asymptotic property of the shapes of multi-diagrams through combinatorial analysis for the Jucys--Murphy elements. On the other hand, a Markov chain is introduced on $\mathbb{Y}_n(\widehat{T})$, canonically reflecting the branching rule for the tower of wreath product groups. We have a continuous time stochastic process on $\mathbb{Y}_n(\widehat{T})$ from this chain by replacing the discrete time by a counting process. Our project is to specify the deterministic limit shape of multi-diagrams at each macroscopic time through appropriate space-time scaling limit, and to describe evolution of related quantities characterizing the shape. Especially, we derive dynamical concentrated limit shapes in the case of abelian $T$ by using free probability tools under the assumption of approximate factorization property for initial ensembles with an additional property of a pausing time distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new integral representation of the $\wedge^2 \otimes \mathrm{std}_2$ $L$-function of generic cusp forms on $\mathbf{GU}_{2,2}\times \mathbf{GL}_2$ and $\mathbf{GL}_4 \times \mathbf{GL}_2$ and we use it to prove a relation between its central $L$-value and the non-spherical period over $\mathbf{GL}_2 \times_{\mathrm{det}} \mathbf{GL}_2$. Exploiting the theta correspondence for $(\mathbf{GL}_4,\mathbf{GL}_4)$, we obtain a relation between the central value of the $L$-function attached to the strongly tempered spherical pair $(\mathbf{GL}_4 \times \mathbf{GL}_2,\mathbf{GL}_2 \times \mathbf{GL}_2)$ and its associated period. In the case of cusp forms on $\mathbf{GL}_4 \times \mathbf{GL}_2$ that are unramified everywhere, our formula gives new evidence towards a conjecture of Wan-Zhang.</description>

      <title>Weakly $\sqrt{J}U$ Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the so-called {\it weakly $\sqrt{J}U$ rings} (hereafter abbreviated as {\it $W\sqrt{J}U$ rings} for short), in which every unit is of the form $j+1$ or $j-1$ for some $j$ in $\sqrt{J(R)} : = \{x \in R : x^n \in J(R) \text{ for some } n\ge 1\}$. This class of rings non-trivially generalizes the classes of $\sqrt{J}U$, $UU$, $JU$, $WUU$ and $WJU$ rings, respectively. We investigate their basic properties showing that they are Dedekind-finite, that $M_n(R)$ is never $W\sqrt{J}U$ for $n\ge 2$, and that when $\operatorname{char}(R)&gt;0$ it must be equal to $2^\alpha 3^\beta$ for some $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{N} \cup \left\{ 0 \right\}$. Moreover, for group rings $RG$, we prove that if $RG$ is $W\sqrt{J}U$, then $R$ is $W\sqrt{J}U$ and $G$ is a torsion group. In addition, when $R$ has positive characteristic and $G$ is a locally finite $p$-group, we give a complete characterization like this: $RG$ is a $W\sqrt{J}U$ ring if, and only if, either $R$ is a $\sqrt{J}U$ ring and $G$ is a $2$-group, or $R$ is a $W\sqrt{J}U$ ring with $3\in J(R)$ and $G$ is a $3$-group, or $R\cong R_1\times R_2$ with $R_1$ a $\sqrt{J}U$ ring, $R_2$ a $W\sqrt{J}U$ ring and $G$ a trivial group. 
  Our results substantially improve on recent achievements due to Saini and Udar in Czech. Math. J. (2025).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following Hausel-Hitchin, we investigate core Lagrangians and upward flows in Hilbert schemes of points on elliptic surfaces. We compute the scheme-theoretic multiplicities of core Lagrangians, as well as the equivariant multiplicities of the very stable ones. Furthermore, we extend the notion of equivariant multiplicity to wobbly components and compute it for Hilbert schemes of two points. Inspired by Eisenstein series functor in Dolbeault Langlands correspondence, we propose that upward flows of very stable ideals are mirror dual to modified Procesi bundles, and justify this claim through numerical checks. Finally, we make some conjectures about extending this picture to wobbly upward flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We will attach a scalar invariant to a tetrahedron whose edges are labelled by irreducible representations of a ternary orthogonal group $\mathrm{SO}_3$ over a local field. This generalizes the $6j$ symbol whose theory was developed by Racah, Wigner, and Regge.
  We give several formulas for this invariant, including in terms of hypergeometric-type integrals and functions, and show that it admits a symmetry by the the $23040$-element Weyl group of $\mathrm{Spin}_{12}$. We then interpret these results in terms of relative Langlands duality, where the dual story comes from the action of $\mathrm{Spin}_{12}$ on a $16$-dimensional cone of spinors.</description>

      <title>Semigroups from full lattices in commutative ${\mathbb Q}$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The full lattices in a finite dimensional commutative ${\mathbb Q}$-algebra form a commutative semigroup. In the case of an algebraic number field the top part of a certain quotient semigroup is the class group. For a separable algebra some basic results, especially the Jordan-Zassenhaus theorem, are known for this quotient semigroup. This paper considers also algebras which are not separable. It studies the commutative semigroup of full lattices in such an algebra and also the quotient semigroup. This leads in this commutative, but not separable situation to a certain extension of the Jordan-Zassenhaus theorem. One application concerns $GL_n({\mathbb Z})$-conjugacy classes of regular integer $n\times n$ matrices.</description>

      <title>Derived Picard groups of symmetric representation-finite algebras of type $D$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.09257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explicitly describe the derived Picard groups of symmetric representation-finite algebras of type $D$. In particular, we prove that these groups are generated by spherical twists along collections of $0$-spherical objects, the shift and autoequivalences which come from outer automorphisms of a particular representative of the derived equivalence class. The arguments we use are based on the fact that symmetric representation-finite algebras are tilting-connected. To apply this result we in particular develop a combinatorial-geometric model for silting mutations in type $D$, generalising the classical concepts of Brauer trees and Kauer moves. Another key ingredient in the proof is the faithfulness of the braid group action via spherical twists along $D$-configurations of $0$-spherical objects.</description>

      <title>On $d$-term silting objects, torsion classes, and cotorsion classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite-dimensional algebra $\Lambda$ over an algebraically closed field $K$, it is known that the poset of $2$-term silting objects in $\mathrm{K}^b(\operatorname{proj}\Lambda)$ is isomorphic to the poset of functorially finite torsion classes in $\operatorname{mod}\Lambda$, and to that of complete cotorsion classes in $\mathrm{K}^{[-1,0]}(\operatorname{proj}\Lambda)$. In this work, we generalise this result to the case of $d$-term silting objects for arbitrary $d\geq 2$ by introducing the notion of torsion classes for extriangulated categories. In particular, we show that the poset of $d$-term silting objects in $\mathrm{K}^b(\operatorname{proj}\Lambda)$ is isomorphic to the poset of complete and hereditary cotorsion classes in $\mathrm{K}^{[-d+1,0]}(\operatorname{proj}\Lambda)$, and to that of positive and functorially finite torsion classes in $D^{[-d+2,0]}(\operatorname{mod}\Lambda)$, an extension-closed subcategory of $D^b(\operatorname{mod}\Lambda)$. We further show that the posets $\operatorname{cotors}\mathrm{K}^{[-d+1,0]}(\operatorname{proj}\Lambda)$ and $\operatorname{tors} D^{[-d+2,0]}(\operatorname{mod}\Lambda)$ are lattices, and that the truncation functor $\tau_{\geq -d+2}$ gives an isomorphism between the two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite-dimensional algebra {\Lambda}, we establish an explicit bijection between widely generated torsion(-free) classes and semibricks in mod {\Lambda}. Using the kappa order on the lattice of torsion classes with canonical join representations, we provide several equivalent conditions for brick-finite algebras. We show that {\Lambda} is brick-finite if and only if any chain of wide subcategories of mod {\Lambda} becomes eventually constant, if and only if any torsion class in mod {\Lambda} has finitely many covers, if and only if every semibrick in mod {\Lambda} is a finite set. Thus, we give a proof of Enomoto's conjecture (Adv. Math., 393 (2021), 108113). As a consequence, we show that {\Lambda} is brick-finite if and only if every wide subcategory closed under coproducts of Mod {\Lambda} is closed under products, if and only if every wide subcategory of mod {\Lambda} is functorially finite. This gives a positive answer to the question posed by Angeleri H\"ugel and Sentieri (J. Algebra, 664 (2025), 164-205).</description>

      <title>Higher torsion classes, $\tau_d$-tilting theory and silting complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Initiated in work by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten, the area known as $\tau$-tilting theory plays a fundamental role in contemporary representation theory. In this paper we explore a higher-dimensional analogue of this theory, formulated with respect to the higher Auslander-Reiten translation $\tau_d$. In particular, we associate to any functorially finite $d$-torsion class a maximal $\tau_d$-rigid pair and a $(d+1)$-term silting complex. In the case $d=1$, the notions of maximal $\tau_d$-rigid and support $\tau$-tilting pairs coincide, and our theory recovers the classical bijections. However, the proof strategies for $d&gt;1$ differ significantly. As an intermediate step, we prove that a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of a module category induces a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of the category of $(d+1)$-term complexes, producing novel examples of $d$-exact categories. We introduce the notion of a $d$-torsion class in the exact setup, and use this to obtain the aforementioned $(d+1)$-term silting complex. We moreover apply our theory to study $d$-APR tilting modules and slices. To illustrate our results, we provide explicit combinatorial descriptions of maximal $\tau_d$-rigid pairs and $(d+1)$-term silting complexes for higher Auslander and higher Nakayama algebras.</description>

Our amenable signed permutations index flagged theta and eta polynomials, which generalize the double theta and eta polynomials of Wilson and the author.

      <description>arXiv:2305.10604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the first in a series of papers, where we introduce and study topological spaces that realize the algebras of quasi-invariants of finite reflection groups. Our result can be viewed as a generalization of a well-known theorem of A. Borel that realizes the ring of invariant polynomials a Weyl group $W$ as a cohomology ring of the classifying space $BG$ of the associated Lie group $G$. In the present paper, we state our realization problem for the algebras of quasi-invariants of Weyl groups and give its solution in the rank one case (for $G = SU(2)$). We call the resulting $G$-spaces $ F_m(G,T) $ the $m$-quasi-flag manifolds and their Borel homotopy quotients $ X_m(G,T) $ the spaces of $m$-quasi-invariants. We compute the equivariant $K$-theory and the equivariant (complex analytic) elliptic cohomology of these spaces and identify them with exponential and elliptic quasi-invariants of $W$. We also extend our construction of spaces quasi-invariants to a certain class of finite loop spaces $ \Omega B $ of homotopy type of $ S^3 $ originally introduced by D. L. Rector. We study the cochain spectra $ C^*(X_m,k) $ associated to the spaces of quasi-invariants and show that these are Gorenstein commutative ring spectra in the sense of Dwyer, Greenlees and Iyengar.</description>

      <title>$p$-curvature of periodic pencils of flat connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05652v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2401.00636 we introduced the notion of a periodic pencil of flat connections on a smooth variety $X$. Namely, a pencil is a linear family of flat connections $\nabla(s_1,...,s_n)=d-\sum_{i=1}^r\sum_{j=1}^ns_jB_{ij}dx_i,$ where $\lbrace x_i\rbrace$ are coordinates on $X$ and $B_{ij}: X\to {\rm Mat}_N$ are matrix-valued regular functions. A pencil is periodic if it is generically invariant under the shifts $s_j\mapsto s_j+1$ up to isomorphism. In this paper we show that in characteristic $p&gt;0$, the $p$-curvature operators $\lbrace C_i,1\le i\le r\rbrace$ of a periodic pencil $\nabla$ are isospectral to the commuting endomorphisms $C_i^*:=\sum_{j=1}^n (s_j-s_j^p)B_{ij}^{(1)}$, where $B_{ij}^{(1)}$ is the Frobenius twist of $B_{ij}$. Using the results of arXiv:2401.00636, this allows us to compute the eigenvalues of the $p$-curvature for many important examples of pencils of flat connections, including Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ), Casimir, and Dunkl connections, their confluent limits, and equivariant quantum connections for conical symplectic resolutions with finitely many torus fixed points. In particular, for rational values of parameters these eigenvalues are zero, so the connections are globally nilpotent. We also show that every periodic pencil has regular singularites and its residues have rational eigenvalues for rational values of parameters. In particular, this holds for the aforementioned quantum connections if they have rational coefficients. Also we generalize these results to irregular pencils (KZ, Casimir, Dunkl, and Toda), and relate them in the Dunkl case to representations of rational Cherednik algebras. Finally, we extend our main result to pseudo-pencils and discuss the generalization to difference equations.</description>

      <title>Partially hyperbolic flows on flat vector bundles with an application to complete affine manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a manifold of dimension $m$ with a flat vector bundle given by a representation $\rho:\pi_1(N) \rightarrow \mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbf{R})$ where $\pi_1(N)$ is finitely generated. The holonomy group $\rho$ is a $k$-partially hyperbolic holonomy representation if the flat bundle pulled back over the unit tangent bundle of a sufficiently large compact submanifold of $N$ splits into expanding, neutral, and contracting subbundles along the geodesic flow, where the expanding and contracting subbundles are $k$-dimensional with $k &lt; n/2$. Suppose that each element of $\rho(\pi_1(N))$ has an eigenvalue of norm $1$, or, alternatively, $\rho$ has some singular values of subexponential growth in terms of word length. We show that $\rho$ is a $P$-Anosov representation for a parabolic subgroup $P$ of $\mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbf{R})$ if and only if $\rho$ is a partially hyperbolic representation. We are going to primarily employ representation theory techniques. As an application, we will show that the equivalence holds when $N$ is a complete affine $n$-manifold, and $\rho$ is a linear part of the holonomy representation. This had never been done over the full general linear group.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence between the existence of $n$-kernels and $n$-cokernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an elementary proof of the statement that if an idempotent complete preadditive category has weak kernels and weak cokernels, then it has $n$-kernels if and only if it has $n$-cokernels, where $n$ is a nonnegative integer. As a consequence, elementary proofs of two results concerning the equality between the global dimensions of certain right and left module categories are obtained.</description>

      <title>Groups and quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are intereseted in quandles and their enveloping groups. Various results are proven. We show that a quandle $Q$ and its image in the enveloping group $G(Q)$ have isomorphic enveloping groups. The image quandle is injective. For $Q$ a finite quandle, we show that $G(Q)$ admits a faithfull representation $\rho : G(Q)\to GL_n(\mathbb{Z})$ for some $n$; an irreducible representation of $G(Q)$ over $\mathbb{C}$ is finite dimensional an its degree divides the order of the group $Inn(Q)$ of inner automorphism of $Q$ and is bounded by $\sqrt{\vert Inn(Q) \vert }$. We determine the Malcev Lie algebra and the rational cohomology ring of $G(Q)$ for $Q$ finite. We prove that a finite injective quandle is a subquandle (for conjugacy) of a finite group. We also prove that the only finite subquandles (for conjugacy) of uniquely divisible groups are trivial quandles and that morphisms from quandles to nilpotent groups (for conjugacy) are constant on the indecomposable components. Implication of these results are considered.</description>

      <title>Massless Representations in Conformal Space and Their de Sitter (dS) Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The monograph develops a self-contained, mathematically rigorous framework for massless representations of the conformal group U(2,2) and their restriction to the de Sitter group Sp(2,2). It systematically constructs ladder (massless) representations, computes invariant bilinear forms and Casimir operators, and provides explicit constructions of vertex operators and two-point functions for low-helicity fields. The monograph employs a novel Clifford-split-octonion approach, embedding 8-component Majorana spinors within an alternative composition algebra, which allows for fully explicit algebraic, spinorial, and geometric constructions. The text bridges foundational representation theory, explicit computational methods, and physical applications in quantum field theory and cosmology. While targeted at researchers in mathematical physics, quantum cosmology, and quantum field theory, the exposition is pedagogically structured to guide advanced graduate students through subtle algebraic and representation-theoretic ideas, making complex constructions accessible without sacrificing rigor.</description>

      <title>A proof of Dolbeault geometric Langlands for $\mathrm{GL}_2$ with reduced spectral curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper with Tudor P\u{a}durariu, we introduced the notion of limit categories for moduli stacks of Higgs bundles and formulated the Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence. These limit categories are expected to provide an effective ``classical limit'' of the categories of D-modules on the moduli stack of bundles, and our formulation links categorical Donaldson-Thomas theory with the geometric Langlands correspondence.
  In this paper, we prove the above Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence for $\mathrm{GL}_2$ over the locus in the Hitchin base where the spectral curves are reduced. This is the first non-trivial case in which the relevant moduli stacks are not quasi-compact, and the use of limit categories is essential to the formulation and proof of the correspondence.
  Our approach also outlines a strategy for proving the correspondence in greater generality and explains the current obstructions to such an extension.</description>
