      <title>Can Emotion Fool Anti-spoofing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional anti-spoofing focuses on models and datasets built on synthetic speech with mostly neutral state, neglecting diverse emotional variations. As a result, their robustness against high-quality, emotionally expressive synthetic speech is uncertain. We address this by introducing EmoSpoof-TTS, a corpus of emotional text-to-speech samples. Our analysis shows existing anti-spoofing models struggle with emotional synthetic speech, exposing risks of emotion-targeted attacks. Even trained on emotional data, the models underperform due to limited focus on emotional aspect and show performance disparities across emotions. This highlights the need for emotion-focused anti-spoofing paradigm in both dataset and methodology. We propose GEM, a gated ensemble of emotion-specialized models with a speech emotion recognition gating network. GEM performs effectively across all emotions and neutral state, improving defenses against spoofing attacks. We release the EmoSpoof-TTS Dataset: https://emospoof-tts.github.io/Dataset/</description>

      <title>Fine-tune Before Structured Pruning: Towards Compact and Accurate Self-Supervised Models for Speaker Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models like WavLM can be effectively utilized when building speaker diarization systems but are often large and slow, limiting their use in resource constrained scenarios. Previous studies have explored compression techniques, but usually for the price of degraded performance at high pruning ratios. In this work, we propose to compress SSL models through structured pruning by introducing knowledge distillation. Different from the existing works, we emphasize the importance of fine-tuning SSL models before pruning. Experiments on far-field single-channel AMI, AISHELL-4, and AliMeeting datasets show that our method can remove redundant parameters of WavLM Base+ and WavLM Large by up to 80% without any performance degradation. After pruning, the inference speeds on a single GPU for the Base+ and Large models are 4.0 and 2.6 times faster, respectively. Our source code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>MOPSA: Mixture of Prompt-Experts Based Speaker Adaptation for Elderly Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Mixture of Prompt-Experts based Speaker Adaptation approach (MOPSA) for elderly speech recognition. It allows zero-shot, real-time adaptation to unseen speakers, and leverages domain knowledge tailored to elderly speakers. Top-K most distinctive speaker prompt clusters derived using K-means serve as experts. A router network is trained to dynamically combine clustered prompt-experts. Acoustic and language level variability among elderly speakers are modelled using separate encoder and decoder prompts for Whisper. Experiments on the English DementiaBank Pitt and Cantonese JCCOCC MoCA elderly speech datasets suggest that online MOPSA adaptation outperforms the speaker-independent (SI) model by statistically significant word error rate (WER) or character error rate (CER) reductions of 0.86% and 1.47% absolute (4.21% and 5.40% relative). Real-time factor (RTF) speed-up ratios of up to 16.12 times are obtained over offline batch-mode adaptation.</description>

      <title>Probing the Robustness Properties of Neural Speech Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural speech codecs have revolutionized speech coding, achieving higher compression while preserving audio fidelity. Beyond compression, they have emerged as tokenization strategies, enabling language modeling on speech and driving paradigm shifts across various speech processing tasks. Despite these advancements, their robustness in noisy environments remains underexplored, raising concerns about their generalization to real-world scenarios. In this work, we systematically evaluate neural speech codecs under various noise conditions, revealing non-trivial differences in their robustness. We further examine their linearity properties, uncovering non-linear distortions which partly explain observed variations in robustness. Lastly, we analyze their frequency response to identify factors affecting audio fidelity. Our findings provide critical insights into codec behavior and future codec design, as well as emphasizing the importance of noise robustness for their real-world integration.</description>

      <title>A Perception-Based L2 Speech Intelligibility Indicator: Leveraging a Rater's Shadowing and Sequence-to-sequence Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating L2 speech intelligibility is crucial for effective computer-assisted language learning (CALL). Conventional ASR-based methods often focus on native-likeness, which may fail to capture the actual intelligibility perceived by human listeners. In contrast, our work introduces a novel, perception based L2 speech intelligibility indicator that leverages a native rater's shadowing data within a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) voice conversion framework. By integrating an alignment mechanism and acoustic feature reconstruction, our approach simulates the auditory perception of native listeners, identifying segments in L2 speech that are likely to cause comprehension difficulties. Both objective and subjective evaluations indicate that our method aligns more closely with native judgments than traditional ASR-based metrics, offering a promising new direction for CALL systems in a global, multilingual contexts.</description>

      <title>When Humans Growl and Birds Speak: High-Fidelity Voice Conversion from Human to Animal and Designed Sounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human to non-human voice conversion (H2NH-VC) transforms human speech into animal or designed vocalizations. Unlike prior studies focused on dog-sounds and 16 or 22.05kHz audio transformation, this work addresses a broader range of non-speech sounds, including natural sounds (lion-roars, birdsongs) and designed voice (synthetic growls). To accomodate generation of diverse non-speech sounds and 44.1kHz high-quality audio transformation, we introduce a preprocessing pipeline and an improved CVAE-based H2NH-VC model, both optimized for human and non-human voices. Experimental results showed that the proposed method outperformed baselines in quality, naturalness, and similarity MOS, achieving effective voice conversion across diverse non-human timbres. Demo samples are available at https://nc-ai.github.io/speech/publications/nonhuman-vc/</description>

      <title>Speech Token Prediction via Compressed-to-fine Language Modeling for Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs, used as speech tokenizers, have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of speech generation. However, to ensure high-fidelity audio reconstruction, neural audio codecs typically encode audio into long sequences of speech tokens, posing a significant challenge for downstream language models in long-context modeling. We observe that speech token sequences exhibit short-range dependency: due to the monotonic alignment between text and speech in text-to-speech (TTS) tasks, the prediction of the current token primarily relies on its local context, while long-range tokens contribute less to the current token prediction and often contain redundant information. Inspired by this observation, we propose a \textbf{compressed-to-fine language modeling} approach to address the challenge of long sequence speech tokens within neural codec language models: (1) \textbf{Fine-grained Initial and Short-range Information}: Our approach retains the prompt and local tokens during prediction to ensure text alignment and the integrity of paralinguistic information; (2) \textbf{Compressed Long-range Context}: Our approach compresses long-range token spans into compact representations to reduce redundant information while preserving essential semantics. Extensive experiments on various neural audio codecs and downstream language models validate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of token compression in improving speech generation within neural codec language models. The demo of audio samples will be available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SpeechTokenPredictionViaCompressedToFinedLM.</description>

      <title>Pretraining Multi-Speaker Identification for Neural Speaker Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end speaker diarization enables accurate overlap-aware diarization by jointly estimating multiple speakers' speech activities in parallel. This approach is data-hungry, requiring a large amount of labeled conversational data, which cannot be fully obtained from real datasets alone. To address this issue, large-scale simulated data is often used for pretraining, but it requires enormous storage and I/O capacity, and simulating data that closely resembles real conversations remains challenging. In this paper, we propose pretraining a model to identify multiple speakers from an input fully overlapped mixture as an alternative to pretraining a diarization model. This method eliminates the need to prepare a large-scale simulated dataset while leveraging large-scale speaker recognition datasets for training. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method enables a highly accurate yet lightweight local diarization model without simulated conversational data.</description>

      <title>Identifying Primary Stress Across Related Languages and Dialects with Transformer-based Speech Encoder Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating primary stress identification has been an active research field due to the role of stress in encoding meaning and aiding speech comprehension. Previous studies relied mainly on traditional acoustic features and English datasets. In this paper, we investigate the approach of fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model with an audio frame classification head. Our experiments use a new Croatian training dataset, with test sets in Croatian, Serbian, the Chakavian dialect, and Slovenian. By comparing an SVM classifier using traditional acoustic features with the fine-tuned speech transformer, we demonstrate the transformer's superiority across the board, achieving near-perfect results for Croatian and Serbian, with a 10-point performance drop for the more distant Chakavian and Slovenian. Finally, we show that only a few hundred multi-syllabic training words suffice for strong performance. We release our datasets and model under permissive licenses.</description>

      <title>A Composite Predictive-Generative Approach to Monaural Universal Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is promising to design a single model that can suppress various distortions and improve speech quality, i.e., universal speech enhancement (USE). Compared to supervised learning-based predictive methods, diffusion-based generative models have shown greater potential due to the generative capacities from degraded speech with severely damaged information. However, artifacts may be introduced in highly adverse conditions, and diffusion models often suffer from a heavy computational burden due to many steps for inference. In order to jointly leverage the superiority of prediction and generation and overcome the respective defects, in this work we propose a universal speech enhancement model called PGUSE by combining predictive and generative modeling. Our model consists of two branches: the predictive branch directly predicts clean samples from degraded signals, while the generative branch optimizes the denoising objective of diffusion models. We utilize the output fusion and truncated diffusion scheme to effectively integrate predictive and generative modeling, where the former directly combines results from both branches and the latter modifies the reverse diffusion process with initial estimates from the predictive branch. Extensive experiments on several datasets verify the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the complementarity and benefits of combining predictive and generative modeling.</description>

      <title>"Dyadosyncrasy", Idiosyncrasy and Demographic Factors in Turn-Taking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turn-taking in dialogue follows universal constraints but also varies significantly. This study examines how demographic (sex, age, education) and individual factors shape turn-taking using a large dataset of US English conversations (Fisher). We analyze Transition Floor Offset (TFO) and find notable interspeaker variation. Sex and age have small but significant effects female speakers and older individuals exhibit slightly shorter offsets - while education shows no effect. Lighter topics correlate with shorter TFOs. However, individual differences have a greater impact, driven by a strong idiosyncratic and an even stronger "dyadosyncratic" component - speakers in a dyad resemble each other more than they resemble themselves in different dyads. This suggests that the dyadic relationship and joint activity are the strongest determinants of TFO, outweighing demographic influences.</description>

      <title>More-than-Human Storytelling: Designing Longitudinal Narrative Engagements with Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Longitudinal engagement with generative AI (GenAI) storytelling agents is a timely but less charted domain. We explored multi-generational experiences with "Dreamsmithy," a daily dream-crafting app, where participants (N = 28) co-created stories with AI narrator "Makoto" every day. Reflections and interactions were captured through a two-week diary study. Reflexive thematic analysis revealed themes likes "oscillating ambivalence" and "socio-chronological bonding," highlighting the complex dynamics that emerged between individuals and the AI narrator over time. Findings suggest that while people appreciated the personal notes, opportunities for reflection, and AI creativity, limitations in narrative coherence and control occasionally caused frustration. The results underscore the potential of GenAI for longitudinal storytelling, but also raise critical questions about user agency and ethics. We contribute initial empirical insights and design considerations for developing adaptive, more-than-human storytelling systems.</description>

      <title>Unified AI for Accurate Audio Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified AI framework for high-accuracy audio anomaly detection by integrating advanced noise reduction, feature extraction, and machine learning modeling techniques. The approach combines spectral subtraction and adaptive filtering to enhance audio quality, followed by feature extraction using traditional methods like MFCCs and deep embeddings from pre-trained models such as OpenL3. The modeling pipeline incorporates classical models (SVM, Random Forest), deep learning architectures (CNNs), and ensemble methods to boost robustness and accuracy. Evaluated on benchmark datasets including TORGO and LibriSpeech, the proposed framework demonstrates superior performance in precision, recall, and classification of slurred vs. normal speech. This work addresses challenges in noisy environments and real-time applications and provides a scalable solution for audio-based anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>4,500 Seconds: Small Data Training Approaches for Deep UAV Audio Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) usage is expected to surge in the coming decade, raising the need for heightened security measures to prevent airspace violations and security threats. This study investigates deep learning approaches to UAV classification focusing on the key issue of data scarcity. To investigate this we opted to train the models using a total of 4,500 seconds of audio samples, evenly distributed across a 9-class dataset. We leveraged parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and data augmentations to mitigate the data scarcity. This paper implements and compares the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention-based transformers. Our results show that, CNNs outperform transformers by 1-2\% accuracy, while still being more computationally efficient. These early findings, however, point to potential in using transformers models; suggesting that with more data and further optimizations they could outperform CNNs. Future works aims to upscale the dataset to better understand the trade-offs between these approaches.</description>

      <title>Learning Normal Patterns in Musical Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an unsupervised framework for detecting audio patterns in musical samples (loops) through anomaly detection techniques, addressing challenges in music information retrieval (MIR). Existing methods are often constrained by reliance on handcrafted features, domain-specific limitations, or dependence on iterative user interaction. We address these limitations through an architecture combining deep feature extraction with unsupervised anomaly detection. Our approach leverages a pre-trained Hierarchical Token-semantic Audio Transformer (HTS-AT), paired with a Feature Fusion Mechanism (FFM), to generate representations from variable-length audio loops. These embeddings are processed using one-class Deep Support Vector Data Description (Deep SVDD), which learns normative audio patterns by mapping them to a compact latent hypersphere. Evaluations on curated bass and guitar datasets compare standard and residual autoencoder variants against baselines like Isolation Forest (IF) and and principle component analysis (PCA) methods. Results show our Deep SVDD models, especially the residual autoencoder variant, deliver improved anomaly separation, particularly for larger variations. This research contributes a flexible, fully unsupervised solution for processing diverse audio samples, overcoming previous structural and input limitations while enabling effective pattern identification through distance-based latent space scoring.</description>

      <title>SpeechVerifier: Robust Acoustic Fingerprint against Tampering Attacks via Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the surge of social media, maliciously tampered public speeches, especially those from influential figures, have seriously affected social stability and public trust. Existing speech tampering detection methods remain insufficient: they either rely on external reference data or fail to be both sensitive to attacks and robust to benign operations, such as compression and resampling. To tackle these challenges, we introduce SpeechVerifer to proactively verify speech integrity using only the published speech itself, i.e., without requiring any external references. Inspired by audio fingerprinting and watermarking, SpeechVerifier can (i) effectively detect tampering attacks, (ii) be robust to benign operations and (iii) verify the integrity only based on published speeches. Briefly, SpeechVerifier utilizes multiscale feature extraction to capture speech features across different temporal resolutions. Then, it employs contrastive learning to generate fingerprints that can detect modifications at varying granularities. These fingerprints are designed to be robust to benign operations, but exhibit significant changes when malicious tampering occurs. To enable speech verification in a self-contained manner, the generated fingerprints are then embedded into the speech signal by segment-wise watermarking. Without external references, SpeechVerifier can retrieve the fingerprint from the published audio and check it with the embedded watermark to verify the integrity of the speech. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SpeechVerifier is effective in detecting tampering attacks and robust to benign operations.</description>

      <title>Patient-Aware Feature Alignment for Robust Lung Sound Classification:Cohesion-Separation and Global Alignment Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lung sound classification is vital for early diagnosis of respiratory diseases. However, biomedical signals often exhibit inter-patient variability even among patients with the same symptoms, requiring a learning approach that considers individual differences. We propose a Patient-Aware Feature Alignment (PAFA) framework with two novel losses, Patient Cohesion-Separation Loss (PCSL) and Global Patient Alignment Loss (GPAL). PCSL clusters features of the same patient while separating those from other patients to capture patient variability, whereas GPAL draws each patient's centroid toward a global center, preventing feature space fragmentation. Our method achieves outstanding results on the ICBHI dataset with a score of 64.84\% for four-class and 72.08\% for two-class classification. These findings highlight PAFA's ability to capture individualized patterns and demonstrate performance gains in distinct patient clusters, offering broader applications for patient-centered healthcare.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Classification of Maritime Vessels using Learnable Filterbanks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliably monitoring and recognizing maritime vessels based on acoustic signatures is complicated by the variability of different recording scenarios. A robust classification framework must be able to generalize across diverse acoustic environments and variable source-sensor distances. To this end, we present a deep learning model with robust performance across different recording scenarios. Using a trainable spectral front-end and temporal feature encoder to learn a Gabor filterbank, the model can dynamically emphasize different frequency components. Trained on the VTUAD hydrophone recordings from the Strait of Georgia, our model, CATFISH, achieves a state-of-the-art 96.63 % percent test accuracy across varying source-sensor distances, surpassing the previous benchmark by over 12 percentage points. We present the model, justify our architectural choices, analyze the learned Gabor filters, and perform ablation studies on sensor data fusion and attention-based pooling.</description>

      <title>FeatureSense: Protecting Speaker Attributes in Always-On Audio Sensing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio is a rich sensing modality that is useful for a variety of human activity recognition tasks. However, the ubiquitous nature of smartphones and smart speakers with always-on microphones has led to numerous privacy concerns and a lack of trust in deploying these audio-based sensing systems. This paper addresses this critical challenge of preserving user privacy when using audio for sensing applications while maintaining utility. While prior work focuses primarily on protecting recoverable speech content, we show that sensitive speaker-specific attributes such as age and gender can still be inferred after masking speech and propose a comprehensive privacy evaluation framework to assess this speaker attribute leakage. We design and implement FeatureSense, an open-source library that provides a set of generalizable privacy-aware audio features that can be used for wide range of sensing applications. We present an adaptive task-specific feature selection algorithm that optimizes the privacy-utility-cost trade-off based on the application requirements. Through our extensive evaluation, we demonstrate the high utility of FeatureSense across a diverse set of sensing tasks. Our system outperforms existing privacy techniques by 60.6% in preserving user-specific privacy. This work provides a foundational framework for ensuring trust in audio sensing by enabling effective privacy-aware audio classification systems.</description>

      <title>Improving Multilingual Speech Models on ML-SUPERB 2.0: Fine-tuning with Data Augmentation and LID-Aware CTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilingual speech processing with self-supervised or supervised pre-trained Speech Foundation Models (SFM) has achieved strong performance on tasks like Language Identification (LID) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, these models struggle with limited resources during fine-tuning. This paper enhances multilingual LID and ASR on ML-SUPERB 2.0 by exploring multiple strategies for adapting SFMs, including frozen upstream training, partial fine-tuning, and low-rank adaptation. Furthermore, we employ data augmentation to mitigate performance gaps in few-shot settings and introduce LID Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss for regularization. Our approach achieves a 14% relative improvement in LID accuracy and a 30% relative reduction in ASR CER over the baseline on ML-SUPERB 2.0, securing second place in the Interspeech 2025 ML-SUPERB 2.0 Challenge.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Context-Aware Streaming Pretrained Language Model For Inverse Text Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse Text Normalization (ITN) is crucial for converting spoken Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) outputs into well-formatted written text, enhancing both readability and usability. Despite its importance, the integration of streaming ITN within streaming ASR remains largely unexplored due to challenges in accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability, particularly in low-resource and limited-context scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a streaming pretrained language model for ITN, leveraging pretrained linguistic representations for improved robustness. To address streaming constraints, we propose Dynamic Context-Aware during training and inference, enabling adaptive chunk size adjustments and the integration of right-context information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves accuracy comparable to non-streaming ITN and surpasses existing streaming ITN models on a Vietnamese dataset, all while maintaining low latency, ensuring seamless integration into ASR systems.</description>

      <title>Discl-VC: Disentangled Discrete Tokens and In-Context Learning for Controllable Zero-Shot Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, zero-shot voice conversion systems are capable of synthesizing the voice of unseen speakers. However, most existing approaches struggle to accurately replicate the speaking style of the source speaker or mimic the distinctive speaking style of the target speaker, thereby limiting the controllability of voice conversion. In this work, we propose Discl-VC, a novel voice conversion framework that disentangles content and prosody information from self-supervised speech representations and synthesizes the target speaker's voice through in-context learning with a flow matching transformer. To enable precise control over the prosody of generated speech, we introduce a mask generative transformer that predicts discrete prosody tokens in a non-autoregressive manner based on prompts. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of Discl-VC in zero-shot voice conversion and its remarkable accuracy in prosody control for synthesized speech.</description>

Abstract: Neural speech codecs are essential for advancing text-to-speech (TTS) systems. With the recent success of large language models in text generation, developing high-quality speech tokenizers has become increasingly important. This paper introduces DS-Codec, a novel neural speech codec featuring a dual-stage training framework with mirror and non-mirror architectures switching, designed to achieve superior speech reconstruction. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of our training strategy and compare the performance of the two architectures. Our results show that the mirrored structure significantly enhances the robustness of the learned codebooks, and the training strategy balances the advantages between mirrored and non-mirrored structures, leading to improved high-fidelity speech reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Fewer Hallucinations, More Verification: A Three-Stage LLM-Based Framework for ASR Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) error correction aims to correct recognition errors while preserving accurate text. Although traditional approaches demonstrate moderate effectiveness, LLMs offer a paradigm that eliminates the need for training and labeled data. However, directly using LLMs will encounter hallucinations problem, which may lead to the modification of the correct text. To address this problem, we propose the Reliable LLM Correction Framework (RLLM-CF), which consists of three stages: (1) error pre-detection, (2) chain-of-thought sub-tasks iterative correction, and (3) reasoning process verification. The advantage of our method is that it does not require additional information or fine-tuning of the model, and ensures the correctness of the LLM correction under multi-pass programming. Experiments on AISHELL-1, AISHELL-2, and Librispeech show that the GPT-4o model enhanced by our framework achieves 21%, 11%, 9%, and 11.4% relative reductions in CER/WER.</description>

Abstract: We present a universal high-fidelity neural audio compression algorithm that can compress speech, music, and general audio below 3 kbps bandwidth. Although current state-of-the-art audio codecs excel in audio compression, their effectiveness significantly declines when embedding space is sharply reduced, which corresponds to higher compression. To address this problem, we propose Residual Experts Vector Quantization (REVQ), which significantly expands the available embedding space and improves the performance while hardly sacrificing the bandwidth. Furthermore, we introduce a strategy to ensure that the vast embedding space can be fully utilized. Additionally, we propose a STFT-based discriminator to guide the generator in producing indistinguishable spectrograms. We demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods through detailed ablations.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents our system for the MISP-Meeting Challenge Track 2. The primary difficulty lies in the dataset, which contains strong background noise, reverberation, overlapping speech, and diverse meeting topics. To address these issues, we (a) designed G-SpatialNet, a speech enhancement (SE) model to improve Guided Source Separation (GSS) signals; (b) proposed TLS, a framework comprising time alignment, level alignment, and signal-to-noise ratio filtering, to generate signal-level pseudo labels for real-recorded far-field audio data, thereby facilitating SE models' training; and (c) explored fine-tuning strategies, data augmentation, and multimodal information to enhance the performance of pre-trained Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models in meeting scenarios. Finally, our system achieved character error rates (CERs) of 5.44% and 9.52% on the Dev and Eval sets, respectively, with relative improvements of 64.8% and 52.6% over the baseline, securing second place.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the lack of target speech annotations in real-recorded far-field conversational datasets, speech enhancement (SE) models are typically trained on simulated data. However, the trained models often perform poorly in real-world conditions, hindering their application in far-field speech recognition. To address the issue, we (a) propose direct sound estimation (DSE) to estimate the oracle direct sound of real-recorded data for SE; and (b) present a novel pseudo-supervised learning method, SuPseudo, which leverages DSE-estimates as pseudo-labels and enables SE models to directly learn from and adapt to real-recorded data, thereby improving their generalization capability. Furthermore, an SE model called FARNET is designed to fully utilize SuPseudo. Experiments on the MISP2023 corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of SuPseudo, and our system significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. A demo of our method can be found at https://EeLLJ.github.io/SuPseudo/.</description>

      <title>Rehearsal with Auxiliary-Informed Sampling for Audio Deepfake Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of existing audio deepfake detection frameworks degrades when confronted with new deepfake attacks. Rehearsal-based continual learning (CL), which updates models using a limited set of old data samples, helps preserve prior knowledge while incorporating new information. However, existing rehearsal techniques don't effectively capture the diversity of audio characteristics, introducing bias and increasing the risk of forgetting. To address this challenge, we propose Rehearsal with Auxiliary-Informed Sampling (RAIS), a rehearsal-based CL approach for audio deepfake detection. RAIS employs a label generation network to produce auxiliary labels, guiding diverse sample selection for the memory buffer. Extensive experiments show RAIS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Equal Error Rate (EER) of 1.953 % across five experiences. The code is available at: https://github.com/falihgoz/RAIS.</description>

      <title>MELT: Towards Automated Multimodal Emotion Data Annotation by Leveraging LLM Embedded Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although speech emotion recognition (SER) has advanced significantly with deep learning, annotation remains a major hurdle. Human annotation is not only costly but also subject to inconsistencies annotators often have different preferences and may lack the necessary contextual knowledge, which can lead to varied and inaccurate labels. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a scalable alternative for annotating text data. However, the potential of LLMs to perform emotional speech data annotation without human supervision has yet to be thoroughly investigated. To address these problems, we apply GPT-4o to annotate a multimodal dataset collected from the sitcom Friends, using only textual cues as inputs. By crafting structured text prompts, our methodology capitalizes on the knowledge GPT-4o has accumulated during its training, showcasing that it can generate accurate and contextually relevant annotations without direct access to multimodal inputs. Therefore, we propose MELT, a multimodal emotion dataset fully annotated by GPT-4o. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MELT by fine-tuning four self-supervised learning (SSL) backbones and assessing speech emotion recognition performance across emotion datasets. Additionally, our subjective experiments\' results demonstrate a consistence performance improvement on SER.</description>

      <title>ARECHO: Autoregressive Evaluation via Chain-Based Hypothesis Optimization for Speech Multi-Metric Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech signal analysis poses significant challenges, particularly in tasks such as speech quality evaluation and profiling, where the goal is to predict multiple perceptual and objective metrics. For instance, metrics like PESQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality), STOI (Short-Time Objective Intelligibility), and MOS (Mean Opinion Score) each capture different aspects of speech quality. However, these metrics often have different scales, assumptions, and dependencies, making joint estimation non-trivial. To address these issues, we introduce ARECHO (Autoregressive Evaluation via Chain-based Hypothesis Optimization), a chain-based, versatile evaluation system for speech assessment grounded in autoregressive dependency modeling. ARECHO is distinguished by three key innovations: (1) a comprehensive speech information tokenization pipeline; (2) a dynamic classifier chain that explicitly captures inter-metric dependencies; and (3) a two-step confidence-oriented decoding algorithm that enhances inference reliability. Experiments demonstrate that ARECHO significantly outperforms the baseline framework across diverse evaluation scenarios, including enhanced speech analysis, speech generation evaluation, and noisy speech evaluation. Furthermore, its dynamic dependency modeling improves interpretability by capturing inter-metric relationships.</description>

      <title>MSDA: Combining Pseudo-labeling and Self-Supervision for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Meta PL unsupervised domain adaptation framework for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). We introduce a Multi-Stage Domain Adaptation pipeline (MSDA), a sample-efficient, two-stage adaptation approach that integrates self-supervised learning with semi-supervised techniques. MSDA is designed to enhance the robustness and generalization of ASR models, making them more adaptable to diverse conditions. It is particularly effective for low-resource languages like Greek and in weakly supervised scenarios where labeled data is scarce or noisy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Meta PL can be applied effectively to ASR tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods, and providing more robust solutions for unsupervised domain adaptation in ASR. Our ablations highlight the necessity of utilizing a cascading approach when combining self-supervision with self-training.</description>

      <title>Speech-to-Text Translation with Phoneme-Augmented CoT: Enhancing Cross-Lingual Transfer in Low-Resource Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) approach that integrates phoneme representations into a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework to improve translation in low-resource and zero-resource settings. By introducing phoneme recognition as an intermediate step, we enhance cross-lingual transfer, enabling translation even for languages with no labeled speech data. Our system builds on a multilingual LLM, which we extend to process speech and phonemes. Training follows a curriculum learning strategy that progressively introduces more complex tasks. Experiments on multilingual S2TT benchmarks show that phoneme-augmented CoT improves translation quality in low-resource conditions and enables zero-resource translation, while slightly impacting high-resource performance. Despite this trade-off, our findings demonstrate that phoneme-based CoT is a promising step toward making S2TT more accessible across diverse languages.</description>

      <title>Voice Conversion Improves Cross-Domain Robustness for Spoken Arabic Dialect Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arabic dialect identification (ADI) systems are essential for large-scale data collection pipelines that enable the development of inclusive speech technologies for Arabic language varieties. However, the reliability of current ADI systems is limited by poor generalization to out-of-domain speech. In this paper, we present an effective approach based on voice conversion for training ADI models that achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improves robustness in cross-domain scenarios. Evaluated on a newly collected real-world test set spanning four different domains, our approach yields consistent improvements of up to +34.1% in accuracy across domains. Furthermore, we present an analysis of our approach and demonstrate that voice conversion helps mitigate the speaker bias in the ADI dataset. We release our robust ADI model and cross-domain evaluation dataset to support the development of inclusive speech technologies for Arabic.</description>

      <title>Masked Self-distilled Transducer-based Keyword Spotting with Semi-autoregressive Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RNN-T-based keyword spotting (KWS) with autoregressive decoding~(AR) has gained attention due to its streaming architecture and superior performance. However, the simplicity of the prediction network in RNN-T poses an overfitting issue, especially under challenging scenarios, resulting in degraded performance. In this paper, we propose a masked self-distillation (MSD) training strategy that avoids RNN-Ts overly relying on prediction networks to alleviate overfitting. Such training enables masked non-autoregressive (NAR) decoding, which fully masks the RNN-T predictor output during KWS decoding. In addition, we propose a semi-autoregressive (SAR) decoding approach to integrate the advantages of AR and NAR decoding. Our experiments across multiple KWS datasets demonstrate that MSD training effectively alleviates overfitting. The SAR decoding method preserves the superior performance of AR decoding while benefits from the overfitting suppression of NAR decoding, achieving excellent results.</description>

      <title>StyleSinger: Style Transfer for Out-of-Domain Singing Voice Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10741v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Style transfer for out-of-domain (OOD) singing voice synthesis (SVS) focuses on generating high-quality singing voices with unseen styles (such as timbre, emotion, pronunciation, and articulation skills) derived from reference singing voice samples. However, the endeavor to model the intricate nuances of singing voice styles is an arduous task, as singing voices possess a remarkable degree of expressiveness. Moreover, existing SVS methods encounter a decline in the quality of synthesized singing voices in OOD scenarios, as they rest upon the assumption that the target vocal attributes are discernible during the training phase. To overcome these challenges, we propose StyleSinger, the first singing voice synthesis model for zero-shot style transfer of out-of-domain reference singing voice samples. StyleSinger incorporates two critical approaches for enhanced effectiveness: 1) the Residual Style Adaptor (RSA) which employs a residual quantization module to capture diverse style characteristics in singing voices, and 2) the Uncertainty Modeling Layer Normalization (UMLN) to perturb the style attributes within the content representation during the training phase and thus improve the model generalization. Our extensive evaluations in zero-shot style transfer undeniably establish that StyleSinger outperforms baseline models in both audio quality and similarity to the reference singing voice samples. Access to singing voice samples can be found at https://aaronz345.github.io/StyleSingerDemo/.</description>

      <title>Versatile Framework for Song Generation with Prompt-based Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Song generation focuses on producing controllable high-quality songs based on various prompts. However, existing methods struggle to generate vocals and accompaniments with prompt-based control and proper alignment. Additionally, they fall short in supporting various tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce VersBand, a multi-task song generation framework for synthesizing high-quality, aligned songs with prompt-based control. VersBand comprises these primary models: 1) VocalBand, a decoupled model, leverages the flow-matching method for generating singing styles, pitches, and mel-spectrograms, allowing fast, high-quality vocal generation with style control. 2) AccompBand, a flow-based transformer model, incorporates the Band-MOE, selecting suitable experts for enhanced quality, alignment, and control. This model allows for generating controllable, high-quality accompaniments aligned with vocals. 3) Two generation models, LyricBand for lyrics and MelodyBand for melodies, contribute to the comprehensive multi-task song generation system, allowing for extensive control based on multiple prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that VersBand performs better over baseline models across multiple song generation tasks using objective and subjective metrics. Audio samples are available at https://aaronz345.github.io/VersBandDemo.</description>

      <title>ISDrama: Immersive Spatial Drama Generation through Multimodal Prompting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal immersive spatial drama generation focuses on creating continuous multi-speaker binaural speech with dramatic prosody based on multimodal prompts, with potential applications in AR, VR, and others. This task requires simultaneous modeling of spatial information and dramatic prosody based on multimodal inputs, with high data collection costs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to address these challenges. We construct MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, containing binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts. Then, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting. ISDrama comprises these primary components: 1) Multimodal Pose Encoder, based on contrastive learning, considering the Doppler effect caused by moving speakers to extract unified pose information from multimodal prompts. 2) Immersive Drama Transformer, a flow-based mamba-transformer model that generates high-quality drama, incorporating Drama-MOE to select proper experts for enhanced prosody and pose control. We also design a context-consistent classifier-free guidance strategy to coherently generate complete drama. Experimental results show that ISDrama outperforms baseline models on objective and subjective metrics. The demos and dataset are available at https://aaronz345.github.io/ISDramaDemo.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Emotional Synchrony in Dyadic Interactions: The Role of Speech Conditions in Facial and Vocal Affective Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how humans express and synchronize emotions across multiple communication channels particularly facial expressions and speech has significant implications for emotion recognition systems and human computer interaction. Motivated by the notion that non-overlapping speech promotes clearer emotional coordination, while overlapping speech disrupts synchrony, this study examines how these conversational dynamics shape the spatial and temporal alignment of arousal and valence across facial and vocal modalities. Using dyadic interactions from the IEMOCAP dataset, we extracted continuous emotion estimates via EmoNet (facial video) and a Wav2Vec2-based model (speech audio). Segments were categorized based on speech overlap, and emotional alignment was assessed using Pearson correlation, lag adjusted analysis, and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Across analyses, non overlapping speech was associated with more stable and predictable emotional synchrony than overlapping speech. While zero-lag correlations were low and not statistically different, non overlapping speech showed reduced variability, especially for arousal. Lag adjusted correlations and best-lag distributions revealed clearer, more consistent temporal alignment in these segments. In contrast, overlapping speech exhibited higher variability and flatter lag profiles, though DTW indicated unexpectedly tighter alignment suggesting distinct coordination strategies. Notably, directionality patterns showed that facial expressions more often preceded speech during turn-taking, while speech led during simultaneous vocalizations. These findings underscore the importance of conversational structure in regulating emotional communication and provide new insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of multimodal affective alignment in real world interaction.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Subgroup Disparities in Multi-Label Speech Emotion Recognition: A Pseudo-Labeling and Unsupervised Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While subgroup disparities and performance bias are increasingly studied in computational research, fairness in categorical Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) remains underexplored. Existing methods often rely on explicit demographic labels, which are difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns. To address this limitation, we introduce an Implicit Demography Inference (IDI) module that leverages pseudo-labeling from a pre-trained model and unsupervised learning using k-means clustering to mitigate bias in SER. Our experiments show that pseudo-labeling IDI reduces subgroup disparities, improving fairness metrics by over 28% with less than a 2% decrease in SER accuracy. Also, the unsupervised IDI yields more than a 4.6% improvement in fairness metrics with a drop of less than 3.6% in SER performance. Further analyses reveal that the unsupervised IDI consistently mitigates race and age disparities, demonstrating its potential when explicit demographic information is unavailable.</description>

      <title>TCSinger 2: Customizable Multilingual Zero-shot Singing Voice Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Customizable multilingual zero-shot singing voice synthesis (SVS) has various potential applications in music composition and short video dubbing. However, existing SVS models overly depend on phoneme and note boundary annotations, limiting their robustness in zero-shot scenarios and producing poor transitions between phonemes and notes. Moreover, they also lack effective multi-level style control via diverse prompts. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TCSinger 2, a multi-task multilingual zero-shot SVS model with style transfer and style control based on various prompts. TCSinger 2 mainly includes three key modules: 1) Blurred Boundary Content (BBC) Encoder, predicts duration, extends content embedding, and applies masking to the boundaries to enable smooth transitions. 2) Custom Audio Encoder, uses contrastive learning to extract aligned representations from singing, speech, and textual prompts. 3) Flow-based Custom Transformer, leverages Cus-MOE, with F0 supervision, enhancing both the synthesis quality and style modeling of the generated singing voice. Experimental results show that TCSinger 2 outperforms baseline models in both subjective and objective metrics across multiple related tasks. Singing voice samples are available at https://aaronz345.github.io/TCSinger2Demo/.</description>

      <title>EASY: Emotion-aware Speaker Anonymization via Factorized Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emotion plays a significant role in speech interaction, conveyed through tone, pitch, and rhythm, enabling the expression of feelings and intentions beyond words to create a more personalized experience. However, most existing speaker anonymization systems employ parallel disentanglement methods, which only separate speech into linguistic content and speaker identity, often neglecting the preservation of the original emotional state. In this study, we introduce EASY, an emotion-aware speaker anonymization framework. EASY employs a novel sequential disentanglement process to disentangle speaker identity, linguistic content, and emotional representation, modeling each speech attribute in distinct subspaces through a factorized distillation approach. By independently constraining speaker identity and emotional representation, EASY minimizes information leakage, enhancing privacy protection while preserving original linguistic content and emotional state. Experimental results on the VoicePrivacy Challenge official datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms all baseline systems, effectively protecting speaker privacy while maintaining linguistic content and emotional state.</description>

      <title>MFA-KWS: Effective Keyword Spotting with Multi-head Frame-asynchronous Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is essential for voice-driven applications, demanding both accuracy and efficiency. Traditional ASR-based KWS methods, such as greedy and beam search, explore the entire search space without explicitly prioritizing keyword detection, often leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose an effective keyword-specific KWS framework by introducing a streaming-oriented CTC-Transducer-combined frame-asynchronous system with multi-head frame-asynchronous decoding (MFA-KWS). Specifically, MFA-KWS employs keyword-specific phone-synchronous decoding for CTC and replaces conventional RNN-T with Token-and-Duration Transducer to enhance both performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we explore various score fusion strategies, including single-frame-based and consistency-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of MFA-KWS, which achieves state-of-the-art results on both fixed keyword and arbitrary keywords datasets, such as Snips, MobvoiHotwords, and LibriKWS-20, while exhibiting strong robustness in noisy environments. Among fusion strategies, the consistency-based CDC-Last method delivers the best performance. Additionally, MFA-KWS achieves a 47% to 63% speed-up over the frame-synchronous baselines across various datasets. Extensive experimental results confirm that MFA-KWS is an effective and efficient KWS framework, making it well-suited for on-device deployment.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Diffusion-based Text-to-Speech Model Training with Dual Modality Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to optimize the training process of diffusion-based text-to-speech models. While recent studies have achieved remarkable advancements, their training demands substantial time and computational costs, largely due to the implicit guidance of diffusion models in learning complex intermediate representations. To address this, we propose A-DMA, an effective strategy for Accelerating training with Dual Modality Alignment. Our method introduces a novel alignment pipeline leveraging both text and speech modalities: text-guided alignment, which incorporates contextual representations, and speech-guided alignment, which refines semantic representations. By aligning hidden states with discriminative features, our training scheme reduces the reliance on diffusion models for learning complex representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that A-DMA doubles the convergence speed while achieving superior performance over baselines.

      <title>Breaking Resource Barriers in Speech Emotion Recognition via Data Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) plays a crucial role in human-computer interaction. The emergence of edge devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) presents challenges in constructing intricate deep learning models due to constraints in memory and computational resources. Moreover, emotional speech data often contains private information, raising concerns about privacy leakage during the deployment of SER models. To address these challenges, we propose a data distillation framework to facilitate efficient development of SER models in IoT applications using a synthesised, smaller, and distilled dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that the distilled dataset can be effectively utilised to train SER models with fixed initialisation, achieving performances comparable to those developed using the original full emotional speech dataset.</description>

Abstract: Developing robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for Arabic requires effective strategies to manage its diversity. Existing ASR systems mainly cover the modern standard Arabic (MSA) variety and few high-resource dialects, but fall short in coverage and generalization across the multitude of spoken variants. Code-switching with English and French is also common in different regions of the Arab world, which challenges the performance of monolingual Arabic models. In this work, we introduce a suite of ASR models optimized to effectively recognize multiple variants of spoken Arabic, including MSA, various dialects, and code-switching. We provide open-source pre-trained models that cover data from 17 Arabic-speaking countries, and fine-tuned MSA and dialectal ASR models that include at least 11 variants, as well as multi-lingual ASR models covering embedded languages in code-switched utterances. We evaluate ASR performance across these spoken varieties and demonstrate both coverage and performance gains compared to prior models.</description>

      <title>V2SFlow: Video-to-Speech Generation with Speech Decomposition and Rectified Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce V2SFlow, a novel Video-to-Speech (V2S) framework designed to generate natural and intelligible speech directly from silent talking face videos. While recent V2S systems have shown promising results on constrained datasets with limited speakers and vocabularies, their performance often degrades on real-world, unconstrained datasets due to the inherent variability and complexity of speech signals. To address these challenges, we decompose the speech signal into manageable subspaces (content, pitch, and speaker information), each representing distinct speech attributes, and predict them directly from the visual input. To generate coherent and realistic speech from these predicted attributes, we employ a rectified flow matching decoder built on a Transformer architecture, which models efficient probabilistic pathways from random noise to the target speech distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V2SFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, even surpassing the naturalness of ground truth utterances.

      <title>Towards Inclusive ASR: Investigating Voice Conversion for Dysarthric Speech Recognition in Low-Resource Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for dysarthric speech remains challenging due to data scarcity, particularly in non-English languages. To address this, we fine-tune a voice conversion model on English dysarthric speech (UASpeech) to encode both speaker characteristics and prosodic distortions, then apply it to convert healthy non-English speech (FLEURS) into non-English dysarthric-like speech. The generated data is then used to fine-tune a multilingual ASR model, Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS), for improved dysarthric speech recognition. Evaluation on PC-GITA (Spanish), EasyCall (Italian), and SSNCE (Tamil) demonstrates that VC with both speaker and prosody conversion significantly outperforms the off-the-shelf MMS performance and conventional augmentation techniques such as speed and tempo perturbation. Objective and subjective analyses of the generated data further confirm that the generated speech simulates dysarthric characteristics.</description>

      <title>Impact of Frame Rates on Speech Tokenizer: A Case Study on Mandarin and English</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The speech tokenizer plays a crucial role in recent speech tasks, generally serving as a bridge between speech signals and language models. While low-frame-rate codecs are widely employed as speech tokenizers, the impact of frame rates on speech tokens remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate how varying frame rates affect speech tokenization by examining Mandarin and English, two typologically distinct languages. We encode speech at different frame rates and evaluate the resulting semantic tokens in the speech recognition task. Our findings reveal that frame rate variations influence speech tokenization differently for each language, highlighting the interplay between frame rates, phonetic density, and language-specific acoustic features. The results provide insights into optimizing frame rate selection for speech tokenizers, with implications for automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and other speech-related applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Assessment of Pathological Voices via Combined Low-Level Descriptors and Foundation Model Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21356v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perceptual voice quality assessment is essential for diagnosing and monitoring voice disorders by providing standardized evaluations of vocal function. Traditionally, expert raters use standard scales such as the Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) and Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain (GRBAS). However, these metrics are subjective and prone to inter-rater variability, motivating the need for automated, objective assessment methods. This study proposes Voice Quality Assessment Network (VOQANet), a deep learning-based framework with an attention mechanism that leverages a Speech Foundation Model (SFM) to extract high-level acoustic and prosodic information from raw speech. To enhance robustness and interpretability, we also introduce VOQANet+, which integrates low-level speech descriptors such as jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) with SFM embeddings into a hybrid representation. Unlike prior studies focused only on vowel-based phonation (PVQD-A subset) of the Perceptual Voice Quality Dataset (PVQD), we evaluate our models on both vowel-based and sentence-level speech (PVQD-S subset) to improve generalizability. Results show that sentence-based input outperforms vowel-based input, especially at the patient level, underscoring the value of longer utterances for capturing perceptual voice attributes. VOQANet consistently surpasses baseline methods in root mean squared error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) across CAPE-V and GRBAS dimensions, with VOQANet+ achieving even better performance. Additional experiments under noisy conditions show that VOQANet+ maintains high prediction accuracy and robustness, supporting its potential for real-world and telehealth deployment.</description>

      <title>VoiceMark: Zero-Shot Voice Cloning-Resistant Watermarking Approach Leveraging Speaker-Specific Latents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voice cloning (VC)-resistant watermarking is an emerging technique for tracing and preventing unauthorized cloning. Existing methods effectively trace traditional VC models by training them on watermarked audio but fail in zero-shot VC scenarios, where models synthesize audio from an audio prompt without training. To address this, we propose VoiceMark, the first zero-shot VC-resistant watermarking method that leverages speaker-specific latents as the watermark carrier, allowing the watermark to transfer through the zero-shot VC process into the synthesized audio. Additionally, we introduce VC-simulated augmentations and VAD-based loss to enhance robustness against distortions. Experiments on multiple zero-shot VC models demonstrate that VoiceMark achieves over 95% accuracy in watermark detection after zero-shot VC synthesis, significantly outperforming existing methods, which only reach around 50%.

      <title>Automatic classification of stop realisation with wav2vec2.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern phonetic research regularly makes use of automatic tools for the annotation of speech data, however few tools exist for the annotation of many variable phonetic phenomena. At the same time, pre-trained self-supervised models, such as wav2vec2.0, have been shown to perform well at speech classification tasks and latently encode fine-grained phonetic information. We demonstrate that wav2vec2.0 models can be trained to automatically classify stop burst presence with high accuracy in both English and Japanese, robust across both finely-curated and unprepared speech corpora. Patterns of variability in stop realisation are replicated with the automatic annotations, and closely follow those of manual annotations. These results demonstrate the potential of pre-trained speech models as tools for the automatic annotation and processing of speech corpus data, enabling researchers to 'scale-up' the scope of phonetic research with relative ease.</description>
