      <title>Convergence, optimization and stability of singular eigenmaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenmaps are important in analysis, geometry, and machine learning, especially in nonlinear dimension reduction. Approximation of the eigenmaps of a Laplace operator depends crucially on the scaling parameter $\epsilon$. If $\epsilon$ is too small or too large, then the approximation is inaccurate or completely breaks down. However, an analytic expression for the optimal $\epsilon$ is out of reach. In our work, we use some explicitly solvable models and Monte Carlo simulations to find the approximately optimal range of $\epsilon$ that gives, on average, relatively accurate approximation of the eigenmaps. Numerically we can consider several model situations where eigen-coordinates can be computed analytically, including intervals with uniform and weighted measures, squares, tori, spheres, and the Sierpinski gasket. In broader terms, we intend to study eigen-coordinates on weighted Riemannian manifolds, possibly with boundary, and on some metric measure spaces, such as fractals.</description>

      <title>A Hurewicz-type formula for asymptotic-dimension-lowering symmetric quasimorphisms of countable approximate groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known Hurewicz-type formula for asymptotic-dimension-lowering group homomorphisms, due to A. Dranishnikov and J. Smith, states that if $f:G\to H$ is a group homomorphism, then $\mathrm{asdim} G \leq \mathrm{asdim} H + \mathrm{asdim} (\ker f)$. In this paper we establish a similar formula for certain quasimorphisms of countable approximate groups: if $(\Xi, \Xi^\infty)$ and $(\Lambda, \Lambda^\infty)$ are countable approximate groups and if $f:(\Xi, \Xi^\infty)\to (\Lambda,\Lambda^\infty)$ is a symmetric unital quasimorphism, we show that $\mathrm{asdim} \Xi \leq \mathrm{asdim} \Lambda + \mathrm{asdim} (f^{-1}\!(D(f)))$, where $D(f)$ is the defect set of $f$.</description>

      <title>Criteria for entropic curvature on graph spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we establish new simple local geometric criteria for discrete entropic curvature introduced in [47] that are powerful enough to capture many geometric properties of complex models arising in mathematical physics. These results are robust in the sense that they apply to any discrete graph equipped with a Markov reversible generator. Our definitions of entropic curvature differ from the one of the pioneering works of Erbar-Maas [19,20] (which is already a discrete analog of the Lott-Sturm-Villani entropic curvature in the continuous setting). Singularly, our results provide refined concentration properties related to the celebrated convex-hull method by Talagrand [50,51] for a large class of probability measures that cannot be captured from Erbar- Maas entropic definition of curvature. Our approach gives also a new insight of the convex hull method, without being related to induction arguments. We illustrate the power of our results, as well as the general entropic strategy developed in this paper, to tackle challenging models studied in mathematical physics, including Gibbs measures with interaction potentials such as Ising models on the discrete hypercube and measures with interaction potential on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$. For instance, we significantly improve the constant of the refined convex concentration properties obtained in [2] for Ising models. Moreover, when dealing with the antiferromagnetic Curie-Weiss model, we improve the previously known bound for entropic curvature by a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. Our simple criteria also provides the expected right order of magnitude $C/\sqrt n$ for the lower-bound on the entropic curvature for the renowned Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model from the spin glass theory. This last result is consistant with the recent works [6,17] on the modified logarithmic Sobolev and Poincar\'e inequalities for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model.</description>
