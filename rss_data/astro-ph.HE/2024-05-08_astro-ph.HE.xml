      <title>The Orbit of NGC 5907 ULX-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the orbit of the binary system powering the most extreme ultraluminous X-ray pulsar known to date: NGC 5907 ULX-1 (hereafter ULX1). ULX1 has been the target of a substantial multi-instrument campaign, mainly in the X-ray band, but no clear counterparts are known in other bands. Although ULX1 is highly variable and pulsations can be transient (regardless of the source flux), the timing data collected so far allow us to investigate the orbit of this system. We find an orbital period $P_{orb}=5.7^{+0.1}_{-0.6}\text{ d}$ and a projected semi-axis $A_1 =3.1^{+0.8}_{-0.9}\text{ lts}$. The most likely ephemeris is: $P_{orb}=5.6585(6)\text{ d}$, $A_1 = 3.1(4)\text{ lts}$, and the epoch of ascending nodes passage is: $T_{asc} = 57751.37(5)\text{ MJD}$. However, there are 6 similar solutions, acceptable within $3\,\sigma$. We find further indications that ULX1 is a high-mass X-ray binary. This implies that we are observing its orbit face-on, with an inclination $&lt;5\text{ deg}$.</description>

      <title>SN2023fyq: A Type Ibn Supernova With Long-standing Precursor Activity Due to Binary Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2023fyq, a type Ibn supernova in the nearby galaxy NGC 4388 (D$\simeq$18~Mpc). In addition, we trace long-standing precursor emission at the position of SN 2023fyq using data from DLT40, ATLAS, ZTF, ASAS-SN, Swift, and amateur astronomer Koichi Itagaki. Precursor activity is observed up to nearly three years before the supernova explosion, with a relatively rapid rise in the final 100 days. The double-peaked post-explosion light curve reaches a luminosity of $\sim10^{43}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. The strong intermediate-width He lines observed in the nebular spectrum of SN 2023fyq imply the interaction is still active at late phases. We found that the precursor activity in SN 2023fyq is best explained by the mass transfer in a binary system involving a low-mass He star and a compact companion. An equatorial disk is likely formed in this process ($\sim$0.6$\rm M_{\odot}$), and the interaction of SN ejecta with this disk powers the main peak of the supernova. The early SN light curve reveals the presence of dense extended material ($\sim$0.3$\rm M_{\odot}$) at $\sim$3000$\rm R_{\odot}$ ejected weeks before the SN explosion, likely due to final-stage core silicon burning or runaway mass transfer resulting from binary orbital shrinking, leading to rapid rising precursor emission within $\sim$30 days prior to explosion. The final explosion could be triggered either by the core-collapse of the He star or by the merger of the He star with a compact object. SN 2023fyq, along with SN 2018gjx and SN 2015G, forms a unique class of Type Ibn SNe which originate in binary systems and are likely to exhibit detectable long-lasting pre-explosion outbursts with magnitudes ranging from $-$10 to $-$13.</description>

      <title>An arcsecond view at 1-2 GHz into the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a high angular resolution (1.1") and sensitivity (maximum of ~0.1 mJy) radio survey at 1-2 GHz in the Galactic Bulge. This complements the X-ray Chandra Galactic Bulge Survey, and investigates the full radio source population in this dense Galactic region. Radio counterparts to sources at other wavelengths can aid in classification, as there are relatively few types of objects that are reasonably detectable in radio at kiloparsec distances, and even fewer that are detected in both X-rays and radio. This survey covers about 3 square degrees of the Galactic Bulge Survey area (spanning the Galactic coordinate range of -3deg &lt; l &lt; +3deg and +1.6deg &lt; b &lt; +2.1deg as a first look into this region of the Galaxy with this combination of frequency, resolution, and sensitivity. Spectral indices within the observed band of 1-2 GHz were calculated for each source to assist in determining its emission mechanism. We find 1617 unique sources in the survey, 25 of which are radio counterparts to X-ray sources, and about 100 of which are steep-spectrum (alpha &lt;~ -1.4) point sources that are viable pulsar candidates. Four radio sources are of particular interest: a compact binary; an infrared transient with an inverted radio spectrum; a potential transitional millisecond pulsar candidate; and a very steep spectrum radio source with an X-ray and bright infrared counterpart. We discuss other notable sources, including possible radio transients, potential new planetary nebulae, and active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Black Hole Photogrammetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple, analytic dual-cone accretion model for horizon scale images of the cores of Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGN), including those observed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Our underlying model is of synchrotron emission from an axisymmetric, magnetized plasma, which is constrained to flow within two oppositely oriented cones that are aligned with the black hole's spin axis. We show that this model can accurately reproduce images for a variety of time-averaged general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, that it accurately recovers both the black hole and emission parameters from these simulations, and that it is sufficiently efficient to be used to measure these parameters in a Bayesian inference framework with radio interferometric data. We show that non-trivial topologies in the source image can result in non-trivial multi-modal solutions when applied to observations from a sparse array, such as the EHT 2017 observations of M87${}^*$. The presence of these degeneracies underscores the importance of employing Bayesian techniques that adequately sample the posterior space for the interpretation of EHT measurements. We fit our model to the EHT observations of M87${}^*$ and find a 95% Highest Posterior Density Interval (HPDI) for the mass-to-distance ratio of $\theta_g\in(2.84,3.75)\,\mu{\rm as}$, and give an inclination of $\theta_{\rm o}\in(11^\circ,24^\circ)$. These new measurements are consistent with mass measurements from the EHT and stellar dynamical estimates (e.g., Gebhardt et al. 2011; EHTC et al. 2019a,b; Liepold et al. 2023), and with the spin axis inclination inferred from properties of the M87${}^*$ jet (e.g., Walker et al. 2018).</description>

      <title>The Northern Cross Fast Radio Burst project IV. Multiwavelength study of the actively repeating FRB 20220912A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are energetic, millisecond-duration radio pulses observed at extragalactic distances and whose origin is still largely debated. A fraction of the FRB population have shown repeating bursts. It is still unclear whether these represent a distinct class of sources. We investigate the bursting behaviour of FRB 20220912A, one of the most active repeating FRBs known. In particular, we focus on its burst energy distribution, linked to the source energetics, and its emission spectrum, the latter directly related to the underlying emission mechanism. We monitored FRB 20220912A at $408$ MHz with the Northern Cross radio telescope and at $1.4$ GHz using the $32$-m Medicina Grueff radio telescope. Additionaly, we conducted $1.2$ GHz observations taken with the upgraded-Giant Meter Wave Radio Telescope searching for a persistent radio source coincident with FRB 20220912A, and we present the first upper limits obtained from a monitoring in X and $\gamma$ rays conducted with Swift and AGILE satellites. We report 16 new bursts from FRB 20220912A at $408$ MHz during the period of time between October 16$^{\rm th}$ 2022 and December 31$^{\rm st}$ 2023. Their cumulative spectral energy distribution follows a power law with slope $\alpha_E = -1.5 \pm 0.3$ and we measure a repetition rate of $0.15 \pm 0.04$ hr$^{-1}$ for bursts having fluence $\mathcal{F} \geq 20$ Jy ms. Furthermore, we report no detections at $1.4$ GHz during down to a fluence of $\mathcal{F} \geq 13$ Jy ms. These non-detections imply an upper limit of $\beta &lt; -2.3$, with $\beta$ being the global spectral index of FRB 20220912A. This is inconsistent with positive $\beta$ values found for the only two known cases in which an FRB has been detected in separate spectral bands. We find that FRB 20220912A has shown a decline of $4$ orders of magnitude in its bursting activity at $1.4$ GHz over a one year ... (abridged)</description>

      <title>A Gamma-ray Emitting Collisional Ring Galaxy System in our Galactic Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The astrophysical $\gamma$-ray photons carry the signatures of the violent phenomena happening on various astronomical scales in our Universe. This includes supernova remnants, pulsars, and pulsar wind nebulae in the Galactic environment and extragalactic relativistic jets associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, $\sim$30\% of the \gm-ray sources detected with the Fermi Large Area Telescope lack multiwavelength counterpart association, precluding us from characterizing their origin. Here we report, for the first time, the association of a collisional ring galaxy system in our Galactic neighborhood (distance $\sim$10 Mpc), formed as a consequence of a smaller `bullet' galaxy piercing through a larger galaxy, as the multi-frequency counterpart of an unassociated $\gamma$-ray source 4FGL~J1647.5$-$5724. The system, also known as "Kathryn's Wheel", contains two dwarf irregular galaxies and an edge-on, late-type, spiral galaxy surrounded by a ring of star-forming knots. We utilized observations taken from the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory, Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey, SuperCOSMOS H$\alpha$ Survey, Dark Energy Survey, and Visible MultiObject Spectrograph at Very Large Telescope to ascertain the association with 4FGL~J1647.5$-$5724 and to explore the connection between the star-forming activities and the observed $\gamma$-ray emission. We found that star-formation alone cannot explain the observed $\gamma$-ray emission, and additional contribution likely from the pulsars/supernova remnants or buried AGN is required. We conclude that arcsecond/sub-arcsecond-scale observations of this extraordinary $\gamma$-ray emitting galaxy collision will be needed to resolve the environment and explore the origin of cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Sedimentary rocks from Mediterranean drought in the Messinian age as a probe of the past cosmic ray flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the use of natural minerals as detectors to study the past flux of cosmic rays. This novel application of the \textit{paleo-detector} technique requires a specific approach as it needs samples that have been exposed to secondary cosmic rays for a well defined period of time. We suggest here the use of the evaporites formed during the desiccation of the Mediterranean sea ${\sim}6$ Myr ago. These minerals have been created and exposed to the air or under a shallow water basin for ${\sim}500$ kyr before being quickly submerged again by a km-scale overburden of water. We show that, by looking at the damages left in the minerals by muons in cosmic ray showers, we could detect differences in the primary cosmic ray flux during that period, as the ones expected from nearby supernova explosions, below the percent-level. We show also that little to no background from radioactive contamination and other astroparticles is expected for this kind of analysis.</description>

      <title>A high-resolution radio morphology and polarization of the kpc-scale X-ray jet of PKS 1127-145</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on new multi-frequency Very Large Array (VLA) radio observations and Chandra X-ray observations of a radio-loud quasar with a ~300 kpc long jet, PKS 1127-145, during a flaring event detected in $\gamma$-rays by the Fermi Large Area Telescope in 2020 December. The high angular resolution of the new radio images allows us to disentangle for the first time the inner kpc-scale jet from the core contribution. The inner radio jet, up to 15 kpc from the core, is highly polarized (33 per cent) and the magnetic field is parallel to the jet axis. At about 18 arcsec from the core the jet slightly bends and we observe a re-brightening of the radio emission and a 90-degree rotation of the magnetic field, likely highlighting the presence of a shock that is compressing the magnetic field to a plane perpendicular to the jet axis and where efficient particle acceleration takes place. At the same position the X-ray emission fades, suggesting a deceleration of the bulk velocity of the jet after the bend. A change in velocity and collimation of the jet is supported by the widening of the jet profile and the detection of a limb-brightened structure connecting the bending region with the jet termination. The limb-brightened structure might indicate the co-existence of both longitudinal and transverse velocity gradients at the jet bending. There is no evidence for significant brightening of the kpc-scale jet in the radio or X-ray band during the $\gamma$-ray flare. The X-ray flux, $F_{\rm 2-10\,keV} =
  (6.24\pm0.57)\times10^{-12}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, measured by Chandra from the quasar core is consistent with the flux measured by the X-Ray Telescope on board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory after the high-energy flare. Our results indicate that the $\gamma$-ray flaring region is located within the VLA source core.</description>

      <title>A unified theory of the self-similar supersonic Marshak wave problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the similarity solutions for the Marshak wave problem, in the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) diffusion approximation and in the supersonic regime. Self-similar solutions exist for a temporal power law surface temperature drive and a material model with power law temperature dependent opacity and energy density. The properties of the solutions in both linear and nonlinear conduction regimes are studied as a function of the temporal drive, opacity and energy density exponents. We show that there exists a range of the temporal exponent for which the total energy in the system decreases, and the solution has a local maxima. For nonlinear conduction, we specify the conditions on the opacity and energy density exponents under which the heat front is linear or even flat, and does posses its common sharp character; this character is independent of the drive exponent. We specify the values of the temporal exponents for which analytical solutions exist and employ the Hammer-Rosen perturbation theory to obtain highly accurate approximate solutions, which are parameterized using only two numerically fitted quantities. The solutions are used to construct a set of benchmarks for supersonic LTE radiative heat transfer, including some with unusual and interesting properties such as local maxima and non sharp fronts. The solutions are compared in detail to implicit Monte-Carlo and discrete-ordinate transport simulations as well gray diffusion simulations, showing a good agreement, which highlights their usefulness as a verification test problem for radiative transfer simulations.</description>

      <title>GRB afterglows with energy injections in AGN accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks are widely considered potential hosts for various high-energy transients, including gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The reactivation of GRB central engines can provide additional energy to shocks formed during the interaction of the initially ejected GRB jets with the circumburst material, commonly referred to as energy injections. In this paper, we study GRBs occurring in AGN disks within the context of energy injections. We adopt the standard external forward shock (EFS) model and consider both short- and long-duration GRB scenarios. Light curves for two types of radiation, namely the radiation from the heated disk material (RHDM) and GRB afterglows, are computed. We find that the energy injection facilitates the EFS to break out from the photosphere of the low-density AGN disk at relativistic velocity. Moreover, the energy injection almost does not affect the RHDM but significantly enhances the peak flux of the GRB afterglows.</description>

      <title>XMM-Newton observations of the extragalactic microquasar S26 and their implications for PeV cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extragalactic microquasar S26 has the most powerful jets observed in accreting binaries, with a kinetic luminosity of $L_{\rm jet}\sim10^{40}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$. According to the jet-disk symbiosis model, this implies that the accretion power to the stellar black hole at the core of the system should be very super-Eddington, on the order of $L_{\rm acc}\sim L_{\rm jet}$. However, the observed X-ray flux of this system, measured by the \textit{Chandra} and \textit{XMM-Newton} telescopes, indicates an apparent very sub-Eddington accretion luminosity of $L_{\rm X}\approx 10^{37}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, orders of magnitude smaller than the jet power. We present here a preliminary investigation of the relationship between jet and disk power, analyze an X-ray observation of S26 obtained with \textit{XMM-Newton}, and propose an explanation for the emission. We also examine the acceleration and distribution of the particles to discuss the feasibility of microquasars as potential PeVatron sources, exploring their ability to produce cosmic rays with energies of about 1 PeV or higher.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos and gamma rays from beta decays in an active galactic nucleus NGC 1068 jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that TeV neutrinos detected from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068 can be explained by the beta decays of neutrons produced in photodisintegration of nuclei on ultraviolet photons in the jet. The photodisintergation of nuclei occurs at energies above a few PeV, which explains the 1-100 TeV energies of the observed neutrinos. The gamma-ray flux accompanying the beta decays is expected to be much lower than the neutrino flux, and it agrees well with the gamma-ray observations of NGC 1068. This scenario can be applicable to other jetted Seyfert galaxies such as NGC 4151. The flavor ratio studies could be a test of this beta decay jet scenario for gamma-ray deficit neutrino sources.</description>

      <title>Relic Neutrino Background from Cosmic-Ray Reservoirs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the flux of relic neutrino background (R$\nu$B) up-scattered by ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays (CRs) in clusters that act as CR-reservoirs. The long trapping times of UHECRs make this flux larger than that of R$\nu$B up-scattered by UHECRs on their way to Earth, which we also compute. We find that IceCube excludes R$\nu$B weighted overdensities larger than $10^{10}$ in clusters, and that PUEO, RNO-G, GRAND and IceCube-Gen2 will test values down to $10^{8}$. Our treatment incorporates the momentum transfer dependence of the neutrino-nucleus cross section, deep inelastic scattering, a mixed UHECR composition, and flavour information on the up-scattered R$\nu$B fluxes for both cases of neutrino mass spectrum with normal and inverted ordering, providing new handles to possibly disentangle the up-scattered R$\nu$B from cosmogenic neutrinos.</description>

      <title>First direct observations of interplanetary shock impact angle effects on actual geomagnetically induced currents: The case of the Finnish natural gas pipeline system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of interplanetary (IP) shocks on the Earth's magnetosphere can greatly disturb the geomagnetic field and electric currents in the magnetosphere-ionosphere system. At high latitudes, the current systems most affected by the shocks are the auroral electrojet currents. These currents then generate ground geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) that couple with and are highly detrimental to ground artificial conductors including power transmission lines, oil/gas pipelines, railways, and submarine cables. Recent research has shown that the shock impact angle, the angle the shock normal vector performs with the Sun-Earth line, plays a major role in controlling the subsequent geomagnetic activity. More specifically, due to more symmetric magnetospheric compressions, nearly frontal shocks are usually more geoeffective than highly inclined shocks. In this study, we utilize a subset (332 events) of a shock list with more than 600 events to investigate, for the first time, shock impact angle effects on the subsequent GICs right after shock impact (compression effects) and several minutes after shock impact (substorm-like effects). We use GIC recordings from the Finnish natural gas pipeline performed near the M\"ants\"al\"a compression station in southern Finland. We find that GIC peaks (&gt; 5 A) occurring after shock impacts are mostly caused by nearly frontal shocks and occur in the post-noon/dusk magnetic local time sector. These GIC peaks are presumably triggered by partial ring current intensifications in the dusk sector. On the other hand, more intense GIC peaks (&gt; 20 A) generally occur several minutes after shock impacts and are located around the magnetic midnight terminator. These GIC peaks are most likely caused by intense energetic particle injections from the magnetotail which frequently occur during substorms.</description>

      <title>Nonradial instabilities in anisotropic neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-radial oscillation modes of a neutron star possess valuable information about its internal structure and nuclear physics. Starting from the quadrupolar order, such modes under general relativity are known as quasi-normal modes since they dissipate energy through gravitational radiation and their frequencies are complex. The stability of these modes is governed by the sign of the imaginary part of the frequency, which determines whether the mode would decay or grow over time. In this Letter, we develop a fully consistent framework in general relativity to study quasi-normal modes of neutron stars with anisotropic pressure, whose motivation includes strong internal magnetic fields and non-vanishing shear or viscosity. We employ parametrized models for the anisotropy and solve the perturbed Einstein field equations numerically. We find that, unlike the case for isotropic neutron stars, the imaginary parts of some of the pressure ($p$-)modes flip signs as the degree of anisotropy deviates from zero, depicting a transition from stable modes to unstable modes. This finding indicates that some anisotropic neutron star models are unstable, potentially restricting the form of sustained anisotropy.</description>

      <title>An efficient GPU-accelerated multi-source global fit pipeline for LISA data analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-scale analysis task of deciphering gravitational wave signals in the LISA data stream will be difficult, requiring a large amount of computational resources and extensive development of computational methods. Its high dimensionality, multiple model types, and complicated noise profile require a global fit to all parameters and input models simultaneously. In this work, we detail our global fit algorithm, called "Erebor," designed to accomplish this challenging task. It is capable of analysing current state-of-the-art datasets and then growing into the future as more pieces of the pipeline are completed and added. We describe our pipeline strategy, the algorithmic setup, and the results from our analysis of the LDC2A Sangria dataset, which contains Massive Black Hole Binaries, compact Galactic Binaries, and a parameterized noise spectrum whose parameters are unknown to the user. We recover posterior distributions for all 15 (6) of the injected MBHBs in the LDC2A training (hidden) dataset. We catalog $\sim12000$ Galactic Binaries ($\sim8000$ as high confidence detections) for both the training and hidden datasets. All of the sources and their posterior distributions are provided in publicly available catalogs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines a recently hypothesized black hole solution in de Rham--Gabadadze--Tolley massive gravity. Firstly, we consider the negative cosmological constant as a thermodynamic pressure. We extract the thermodynamical properties such as Hawking temperature, heat capacity and Gibbs free energy using the Barrow entropy. We also obtain a new pressure associated to the perfect fluid dark matter and discuss the first-order van der Waals-like phase transition. This black hole's stability is investigated through specific heat and Gibbs free energy. Also, we analyze the thermodynamic curvatures behavior of black hole through geometry methods (Weinhold, Ruppeiner, Hendi-Panahiyah-Eslam-Momennia (HPEM), and geometrothermodynamics (GTD)).</description>

      <title>Bounds on the charge of the graviton using gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If the graviton possesses a non-zero charge $q_g$, gravitational waves (GW) originating from astrophysical sources would experience an additional time delay due to intergalactic magnetic fields. This would result in a modification of the phase evolution of the observed GW signal similar to the effect induced by a massive graviton. As a result, we can reinterpret the most recent upper limits on the graviton's mass as constraints on the joint mass-charge parameter space, finding $|q_g|/{e} &lt; 3\times 10^{-34}$ where $e$ represents the charge of an electron. Additionally, we illustrate that a charged graviton would introduce a constant phase difference in the gravitational waves detected by two spatially separated GW detectors due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Using the non-observation of such a phase difference for the GW event GW190814, we establish a mass-independent constraint $|q_g|/e &lt; 2\times 10^{-26}$. To the best of our knowledge, our results constitute the first-ever bounds on the charge of the graviton. We also discuss various caveats involved in our measurements and prospects for strengthening these bounds with future GW observations.</description>

      <title>Mass function of stellar black holes as revealed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ninety gravitational wave events have been detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network and are released in the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog. Among these events, 83 cases are definitely binary black hole mergers since the masses of all the objects involved significantly exceed the upper limit of neutron stars. The black holes in these merger events naturally form two interesting samples, a pre-merger sample that includes all the black holes before the mergers and a post-merger sample that consists of the black holes generated during the merging processes. The former represents black holes that once existed in the Universe, while the latter represents newly born black holes. Here we present a statistical analysis on these two samples. The non-parametric $\tau$ statistic method is adopted to correct for the observational selection effect. The Lynden-Bell's $C^{-}$ method is further applied to derive the mass distribution and density function of black holes. It is found that the mass distribution can be expressed as a broken power-law function. More interestingly, the power-law index in the high mass region is comparable for the two samples. The number density of black holes is found to depend on redshift as $\rho(z) \propto z^{-2.06}$ -- $z^{-2.12}$ based on the two samples. Implications of these findings on the origin of black holes are discussed.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Spin in the Intermediate Polar CC Sculptoris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on spin variations in the intermediate polar and cataclysmic variable CC Scl, as seen by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). By studying both the spin period and its harmonic, we find that the spin has varied since it was first observed in 2011. We find the latest spin value for the source to be 389.473(6)s, equivalent to 0.00450779(7) days, 0.02s shorter than the first value measured. A linear fit to these and intermediate data give a rate of change of spin ~-4.26(2.66)e10^-11 and a characteristic timescale tau~2.90e10^5 years, in line with other known intermediate polars with varying spin. The spin profile of this source also matches theoretical spin profiles of high-inclination intermediate polars, and furthermore, appears to have changed in shape over a period of three years. Such `spin-up' in an intermediate polar is considered to be from mass accretion onto the white dwarf (the primary), and we note the presence of dwarf nova eruptions in this source as being a possible catalyst of the variations.</description>

      <title>Rapid determination of LISA sensitivity to extreme mass ratio inspirals with machine learning</title>

Abstract: Gravitational wave observations of the inspiral of stellar-mass compact objects into massive black holes (MBHs), extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), enable precision measurements of parameters such as the MBH mass and spin. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna is expected to detect sufficient EMRIs to probe the underlying source population, testing theories of the formation and evolution of MBHs and their environments. Population studies are subject to selection effects that vary across the EMRI parameter space, which bias inference results if unaccounted for. This bias can be corrected, but evaluating the detectability of many EMRI signals is computationally expensive. We mitigate this cost by (i) constructing a rapid and accurate neural network interpolator capable of predicting the signal-to-noise ratio of an EMRI from its parameters, and (ii) further accelerating detectability estimation with a neural network that learns the selection function, leveraging our first neural network for data generation. The resulting framework rapidly estimates the selection function, enabling a full treatment of EMRI detectability in population inference analyses. We apply our method to an astrophysically motivated EMRI population model, demonstrating the potential selection biases and subsequently correcting for them. Accounting for selection effects, we predict that LISA will measure the MBH mass function slope to a precision of 8.8%, the CO mass function slope to a precision of 4.6%, the width of the MBH spin magnitude distribution to a precision of 10% and the event rate to a precision of 12% with EMRIs at redshifts below z=6.</description>

      <title>Fast radio burst energy function in the presence of $\rm DM_{host}$ variation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been found in great numbers, but the physical mechanism of these sources is still a mystery. The redshift evolutions of the FRB energy distribution function and the volumetric rate shed light on the origin of FRBs. However, such estimations rely on the dispersion measurement (DM)-redshift ($z$) relationship. A few FRBs that have been detected recently show large excess DMs beyond the expectation from the cosmological and Milky Way contributions, which indicates large spread of DMs from their host galaxies. In this work, we adopt two lognormal-distributed ${\rm DM}_{\rm host}$ models and estimate the energy function using the non-repeating FRBs selected from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)/FRB Catalog 1. By comparing the lognormal-distributed ${\rm DM}_{\rm host}$ models to a constant ${\rm DM}_{\rm host}$ model, the FRB energy function results are consistent within the measurement uncertainty. We also estimate the volumetric rate of the non-repeating FRBs in three different redshift bins. The volumetric rate shows that the trend is consistent with the stellar-mass density redshift evolution. Since the lognormal-distributed ${\rm DM}_{\rm host}$ model increases the measurement errors, the inference of FRBs tracking the stellar-mass density is nonetheless undermined.</description>

      <title>Accretion flows around spinning compact objects in the post-Newtonian regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the structure of a low angular momentum accretion flows around rotating compact objects incorporating relativistic corrections up to the leading post-Newtonian order. To begin with, we formulate the governing post-Newtonian hydrodynamic equations for the mass and energy-momentum flux without imposing any symmetries. However, for the sake of simplicity, we consider the flow to be stationary, axisymmetric, and inviscid. Toward this, we adapt the polytropic equation of state (EoS) and analyze the vertically integrated accretion flow confined to the equatorial plane. It is shown that the spin-orbit effects manifest themselves in the accretion dynamics. In the present analysis, we focus on global transonic accretion solutions, where a subsonic flow enters far away from the compact object and gradually gains radial velocity as it moves inwards. Thus, the flow becomes supersonic after reaching a certain radius, known as the critical point. To better understand the transonic solutions and examine the effect of post-Newtonian corrections, we classify the post-Newtonian equations into semi-relativistic (SR), semi-Newtonian (SN), and non-relativistic (NR) limits and compare the accretion solutions and their corresponding flow variables. With these, we find that SR and SN flow are in good agreement all throughout, although they deviate largely from the NR ones. Interestingly, the density profile seems to follow the profile $\rho \propto r^{-3/2}$ in the post-Newtonian regime. The present study has the potential to connect Newtonian and GR descriptions of accretion dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process powers energetic jets by extracting the rotating energy of a Kerr black hole. It is important to understand this process in non-Kerr black hole spacetimes. In this study, we conduct two-dimensional and three-dimensional two-temperature General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of magnetized accretion flows onto a rotating Loop-Quantum black hole (LQBH). Our investigation focuses on the accretion flow structure and jet launching dynamics from our simulations. We observe that the loop quantum effects increase the black hole angular frequency for spinning black holes.This phenomenon intensifies the frame-dragging effect, leading to an amplification of the toroidal magnetic field within the funnel region and enhancement of the launching jet power. It is possible to fit the jet power following a similar fitting formula of the black hole angular frequency as seen in the Kerr black hole. Based on the General Relativistic Radiation Transfer (GRRT) calculation, we find that the jet image from LQBH has a wider opening angle and an extended structure than the Kerr BH.</description>

Abstract: We discuss recent results in neutrino astronomy and their implications for the cosmic-ray acceleration in relativistic outflows, such as in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) jets, Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), and Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs). We especially focus on challenges at the interface to particle acceleration which can be inferred from the multi-messenger context, such as the paradigm that the sources power the Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs). We demonstrate that both AGN blazars (in the context of neutrino observations) and GRBs (as UHECR sources in the context of neutrino-non-observations) point towards acceleration spectra harder than $E^{-2}$, or relatively high minimal cosmic-ray injection energies, to meet the respective energy budget requirements. We furthermore speculate that neutrino flares in blazars may be related to super-Eddington accretion flares, or that GRBs are powered by significantly higher kinetic energies than typically assumed in electromagnetic models. For internal shock models, the UHECR paradigm for GRBs can only be maintained in the light of neutrino stacking limits in multi-zone models. While relativistic outflows in TDEs have become recently interesting per se and models for the neutrino emission from jetted TDEs exist, a direct connection between TDE jets pointing in our direction and astrophysical neutrinos has not been identified yet.</description>

Abstract: We search for possible pulsar TeV halos among the very-high-energy (VHE) sources reported in different VHE surveys, among which in particular we use the results from the first Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) catalog of $\gamma$-ray sources. Six candidates are found. They share similar properties of containing a middle-aged, gamma-ray--bright pulsar in their positional error circles (the respective pulsars are J0248+6021, J0359+5414, J0622+3749, J0633+0632, J2006+3102, and J2238+5903), being in a rather clean field without any common Galactic VHE-emitting supernova remnants or (bright) pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), and showing an absence of any gamma-ray emissions in 0.1--500\,GeV after removing the pulsars' emissions. Combining these candidates with several reported (candidate) TeV halos, we obtain the relationships between their luminosity at 50\,TeV ($L_{\rm 50TeV}$) and the corresponding pulsars' spin-down energy ($\dot{E}$), which are $L_{\rm 50TeV}\sim \dot{E}^{0.9}$ and $L_{\rm 50TeV}/\dot{E}\sim 6.4\times 10^{-4}$. The relationships are nearly identical to previously reported ones. We probe possible connections between the extension sizes of the VHE sources and the pulsars' ages, and find a weak older-and-smaller trend. By comparing to the VHE detection results for PWNe, it is clear that the (candidate) TeV halos have hard emissions by either having their power-law indices be smaller than 2 in 1--25\,TeV or by only being detected in 25--100\,TeV. In addition, we also consider seven other VHE sources as possible TeV halos based on the results from different studies of them, but they do not fit cleanly with the properties listed above, indicating their potentially complex nature.</description>

      <title>Quantitative modelling of type Ia supernovae spectral time series: Constraining the explosion physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple explosion mechanisms have been proposed to explain type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Empirical modelling tools have also been developed that allow for fast, customised modelling of individual SNe and direct comparisons between observations and explosion model predictions. Such tools have provided useful insights, but the subjective nature with which empirical modelling is performed makes it difficult to obtain robust constraints on the explosion physics or expand studies to large populations of objects. Machine learning accelerated tools have therefore begun to gain traction. In this paper, we present riddler, a framework for automated fitting of SNe Ia spectral sequences up to shortly after maximum light. We train a series of neural networks on realistic ejecta profiles predicted by the W7 and N100 explosion models to emulate full radiative transfer simulations and apply nested sampling to determine the best-fitting model parameters for multiple spectra of a given SN simultaneously. We show that riddler is able to accurately recover the parameters of input spectra and use it to fit observations of two well-studied SNe Ia. We also investigate the impact of different weighting schemes when performing quantitative spectral fitting and show that best-fitting models and parameters are highly dependent on the assumed weighting schemes and priors. As spectroscopic samples of SNe Ia continue to grow, automated spectral fitting tools such as riddler will become increasingly important to maximise the physical constraints that can be gained in a quantitative and consistent manner.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Emission Properties of Flux Ropes from Two-Temperature GRMHD Simulations with Multiple Magnetic Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flux ropes erupting from the vicinity of the black hole are thought to be a potential model for the flares observed in Sgr\,A$^*$. In this study, we examine the radiative properties of flux ropes that emerged from the vicinity of the black hole. We have performed three-dimensional two-temperature General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of magnetized accretion flows with alternating multiple magnetic loops, and General Relativistic Radiation Transfer (GRRT) calculations. In GRMHD simulations, two different sizes of initial magnetic loops are implemented. In the small loop case, magnetic dissipation leads to a weaker excitement of magneto-rotational instability inside the torus which generates a lower accretion rate compared to the large loop case. However, it makes more generation of flux ropes due to frequent reconnection by magnetic loops with different polarities. By calculating the thermal synchrotron emission, we found that the variability of light curves and emitting region are tightly related. At $230\,\rm GHz$ and higher frequency, the emission from the flux ropes is relatively stronger compared with the background, which is responsible for the filamentary structure in the images. At lower frequencies, e.g. $43\,\rm GHz$, emission comes from more extended regions, which have a less filamentary structure in the image. Our study shows self-consistent electron temperature models are essential for the calculation of thermal synchrotron radiation and the morphology of the GRRT images. Flux ropes contribute considerable emission at frequencies $\gtrsim 230\,\rm GHz$.</description>

      <title>Simple fits for the neutrino luminosities from protoneutron star cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a simple fit function, $L_{\nu_i}(t) = C\, t^{-\alpha}\, e^{-(t/\tau)^{n}}$, to parametrize the luminosities of neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors during the protoneutron star (PNS) cooling phase at post-bounce times $t \gtrsim 1$ s. This fit is based on results from a set of neutrino-hydrodynamics simulations of core-collapse supernovae in spherical symmetry. The simulations were performed with an energy-dependent transport for six neutrino species and took into account the effects of convection and muons in the dense and hot PNS interior. We provide values of the fit parameters $C$, $\alpha$, $\tau$, and $n$ for different neutron star masses and equations of state as well as correlations between these fit parameters. Our functional description is useful for analytic supernova modeling, for characterizing the neutrino light curves in large underground neutrino detectors, and as a tool to extract information from measured signals on the mass and equation of state of the PNS and on secondary signal components on top of the PNS's neutrino emission.</description>

      <title>Multi-filter UV to NIR Data-driven Light Curve Templates for Stripped Envelope Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the spectroscopic classification scheme for Stripped envelope supernovae (SESNe) is clear, and we know that they originate from massive stars that lost some or all their envelopes of Hydrogen and Helium, the photometric evolution of classes within this family is not fully characterized. Photometric surveys, like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, will discover tens of thousands of transients each night and spectroscopic follow-up will be limited, prompting the need for photometric classification and inference based solely on photometry. We have generated 54 data-driven photometric templates for SESNe of subtypes IIb, Ib, Ic, Ic-bl, and Ibn in U/u, B, g, V, R/r, I/i, J, H, Ks, and Swift w2, m2, w1 bands using Gaussian Processes and a multi-survey dataset composed of all well-sampled open-access light curves (165 SESNe, 29531 data points) from the Open Supernova Catalog. We use our new templates to assess the photometric diversity of SESNe by comparing final per-band subtype templates with each other and with individual, unusual and prototypical SESNe. We find that SNe Ibns and Ic-bl exhibit a distinctly faster rise and decline compared to other subtypes. We also evaluate the behavior of SESNe in the PLAsTiCC and ELAsTiCC simulations of LSST light curves highlighting differences that can bias photometric classification models trained on the simulated light curves. Finally, we investigate in detail the behavior of fast-evolving SESNe (including SNe Ibn) and the implications of the frequently observed presence of two peaks in their light curves.</description>

      <title>Modeling Hadronic Interactions in Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays within Astrophysical Environments: A Parametric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactions of ultra-high energy cosmic-rays (UHECRs) accelerated in astrophysical environments have been shown to shape the energy production rate of nuclei escaping from the confinement zone. To address the influence of hadronic interactions, Hadronic Interaction Models (HIM) come into play. In this context, we present a parameterization capable of capturing the outcomes of two distinct HIMs, namely EPOS-LHC and Sibyll2.3d, in terms of secondary fluxes, including escaping nuclei, neutrinos, photons, and electrons. Our parametrization is systematically evaluated against the source codes, both at fixed energy and mass, as well as in a physical case scenario. The comparison demonstrates that our parameterization aligns well with the source codes, establishing its reliability as a viable alternative for analytical or fast Monte Carlo approaches dedicated to the study of UHECR propagation within source environments. This suggests the potential for utilizing our parameterization as a practical substitute in studies focused on the intricate dynamics of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Everything everywhere all at once: A detailed study of GW230529</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the origins of GW230529, delving into its formation from massive stars within isolated binary systems. Utilizing population synthesis models, we present compelling evidence that the neutron star component forms second. However, the event's low signal-to-noise ratio introduces complexities in identifying the underlying physical mechanisms driving its formation. Augmenting our analysis with insights from numerical relativity, we estimate the final black hole mass and spin to be approximately $5.3 M_\odot$ and $0.53$, respectively. Furthermore, we employ the obtained posterior samples to calculate the ejecta mass and kilonova light curves resulting from r-process nucleosynthesis. We find the ejecta mass to range within $0-0.06 M_{\odot}$, contingent on the neutron star equation of state. The peak brightness of the kilonovae light curves indicates that targeted follow-up observations with a Rubin-like observatory may have detected this emission.</description>

      <title>Self-gravitating razor-thin disks around black holes via multi-hole seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.08987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct self-gravitating razor-thin disks of counterrotating dust around Schwarzschild black holes (BHs) by applying the "displace, cut, and reflect" method to known seed solutions representing multi-holes. All but one of the sources of the seed solution generate the surrounding annular disk, whereas the remaining BH is kept unaltered and lies at the disk center after the transformation. The disks are infinite in extent, have annular character, and are linearly stable up to the innermost stable circular orbit of the system. Moreover, all energy conditions are satisfied along the disk and the spacetime is asymptotically flat, having finite ADM mass. We also comment on charged disks around extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om BHs constructed from a Majumdar-Papapetrou $N$-BH seed solution. These simple examples can be extended to more general "BH + disk" solutions, obtained by the same method from seeds of the type "BH + arbitrary axisymmetric source". A natural follow-up of this work would be to construct disks around Reissner-Nordstr\"om BHs with arbitrary charge-to-mass ratio and around Kerr BHs.</description>

      <title>The Host Galaxies of High Velocity Type Ia Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been ample evidence that Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) with high Si 2 velocities near peak brightness are distinguished from SNe Ia of lower velocities and may indeed represent a separate progenitor system. These SNe Ia can contaminate the population of normal events used for cosmological analyses, creating unwanted biases in the final analyses. Given that many current and future surveys using SNe Ia as cosmological probes will not have the resources to take a spectrum of all the events, likely only getting host redshifts long after the SNe Ia have faded, we need to turn to methods that could separate these populations based purely on photometry or host properties. Here, we present a study of a sample of well observed, nearby SNe Ia and their hosts to determine if there are significant enough differences between these populations that can be discerned only from the stellar population properties of their hosts. Our results indicate that the global host properties, including star formation, stellar mass, stellar population age, and dust attenuation, of high velocity SNe Ia do not differ significantly from those of lower velocities. However, we do find that high velocity SNe Ia are more concentrated toward the center of their hosts, suggesting that their local environments may indeed differ. Future work requires strengthening photometric probes of high velocity SNe Ia and their local environments to distinguish these events and determine if they originate from a separate progenitor.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Variation of the Weak Scale from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the EMPRESS collaboration has included new data in the extraction of the primordial $^4$He abundance from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), resulting in a determination that differs from the previous value and from theoretical expectations. There have been several studies attempting to explain this anomaly which involve variation of fundamental constants between the time of BBN and the present. Since the Higgs vacuum expectation value (vev) is the only dimensionful parameter in the Standard Model and it is already known to vary during the electroweak phase transition, we consider the possibility that the vev is slightly different during BBN compared to its present value. A modification of the vev changes not only particle masses but also affects, through mass thresholds, the QCD confinement scale. We use the recently developed PRyMordial program to study this variation and its impact on the $^4$He and deuterium abundances. We find that bounds on $|{\delta v}/{v}|$ are approximately $0.01$, and that the EMPRESS result can be explained within $2\sigma$ if $0.008 &lt; {\delta v}/{v}&lt; 0.02$, but at the cost of worsening the current $2\sigma$ discrepancy in the deuterium abundance to over $3\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculation of hyper-neutron matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) of neutron matter plays a decisive role in our understanding of the properties of neutron stars as well as the generation of gravitational waves in neutron star mergers. At sufficient densities, it is known that the appearance of hyperons generally softens the EoS, thus leading to a reduction in the maximum mass of neutron stars well below the observed values of about 2 solar masses. Even though repulsive three-body forces are known to solve this so-called "hyperon puzzle", so far performing \textit{ab initio} calculations with a substantial number of hyperons has remained elusive. In this work, we address this challenge by employing simulations based on Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory with up to 232 neutrons (pure neutron matter) and up to 116 $\Lambda$ hyperons (hyper-neutron matter) in a finite volume. We introduce a novel auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, allowing us to simulate for both pure neutron matter and hyper-neutron matter systems up to 5 times the density of nuclear matter using a single auxiliary field without any sign oscillations. Also, for the first time in {\em ab initio} calculations, we not only include $N\Lambda$ two-body and $NN\Lambda$ three-body forces, but also $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $N \Lambda\Lambda$ interactions. Consequently, we determine essential astrophysical quantities such as the mass-radius relation, the speed of sound and the tidal deformability of neutron stars. Our findings also confirm the existence of the $I$-Love-$Q$ relation, which gives access to the moment of inertia of the neutron star.</description>
