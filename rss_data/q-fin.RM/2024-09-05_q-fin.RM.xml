      <title>Spectral signatures of structural change in financial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The level of systemic risk in economic and financial systems is strongly determined by the structure of the underlying networks of interdependent entities that can propagate shocks and stresses. Since changes in network structure imply changes in risk levels, it is important to identify structural transitions potentially leading to system-wide crises. Methods have been proposed to assess whether a real-world network is in a (quasi-)stationary state by checking the consistency of its structural evolution with appropriate maximum-entropy ensembles of graphs. While previous analyses of this kind have focused on dyadic and triadic motifs, hence disregarding higher-order structures, here we consider closed walks of any length. Specifically, we study the ensemble properties of the spectral radius of random graph models calibrated on real-world evolving networks. Our approach is shown to work remarkably well for directed networks, both binary and weighted. As illustrative examples, we consider the Electronic Market for Interbank Deposit (e-MID), the Dutch Interbank Network (DIN) and the International Trade Network (ITN) in their evolution across the 2008 crisis. By monitoring the deviation of the spectral radius from its ensemble expectation, we find that the ITN remains in a (quasi-)equilibrium state throughout the period considered, while both the DIN and e-MID exhibit a clear out-of-equilibrium behaviour. The spectral deviation therefore captures ongoing topological changes, extending over all length scales, to provide a compact proxy of the resilience of economic and financial networks.</description>

      <title>The Gerber-Shiu Expected Discounted Penalty Function: An Application to Poverty Trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a risk process to model the capital of a household. Our work focuses on the analysis of the trapping time of such a process, where trapping occurs when a household's capital level falls into the poverty area. A function analogous to the classical Gerber-Shiu function is introduced, which incorporates information on the trapping time, the capital surplus immediately before trapping and the capital deficit at trapping. We derive, under some assumptions, a model belonging to the family of generalised beta (GB) distributions that describes the distribution of the capital deficit at trapping given that trapping occurs. Affinities between the capital deficit at trapping and a class of poverty measures, known as the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) index, are presented. The versatility of this model to estimate FGT indices is assessed using household microdata from Burkina Faso's Enqu\^ete Multisectorielle Continue (EMC) 2014.</description>
