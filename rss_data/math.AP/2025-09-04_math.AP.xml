      <title>Asymptotic Stability of multi-solitons for $1$d Supercritical NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the one-dimensional $L^2$ supercritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation \begin{equation} i\partial_{t}\psi+\partial^{2}_{x}\psi+\vert \psi\vert^{2k}\psi=0 \text{, $k&gt;2$}. \end{equation} It is well known that solitary waves for this equation are unstable. In the pioneering work of Krieger and Schlag \cite{KriegerSchlag}, the asymptotic stability of a solitary wave was established on a codimension-one center-stable manifold. In the present paper, using linear estimates developed for one-dimensional matrix charge transfer models in our previous work, \cite{dispanalysis1}, we prove asymptotic stability of multi-solitons on a finite-codimension manifold for $k&gt;\frac{11}{4}$, provided that the soliton velocities are sufficiently separated.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem for semidiscrete stochastic parabolic operators in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two types of inverse problems for space semidiscrete stochastic parabolic equations in arbitrary dimensions. The first problem concerns a semidiscrete inverse source problem, which involves determining the random source term of the white noise in the stochastic parabolic equation using observation data of the solution at the terminal time and the trace of the discrete spatial derivative of the solution on a subdomain at the boundary of the space. The second problem addresses a semidiscrete Cauchy inverse problem, which involves determining the solution of the stochastic parabolic equation in a subdomain of space-time, from the data of the solution and the trace of the discrete spatial derivative on a subdomain of the boundary of space and time. To address these problems, we establish two Carleman estimates for a semidiscrete stochastic parabolic operator in arbitrary dimensions: one for the homogeneous boundary condition and the other for the nonhomogeneous boundary condition. Applying these Carleman estimates, we obtain Lipschitz and H\"older stability for the first and second inverse problems, respectively.</description>

      <title>H\"older Stable Recovery of the Source in Space-Time Fractional Wave Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the recovery of a spatially dependent source in a one-dimensional space-time fractional wave equation using boundary measurement data collected at a single endpoint. The main challenge arises from the fact that the eigenfunctions of the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem do not form an orthogonal system, due to the presence of a fractional derivative in space. To address this difficulty, we introduce a bi-orthogonal basis for the Mittag-Leffler functions and use it to establish uniqueness and H\"older-type stability results, provided the measurement time is sufficiently large. A Tikhonov regularization method is then employed to numerically solve the inverse source problem. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method and to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Energy decay and blow-up of viscoelastic wave equations with polynomial nonlinearity and damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the energy decay and the finite time blow-up of the solution to a viscoelastic wave equation with polynomial nonlinearity and weak damping. We establish explicit and general decay results for the solutions by imposing polynomial conditions on the relaxation function, provided that the initial energy is sufficiently small. Furthermore, we derive an upper bound for the blow-up time when the initial energy is less than the depth of the potential well by utilizing Levine's convexity method. Additionally, we provide a lower bound for the blow-up time if the solution blows up.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that under a generic asymptotic condition on the charge, the small data solutions to the Vlasov-Maxwell system do not verify linear scattering. In other words, we show the non-$L^1$ asymptotic completeness of the system. The proof makes use of the Lorentz invariance of the equations.</description>

      <title>Existence and large radial solutions for an elliptic system under finite new Keller-Osserman integral conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and qualitative behavior of entire positive radial solutions to the semilinear elliptic system% \begin{equation*} \Delta u=p(|x|)\,g(v),\qquad \Delta v=q(|x|)\,f(u),\qquad x\in \mathbb{R}% ^{n},\ n\geq 3, \end{equation*}% under finite Keller--Osserman-type integral conditions on the nonlinearities $f$ and $g$, and integrability constraints on the radial weights $p$ and $q$% . The nonlinearities are assumed continuous on $[0,\infty )$, differentiable on $(0,\infty )$, vanish at the origin, and are strictly positive elsewhere, with% \begin{equation*} \int_{1}^{\infty }\frac{dt}{g(f(t))}&lt;\infty ,\qquad \int_{1}^{\infty }\frac{% dt}{f(g(t))}&lt;\infty . \end{equation*}% The weights satisfy $\int_{0}^{\infty }s\,p(s)\,ds&lt;\infty $, $% \int_{0}^{\infty }s\,q(s)\,ds&lt;\infty $, and $\min (p,q)$ is not compactly supported. Within this framework, we establish: (i) the existence of infinitely many entire positive radial solutions for a nonempty set of central values; (ii) closedness of the set of admissible central values; and (iii) largeness (blow-up at infinity) of solutions corresponding to boundary points of this set. The approach is based on a novel subharmonic functional tailored to the reciprocal integral conditions, extending classical Keller--Osserman theory to a broad class of coupled systems with general nonlinearities and weight functions.</description>

      <title>Vlasov equation coupled with non-Newtonian fluids with discontinuous-in-time stress tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the system of equations describing the flow of a dilute particle system coupled with an incompressible non-Newtonian fluid in a bounded domain. In this setting, both PDEs are connected via a drag force, or the friction force. We are interested in a thin spray regime, which means that we neglect the inter-particle interactions. When it comes to the fluid system, the Cauchy stress tensor is supposed to be a monotone mapping and has asymptotically $(s-1)$-growth with the parameter $s$ depending on the spatial and time variable. We do not assume any smoothness of $s$ with respect to time variable and assume the log-H\"{o}lder continuity with respect to spatial variable. An example of materials, which satisfy those assumptions, are those whose properties are instantaneous, e.g. changed by the switched electric field. We show the long time and the large data existence of weak solution provided that $s\ge\frac{3d+2}{d+2}$.</description>

      <title>On the local existence for the characteristic initial value problem for the Einstein-Dirac system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the characteristic initial value problem for the Einstein-Dirac system, a model governing the interaction between gravity and spin-$1/2$ fields. We apply Luk's strategy \cite{Luk12} and prove a semi-global existence result for this coupled Einstein-Dirac system without imposing symmetry conditions. More precisely, we construct smooth solutions in a rectangular region to the future of two intersecting null hypersurfaces, on which characteristic initial data are specified. The key novelty is to promote the symmetric spinorial derivatives of the Dirac field to independent variables and to derive a commuted "Weyl-curvature-free" evolution system for them. This eliminates the coupling to the curvature in the energy estimates and closes the bootstrap at the optimal derivative levels. The analysis relies on a double null foliation and incorporates spinor-specific techniques essential to handling the structure of the Dirac field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a structural characterization of a given boundary using two-phase elliptic measure in a multi-operator setting, extending to this novel setting results of Kenig, Preiss &amp; Toro, Toro &amp; Zhao and Azzam &amp; Mourgoglou, including a partial answer to Bishop's question regarding the validity of Oksendal's conjecture under the assumption of mutual absolute continuity of the elliptic measures. Our techniques rely on a reduction to a multi-operator two-phase free-boundary problem combined with an extension of the powerful tools introduced by Preiss in his Density Theorem.</description>

      <title>Recovery of Sturm-Liouville operators from partial boundary spectral data and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inverse Sturm-Liouville problem on a finite interval from partial knowledge of spectral data. Specifically, we show that the potential can be uniquely reconstructed from the knowledge of a fraction of Dirichlet eigenvalues together with the normal derivatives of the corresponding eigenfunctions at both endpoints. We present two novel applications of our spectral result in inverse coefficient determination problems for evolutionary PDEs that include passive wave-based imaging of a medium and active imaging for the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with unknown internal sources. Our results yield optimal time measurement bounds for such inverse coefficient determination problems. A central innovation is the use of Kahane's interpolation theorem to analyze endpoint time traces of solutions, enabling the recovery without requiring analyticity assumptions or infinite-time data, as in previous approaches. Finally, in the appendix, we present a spectral interpolation theorem for one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Energy critical fourth-order Schr\"odinger equation system with power-type nonlinearities in the radial case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a system of focusing fourth-order Schr\"odinger equations in the energy-critical setting with radial initial data and general power-type nonlinearities. The main idea is to generalize the analysis of such systems: we first establish several hypotheses on the nonlinearities and prove their implications. These implications are then used to establish a local well-posedness result in $H^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and and to prove the existence of ground state solutions. Using a virial argument, we demonstrate a blow-up result for initial data with negative energy or with kinetic energy exceeding that of the ground state. Finally, employing the concentration-compactness/rigidity method, we prove a scattering result for solutions whose energy and kinetic energy are below those of the ground state.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we develop the method of multipliers for electromagnetic Dirac operators and establish sufficient conditions on the magnetic and electric fields that guarantee the absence of point spectrum. Our results can be viewed as a generalization of those obtained by Cossetti, Fanelli and Krej\v{c}i\v{r}\'ik (2020), which treated the purely magnetic case. We also emphasize that, in the massless case, our approach covers Coulomb-type potentials of the form $V(x) = \frac{1}{|x|} \big(\nu \mathbb{I} + \mu \beta + i \delta \beta \big(\boldsymbol{\alpha}\cdot \frac{x}{|x|} \big) \big).$</description>

      <title>Quadrature Domains and the Faber Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for reconstructing any simply connected bounded or unbounded, quadrature domain $\Omega$ from its quadrature function $h$. Using the Faber transform, we derive formulae directly relating $h$ to the Riemann map for $\Omega$. Through this approach, we obtain a complete classification of one point quadrature domains with complex charge. We proceed to develop a theory of weighted quadrature domains with respect to weights of the form $\rho_a(w)=|w|^{2(a-1)}$ when $a &gt; 0$ ("power-weighted" quadrature domains) and the limiting case of $a=0$ ("log-weighted" quadrature domains). We obtain Faber transform formulae for reconstructing these from their respective quadrature functions as well. Several examples are presented throughout to illustrate this approach both in the simply connected setting and in the presence of rotational symmetry.</description>

      <title>Analysis of nonlinear resonances in resonator crystals: Tight-binding approximation and existence of subwavelength soliton-like solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work provides a mathematical framework for elucidating physical mechanisms for confining waves at subwavelength scales in periodic systems of nonlinear resonators. A discrete approximation in terms of the linear capacitance operator is provided to characterize the nonlinear subwavelength resonances. Moreover, the existence of subwavelength soliton-like localized waves in periodic systems of nonlinear resonators is proven. As a by-product, a tight-binding approximation of the capacitance operator is shown to be valid for crystals of subwavelength resonators. Both full- and half-space crystals are considered. The framework developed in this work opens the door to the study of topological properties of periodic lattices of subwavelength nonlinear resonators, such as the emergence of nonlinearity-induced topological edge states, and to elucidate the interplay between nonlinearity and disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability properties of an abstract class of semi-linear systems. Our main result establishes rational rates of decay for classical solutions assuming a certain non-uniform observability estimate for the linear part and suitable conditions on the non-linearity. We illustrate the strength of our abstract results by applying them to a one-dimensional wave equation with weak non-linear damping and to an Euler-Bernoulli beam with a tip mass subject to non-linear damping.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and exponential stability for Boussinesq systems on real hyperbolic Manifolds and application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09469v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the global existence and exponential decay of mild solutions for the Boussinesq systems in $L^p$-phase spaces on the framework of real hyperbolic manifold $\mathbb{H}^d(\mathbb{R})$, where $d \geqslant 2$ and $1&lt;p\leq d$. We consider a couple of Ebin-Marsden's Laplace and Laplace-Beltrami operators associated with the corresponding linear system which provides a vectorial matrix semigoup. First, we show the existence and the uniqueness of the bounded mild solution for the linear system by using dispersive and smoothing estimates of the vectorial matrix semigroup. Next, using the fixed point arguments, we can pass from the linear system to the semilinear system to establish the existence of the bounded mild solutions. By using Gronwall's inequality, we establish the exponential stability of such solutions. Finally, we give an application of stability to the existence of periodic mild solutions for the Boussinesq systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the uniqueness and the radial symmetry of minimizers on a Pohozaev-Nehari manifold to the Schr\"{o}dinger Poisson equation with a general nonlinearity $f(u)$. Particularly, we allow that $f$ is $L^2$ supercritical. The main result shows that minimizers are unique and radially symmetric modulo suitable translations.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of global solutions of bi-laplacian Nonautonomous Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the bi-Laplacian Schr\"odinger equation with a general interaction term, which may be linear or nonlinear and is allowed to be time-dependent. We show that global solutions to such equations decompose asymptotically into a free wave and a weakly localized component in all space dimensions. Moreover, in dimensions $n \geq 9$, we prove that the weakly localized component is in fact spatially localized. The proof is based on a suitably adapted construction of the Free Channel Wave Operator, building on the method recently developed in~\cite{SW20221}.</description>

      <title>On existence, uniqueness and radiality of normalized solutions to Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson equations with non-autonomous nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the existence, uniqueness, and radial symmetry of normalized solutions to the Schr\"{o}dinger Poisson equation with non-autonomous nonlinearity $f(x,u)$: \begin{equation} -\triangle u+(|x|^{-1}*|u|^2)u=f(x,u)+\lambda u, \nonumber \end{equation} subject to the constraint $\mathcal{S}_c=\{u\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3)|\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}u^2=c&gt;0 \}$. We consider three cases based on the behavior of $f(x,u)$: the $L^2$ supercritical case, the $L^2$ subcritical case with growth speed less than three power times, and the $L^2$ subcritical case with growth speed more than three power times. We establish the existence of solutions using three different methods depending on $f(x,u)$. Furthermore, we demonstrate the uniqueness and radial symmetry of normalized solutions using an implicit function framework when $c$ is small.</description>

      <title>Normalized grounded states for a coupled nonlinear schr\"{o}dinger system on $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13908v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of normalized ground states to the system of coupled Schr\"odinger equations: \begin{equation}\label{eq:0.1}
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u_1 + \lambda_1 u_1 = \mu_1 |u_1|^{p_1-2}u_1 + \beta r_1|u_1|^{r_1-2}u_1|u_2|^{r_2} &amp; \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^{3},
  -\Delta u_2 + \lambda_2 u_2 = \mu_2|u_2|^{p_2-2}u_2 + \beta r_2|u_1|^{r_1}|u_2|^{r_2-2}u_2 &amp; \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^3,
  \end{cases}
  \end{equation} subject to the constraints $\mathcal{S}_{a_1} \times \mathcal{S}_{a_2} = \{(u_1 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3))|\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} u_1^2 dx = a_1^2\} \times \{(u_2 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3))|\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} u_2^2 dx = a_2^2\}$, where $\mu_1, \mu_2 &gt; 0$, $r_1, r_2 &gt; 1$, and $\beta \geq 0$. Our focus is on the coupled mass super-critical case, specifically, $$\frac{10}{3} &lt; p_1, p_2, r_1 + r_2 &lt; 2^* = 6.$$ We demonstrate that there exists a $\tilde{\beta} \geq 0$ such that equation (\ref{eq:0.1}) admits positive, radially symmetric, normalized ground state solutions when $\beta &gt; \tilde{\beta}$. Furthermore, this result can be generalized to systems with an arbitrary number of components, and the corresponding standing wave is orbitally unstable.</description>

      <title>On Mean Field Games in Infinite Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a Mean Field Games (MFG) system in a real, separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space. The system consists of a second order parabolic type equation, called Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in the paper, coupled with a nonlinear Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. Both equations contain a Kolmogorov operator. Solutions to the HJB equation are interpreted in the mild solution sense and solutions to the FP equation are interpreted in an appropriate weak sense. We prove well-posedness of the considered MFG system under certain conditions. The existence of a solution to the MFG system is proved using Tikhonov's fixed point theorem in a proper space. Uniqueness of solutions is obtained under typical separability and Lasry-Lions type monotonicity conditions.</description>

  We would like to highlight the fact that our results are new with very weak assumption on the nonlinear term appearing in the inequalities.

We also show that the classes of weights are characterized by a suitable maximal operator. Additionally, we study the boundedness of various operators associated with the generalized Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta + \mu$, where $\mu$ is a nonnegative Radon measure in $\mathbb{R}^d$, for $d\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Volume growths versus Sobolev inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper deals with fine volume growth estimates on metric measures spaces supporting various Sobolev-type inequalities. Given a generic metric measure space, we first prove a quantitative volume growth of metric balls under the validity of a Sobolev-type inequality (including Gagliardo-Nirenberg, Sobolev and Nash inequalities, as well as their borderlines, i.e., the logarithmic-Sobolev, Faber-Krahn, Morrey and Moser-Trudinger inequalities, respectively), answering partially a question of Ledoux [Ann. Fac. Sci. Toulouse Math., 2000] in a broader setting. We then prove sharp Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev interpolation inequalities -- with their borderlines -- in the setting of metric measure spaces verifying the curvature-dimension condition ${\sf CD}(0,N)$ in the sense of Lott-Sturm-Villani. In addition, the equality cases are also characterized in terms of the $N$-volume cone structure of the ${\sf CD}(0,N)$ space together with the precise profile of extremizers.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness of a Nonlinear Fokker-Planck Type Model of Grain Growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most technologically useful materials spanning multiple length scales are polycrystalline. Polycrystalline microstructures are composed of a myriad of small crystals or grains with different lattice orientations which are separated by interfaces or grain boundaries. The changes in the grain and grain boundary structure of polycrystals highly influence the materials properties including, but not limited to, electrical, mechanical, and thermal. Thus, an understanding of how microstructures evolve is essential for the engineering of new materials. In this paper, we consider a recently introduced nonlinear Fokker-Planck-type system and establish a global well-posedness result for it. Such systems under specific energy laws emerge in the modeling of the grain boundary dynamics in polycrystals.</description>

Abstract: Anomalous diffusion is the fundamental ansatz of phenomenological theories of passive scalar turbulence, and has been confirmed numerically and experimentally to an extraordinary extent. The purpose of this survey is to discuss our recent result, in which we construct a class of incompressible vector fields that have many of the properties observed in a fully turbulent velocity field, and for which the associated scalar advection-diffusion equation generically displays anomalous diffusion. Our main contribution is to propose an analytical framework in which to study anomalous diffusion via a backward cascade of renormalized eddy viscosities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish the existence and spectral stability, with respect to perturbations of the same period, of double-periodic standing waves for the nonlinear focusing Schr\"odinger equation posed on the bi-dimensional torus. We first show that such double-periodic solutions can be constructed via local and global bifurcation theory, under the assumption that the kernel of the linearized operator around the equilibrium solution is one-dimensional. In addition, we prove that these local and global solutions minimize an appropriate variational problem, which enables us to derive spectral properties of the linearized operator about the periodic wave. Finally, we establish the spectral stability of small-amplitude periodic waves by applying the techniques developed in \cite{KapitulaKevrekidisSandstedeII} and \cite{KapitulaKevrekidisSandstedeI}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear time-asymptotic stability of the composite wave consisting of two viscous shocks and a viscous contact discontinuity for the one-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations. Specifically, we establish that if the composite wave strength and the perturbations are sufficiently small, the NSF system admits a unique global-in-time strong solution, which converges uniformly in space as time tends to infinity, towards the corresponding composite wave, up to dynamical shifts in the positions of the two viscous shocks. Notably, the strengths of the two viscous shocks can be chosen independently. Our proof relies upon the $a$-contraction method with time-dependent shifts and suitable weight functions.</description>

Abstract: We study linear cocycles generated by nonautonomous delay equations in a proper Hilbert space and their extensions (compound cocycles) to exterior powers. Armed with the recently developed version of the Frequency Theorem, we develop analytic perturbation techniques for comparison of spectral properties (e.g., uniform exponential dichotomies) between such cocycles and cocycles generated by stationary equations. In the basis, there lies an interplay between regularity and structure in PDEs associated with delay equations. In particular, the developed machinery results in effective robust criteria for the absence of closed invariant contours on global attractors arising in nonlinear problems.</description>

      <title>Bounding Escape Rates and Approximating Quasi-Stationary Distributions of Brownian Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Throughout physics Brownian dynamics are used to describe the behaviour of molecular systems. When the Brownian particle is confined to a bounded domain, a particularly important question arises around determining how long it takes the particle to encounter certain regions of the boundary from which it can escape. Termed the first passage time, it sets the natural timescale of the chemical, biological, and physical processes that are described by the stochastic differential equation. Probabilistic information about the first passage time can be studied using spectral properties of the deterministic generator of the stochastic process. In this work we introduce a framework for bounding the leading eigenvalue of the generator which determines the exponential rate of escape of the particle from the domain. The method employs sum-of-squares programming to produce nearly sharp numerical upper and lower bounds on the leading eigenvalue, while also giving good numerical approximations of the associated leading eigenfunction, the quasi-stationary distribution of the process. To demonstrate utility, the method is applied to prototypical low-dimensional problems from the literature.</description>

Abstract: By leveraging a new Laplacian comparison theorem, we derive a Li-Yau type gradient estimate for a particular nonlinear parabolic equation, namely, the Finslerian logarithmic Schrodinger equation on a non-compact, complete Finsler manifold with mixed weighted Ricci curvature bounded from below. In our framework, all coefficients are time-dependent functions defined on the manifold. As applications, we establish both a Harnack inequality and an a priori estimate for the positive solutions of this specific equation</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of oscillations for axisymmetric solar backgrounds with differential rotation and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local helioseismology comprises of imaging and inversion techniques employed to reconstruct the dynamic and interior of the Sun from correlations of oscillations observed on the surface, all of which require modeling solar oscillations and computing Green's kernels. In this context, we implement and investigate the robustness of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method in solving the equation modeling stellar oscillations for realistic solar backgrounds containing gravity and differential rotation. While a common choice for modeling stellar oscillations is the Galbrun's equation, our working equations are derived from an equivalent variant, involving less regularity in its coefficients, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure perturbation as unknowns. Under differential rotation and axisymmetric assumption, the system is solved in azimuthal decomposition with the HDG method. Compared to no-gravity approximations, the mathematical nature of the wave operator is now linked to the profile of the solar buoyancy frequency N which encodes gravity, and leads to distinction into regions of elliptic or hyperbolic behavior of the wave operator at zero attenuation. While small attenuation is systematically included to guarantee theoretical well-posedness, the above phenomenon affects the numerical solutions in terms of amplitude and oscillation pattern, and requires a judicious choice of stabilization. We investigate the stabilization of the HDG discretization scheme, and demonstrate its importance to ensure the accuracy of numerical results, which is shown to depend on frequencies relative to N, and on the position of the Dirac source. As validations, the numerical power spectra reproduce accurately the observed effects of the solar rotation on acoustic waves.</description>
