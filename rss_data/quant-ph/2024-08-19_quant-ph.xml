      <title>Primer on quantum weirdness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the key ideas and mathematical tools central to modern discussions of collapse. We assume knowledge of basic quantum mechanics -- the Schr\"{o}dinger evolution of states in Hilbert space, the Born probability rule, the Dirac formalism, and so on -- while explicating such ideas as projectors, density operators, Bell inequalities, entanglement and the Lindblad equation. In other words this work is a \emph{primer} in the simplest sense of that word: without taking a stand on the major questions, it is intended to make an enormous and growing body of research more accessible.</description>

      <title>Nature cannot be described by any causal theory with a finite number of measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show, for any $n \geq 2$, that there exists quantum correlations obtained from performing $n$ dichotomic quantum measurements in a bipartite Bell scenario, which cannot be reproduced by $n-1$ measurements in any causal theory. That is, it requires any no-signaling theory an unbounded number of measurements to reproduce the predictions of quantum theory. We prove our results by showing that there exists Bell inequalities that have to be obeyed by any no-signaling theory involving only $n-1$ measurements and show explicitly how these can be violated in quantum theory. Finally, we discuss the relation of our work to previous works ruling out alternatives to quantum theory with some kind of bounded degree of freedom and consider the experimental verifiability of our results.</description>

      <title>Coqa: Blazing Fast Compiler Optimizations for QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most promising candidates for achieving quantum advantage over classical computers. However, existing compilers lack specialized methods for optimizing QAOA circuits. There are circuit patterns inside the QAOA circuits, and current quantum hardware has specific qubit connectivity topologies. Therefore, we propose Coqa to optimize QAOA circuit compilation tailored to different types of quantum hardware. Our method integrates a linear nearest-neighbor (LNN) topology and efficiently map the patterns of QAOA circuits to the LNN topology by heuristically checking the interaction based on the weight of problem Hamiltonian. This approach allows us to reduce the number of SWAP gates during compilation, which directly impacts the circuit depth and overall fidelity of the quantum computation. By leveraging the inherent patterns in QAOA circuits, our approach achieves more efficient compilation compared to general-purpose compilers. With our proposed method, we are able to achieve an average of 30% reduction in gate count and a 39x acceleration in compilation time across our benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Krylov Subspace Methods for Quantum Dynamics with Time-Dependent Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Krylov subspace methods in quantum dynamics identify the minimal subspace in which a process unfolds. To date, their use is restricted to time evolutions governed by time-independent generators. We introduce a generalization valid for driven quantum systems governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that maps the evolution to a diffusion problem in a one-dimensional lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping probabilities that are inhomogeneous and time-dependent. This representation is used to establish a novel class of fundamental limits to the quantum speed of evolution and operator growth. We also discuss generalizations of the algorithm, adapted to discretized time evolutions and periodic Hamiltonians, with applications to many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz formulas for finite-density Casimir effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lifshitz formula is well known as a theoretical approach to investigate the Casimir effect at finite temperature. In this Letter, we generalize the Lifshitz formula to the Casimir effect originating from quantum fields at finite chemical potential. To demonstrate the versatility of this formula, we discuss the typical phenomena of the Casimir effect at finite chemical potential in various systems, such as some boundary conditions, finite temperatures, arbitrary spatial dimensions, and mismatched chemical potentials. This formula can be applied to the Casimir effect in dense quark matter and Dirac/Weyl semimetals, where the chemical potential is regarded as a parameter to control the Casimir effect.</description>

      <title>A controlled-squeeze gate in superconducting quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to prepare non-classical states of the electromagnetic field in a microwave resonator. It is based on a controlled gate that applies a squeezing operation on a SQUID-terminated resonator conditioned on the state of a dispersively coupled qubit. This controlled-squeeze gate, when combined with Gaussian operations on the resonator, is universal. We explore the use of this tool to map an arbitrary qubit state into a superposition of squeezed states. In particular, we target a bosonic code with well-defined superparity which makes photon losses detectable by nondemolition parity measurements. We analyze the possibility of implementing this using state-of-the-art circuit QED tools and conclude that it is within reach of current technologies.</description>

      <title>Integrated photonic Galton board and its application for photon counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galton board is a desktop probability machine traditionally used to visualize the principles of statistical physics with classical particles. Here, we demonstrate a photonic Galton board that enables on-chip observation of single-photon interference. The photonic Galton board, which can be considered as a simplified Boson sampler, consists of a directional coupler matrix terminated by an array of superconducting nanowire detectors to provide spatiotemporal resolution. This design also allows for photon-number-resolving capability, making it suitable for high-speed photon counting. Our results demonstrate the compatibility between single-photon detector array and photonic integrated circuits, paving the way for implementing on-chip large-scale quantum optics experiments and photonic quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Field mixing in a thermal medium: A quantum master equation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the nonequilibrium dynamics of the indirect mixing of two (pseudo-)scalar fields induced by their couplings to common decay channels in a medium. The effective non-Markovian quantum master equation (QME) for the two fields' reduced density matrix is derived to leading order in the couplings of the two fields with the medium, but to all orders of the couplings among degrees of freedom in the medium. The self-energy and noise-kernel in the QME satisfy a fluctuation-dissipation relation. The solutions show that an initial expectation value (condensate) of one field induces a condensate of the other field through the indirect mixing and that the populations and coherence of the two fields thermalize and approach to non-vanishing values asymptotically. The nearly-degenerate field masses and coupling strengths resonantly enhance the quantum beats and asymptotic coherence, and induce a prominent dynamics of the vacuum after the switch-on of the couplings. We argue that a time-dependent definitions of particles due to the changing vacuum must be introduced so as to obtain results consistent with the calculations of equilibrium states in the asymptotic limit. A coupling strength hierarchy breaks down the resonant enhancement in the nearly-degenerate case but leads to different power countings of the coupling strengths in the magnitudes of the observables and time-scales in the evolution, suggesting the possibility of detecting extremely long-lived particles using prepared short-lived particles within a practical experimental period.</description>

      <title>Heralding Higher-Dimensional Bell and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger States Using Multiport Splitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important resources for quantum optical experiments and applications are on-demand highly entangled multiphoton quantum states. A promising way of generating them is heralding entanglement generation at a high rate from letting independent photons interfere. However, such schemes often work for a specific internal degree of freedom of the interfering photons only. Going to higher numbers of entangled photons, the success probabilities decrease while the number of necessary resources, e.g., auxiliary photons and optical elements, increases. To make probabilistic schemes feasible also for larger quantum states, it is therefore important to find resource-efficient generation schemes with high success probabilities. In this work, we introduce easily implementable schemes to herald qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, higher-dimensional Bell states and higher-dimensional three-party GHZ states. Our schemes solely rely on multiphoton interference, i.e., they can be adjusted to work for arbitrary degrees of freedom. Furthermore, they demonstrate high success probabilities and need comparably few auxiliary photons.</description>

      <title>QWalkVec: Node Embedding by Quantum Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose QWalkVec, a quantum walk-based node embedding method. A quantum walk is a quantum version of a random walk that demonstrates a faster propagation than a random walk on a graph. We focus on the fact that the effect of the depth-first search process is dominant when a quantum walk with a superposition state is applied to graphs. Simply using a quantum walk with its superposition state leads to insufficient performance since balancing the depth-first and breadth-first search processes is essential in node classification tasks. To overcome this disadvantage, we formulate novel coin operators that determine the movement of a quantum walker to its neighboring nodes. They enable QWalkVec to integrate the depth-first search and breadth-first search processes by prioritizing node sampling. We evaluate the effectiveness of QWalkVec in node classification tasks conducted on four small-sized real datasets. As a result, we demonstrate that the performance of QWalkVec is superior to that of the existing methods on several datasets. Our code will be available at \url{https://github.com/ReiSato18/QWalkVec}.</description>

      <title>Quantum random power method for ground state computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum-classical hybrid random power method that approximates a ground state of a Hamiltonian. The quantum part of our method computes a fixed number of elements of a Hamiltonian-matrix polynomial via a quantum polynomial filtering technique. This technique can be implemented using Hamiltonian simulation or block encoding, suitable for early fault-tolerant and fault-tolerant regimes, respectively. The classical part of our method is a randomized iterative algorithm that takes as input the matrix elements computed from the quantum part and outputs an approximation of ground state of the Hamiltonian. For the per-iteration complexity of our method, the required classical time is independent of system size, and the quantum circuit complexity depends polylogarithmically on the system size. We prove that with probability one, our method converges to an approximation of a ground state of the Hamiltonian. We also show a lower bound of the fidelity of the approximate ground state with the true one. The lower bound depends linearly on the magnitude of noise occurring from quantum computation if it is smaller than a critical value. Several numerical experiments demonstrate that our method provides a good approximation of ground state in the presence of systematic and/or sampling noise.</description>

      <title>The detection power of real entanglement witnesses under local unitary equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the birth of quantum theory, it has been controversial that whether real numbers are adequate to describe its formalism. Recently, the imaginary unit $i$ has been experimentally proven to be indispensable for quantum mechanics. It motivates us to study the differences in detection power between real and complex entanglement witnesses (EWs), and analyze the detection power of real EWs under local equivalences. We show that a real EW must detect a real entangled state, and conversely a real entangled state must be detected by a real EW. We present a necessary and sufficient condition for the entangled states detected by real EWs, and give a specific example which implies the detection limitations of real EWs. Then, we conjecture that all entangled states are detected by the EWs locally equivalent to real ones. We prove the conjecture for all states with non-positive partial transpose. We also derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the complex PPT (positive-partial-transpose) entangled states detected by the EWs locally equivalent to real ones. We further prove the conjecture for a family of two-quqart PPT entangled states. Another way to figure out the conjecture is to check whether a counterexample exists. We propose an equivalent method to examine the existence of a counterexample from a set-theoretic perspective, and provide some supporting evidence of non-existence. Finally, we derive some results on local projections of EWs with product projectors.</description>

      <title>Solving The Quantum Many-Body Hamiltonian Learning Problem with Neural Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and characterising quantum many-body dynamics remains a significant challenge due to both the exponential complexity required to represent quantum many-body Hamiltonians, and the need to accurately track states in time under the action of such Hamiltonians. This inherent complexity limits our ability to characterise quantum many-body systems, highlighting the need for innovative approaches to unlock their full potential. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method to solve the Hamiltonian Learning (HL) problem-inferring quantum dynamics from many-body state trajectories-using Neural Differential Equations combined with an Ansatz Hamiltonian. Our method is reliably convergent, experimentally friendly, and interpretable, making it a stable solution for HL on a set of Hamiltonians previously unlearnable in the literature. In addition to this, we propose a new quantitative benchmark based on power laws, which can objectively compare the reliability and generalisation capabilities of any two HL algorithms. Finally, we benchmark our method against state-of-the-art HL algorithms with a 1D spin-1/2 chain proof of concept.</description>

      <title>Optical Ground Station Diversity for Satellite Quantum Key Distribution in Ireland</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space quantum communications is a potential means for establishing global secure communications and quantum networking. Despite pioneering demonstrations of satellite quantum key distribution, considerable challenges remain for wide deployment such as the local effects of the atmosphere on the transmission of single-photon level quantum signals. As part of Ireland's efforts to establish quantum links with the rest of Europe and further afield, we present a preliminary study of the feasibility of satellite quantum key distribution taking into account geographic and weather effects on the space-Earth channel. Weather data over 5 years covering 4 locations across Ireland were used to assess performance and the prospects of optical ground station (OGS) geographic diversity to improve service availability. Despite significant cloud cover that may reduce the performance of a single OGS location, the use of a 4-OGS network can provide up to 45% improvement for a single satellite exploiting anti-correlation in cloud cover, though most gains are achieved with 2 or 3 OGSs.</description>

      <title>Improving Gaussian channel simulation using non-unity gain heralded quantum teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian channel simulation is an essential paradigm in understanding the evolution of bosonic quantum states. It allows us to investigate how such states are influenced by the environment and how they transmit quantum information. This makes it an essential tool for understanding the properties of Gaussian quantum communication. Quantum teleportation provides an avenue to effectively simulate Gaussian channels such as amplifier channels, loss channels and classically additive noise channels. However, implementations of these channels, particularly quantum amplifier channels and channels capable of performing Gaussian noise suppression are limited by experimental imperfections and non-ideal entanglement resources. In this work, we overcome these difficulties using a heralded quantum teleportation scheme that is empowered by a measurement-based noiseless linear amplifier. The noiseless linear amplification enables us to simulate a range of Gaussian channels that were previously inaccessible. In particular, we demonstrate the simulation of non-physical Gaussian channels otherwise inaccessible using conventional means. We report Gaussian noise suppression, effectively converting an imperfect quantum channel into a near-identity channel. The performance of Gaussian noise suppression is quantified by calculating the transmitted entanglement.</description>

      <title>Local quantum channels giving rise to quasi-local Gibbs states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the steady-state properties of quantum channels with local Kraus operators. We consider a large family that consists of general ergodic 1-local (non-interacting) terms and general 2-local (interacting) terms. Physically, a repeated application of these channels can be seen as a simple model for the thermalization process of a many-body system. We study its steady state perturbatively by interpolating between the 1-local and 2-local channels with a perturbation parameter $\epsilon$. We prove that under very general conditions, these states are Gibbs states of a quasi-local Hamiltonian. Expanding this Hamiltonian as a series in $\epsilon$, we show that the $k$'th order term corresponds to a $(k+1)$-local interaction term in the Hamiltonian, which follows the same interaction graph as the Kraus channel. We also prove a complementary result suggesting the existence of an interaction strength threshold, under which the total weight of the high-order terms in the Hamiltonian decays exponentially fast. This result also implies a quasi-polynomial classical algorithm for computing the expectation value of local observables in such steady states. Finally, we also present numerical simulations of various channels that support our theoretical claims.</description>

      <title>Quantum convolutional neural networks for jet images classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, interest in quantum computing has significantly increased, driven by its potential advantages over classical techniques. Quantum machine learning (QML) exemplifies one of the important quantum computing applications that are expected to surpass classical machine learning in a wide range of instances. This paper addresses the performance of QML in the context of high-energy physics (HEP). As an example, we focus on the top-quark tagging, for which classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been effective but fall short in accuracy when dealing with highly energetic jet images. In this paper, we use a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) for this task and compare its performance with CNN using a classical noiseless simulator. We compare various setups for the QCNN, varying the convolutional circuit, type of encoding, loss function, and batch sizes. For every quantum setup, we design a similar setup to the corresponding classical model for a fair comparison. Our results indicate that QCNN with proper setups tend to perform better than their CNN counterparts, particularly when the convolution block has a lower number of parameters. This suggests that quantum models, especially with appropriate encodings, can hold potential promise for enhancing performance in HEP tasks such as top quark jet tagging.</description>

      <title>A methodical approach to evaluate the potential of Quantum Computing for Manufacturing Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a methodical approach to evaluate the potential of quantum computing for manufacturing simulation, using the example of multi-axis milling of thin-walled aerospace components, is discussed. A developed approach for identifying bottlenecks in manufacturing simulations, for which the application of quantum computing potentially provides a speed-up or increase in accuracy, is presented. Moreover, indicators of quantum computing suitability and feasibility are defined with the main objective of identifying whether a manufacturing simulation bottleneck is suitable for quantum computing applications. First results of testing a hybrid routine as an application approach for the milling dynamics simulation on quantum machines are presented.</description>

      <title>Low temperature decoherence dynamics in molecular spin systems using the Lindblad master equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the spin dynamics in low-temperature settings is crucial to designing and optimizing molecular spin systems for use in emerging quantum technologies. At low temperatures, irreversible loss occurs due to ensemble dynamics facilitated by electronic-nuclear spin interactions. We develop a combined open quantum systems and electronic structure theory capable of predicting trends in relaxation rates in molecular spin ensembles. We use the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation and explicitly include electronic structure information in the decoherence channels. We apply this theory to several molecular systems pertinent to contemporary quantum technologies. Our theory provides a framework to describe irreversible relaxation effects in molecular spin systems with applications in quantum information science, quantum sensing, molecular spintronics, and other spin systems dominated by spin-spin relaxation.</description>

      <title>Effect of Correlated Errors on Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent improvements in LDPC code based fault-tolerance for memory against i.i.d. errors naturally lead to the question of fault-tolerance against errors with long-range correlations. We introduce a classical correlation model based on hidden random fields for modeling such errors. We show that this proposed model can capture certain correlation patterns not captured by the joint (system and bath) Hamiltonian model with pairwise terms. Towards that, we derive a converse result for retention time in the presence of an error distribution, which is from the proposed class and exhibits quadratically small correlations. On the other hand, we show that for a broad subclass of error distributions within the proposed model, Tanner codes can ensure exponential retention time when the error rate is sufficiently low. The proposed model is analytically tractable due to the existence of a rich probability literature and thus, can offer insights complementary to the joint Hamiltonian model with pairwise terms.</description>

      <title>How exchange symmetry impacts performance of collective quantum heat engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, multilevel collectively coupled quantum machines like heat engines and refrigerators have been shown to admit performance enhancements in analogy to superradiance. Thus far, investigations of the performance of collective quantum machines have largely restricted the dynamics to particles with bosonic exchange symmetry, especially for large numbers of particles. However, collections of indistiguishable but not fundamentally identical particles may assume quantum states of more general exchange symmetry or combinations thereof, raising the question of whether collective advantages can be observed for dynamics that allow the full Hilbert space to be explored. Here, we compare a collection of single-particle three-level masers with their collectively coupled counterpart, while admitting more general forms of exchange symmetry. We study ergotropy and emitted power as the figures of merit and show which of the known results applicable to a single three-level engine carry over to an engine made up of a collectively coupled ensemble. We do this using results from representation theory to characterise the full basis of the Hilbert space and provide general tools for the description of the dynamics of such systems. We find that collective work extraction can extend beyond the temperature window of three-level lasing, whereas in the lasing regime, individual may outperform collective operation. In addition, the optimal parameter regime for work-like energy output varies for different symmetry types. Our results show a rich picture in which bosonic symmetry is not always optimal and sometimes individual particles may even perform best.</description>

      <title>A Novel Quantum Algorithm for Efficient Attractor Search in Gene Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The description of gene interactions that constantly occur in the cellular environment is an extremely challenging task due to an immense number of degrees of freedom and incomplete knowledge about microscopic details. Hence, a coarse-grained and rather powerful modeling of such dynamics is provided by Boolean Networks (BNs). BNs are dynamical systems composed of Boolean agents and a record of their possible interactions over time. Stable states in these systems are called attractors which are closely related to the cellular expression of biological phenotypes. Identifying the full set of attractors is, therefore, of substantial biological interest. However, for conventional high-performance computing, this problem is plagued by an exponential growth of the dynamic state space. Here, we demonstrate a novel quantum search algorithm inspired by Grover's algorithm to be implemented on quantum computing platforms. The algorithm performs an iterative suppression of states belonging to basins of previously discovered attractors from a uniform superposition, thus increasing the amplitudes of states in basins of yet unknown attractors. This approach guarantees that a new attractor state is measured with each iteration of the algorithm, an optimization not currently achieved by any other algorithm in the literature. Tests of its resistance to noise have also shown promising performance on devices from the current Noise Intermediate Scale Quantum Computing (NISQ) era.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Quantum Heat Statistics with the Reaction Coordinate Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The definition of heat in quantum mechanics is ambiguous. Complications arise in particular when the coupling between a quantum system and an environment is non-negligible, as the boundary between the two becomes blurred, making the distinction between system and environment difficult to draw. The reaction coordinate mapping can be used in such regimes to redraw the boundary between the system and environment. Here we combine the reaction coordinate technique with a two-point measurement protocol to compare two different definitions of heat: energetic changes in the full environment Hamiltonian (prior to the mapping), and energetic changes in the residual environment Hamiltonian (after the mapping). We find that the latter definition displays behaviour more expected of a thermal environment in the highly non-Markovian regime considered.</description>

Abstract: In the quest to harness the power of quantum computing, training quantum neural networks (QNNs) presents a formidable challenge. This study introduces an innovative approach, integrating the Bees Optimization Algorithm (BOA) to overcome one of the most significant hurdles -- barren plateaus. Our experiments across varying qubit counts and circuit depths demonstrate the BOA's superior performance compared to the Adam algorithm. Notably, BOA achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, and greater computational efficiency. This study confirms BOA's potential in enhancing the applicability of QNNs in complex quantum computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we strengthen the connection between qubit-based quantum circuits and photonic quantum computation. Within the framework of circuit-based quantum computation, the sum-over-paths interpretation of quantum probability amplitudes leads to the emergence of sums of exponentiated polynomials. In contrast, the matrix permanent is a combinatorial object that plays a crucial role in photonic by describing the probability amplitudes of linear optical computations. To connect the two, we introduce a general method to encode an $\mathbb F_2$-valued polynomial with complex coefficients into a graph, such that the permanent of the resulting graph's adjacency matrix corresponds directly to the amplitude associated the polynomial in the sum-over-path framework. This connection allows one to express quantum amplitudes arising from qubit-based circuits as permanents, which can naturally be estimated on a photonic quantum device.</description>

Abstract: Single-shot quantum error correction has the potential to speed up quantum computations by removing the need for multiple rounds of syndrome extraction in order to be fault-tolerant. Using Quantinuum's H2 trapped-ion quantum computer, we implement the [[33,1,4]] 4D surface code and perform the first experimental demonstration of single-shot quantum error correction with bare ancilla qubits. We conduct memory experiments comparing the 2D and 4D surface codes and find that despite differences in qubit use and syndrome extraction circuit depth, the 4D surface code matches or outperforms the 2D surface code in both the fault-tolerant and single-shot regimes.</description>

Abstract: This introductory text on the basics of quantum mechanics is intended to serve as a kind of travel guide through the quantum world. It starts by asking whether quantum physics is important, or weird, or incomprehensible. It explains why particles sometimes behave like waves, and how uncertainty and randomness enter physics, before explaining a number of historically important experiments. Modern topics, like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and quantum computing are also covered. Essential concepts, such as the uncertainty principle, are analyzed in depth, employing a slightly increased dose of mathematics.
  This is the English version of the first part of a manual intended as a companion to the "Treffpunkt Quantenmechanik" (meeting point quantum mechanics), a laboratory at TU Dortmund University, where high-school students can get acquainted with the wonderful world of quantum physics.

Abstract: This paper introduces a simplified quantum Petri net (QPN) model and uses this model to generalize classical SISO, SIMO, MISO, MIMO and priority buffers to their quantum counterparts. It provides a primitive storage element, namely a quantum S-R flip-flop design using quantum CNOT and SWAP gates that can be replicated to obtain a quantum register for any given number of qubits. The aforementioned quantum buffers are then obtained using the simplified QPN model and quantum registers. $\!\!$The quantum S-R flip-flop and quantum buffer designs have been tested using OpenQASM and Qiskit on IBM quantum computers and simulators and the results validate the presented quantum S-R flip-flop and buffer designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma is capable of mediating the conversion of two pump photons into two different photons through a relativistic four-wave mixing nonlinearity. Spontaneously created photon pairs are emitted at symmetric angles with respect to the colinear pump direction, and the emission rate is largest if they have identical frequency. Thus, two orthogonally polarized pumps can produce polarization-entangled photon pairs through a mm-long homogeneous plasma. The noise from Raman scattering can be avoided if the pump detuning differs from twice the plasma frequency. On the other hand, pump detuning exactly equal to twice the plasma frequency can significantly enhance the interaction rate, which allows for the production of two-mode squeezed states. Remarkably, the amplified noise from Raman scattering are correlated and hence can be suppressed in one of the output quadratures, thereby maintaining the squeezing magnitude.</description>

      <title>Differentiating Three-Dimensional Molecular Structures using Laser-induced Coulomb Explosion Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) with x-ray free electron lasers has recently been shown to be a powerful method for obtaining detailed structural information of gas-phase planar ring molecules [R. Boll et al. Nat. Phys. 18, 423-428 (2022)]. In this Letter, we investigate the potential of CEI driven by a tabletop laser and extend this approach to differentiating three-dimensional (3D) structures. We study the static CEI patterns of planar and nonplanar organic molecules that resemble the structures of typical products formed in ring-opening reactions. Our results reveal that each molecule exhibits a well-localized and distinctive pattern in 3D fragment-ion momentum space. We find that these patterns yield direct information about the molecular structures and can be qualitatively reproduced using a classical Coulomb explosion simulation. Our findings suggest that laser-induced CEI can serve as a robust method for differentiating molecular structures of organic ring and chain molecules. As such, it holds great promise as a method for following ultrafast structural changes, e.g., during ring-opening reactions, by tracking the motion of individual atoms in pump-probe experiments.</description>

      <title>Flat-plane based double-counting free and parameter free many-body DFT+U</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Burgess et al. have recently introduced the BLOR corrective exchange-correlation functional that is, by construction, the unique simplified rotationally-invariant DFT+U functional that enforces the flat-plane condition separately on each effective orbital of a localized subspace. Detached from the Hubbard model, functionals of this type are both double-counting correction free and, when optimized in situ using appropriate error quantifiers, effectively parameter free. In this work, the extension of the BLOR functional to address many-body errors (mBLOR) is derived. The mBLOR functional is built to enforce the flat-plane condition on the entire subspace, rather than on each orbital individually. In this way inter-orbital errors are corrected on the same footing as the single-particle ones. Focusing on exact test cases with strong inter-orbital interactions, the BLOR and mBLOR functionals were benchmarked against contemporary DFT+U functionals using the total energy extensivity condition on stretched homo-nuclear p-block dimers that represent various self-interaction and static-correlation error regimes. The BLOR functional outperformed all other DFT+$U$ functionals tested, which often act to increase total-energy errors, yet it still yielded large errors in some systems. mBLOR instead yielded low energy errors across all four strongly-correlated dimers, while being constructed using only semi-local approximation ingredients. As mBLOR would not otherwise introduce a band-gap correction in the manner that is a desirable feature of DFT+U, we developed a cost-free technique to reintroduce it automatically by moving the functional's unusual explicit derivative discontinuity into the potential. With this in place, mBLOR is the only known DFT$+U$ functional that opens the bandgap of stretched neutral homo-nuclear dimers without the aid of unphysical spin-symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the unitary Bose gas near a narrow Feshbach resonance: universal coherent atom-molecule oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quench experiments on a unitary Bose gas around a broad Feshbach resonance have led to the discovery of universal dynamics. This universality is manifested in the measured atomic momentum distributions where, asymptotically, a quasi-equilibrated metastable state is found in which both the momentum distribution and the time scales are determined by the particle density. In this paper we present counterpart studies but for the case of a very narrow Feshbach resonance of $^{133}$Cs atoms having a width of 8.3 mG. In dramatic contrast to the behavior reported earlier, a rapid quench of an atomic condensate to unitarity is observed to ultimately lead to coherent oscillations involving dynamically produced condensed and non-condensed molecules and atoms. The same characteristic frequency, determined by the Feshbach coupling, is observed in all types of particles. To understand these quench dynamics and how these different particle species are created, we develop a beyond Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov dynamical framework including a new type of cross correlation between atoms and molecules. This leads to a quantitative consistency with the measured frequency. Our results, which can be applied to the general class of bosonic superfluids associated with narrow Feshbach resonances, establish a new paradigm for universal dynamics dominated by quantum many-body interactions.</description>

      <title>SLOCC and LU classification of black holes with eight electric and magnetic charges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \cite{Linde}, Kallosh and Linde discussed the SLOCC classification of black holes. However, the criteria for the SLOCC classification of black holes have not been given. In addition, the LU classification of black holes has not been studied in the past. In this paper we will consider both SLOCC and LU classification of the STU black holes with four integer electric charges $q_{i} $ and four integer magnetic charges $p^{i}$, $i=0,1,2,3$. Two STU black holes with eight charges are considered SLOCC (LU) equivalent if and only if their corresponding states of three qubits are SLOCC (LU) equivalent. Under this definition, we give criteria for the classification of the eight-charge STU black holes under SLOCC and under LU, respectively. We will study the classification of the black holes via the classification of SLOCC and LU entanglement of three qubits. We then identify a set of black holes corresponding to the state W of three qubits, which is of interest since it has the maximal average von Neumann entropy of entanglement. Via von Neumann entanglement entropy, we partition the STU black holes corresponding to pure states of GHZ SLOCC class into five families under LU.</description>

      <title>Stability of Majorana zero modes with quantum optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I analyze the emergence of Majorana zero modes (MZM) in a one dimensional ultracold fermionic system confined by an optical lattice inside a high-Q cavity. This forms a quantum optical lattice due to the cavity backaction, with emergent long range interactions controlled by the light pumped into the system and thus long range pairing. I investigate the possibility of formation and emergence of edge modes using exact diagonalization and singular value decomposition of the Hamiltonian in the Majorana representation, while computing the mass gap of the MZM. I find that under certain conditions MZM appear distinctively. This MZM have potential applications for quantum information as they are topologically protected analogous to the behaviour of the Kitaev chain.</description>

      <title>Acceleration and twisting of neutral atoms by strong elliptically polarized short-wavelength laser pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated non-dipole effects in the interaction of a hydrogen atom with elliptically polarized laser pulses of intensity 10$^{14}$ W/cm$^2$ with about 8 fs duration. The study was performed within the framework of a hybrid quantum-quasiclassical approach in which the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for an electron and the classical Hamilton equations for the center-of-mass (CM) of an atom are simultaneously integrated. It is shown that the spatial inhomogeneity $ \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}$ of the laser field and the presence of a magnetic component in it lead to the non-separability of the CM and electron variables in a neutral atom and, as a consequence, to its acceleration. We have established a strict correlation between the total probability of excitation and ionization of an atom and the velocity of its CM acquired as a result of interaction with a laser pulse. The acceleration of the atom weakly depends on the polarization of the laser in the considered region (\mbox{5 eV $\lesssim \hbar\omega \lesssim $ 27 eV}) of its frequencies. However, the transition from linear to elliptical laser polarization leads to the twisting of the atom relative to the axis directed along the pulse propagation (coinciding with the direction of the momentum of the accelerated atom). It is shown that with increasing ellipticity the twisting effect increases and reaches its maximum value with circular polarization. At this point the projection of the orbital angular momentum acquired by the electron onto the direction of the pulse propagation reaches its maximum value. Further exploration of the possibilities for producing accelerated and twisted atoms with electromagnetic pulses is of interest for a number of prospective applications.</description>

Abstract: The integration of topology into photonics has generated a new design framework for constructing robust and unidirectional waveguides, which are not feasible with traditional photonic devices. Here, we overcome current barriers to the successful integration of quantum emitters such as quantum dots (QDs) into valley-Hall (VH) topological waveguides, utilising photonic defects at the topological interface to stabilise the local charge environment and inverse design for efficient topological-conventional mode conversion. By incorporating QDs within defects of VH-photonic crystals, we demonstrate the first instances of single-photon resonant fluorescence and resonant transmission spectroscopy of a quantum emitter at a topological waveguide interface. Our results bring together topological photonics with optical nonlinear effects at the single-photon level, offering a new avenue to investigate the interaction between topology and quantum nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Antiferromagnetic Chains via Combined On-surface Synthesis and Reduction for Spinon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains are excellent one-dimensional platforms for exploring quantum magnetic states and quasiparticle fractionalization. Understanding its quantum magnetism and quasiparticle excitation at the atomic scale is crucial for manipulating the quantum spin systems. Here, we report the fabrication of spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains through on-surface synthesis and in-situ reduction. A closed-shell nanographene is employed as a precursor for Ullman coupling to avoid radical fusing, thus obtaining oligomer chains. Following exposure to atomic hydrogen and tip manipulation, closed-shell polymers are transformed into spin-1/2 chains with controlled lengths by reducing the ketone groups and subsequent hydrogen desorption. The spin excitation gaps are found to decrease in power-law as the chain lengths, suggesting its gapless feature. More interestingly, the spinon dispersion is extracted from the inelastic spectroscopic spectra, agreeing well with the calculations. Our results demonstrate the great potential of fabricating desired quantum systems through a combined on-surface synthesis and reduction approach.</description>

      <title>Device-independent lower bounds on the conditional von Neumann entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.13692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rates of several device-independent (DI) protocols, including quantum key-distribution (QKD) and randomness expansion (RE), can be computed via an optimization of the conditional von Neumann entropy over a particular class of quantum states. In this work we introduce a numerical method to compute lower bounds on such rates. We derive a sequence of optimization problems that converge to the conditional von Neumann entropy of systems defined on general separable Hilbert spaces. Using the Navascu\'es-Pironio-Ac\'in hierarchy we can then relax these problems to semidefinite programs, giving a computationally tractable method to compute lower bounds on the rates of DI protocols. Applying our method to compute the rates of DI-RE and DI-QKD protocols we find substantial improvements over all previous numerical techniques, demonstrating significantly higher rates for both DI-RE and DI-QKD. In particular, for DI-QKD we show a minimal detection efficiency threshold which is within the realm of current capabilities. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method is capable of converging rapidly by recovering all known tight analytical bounds up to several decimal places. Finally, we note that our method is compatible with the entropy accumulation theorem and can thus be used to compute rates of finite round protocols and subsequently prove their security.</description>

Abstract: The no-masking theorem for quantum information proves that it is impossible to encode an arbitrary input state into a larger bipartite entangled state such that the full information is stored in the correlation but the individual subsystems have no information about the input state. Here, we ask the question: Is it possible to mask an observable such that the information about the observable is available in the joint system, but individual subsystems reveal nothing about the imprints of the observable? This generalizes the notion of masking to observables. We show that a universal unitary that can mask an arbitrary observable in any dimension does not exist. For a qubit system, we show that the masking operation for a given observable is locally unitarily connected to the SWAP operation. This suggests a conservation law for information content of observables that goes beyond the conservation laws under symmetry operations. Furthermore, we prove that the unconditional no-bit commitment result follows from the no-masking theorem for observables. Our results can have important applications in quantum information and quantum communication where we encode information not in states but in observables.</description>

      <title>Classification of "large" black holes into seven families</title>

Abstract: The black-hole--qubit correspondence has been proven to be ``useful for obtaining additional insight into one of the string black hole theory and quantum information theory by exploiting approaches of the other"[Phys. Rev. D 82, 026003 (2010)]. Though different classes of stringy black holes can be related to the well-known stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) entanglement classes of pure states, the string theory requires a more detailed classification than the SLOCC classification of three qubits. In this paper, we derive the entanglement family of three qubits under local unitary operations (LU), and use the black-hole--qubit correspondence to classify \textquotedblleft large\textquotedblright\ black holes into seven inequivalent families. In particular, we show that two black holes with 4 non-vanishing charges ($q_{0}$, $p^{1}$, $p^{2}$, and $p^{3}$) are LU equivalent if their difference is only in the signs of charges. Thus, the classification of black holes is independent of the signs of charges and is only related to the ratio of the absolute values of charges. This observation simplifies the classification task, as one would only need to consider either the classification of non-BPS black holes or the classification of BPS black holes, but not both. Moreover, through the LU classification, the physical basis for this black-hole--qubit correspondence can be observed, and a relation between the black-hole entropy and the von Neumann entanglement entropy is revealed. Therefore, the LU classification offers a more straightforward physical connection than the SLOCC classification. Based on the LU classification, we further study the properties of von Neumann entanglement entropy for each of the seven families, and find the black holes with the maximal von Neumann entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Strong tunable spin-spin coupling with cavity-magnon criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong long-distance spin-spin coupling is desperately demanded for solid-state quantum information processing, but it is still challenged. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum system, consisting of a coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator weakly coupled to a single nitrogen-vacancy spin in diamond and a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) nanosphere holding Kerr magnons, to realize strong long-distance spin-spin coupling. With a strong driving field on magnons, the Kerr effect can squeeze magnons, and thus the coupling between the CPW resonator and the squeezed magnons is {\it exponentially enhanced}, which produces two cavity-magnon polaritons, i.e., the high-frequency polariton (HP) and low-frequency polariton (LP). When the enhanced cavity-magnon coupling approaches the critical value, the spin is fully decoupled from the HP, while the coupling between the spin and the LP is significantly improved. In the dispersive regime, a strong spin-spin coupling is achieved with accessible parameters. The coupling distance can be up to centimeter scale, limited by the cavity size. Our proposal provides a pave way to manipulate solid spins with cavity-magnon polaritons.</description>

Abstract: Particle-conserved subspace encoding reduces resources for quantum simulations, but a scalable and resource-minimal protocol for $M$ modes and $N$ particles, $\mathcal{O}(N\log M)$ qubits and $\mathcal{O}(Poly(M))$ measurements bases, has remained unknown. We demonstrate optimal encoding with classical parity check code generated by the Randomized Linear Encoder and propose the Fermionic Expectation Decoder for scalable probability decoding in $\mathcal{O}(M^4)$ bases. The protocol is tested with variational quantum eigensolver on LiH in the STO-3G and 6-31G basis, and $\text{H}_2$ potential energy curve in the 6-311G* basis.</description>

      <title>Corrected Bell and Noncontextuality Inequalities for Realistic Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contextuality is a feature of quantum correlations. It is crucial from a foundational perspective as a nonclassical phenomenon, and from an applied perspective as a resource for quantum advantage. It is commonly defined in terms of hidden variables, for which it forces a contradiction with the assumptions of parameter-independence and determinism. The former can be justified by the empirical property of non-signalling or non-disturbance, and the latter by the empirical property of measurement sharpness. However, in realistic experiments neither empirical property holds exactly, which leads to possible objections to contextuality as a form of nonclassicality, and potential vulnerabilities for supposed quantum advantages. We introduce measures to quantify both properties, and introduce quantified relaxations of the corresponding assumptions. We prove the continuity of a known measure of contextuality, the contextual fraction, which ensures its robustness to noise. We then bound the extent to which these relaxations can account for contextuality, via corrections terms to the contextual fraction (or to any noncontextuality inequality), culminating in a notion of genuine contextuality, which is robust to experimental imperfections. We then show that our result is general enough to apply or relate to a variety of established results and experimental setups.</description>

Abstract: Since quantum spatial searches on complex networks have a strong network dependence, the question arises whether the universal perspective exists in this quantum algorithm for complex networks. Here, we uncover the universal scaling laws of the quantum spatial search on complex networks such as small-world and scale-free networks. The average path length, a key quantity in the complex network science, is useful to expose this universal feature, where the collapse plot can be generated for the optimal time, the maximal finding probability and the optimal hopping parameter. Based on the path integral method, we also clarify that the probability amplitude in the continuous-time quantum walk can be determined by the path length distribution. Our results demonstrate a new link between the quantum physics and the complex networks.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Qubits Above 20 GHz Operating over 200 mK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art superconducting microwave qubits are cooled to extremely low temperatures to avoid sources of decoherence. Higher qubit operating temperatures would significantly increase the cooling power available, which is desirable for scaling up the number of qubits in quantum computing architectures and integrating qubits in experiments requiring increased heat dissipation. To operate superconducting qubits at higher temperatures, it is necessary to address both quasiparticle decoherence (which becomes significant for aluminum junctions above 160 mK) and dephasing from thermal microwave photons (which are problematic above 50 mK). Using low-loss niobium trilayer junctions, which have reduced sensitivity to quasiparticles due to niobium's higher superconducting transition temperature, we fabricate transmons with higher frequencies than previously studied, up to 24 GHz. We measure decoherence and dephasing times of about 1 us, corresponding to average qubit quality factors of approximately $10^5$, and find that decoherence is unaffected by quasiparticles up to 1 K. Without relaxation from quasiparticles, we are able to explore dephasing from purely thermal sources, finding that our qubits can operate up to approximately 250 mK while maintaining similar performance. The thermal resilience of these qubits creates new options for scaling up quantum processors, enables hybrid quantum experiments with high heat dissipation budgets, and introduces a material platform for even higher-frequency qubits.</description>

Abstract: Cold atoms in optical lattice represent a quantum system of fundamental importance as they enable the study of many-body physics in a controllable way. It is thus essential to develop theoretical and experimental tools to explore quantum correlation in such systems to advance our understanding of many-body interactions. While previous works have identified some profound aspects of quantum entanglement via e.g. entanglement entropy, there exists a critical demand to have an experimentally accessible tool to investigate many-body quantum entanglement in a broad context. We present an entanglement criterion characterizing collective entanglement among lattice sites and enabling experimental observation readily. Our criterion witnesses phase transitions such as Mott insulator--superfluid and Mott insulator--charge density wave transitions in a measurable way and can be experimentally tested via Raman scattering or time-of-flight expansion approach thus within the reach of current technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation is a key approach for extracting target state properties on state-of-the-art noisy machines and early fault-tolerant devices. Using the ideas from flag fault tolerance and virtual state purification, we develop the virtual channel purification (VCP) protocol, which consumes similar qubit and gate resources as virtual state purification but offers stronger error suppression with increased system size and more noisy operation copies. Furthermore, VCP removes most of the assumptions required in virtual state purification. Essentially, VCP is the first quantum error mitigation protocol that does not require specific knowledge about the noise models, the target quantum state, and the target problem while still offering rigorous performance guarantees for practical noise regimes. Further connections are made between VCP and quantum error correction to produce the virtual error correction (VEC) protocol, one of the first protocols that combine quantum error correction (QEC) and quantum error mitigation beyond concatenation. VEC can virtually remove all correctable noise in the channel while paying only the same sampling cost as low-order purification. It can achieve QEC-level protection on an unencoded register when transmitting it through a noisy channel, removing the associated encoding qubit overhead. Another variant of VEC can mimic the error suppression power of the surface code by inputting only a bit-flip and a phase-flip code. Our protocol can also be adapted to key tasks in quantum networks like channel capacity activation and entanglement distribution.</description>

Abstract: Nearly quantum limited Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs) are essential components in superconducting quantum circuits. However, higher order nonlinearities of the Josephson cosine potential are known to cause gain compression, therefore limiting scalability. In an effort to reduce the fourth order, or Kerr nonlinearity, we realize a parametric amplifier with an Al-InAs superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Josephson junction (JJ). We extract the Kerr nonlinearity of the Al-InAs JJ from two different devices and show that it is three orders of magnitude lower compared to an Al-$\text{AlO}_\text{X}$ junction with identical Josephson inductance. We then demonstrate a four-wave-mixing (4WM) parametric amplifier made with an Al-InAs junction that achieves more than 20 dB of gain and -119 dBm of compression power, that outperforms single resonant JPAs based on Al junctions.</description>

      <title>Low Overhead Qutrit Magic State Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that using qutrits rather than qubits leads to a substantial reduction in the overhead cost associated with an approach to fault-tolerant quantum computing known as magic state distillation. We construct a family of $[[9m-k, k, 2]]_3$ triorthogonal qutrit error-correcting codes for any positive integers $m$ and $k$ with $k \leq 3m-2$ that are suitable for magic state distillation. In magic state distillation, the number of ancillae required to produce a magic state with target error rate $\epsilon$ is $O(\log^\gamma \epsilon^{-1})$, where the yield parameter $\gamma$ characterizes the overhead cost. For $k=3m-2$, our codes have $\gamma = \log_2 (2+\frac{6}{3 m-2})$, which tends to $1$ as $m \to \infty$. Moreover, the $[[20,7,2]]_3$ qutrit code that arises from our construction when $m=3$ already has a yield parameter of $1.51$ which outperforms all known qubit triorthogonal codes of size less than a few hundred qubits.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in symmetric random circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry, which serves as a diagnostic tool for symmetry breaking and a proxy for thermalization, has recently been proposed and studied in the context of symmetry restoration for quantum many-body systems undergoing a quench. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry restoration in various symmetric random quantum circuits, particularly focusing on the U(1) symmetry case. In contrast to non-symmetric random circuits where the U(1) symmetry of a small subsystem can always be restored at late times, we reveal that symmetry restoration can fail in U(1)-symmetric circuits for certain weak symmetry-broken initial states in finite-size systems. In the early-time dynamics, we observe an intriguing quantum Mpemba effect implying that symmetry is restored faster when the initial state is more asymmetric. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement asymmetry dynamics for SU(2) and $Z_{2}$ symmetric circuits and identify the presence and absence of the quantum Mpemba effect for the corresponding symmetries, respectively. A unified understanding of these results is provided through the lens of quantum thermalization with conserved charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An m-uniform quantum state on n qubits is an entangled state in which every m-qubit subsystem is maximally mixed. Such a state spans a pure [[n,0,m+1]] quantum error correcting code (QECC). Starting with an m-uniform state realized as the graph state associated with an m-regular graph, and a classical [n,k,d \ge m+1] binary linear code with certain additional properties, we construct codeword stabilized (CWS) codes that are pure [[n,k,m+1]] QECCs. We propose measurement-based protocols for encoding into code states and recovery of logical qubits from code states. Our proposed protocols support sequential encoding and partial recovery of logical qubits, which can be useful for quantum memory applications.</description>

      <title>Conditions for enhancement of chemical reactions in gas phase inside a dark cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhancing chemical reactions, such as $A+B \to [\textit{activated complex}]^\# \to C+D$, in gas phase through its coupling to quantum-electrodynamics (QED) modes in a dark cavity is investigated. The main result is that the enhancement of the reaction rate by a dark cavity is for asymmetric reactions (products different from reactants.) Notice that in addition to the cavity been dark, the reactants are in their ground electronic and vibrational states, i.e., it is indeed dark. Theoretical derivation, utilizing the non-Hermitian formalism of quantum mechanics (NHQM), provides conditions and guidelines for selecting the proper type of reactions that can be enhanced by a dark cavity. Nevertheless, the time-dependent simulations of such experiments can be carried out using the standard (Hermitian) scattering theory (but including the conditions derived via NHQM). We believe that this work opens a gate to new types of studies and hopefully helps to close the gap between theory and experiments in this fascinating, relatively new field of research. As an example, we demonstrate that the asymmetric reaction rates of $O+D_2\to [ODD]^{\#} \to OD+D$ and $H+ArCl \to [ArHCl]^{\#} \to H+Ar+Cl$ can be enhanced by a dark cavity. Contrary, the dark cavity effect on the symmetric reaction of hydrogen exchange in methane will be negligible.</description>

      <title>Mitigating scattering in a quantum system using only an integrating sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong quantum-correlated sources are essential but delicate resources for quantum information science and engineering protocols. Decoherence and loss are the two main disruptive processes that lead to the loss of nonclassical behavior in quantum correlations. In quantum systems, scattering can contribute to both decoherence and loss. In this work, we present an experimental scheme capable of significantly mitigating the adverse impact of scattering in quantum systems. Our quantum system is composed of a two-mode squeezed light generated with the four-wave mixing process in hot rubidium vapor, and a scatterer is introduced to one of the two modes. An integrating sphere is then placed after the scatterer to recollect the scattered photons. We use mutual information between the two modes as the measure of quantum correlations, and demonstrate a 47.5% mutual information recovery from scattering, despite an enormous photon loss of greater than 85%. Our scheme is a pioneering step towards recovering quantum correlations from disruptive random processes, thus has the potential to bridge the gap between proof-of-principle demonstrations and practical real-world deployments of quantum protocols.</description>

      <title>Robust double Bragg diffraction via detuning control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new theoretical model and numerical optimization of double Bragg diffraction (DBD), a widely used technique in atom interferometry. We derive an effective two-level-system Hamiltonian based on the Magnus expansion in the so-called "quasi-Bragg regime", where most Bragg-pulse atom interferometers operate. Furthermore, we extend the theory to a five-level description to account for Doppler detuning. Using these derived effective Hamiltonians, we investigate the impacts of AC-Stark shift and polarization errors on the double Bragg beam-splitter, along with their mitigations through detuning control. Notably, we design a linear detuning sweep that demonstrates robust efficiency exceeding 99.5% against polarization errors up to 8.5%. Moreover, we develop an artificial intelligence-aided optimal detuning control protocol, showcasing enhanced robustness against both polarization errors and Doppler effects. This protocol achieves an average efficiency of 99.92% for samples with a finite momentum width of 0.05$\hbar k_L$ within an extended polarization error range of up to 10%.</description>

      <title>The Born rule for quantum probabilities from Newton's third law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the Born rule, the probability density in quantum theory is determined by the square of the wave function. A generally accepted derivation of this rule has not yet been proposed. In the given work, a simple physical picture is constructed within which the Born rule arises in a natural way. In the proposed scheme, the interaction of a particle with a measuring apparatus is equivalent to creation of a "mirror image" of particle wave function in the space region of interaction. The observable quantity is the product of the particle wave function and its "image". The phase of the latter is reversed due to Newton's third law, thus leading to the Born rule.</description>

Abstract: The analysis conducted by Rymarz and DiVincenzo (Phys. Rev. X 13, 021017 (2023)) regarding quantization of superconducting circuits is insufficient to justify their general conclusions, most importantly the need to discard Kirchhoff's laws to effect variable reductions. Amongst a variety of reasons, one source of several disagreements with experimental and theoretical results is the long-standing dispute between extended vs compact variables in the presence of Josephson junctions.</description>

Abstract: We decompose arbitrary weight $Z\otimes \ldots \otimes Z$ exponentials into circuits of constant depth using $\mathcal{O}(n)$ ancillae and two-body XX and ZZ interactions. Consequenty, a similar method works for arbitrary Pauli exponentials. Our decomposition is compatible with linear nearest neighbour architectures. We prove its correctness after introducing novel circuit rewrite rules for circuits which benefit from qubit recycling. As a novelty, the decomposition is immediately applicable for implementing fault-tolerant lattice surgery computations, expressing arbitrary stabilizer circuits using only two-body interactions, as well as reducing the depth of NISQ computations, such as VQE.</description>

      <title>Memory-optimised Cubic Splines for High-fidelity Quantum Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio-frequency pulses are widespread for the control of quantum bits and the execution of operations in quantum computers. The ability to tune key pulse parameters such as time-dependent amplitude, phase, and frequency is essential to achieve maximal gate fidelity and mitigate errors. As systems scale, a larger fraction of the control electronic processing will move closer to the qubits, to enhance integration and minimise latency in operations requiring fast feedback. This will constrain the space available in the memory of the control electronics to load time-resolved pulse parameters at high sampling rates. Cubic spline interpolation is a powerful and widespread technique that divides the pulse into segments of cubic polynomials. We show an optimised implementation of this strategy, using a two-stage curve fitting process and additional symmetry operations to load a high-sampling pulse output on an FPGA. This results in a favourable accuracy versus memory footprint trade-off. By simulating single-qubit population transfer and atom transport on a neutral atom device, we show that we can achieve high fidelities with low memory requirements. This is instrumental for scaling up the number of qubits and gate operations in environments where memory is a limited resource.</description>

Abstract: We have developed a method to simulate quantum spin models with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) using Rydberg atom quantum simulators. Our approach involves a two-photon Raman transition and a transformation to the spin-rotating frame, both of which are feasible with current experimental techniques. As a model that can be simulated in our setup but not in solid-state systems, we consider an $S=1/2$ spin chain with a Hamiltonian consisting of the DMI and Zeeman energy. We study the magnetization curve in the ground state of this model and quench dynamics. Further, we show the existence of quantum many-body scar states and asymptotic quantum many-body scar states. The observed nonergodicity in this model demonstrates the importance of the highly tunable DMI that can be realized by the proposed quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Transduction Using Anti-Ferromagnetic Topological Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transduction of quantum information between distinct quantum systems is an essential step in various applications, including quantum communications and quantum computing. However, mediating photons of vastly different frequencies and designing high-performance transducers are highly nontrivial, due to multifaceted and sometimes conflicting requirements. In this work, we first discuss some general principles for quantum transducer design, and then propose solid-state anti-ferromagnetic topological insulators to serve as particularly effective transducers. First, the anti-ferromagnetic order can minimize detrimental influences on nearby quantum systems caused by magnetic interactions. Second, topological insulators exhibit band-inversion, which can greatly enhance their optical responses. This property, coupled with robust spin-orbit coupling and high spin density, results in strong nonlinear interaction in magnetic topological insulators, thereby substantially improving transduction efficiency. Using MnBi2Te4 as an example, we discuss the potential experimental realization of quantum transduction based on magnetic topological materials. Particularly, we showcase that quantum transduction efficiency exceeding 90% can be achieved with modest experimental requirements, while the transduction bandwidth can reach the GHz range. The strong nonlinear photonic interactions in magnetic topological insulators can find diverse applications besides quantum transduction, such as quantum squeezing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new avenue in which percolation, which has been much associated with critical phase transitions, can also dictate the asymptotic dynamics of non-Hermitian systems by breaking PT symmetry. Central to it is our newly-designed mechanism of topologically guided gain, where chiral edge wavepackets in a topological system experience non-Hermitian gain or loss based on how they are topologically steered. For sufficiently wide topological islands, this leads to irreversible growth due to positive feedback from interlayer tunneling. As such, a percolation transition that merges small topological islands into larger ones also drives the edge spectrum across a real to complex transition. Our discovery showcases intriguing dynamical consequences from the triple interplay of chiral topology, directed gain and interlayer tunneling, and suggests new routes for the topology to be harnessed in the control of feedback systems.</description>

Abstract: The recently proposed exact quantum solution for two $\delta$-function-interacting particles with a mass-ratio $3\!:\!1$ in a hard-wall box [Y. Liu, F. Qi, Y. Zhang and S. Chen, iScience 22, 181 (2019)] violates the conventional necessary condition for a Bethe Ansatz integrability, the condition being that the system must be reducible to a superposition of semi-transparent mirrors that is invariant under all the reflections it generates. In this article, we found a way to relax this condition: some of the semi-transparent mirrors of a known self-invariant mirror superposition can be replaced by the perfectly reflecting ones, thus breaking the self-invariance. The proposed name for the method is \emph{Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz} (Asymmetric BA). As a worked example, we study in detail the bound states of the nominally non-integrable system comprised of a bosonic dimer in a $\delta$-well. Finally, we show that the exact solution of the Liu-Qi-Zhang-Chen problem is a particular instance of the the Asymmetric BA.</description>

      <title>Hints of Entanglement Suppression in Hyperon-Nucleon Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperon ($Y=\Sigma,\Lambda$)-nucleon ($N=n,p$) interactions are crucial for understanding the existence of neutron stars heavier than two solar masses. Amid renewed experimental efforts, we study $YN$ scatterings from the perspective of quantum information, focusing on whether spin entanglement is suppressed in the s-wave channel, which is observed in $np$ scattering and leads to enhanced global symmetries. Using global fits of phase shifts from experimental data, we find hints of entanglement suppression among the eight flavor channels in the strangeness $S=-1$ sector, similar to the $np$ case. One exception is the $\Sigma^+p$ channel, where conflicting global fits lead to inconclusive outcome. We then propose ''quantum'' observables in $\Sigma^+p$ scattering to help resolve the differing global fits.</description>

      <title>Alternating Bias Assisted Annealing of Amorphous Oxide Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07415v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a transformational technique for controllably tuning the electrical properties of fabricated thermally oxidized amorphous aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions. Using conventional test equipment to apply an alternating bias to a heated tunnel barrier, giant increases in the room temperature resistance, greater than 70%, can be achieved. The rate of resistance change is shown to be strongly temperature-dependent, and is independent of junction size in the sub-micron regime. In order to measure their tunneling properties at mK temperatures, we characterized transmon qubit junctions treated with this alternating-bias assisted annealing (ABAA) technique. The measured frequencies follow the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation between the shifted resistance and critical current. Further, these studies show a reduction of junction-contributed loss on the order of $\approx 2 \times10^{-6}$, along with a significant reduction in resonant- and off-resonant-two level system defects when compared to untreated samples. Imaging with high-resolution TEM shows that the barrier is still predominantly amorphous with a more uniform distribution of aluminum coordination across the barrier relative to untreated junctions. This new approach is expected to be widely applicable to a broad range of devices that rely on amorphous aluminum oxide, as well as the many other metal-insulator-metal structures used in modern electronics.</description>

Abstract: Variational quantum calculations have borrowed many tools and algorithms from the machine learning community in the recent years. Leveraging great expressive power and efficient gradient-based optimization, researchers have shown that trial states inspired by deep learning problems can accurately model many-body correlated phenomena in spin, fermionic and qubit systems. In this review, we derive the central equations of different flavors variational Monte Carlo (VMC) approaches, including ground state search, time evolution and overlap optimization, and discuss data-driven tasks like quantum state tomography. An emphasis is put on the geometry of the variational manifold as well as bottlenecks in practical implementations. An overview of recent results of first-principles ground-state and real-time calculations is provided.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Signalling: Connections between Causal Inference and Space-time Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causality is pivotal to our understanding of the world, presenting itself in different forms: information-theoretic and relativistic, the former linked to the flow of information, the latter to the structure of space-time. Leveraging a framework introduced in PRA, 106, 032204 (2022), which formally connects these two notions in general physical theories, we study their interplay. Here, information-theoretic causality is defined through a causal modelling approach. First, we improve the characterization of information-theoretic signalling as defined through so-called affects relations. Specifically, we provide conditions for identifying redundancies in different parts of such a relation, introducing techniques for causal inference in unfaithful causal models (where the observable data does not "faithfully" reflect the causal dependences). In particular, this demonstrates the possibility of causal inference using the absence of signalling between certain nodes. Second, we define an order-theoretic property called conicality, showing that it is satisfied for light cones in Minkowski space-times with $d&gt;1$ spatial dimensions but violated for $d=1$. Finally, we study the embedding of information-theoretic causal models in space-time without violating relativistic principles such as no superluminal signalling (NSS). In general, we observe that constraints imposed by NSS in a space-time and those imposed by purely information-theoretic causal inference behave differently. We then prove a correspondence between conical space-times and faithful causal models: in both cases, there emerges a parallel between these two types of constraints. This indicates a connection between informational and geometric notions of causality, and offers new insights for studying the relations between the principles of NSS and no causal loops in different space-time geometries and theories of information processing.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group for Anderson localization on high-dimensional lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the dependence of the critical properties of the Anderson model on the dimension $d$ in the language of $\beta$-function and renormalization group recently introduced in Ref.[arXiv:2306.14965] in the context of Anderson transition on random regular graphs. We show how in the delocalized region, including the transition point, the one-parameter scaling part of the $\beta$-function for the fractal dimension $D_{1}$ evolves smoothly from its $d=2$ form, in which $\beta_2\leq 0$, to its $\beta_\infty\geq 0$ form, which is represented by the regular random graph (RRG) result. We show how the $\epsilon=d-2$ expansion and the $1/d$ expansion around the RRG result can be reconciled and how the initial part of a renormalization group trajectory governed by the irrelevant exponent $y$ depends on dimensionality. We also show how the irrelevant exponent emerges out of the high-gradient terms of expansion in the nonlinear sigma-model and put forward a conjecture about a lower bound for the fractal dimension. The framework introduced here may serve as a basis for investigations of disordered many-body systems and of more general non-equilibrium quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry and quantum Mpemba effect in two-dimensional free-fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect is the counter-intuitive non-equilibrium phenomenon wherein the dynamic restoration of a broken symmetry occurs more rapidly when the initial state exhibits a higher degree of symmetry breaking. The effect has been recently discovered theoretically and observed experimentally in the framework of global quantum quenches, but so far it has only been investigated in one-dimensional systems. Here we focus on a two-dimensional free-fermion lattice employing the entanglement asymmetry as a measure of symmetry breaking. Our investigation begins with the ground state analysis of a system featuring nearest-neighbor hoppings and superconducting pairings, the latter breaking explicitly the $U(1)$ particle number symmetry. We compute analytically the entanglement asymmetry of a periodic strip using dimensional reduction, an approach that allows us to adjust the extent of the transverse size, achieving a smooth crossover between one and two dimensions. Further applying the same method, we study the time evolution of the entanglement asymmetry after a quench to a Hamiltonian with only nearest-neighbor hoppings, preserving the particle number symmetry which is restored in the stationary state. We find that the quantum Mpemba effect is strongly affected by the size of the system in the transverse dimension, with the potential to either enhance or spoil the phenomenon depending on the initial states. We establish the conditions for its occurrence based on the properties of the initial configurations, extending the criteria found in the one-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Stability of quasicrystalline ultracold fermions to dipolar interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials can be used to interpolate between localization and delocalization in one dimension. With the rise of optical platforms engineering dipolar interactions, a key question is the stability of quasicrystalline phases under these long-range interactions. In this work, we study repulsive ultracold dipolar fermions in a quasiperiodic optical lattice to characterize the behavior of interacting quasicrystals. We simulate the full time evolution of the typical experimental protocols used to probe quasicrystalline order and localization properties. We extract experimentally measurable dynamical observables and correlation functions to characterize the three phases observed in the noninteracting setting: localized, intermediate, and extended. We then study the stability of such phases to repulsive dipolar interactions. We find that dipolar interactions can completely alter the shape of the phase diagram by stabilizing the intermediate phase, mostly at the expense of the extended phase. Moreover, in the strongly interacting regime, a resonance-like behavior characterized by density oscillations appears. Remarkably, strong dipolar repulsions can also localize particles even in the absence of quasiperiodicity if the primary lattice is sufficiently deep. Our work shows that dipolar interactions in a quasiperiodic potential can give rise to a complex, tuneable coexistence of localized and extended quantum states.</description>

      <title>Operator size growth in Lindbladian SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of operator size in the Lindbladian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with $q$-body interaction terms and linear jump terms at finite dissipation strength. We compute the operator size as well as its distribution numerically at finite $q$ and analytically at large $q$. With dissipative (productive) jump terms, the size converges to a value smaller (larger) than half the number of Majorana fermions. At weak dissipation, the evolution of operator size displays a quadratic-exponential-plateau behavior. The plateau value is determined by the ratios between the coupling of the interaction and the linear jump term in the large $q$ limit. The operator size distribution remains localized in the finite size region even at late times, contrasting with the unitary case. Moreover, we also derived the time-independent orthogonal basis for operator expansion which exhibits the operator size concentration at finite dissipation. Finally, we observe that the uncertainty relation for operator size growth is saturated at large $q$, leading to classical dynamics of the operator size growth with dissipation.</description>

Abstract: Fibonacci anyons provide the simplest possible model of non-Abelian fusion rules: [1] x [1] = [0] + [1]. We propose a conformal field theory construction of topological quantum registers based on Fibonacci anyons realized as quasiparticle excitations in the Z_3 parafermion fractional quantum Hall state. To this end, the results of Ardonne and Schoutens for the correlation function of n = 4 Fibonacci fields are extended to the case of arbitrary n (and 3 r electrons). Special attention is paid to the braiding properties of the obtained correlators. We explain in details the construction of a monodromy representation of the Artin braid group acting on n-point conformal blocks of Fibonacci anyons. For low n (up to n = 8), the matrices of braid group generators are displayed explicitly. A simple recursion formula makes it possible to extend without efforts the construction to any n. Finally, we construct N qubit computational spaces in terms of conformal blocks of 2N + 2 Fibonacci anyons.</description>

      <title>Microscale Fiber-Integrated Vector Magnetometer with On-Tip Field Biasing using NV Ensembles in Diamond Microcystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum sensing of magnetic fields, ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond offer high sensitivity, high bandwidth and outstanding spatial resolution while operating in harsh environments. Moreover, the orientation of defect centers along four crystal axes forms an intrinsic coordinate system, enabling vector magnetometry within a single diamond crystal. While most vector magnetometers rely on a known bias magnetic field for full recovery of three-dimensional field information, employing external 3D Helmholtz coils or permanent magnets results in bulky, laboratory-bound setups, impeding miniaturization of the device. Here, a novel approach is presented that utilizes a fiber-integrated microscale coil at the fiber tip to generate a localized uniaxial magnetic field. The same fiber-tip coil is used in parallel for spin control by combining DC and microwave signals in a bias tee. To implement vector magnetometry using a uniaxial bias field, we preselect the orientation of the diamond crystal and then fully characterize it by rotating a static magnetic field in three planes of rotation. We demonstrate the measurement of vector magnetic fields in the full solid angle with a shot-noise limited sensitivity of $19.4\:\textrm{nT/Hz}^{1/2}$ and microscale spatial resolution while achieving a cross section of the fiber sensor head below $1\:\textrm{mm}^2.$</description>

      <title>Dynamics of spin helices in the diluted one-dimensional $XX$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by discrepancies between recent cold atom experiments and the associated theory, we explore the effect of immobile holes on the quantum dynamics of $x$-$z$ spin helices in the one-dimensional $XX$ model. We calculate the exact spin dynamics by mapping onto a system of non-interacting fermions, averaging over the distribution of holes. At small hole densities we find that the helical spin pattern decays exponentially, with a pitch dependence that agrees with the experiments. At large hole densities we instead find persistent oscillations. While our analytic approach does not generalize to the $XXZ$ model with arbitrary anisotropies, we validate a matrix product state technique which might be used to model the experiments in those settings.</description>

      <title>Universality of the thermodynamics of a quantum-mechanically radiating black hole departing from thermality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathur and Mehta won the third prize in the 2023 Gravity Research Foundation Essay Competition for proving the universality of black hole (BH) thermodynamics. Specifically, they demonstrated that any Extremely Compact Object (ECO) must have the same BH thermodynamic properties regardless of whether or not the ECO possesses an event horizon. The result is remarkable, but it was obtained under the approximation according to which the BH emission spectrum has an exactly thermal character. In fact, strong arguments based on energy conservation and BH back reaction imply that the spectrum of the Hawking radiation cannot be exactly thermal. In this work the result of Mathur and Mehta will be extended to the case where the radiation spectrum is not exactly thermal using the concept of BH dynamical state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A parametrically modulated oscillator has two opposite-phase vibrational states at half the modulation frequency. An extra force at the vibration frequency breaks the symmetry of the states. The effect can be extremely strong due to the interplay between the force and the quantum fluctuations resulting from the coupling of the oscillator to a thermal bath. The force changes the rates of the fluctuation-induced walk over the quantum states of the oscillator. If the number of the states is large, the effect accumulates to an exponentially large factor in the rate of switching between the vibrational states. We find the factor and analyze it in the limiting cases including the prebifurcation regime where the system is close but not too close to the bifurcation point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the particle creation of a harmonic oscillator using the classical stochastic method. This recently constructed method reproduces all the vacuum expectation values in quantum theory. We prepare the vacuum state at the initial time and evolve it over time using Langevin equations of motion. By averaging over the ensemble, we compute the energy of the state at the final time and determine the amount of particles created. We verify that the particle creation agrees with predictions from quantum theory and thus give an evidence that this method can really compute the quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Violating Bell's inequality in gate-defined quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superior computational power promised by quantum computers utilises the fundamental quantum mechanical principle of entanglement. However, achieving entanglement and verifying that the generated state does not follow the principle of local causality has proven difficult for spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots, as it requires simultaneously high concurrence values and readout fidelities to break the classical bound imposed by Bell's inequality. Here we employ heralded initialization and calibration via gate set tomography (GST), to reduce all relevant errors and push the fidelities of the full 2-qubit gate set above 99 %, including state preparation and measurement (SPAM). We demonstrate a 97.17 % Bell state fidelity without correcting for readout errors and violate Bell's inequality with a Bell signal of S = 2.731 close to the theoretical maximum of $2\sqrt{2}$. Our measurements exceed the classical limit even at elevated temperatures of 1.1 K or entanglement lifetimes of 100 $\mu s$.</description>

      <title>Coupler enabled tunable dipole-dipole coupling between optically levitated nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple optically levitated particles in vacuum can exhibit electrostatic interactions, optical binding, and non-reciprocal light-induced dipole-dipole interactions, making them promising platforms for exploring mesoscopic entanglement and complex interactions. However, in optical trap arrays, individually controlling the position and polarization of each trap is challenging, limiting the precise tuning of interactions between adjacent particles. This constraint hinders the study of complex interaction systems. In this work, we introduce a third nanoparticle as a coupler to two initially non-interacting nanoparticles, achieving tunable dipole-dipole coupling mediated by the third one. We investigated the effect of the particles' phases and positions on the interaction strength and demonstrated its broad tunability. Our method allows for precise control of interactions between any pair of adjacent particles in multi-particle systems, facilitating the further use of levitated nanoparticle arrays in macroscopic quantum mechanics and sensing.</description>
