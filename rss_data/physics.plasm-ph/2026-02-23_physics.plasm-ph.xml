      <title>Nonlinear Saturation of Ballooning Modes in Stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ballooning mode saturation is investigated in realistic stellarator configurations using the flux tube approach of Ham et. al. [1] [2]. The method is adapted to account for the lack of exact force balance in stellarator equilibrium solvers that assume existence of nested flux surfaces. A variational approach for calculating flux tube energy is developed to overcome this force error problem in stellarator numerical equilibria. Saturated (equilibrium) flux tube states that cross 10-20% of the plasma minor radius are shown to exist for linearly ballooning unstable profiles. It is shown that several features of the displaced flux tube structure in a full nonlinear MHD simulation of Wendelstein 7X are reproduced by our model. Saturated states are found in a compact stellarator equilibrium close but below the marginal ballooning linear instability, i.e. the unperturbed equilibrium is metastable. This suggests that Edge-Localized-Mode-like explosive MHD behavior may be possible in stellarators.</description>

      <title>Spectral Homogenization of the Radiative Transfer Equation via Low-Rank Tensor Train Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative transfer in absorbing-scattering media requires solving a transport equation across a spectral domain with 10^5 - 10^6 molecular absorption lines. Line-by-line (LBL) computation is prohibitively expensive, while existing approximations sacrifice spectral fidelity. We show that the Young-measure homogenization framework produces solution tensors I that admit low-rank tensor-train (TT) decompositions whose bond dimensions remain bounded as the spectral resolution Ns increases. Using molecular line parameters from the HITRAN database for H2O and CO2, we demonstrate that: (i) the TT rank saturates at r = 8 (at tolerance e = 10^-6) from Ns = 16 to 4096, independent of single-scattering albedo, Henyey-Greenstein asymmetry, temperature, and pressure; (ii) quantized tensor-train (QTT) representations achieve sub-linear storage scaling; (iii) in a controlled comparison using identical opacity data and transport solver, the homogenized approach achieves over an order of magnitude lower L2 error than the correlated-k distribution at equal cost; and (iv) for atomic plasma opacity (aluminum at 60 eV, TOPS database), the TT rank saturates at r = 15 with fundamentally different spectral structure (bound-bound and bound-free transitions spanning 12 decades of dynamic range), confirming that rank boundedness is a property of the transport equation rather than any particular opacity source. These results establish that the spectral complexity of radiative transfer has a finite effective rank exploitable by tensor decomposition, complementing the spatial-angular compression achieved by existing TT and dynamical low-rank approaches.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Dynamics of Electron Radiation Reaction via Structure-Preserving Geometric Algorithms for Coupled Schr\"odinger-Maxwell Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17429</link>

Abstract: Classically, a charged particle in a magnetic field emits radiation, losing momentum and experiencing the Abraham-Lorentz (AL) / Landau-Lifshitz (LL) radiation reaction (RR) force. However, at atomic scales and outside the range of their applicability, the AL/LL equations fail and RR destroys the coherent state of an electron-undermining the very concept of a RR force. This process can be described by the coupled Schr\"odinger-Maxwell (SM) system under appropriate limits, but the system's nonlinear complexity has long limited purely analytical studies. We present geometric structure-preserving algorithms for the SM system that preserve gauge invariance, symplecticity, and unitarity on the discrete space-time lattice, which are implemented in our Structure-Preserving scHrodINger maXwell (SPHINX) code. By constructing coherent states from the Landau levels, SPHINX simulates the fully-coupled nonlinear dynamics of an electron coherent state, the energy partition evolution, and decoherence/relaxation of the electron wave packet in time due to RR. These simulations indicate that, in an external magnetic field, an electron prepared in an atomic-scale coherent state can radiate strongly, rapidly losing coherence and dispersing into a decoherent wave packet. Additionally, we also present the fully-coupled nonlinear evolution of the non-degenerate ground- and first-excited Landau levels themselves to understand how the coupled SM system modifies the well-known ideal (i.e., Schr\"odinger-only) dynamics of the Landau Levels. With appropriate boundary conditions, simulations show that the Landau levels are renormalized into stationary dressed eigenstates with constant electromagnetic and kinetic energies. This opens a new computational window into RR physics and advances modeling of extreme-field phenomena in fusion plasmas, astrophysics, and next-generation laser experiments</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Effects of Parameters in Widespread SEP Events with EPREM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16401</link>

Abstract: The Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Model (EPREM) solves the focused transport equation (FTE) on a Lagrangian grid in a frame co-moving with the solar wind plasma and simulates the acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles (SEP) in the heliosphere. When not coupled to an external magnetohydrodynamic model, EPREM functions in an uncoupled mode where an ideal cone-shock is injected into a homogeneous background solar wind. We carried out an analysis of the effects of multiple physical parameters in producing widespread SEP events simulated by the uncoupled EPREM using a relatively simple model of a strong magnetized shock propagating radially outward through the inner heliosphere to produce the requisite MHD quantities for EPREM's sophisticated model of proton acceleration and transport. We compared a baseline simulation with seven variations in which the value of a single parameter differed from its baseline value. All simulations exhibit complex profiles of SEP flux as a function of time and energy, with clear dependence on parameters related to diffusion, mean free path, and shock profile. Moreover, while all simulations exhibit significant longitudinal spread in SEP flux, for certain parameter values there exists a decrease or absence in SEP flux at observers located $\geq 90^\circ$ from the shock origin. Relating the differences in SEP flux to the specific values of each parameter in the simulations provides insight into the morphology of observed SEP events and the state of the solar wind through which the driving CME propagates.</description>

      <title>Melting Coulomb clusters through nonreciprocity-enhanced parametric pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems out of equilibrium often experience intermittent oscillations between quiescent and highly dynamic states. The type of intermittency depends on how energy is pumped into the system, and how it is dissipated. While intermittency is usually driven by stochastic noise or external forcing, energy can also be sourced from field-mediated interactions between particles, which are often nonreciprocal and effectively violate Newton's 3rd law. Here we demonstrate how nonreciprocal interactions produce intermittency in clusters of charged micron-sized particles confined in a plasma sheath. Through three-dimensional particle tracking, we observe that vertical oscillations, induced by fluctuations of the plasma environment, can be parametrically coupled to the horizontal modes. Experiments and simulations show that nonreciprocal interactions strongly amplify this parametric coupling, creating a positive feedback loop that drives explosive growth of both the horizontal and vertical modes. This mechanism triggers abrupt melting transitions from an ordered cluster to an ergodic gas-like state, and leads to intermittent switching between states over long time scales. Overall, our work identifies nonreciprocal interactions as a key mechanism through which strongly coupled finite systems transform interaction-mediated activity into dynamical nonequilibrium states.</description>
