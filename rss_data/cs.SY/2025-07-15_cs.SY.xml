      <title>Counterfactual optimization for fault prevention in complex wind energy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning models are increasingly used in businesses to detect faults and anomalies in complex systems. In this work, we take this approach a step further: beyond merely detecting anomalies, we aim to identify the optimal control strategy that restores the system to a safe state with minimal disruption. We frame this challenge as a counterfactual problem: given a Machine Learning model that classifies system states as either good or anomalous, our goal is to determine the minimal adjustment to the system's control variables (i.e., its current status) that is necessary to return it to the good state. To achieve this, we leverage a mathematical model that finds the optimal counterfactual solution while respecting system specific constraints. Notably, most counterfactual analysis in the literature focuses on individual cases where a person seeks to alter their status relative to a decision made by a classifier, such as for loan approval or medical diagnosis. Our work addresses a fundamentally different challenge: optimizing counterfactuals for a complex energy system, specifically an offshore wind turbine oil type transformer. This application not only advances counterfactual optimization in a new domain but also opens avenues for broader research in this area. Our tests on real world data provided by our industrial partner show that our methodology easily adapts to user preferences and brings savings in the order of 3 million euros per year in a typical farm.</description>

      <title>Efficient Discovery of Actual Causality with Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the actual cause of events in engineered systems is a fundamental challenge in system analysis. Finding such causes becomes more challenging in the presence of noise and uncertainty in real-world systems. In this paper, we adopt the notion of probabilistic actual causality by Fenton-Glynn, which is a probabilistic extension of Halpern and Pearl's actual causality, and propose a novel method to formally reason about causal effect of events in systems subject to uncertainty. We (1) formulate the discovery of probabilistic actual causes in computing systems as an SMT problem, and (2) address the scalability challenges by introducing an abstraction-refinement technique that significantly improves efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through three case studies, identifying probabilistic causes of safety violations in (1) the Mountain Car problem, (2) the Lunar Lander benchmark, and (3) MPC controller for an F-16 autopilot simulator.</description>

      <title>Modelling and Control of a Buck Converter Using State-Space Averaging and Classical Feedback Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the modeling, control design, and performance analysis of a DC-DC buck converter using state-space averaging techniques. Buck converters are essential in modern power electronics for regulating DC voltages in renewable energy and electric vehicle systems. The paper first introduces the basic operation of buck converters and emphasizes the need for voltage regulation through closed-loop control systems. A state-space averaged model is derived to simplify the nonlinear switched dynamics, enabling a more effective analysis and controller design. The small-signal transfer function from the duty cycle to the output voltage is obtained to support control development. In addition, the Proportional-Integral (PI) control based on the frequency-domain method was explored. The PI controller was tuned to achieve various phase margins and is evaluated through Bode plots, step responses, and performance metrics, revealing trade-offs between overshoot, settling time, and steady-state error. A complete simulation of the controlled buck converter verifies its ability to maintain a stable output voltage across wide input voltage variations. The results validate the effectiveness of state-space averaging in control design and highlight the robustness of feedback systems in power electronic converters.</description>

      <title>Integrating Planning and Predictive Control Using the Path Feasibility Governor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion planning problem of generating dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories in non-convex environments is a fundamental challenge for autonomous systems. Decomposing the problem into path planning and path tracking improves tractability, but integrating these components in a theoretically sound and computationally efficient manner is challenging. We propose the Path Feasibility Governor (PathFG), a framework for integrating path planners with nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC). The PathFG manipulates the reference passed to the MPC controller, guiding it along a path while ensuring constraint satisfaction, stability, and recursive feasibility. The PathFG is modular, compatible with replanning, and improves computational efficiency and reliability by reducing the need for long prediction horizons. We prove safety and asymptotic stability with a significantly expanded region of attraction, and validate its real-time performance through a simulated case study of quadrotor navigation in a cluttered environment.</description>

      <title>Vertex-Guided Redundant Constraints Identification for Unit Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power systems Unit Commitment (UC) problem determines the generator commitment schedule and dispatch decisions to realize the reliable and economic operation of power networks. The growing penetration of stochastic renewables and demand behaviors makes it necessary to solve the UC problem timely. It is possible to derive lightweight, faster-to-solve UC models via constraint screening to eliminate redundant constraints. However, the screening process remains computationally cumbersome due to the need of solving numerous linear programming (LP) problems. To reduce the number of LPs to solve, we introduce a novel perspective on such classic LP-based screening. Our key insights lie in the principle that redundant constraints will be satisfied by all vertices of the screened feasible region. Using the UC decision variables' bounds tightened by solving much fewer LPs, we build an outer approximation for the UC feasible region as the screened region. A matrix operation is then designed and applied to the outer approximation's vertices to identify all redundant constraints on-the-fly. Adjustments for the outer approximation are further explored to improve screening efficiency by considering the load operating range and cutting planes derived from UC cost and discrete unit status prediction. Extensive simulations are performed on a set of testbeds up to 2,383 buses to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. Compared to classic LP-based screening, our schemes can achieve up to 8.8x acceleration while finding the same redundant constraints.</description>

      <title>A Fairness-Oriented Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning approach for Autonomous Intersection Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) approach for autonomous intersection management, aiming to balance traffic efficiency and environmental sustainability across electric and internal combustion vehicles. The proposed method utilizes MORL to identify Pareto-optimal policies, with a post-hoc fairness criterion guiding the selection of the final policy. Simulation results in a complex intersection scenario demonstrate the approach's effectiveness in optimizing traffic efficiency and emissions reduction while ensuring fairness across vehicle categories. We believe that this criterion can lay the foundation for ensuring equitable service, while fostering safe, efficient, and sustainable practices in smart urban mobility.</description>

      <title>Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Optimization for Solving Unit Commitment Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a neural stochastic optimization method for efficiently solving the two-stage stochastic unit commitment (2S-SUC) problem under high-dimensional uncertainty scenarios. The proposed method approximates the second-stage recourse problem using a deep neural network trained to map commitment decisions and uncertainty features to recourse costs. The trained network is subsequently embedded into the first-stage UC problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), allowing for explicit enforcement of operational constraints while preserving the key uncertainty characteristics. A scenario-embedding network is employed to enable dimensionality reduction and feature aggregation across arbitrary scenario sets, serving as a data-driven scenario reduction mechanism. Numerical experiments on IEEE 5-bus, 30-bus, and 118-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed neural two-stage stochastic optimization method achieves solutions with an optimality gap of less than 1%, while enabling orders-of-magnitude speedup compared to conventional MILP solvers and decomposition-based methods. Moreover, the model's size remains constant regardless of the number of scenarios, offering significant scalability for large-scale stochastic unit commitment problems.</description>

      <title>Learning Koopman Models From Data Under General Noise Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel identification approach of Koopman models of nonlinear systems with inputs under rather general noise conditions. The method uses deep state-space encoders based on the concept of state reconstructability and an efficient multiple-shooting formulation of the squared loss of the prediction error to estimate the dynamics and the lifted state from input-output data. Furthermore, the Koopman model structure includes an innovation noise term that is used to handle process and measurement noise. It is shown that the proposed approach is statistically consistent and computationally efficient due to the multiple-shooting formulation where, on subsections of the data, multi-step prediction errors can be calculated in parallel. The latter allows for efficient batch optimization of the network parameters and, at the same time, excellent long-term prediction capabilities of the obtained models. The performance of the approach is illustrated by nonlinear benchmark examples.</description>

      <title>Symptom-Driven Personalized Proton Pump Inhibitors Therapy Using Bayesian Neural Networks and Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) are the standard of care for gastric acid disorders but carry significant risks when administered chronically at high doses. Precise long-term control of gastric acidity is challenged by the impracticality of invasive gastric acid monitoring beyond 72 hours and wide inter-patient variability. We propose a noninvasive, symptom-based framework that tailors PPI dosing solely on patient-reported reflux and digestive symptom patterns. A Bayesian Neural Network prediction model learns to predict patient symptoms and quantifies its uncertainty from historical symptom scores, meal, and PPIs intake data. These probabilistic forecasts feed a chance-constrained Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that dynamically computes future PPI doses to minimize drug usage while enforcing acid suppression with high confidence - without any direct acid measurement. In silico studies over diverse dietary schedules and virtual patient profiles demonstrate that our learning-augmented MPC reduces total PPI consumption by 65 percent compared to standard fixed regimens, while maintaining acid suppression with at least 95 percent probability. The proposed approach offers a practical path to personalized PPI therapy, minimizing treatment burden and overdose risk without invasive sensors.</description>

      <title>Electric Vehicle Public Charging Equity Considerations: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is crucial for accelerating EV adoption and reducing transportation emissions; however, disparities in infrastructure access have raised significant equity concerns. This systematic review synthesizes existing knowledge and identifies gaps regarding equity in EV public charging research. Following structured review protocols, 91 peer-reviewed studies from Scopus and Google Scholar were analyzed, focusing explicitly on equity considerations. The findings indicate that current research on EV public charging equity mainly adopted geographic information systems (GIS), network optimization, behavioral modeling, and hybrid analytical frameworks, yet lacks consistent normative frameworks for assessing equity outcomes. Equity assessments highlight four key dimensions: spatial accessibility, cost burdens, reliability and usability, and user awareness and trust. Socio-economic disparities, particularly income, housing tenure, and ethnicity, frequently exacerbate inequitable access, disproportionately disadvantaging low-income, renter, and minority populations. Additionally, infrastructure-specific choices, including charger reliability, strategic location, and pricing strategies, significantly influence adoption patterns and equity outcomes. However, existing literature primarily reflects North American, European, and Chinese contexts, revealing substantial geographical and methodological limitations. This review suggests the need for more robust normative evaluations of equity, comprehensive demographic data integration, and advanced methodological frameworks, thereby guiding targeted, inclusive, and context-sensitive infrastructure planning and policy interventions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Power Management of Battery Energy Storage Systems via Ensemble Kalman Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal power management of battery energy storage systems (BESS) is crucial for their safe and efficient operation. Numerical optimization techniques are frequently utilized to solve the optimal power management problems. However, these techniques often fall short of delivering real-time solutions for large-scale BESS due to their computational complexity. To address this issue, this paper proposes a computationally efficient approach. We introduce a new set of decision variables called power-sharing ratios corresponding to each cell, indicating their allocated power share from the output power demand. We then formulate an optimal power management problem to minimize the system-wide power losses while ensuring compliance with safety, balancing, and power supply-demand match constraints. To efficiently solve this problem, a parameterized control policy is designed and leveraged to transform the optimal power management problem into a parameter estimation problem. We then implement the ensemble Kalman inversion to estimate the optimal parameter set. The proposed approach significantly reduces computational requirements due to 1) the much lower dimensionality of the decision parameters and 2) the estimation treatment of the optimal power management problem. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show promise in accuracy and computation time compared with explored numerical optimization techniques.</description>

      <title>Joint Scheduling of Deferrable and Nondeferrable Demand with Colocated Stochastic Supply</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of optimal joint scheduling of deferrable and nondeferrable demand involving colocated stochastic supply. Deferrable demand can be delayed within its service deadline, whereas nondeferrable demand must be scheduled immediately. Under a finite-horizon stochastic dynamic programming formulation, we show that the optimal scheduling policy is a ``procrastination policy'' that delays scheduling as much as possible and is characterized by three procrastination parameters. Exploiting the low-dimensional parameterization of the optimal policy, we propose a Procrastination Threshold Reinforcement Learning algorithm. Numerical experiments based on real-world test data confirm that the threshold-learning algorithm closely approximates the optimal policy and outperforms standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Intersection of Reinforcement Learning and Bayesian Optimization for Intelligent Control of Industrial Processes: A Safe MPC-based DPG using Multi-Objective BO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a structured and interpretable alternative to Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based RL methods, with lower computational complexity and greater transparency. However, standard MPC-RL approaches often suffer from slow convergence, suboptimal policy learning due to limited parameterization, and safety issues during online adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates MPC-RL with Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO). The proposed MPC-RL-MOBO utilizes noisy evaluations of the RL stage cost and its gradient, estimated via a Compatible Deterministic Policy Gradient (CDPG) approach, and incorporates them into a MOBO algorithm using the Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) acquisition function. This fusion enables efficient and safe tuning of the MPC parameters to achieve improved closed-loop performance, even under model imperfections. A numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving sample-efficient, stable, and high-performance learning for control systems.</description>

      <title>A Case Study on Data Acquisition Systems: Relevance to Renewable Energy Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple advantages had been identified with the integration of data acquisition into any existing system configuration and implementation. Using data acquisition as a support into a monitoring system has not only improved its overall performance and reliability but also lowered its operational and maintenance cost because of its real-time data collection from node sensors.
  As renewable energy needs to be sustainable for it to fully support the energy demand of communities, its management and control still needs to be improved and enhanced. Smart systems are considered the next generation technological improvement of any system that exists. It is the prelude to autonomous systems from industrial applications to home automation. Data acquisition is only a part of these smart systems that help in the remote management and control of these devices. Remote monitoring functionality enhances the operation and reliability which help in making proactive decisions during critical situations and circumstances.
  Even with data acquisition enhancements, there is still room for improving its implementation regarding data security and privacy and accuracy of information being exchanged between nodes. Current technological advancements have already shown promising results and have widen its utilization spectrum by covering almost any field of specialization. With increasing implementation and design complexity that comes with its enhancements, challenges and issues are also faced that needs to be addressed and considered to mitigate the effects of such.</description>

      <title>Efficient RF Chain Selection for MIMO Integrated Sensing and Communications: A Greedy Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multiple-input multiple-output integrated sensing and communication (MIMO ISAC) systems, radio frequency chain (i.e., RF chain) selection plays a vital role in reducing hardware cost, power consumption, and computational complexity. However, designing an effective RF chain selection strategy is challenging due to the disparity in performance metrics between communication and sensing-mutual information (MI) versus beam-pattern mean-squared error (MSE) or the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB). To overcome this, we propose a low-complexity greedy RF chain selection framework maximizing a unified MI-based performance metric applicable to both functions. By decomposing the total MI into individual contributions of each RF chain, we introduce two approaches: greedy eigen-based selection (GES) and greedy cofactor-based selection (GCS), which iteratively identify and remove the RF chains with the lowest contribution. We further extend our framework to beam selection for beamspace MIMO ISAC systems, introducing diagonal beam selection (DBS) as a simplified solution. Simulation results show that our proposed methods achieve near-optimal performance with significantly lower complexity than exhaustive search, demonstrating their practical effectiveness for MIMO ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Predictive &amp; Trust-based Multi-Agent Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a trust-based predictive multi-agent consensus protocol that analyses neighbours' anticipation data and makes coordination decisions. Agents in the network share their future predicted data over a finite look-ahead horizon with their neighbours and update their predictions in a rolling-horizon fashion. The prediction data is then used by agents to learn both the trust and the commitment traits exhibited by their neighbours over time. The proposed protocol is named as the Anticipatory Distributed Coordination (ADC) protocol. Lyapunov theory-based agreement convergence between agents is provided, followed by demonstrations using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Hardware test and validation of the angular droop control: Analysis and experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The angular droop control is a grid-forming control strategy that exploits the idea of power-to-angle droop to achieve exact frequency synchronization with no stringent separation between primary and secondary frequency control. In this work, we conduct hardware experiments in the Smart Energy System Control Laboratory at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) to test and validate the angular droop control for low voltage power grids in two different test scenarios. First, we verify its grid-forming capabilities after a major event, e.g., following a blackout, demonstrated via power-to-angle droop behavior. For this, we propose two implementation schemes that rely either on direct or indirect actuation of the modulation signal and draw a comparison between them. Second, we investigate the plug-and-play capabilities, i.e., local stability and power sharing for a two-converter system and provide suitable tuning for the control gains. Our experimental findings illustrate the usefulness of hardware test and validation for DC/AC converter control, the practical challenges entailed and the proposed remedies.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Robustness in the Gap Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainties influencing the dynamical systems pose a significant challenge in estimating the achievable performance of a controller aiming to control such uncertain systems. When the uncertainties are of stochastic nature, obtaining hard guarantees for the robustness of a controller aiming to hedge against the uncertainty is not possible. This issue set the platform for the development of probabilistic robust control approaches. In this work, we utilise the gap metric between the known nominal model and the unknown perturbed model of the uncertain system as a tool to gauge the robustness of a controller and formulate the gap as a random variable in the setting with stochastic uncertainties. Main results of this paper includes giving probabilistic bound on the gap exceeding a known threshold followed by bounds on the expected gap value and probabilistic robust stability in terms of the gap metric. Further, we also provide a probabilistic controller performance certification under gap uncertainty and probabilistic guarantee on the achievable $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ robustness. Numerical simulations are provided at many places to demonstrate the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Survey on Methods for Detection, Classification and Location of Faults in Power Systems Using Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Components of electrical power systems are susceptible to failures caused by lightning strikes, aging or human errors. These faults can cause equipment damage, affect system reliability, and results in expensive repair costs. As electric power systems are becoming more complex, traditional protection methods face limitations and shortcomings. Faults in power systems can occur at anytime and anywhere, can be caused by a natural disaster or an accident, and their occurrence can be hardly predicted or avoided; therefore, it is crucial to accurately estimate the fault location and quickly restore service. The development of methods capable of accurately detecting, locating and removing faults is essential (i.e. fast isolation of faults is necessary to maintain the system stability at transmission levels; accurate and fast detection and location of faults are essential for increasing reliability and customer satisfaction at distribution levels). This has motivated the development of new and more efficient methods. Methods developed to detect and locate faults in power systems can be divided into two categories, conventional and artificial intelligence-based techniques. Although the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques offer tremendous potential, they are challenging and time consuming (i.e. many AI techniques require training data for processing). This paper presents a survey of the application of AI techniques to fault diagnosis (detection, classification and location of faults) of lines and cables of power systems at both transmission and distribution levels. The paper provides a short introduction to AI concepts, a brief summary of the application of AI techniques to power system analysis and design, and a discussion on AI-based fault diagnosis methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Battery Placement in Power Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimal placement of an unlimited-capacity battery in power grids under a centralized market model, where the independent system operator (ISO) aims to minimize total generation costs through load shifting. The optimal battery placement is not well understood by the existing literature, especially regarding the influence of network topology on minimizing generation costs. Our work starts with decomposing the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem into a series of Linear Programming (LP) formulations. For power grids with sufficiently large generation capacity or tree topologies, we derive analytical cost expressions demonstrating that, under reasonable assumptions, the weighted degree is the only topological factor for optimal battery placement. We also discuss the minor impact of higher-order topological conditions on tree-topology networks. To find the localized nature of a single battery's impact, we establish that the relative cost-saving benefit of a single battery decreases as the network scales. Furthermore, we design a low-complexity algorithm for weakly-cyclic networks. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm is not only approximately 100 times faster than commercial solvers but also maintains high accuracy even when some theoretical assumptions are relaxed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how a recently published 2d model for traffic flow can be further improved. Besides other improvements and simplifications, we present not only a method to compute the necessary time step restrictions, but also a subcycling for the inflow and outflow. This drastically reduces computational cost on large domains with coarse grids, i.\,e.\ for simulations of a whole region instead of a small part of a city or town.</description>

      <title>A SUMO-Based Digital Twin for Evaluation of Conventional and Electric Vehicle Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twins are increasingly applied in transportation modelling to replicate real-world traffic dynamics and evaluate mobility and energy efficiency. This study presents a SUMO-based digital twin that simulates mixed ICEV-EV traffic on a major motorway segment, leveraging multi-sensor data fusion from inductive loops, GPS probes, and toll records. The model is validated under both complete and partial information scenarios, achieving 93.1% accuracy in average speed estimation and 97.1% in average trip length estimation. Statistical metrics, including KL Divergence and Wasserstein Distance, demonstrate strong alignment between simulated and observed traffic patterns. Furthermore, CO2 emissions were overestimated by only 0.8-2.4%, and EV power consumption underestimated by 1.0-5.4%, highlighting the model's robustness even with incomplete vehicle classification information.</description>

      <title>Improved Sum-of-Squares Stability Verification of Neural-Network-Based Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents several improvements to the closed-loop stability verification framework using semialgebraic sets and convex semidefinite programming to examine neural-network-based control systems regulating nonlinear dynamical systems. First, the utility of the framework is greatly expanded: two semialgebraic functions mimicking common, smooth activation functions are presented and compatibility with control systems incorporating Recurrent Equilibrium Networks (RENs) and thereby Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is established. Second, the validity of the framework's state-of-the-art stability analyses is established via an alternate proof. Third, based on this proof, two new optimization problems simplifying the analysis of local stability properties are presented. To simplify the analysis of a closed-loop system's Region of Attraction (RoA), the first problem explicitly parameterizes a class of candidate Lyapunov functions larger than in previous works. The second problem utilizes the unique guarantees available under the condition of invariance to further expand the set of candidate Lyapunov functions and directly determine whether an invariant set forms part of the system's RoA. These contributions are successfully demonstrated in two numerical examples and suggestions for future research are provided.</description>

      <title>MQFQ-Sticky: Fair Queueing For Serverless GPU Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hardware accelerators like GPUs are now ubiquitous in data centers, but are not fully supported by common cloud abstractions such as Functions as a Service (FaaS). Many popular and emerging FaaS applications such as machine learning and scientific computing can benefit from GPU acceleration. However, FaaS frameworks (such as OpenWhisk) are not capable of providing this acceleration because of the impedance mismatch between GPUs and the FaaS programming model, which requires virtualization and sandboxing of each function. The challenges are amplified due to the highly dynamic and heterogeneous FaaS workloads. This paper presents the design and implementation of a FaaS system for providing GPU acceleration in a black-box manner (without modifying function code). Running small functions in containerized sandboxes is challenging due to limited GPU concurrency and high cold-start overheads, resulting in heavy queueing of function invocations. We show how principles from I/O scheduling, such as fair queuing and anticipatory scheduling, can be translated to function scheduling on GPUs. We develop MQFQ-Sticky, an integrated fair queueing and GPU memory management approach, which balances the tradeoffs between locality, fairness, and latency. Empirical evaluation on a range of workloads shows that it reduces function latency by 2x to 20x compared to existing GPU and CPU queueing policies.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptation-Enabled Realistic Map-Based Channel Estimation for MIMO-OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is crucial for the improvement of signal processing performance in wireless communications. However, traditional model-based methods frequently experience difficulties in dynamic environments. Similarly, alternative machine-learning approaches typically lack generalization across different datasets due to variations in channel characteristics. To address this issue, in this study, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach to bridge the gap between the quasi-static channel model (QSCM) and the map-based channel model (MBCM). Specifically, we first proposed a channel estimation pipeline that takes into account realistic channel simulation to train our foundation model. Then, we proposed domain adaptation methods to address the estimation problem. Using simulation-based training to reduce data requirements for effective application in practical wireless environments, we find that the proposed strategy enables robust model performance, even with limited true channel information.</description>

      <title>On the Gradient Domination of the LQG Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider solutions to the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) regulator problem via policy gradient (PG) methods. Although PG methods have demonstrated strong theoretical guarantees in solving the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem, despite its nonconvex landscape, their theoretical understanding in the LQG setting remains limited. Notably, the LQG problem lacks gradient dominance in the classical parameterization, i.e., with a dynamic controller, which hinders global convergence guarantees. In this work, we study PG for the LQG problem by adopting an alternative parameterization of the set of stabilizing controllers and employing a lifting argument. We refer to this parameterization as a history representation of the control input as it is parameterized by past input and output data from the previous p time-steps. This representation enables us to establish gradient dominance and approximate smoothness for the LQG cost. We prove global convergence and per-iteration stability guarantees for policy gradient LQG in model-based and model-free settings. Numerical experiments on an open-loop unstable system are provided to support the global convergence guarantees and to illustrate convergence under different history lengths of the history representation.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Exploration: Learning to Explore via In-Context Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing autonomous agents that quickly explore an environment and adapt their behavior online is a canonical challenge in robotics and machine learning. While humans are able to achieve such fast online exploration and adaptation, often acquiring new information and skills in only a handful of interactions, existing algorithmic approaches tend to rely on random exploration and slow, gradient-based behavior updates. How can we endow autonomous agents with such capabilities on par with humans? Taking inspiration from recent progress on both in-context learning and large-scale behavioral cloning, in this work we propose behavioral exploration: training agents to internalize what it means to explore and adapt in-context over the space of ``expert'' behaviors. To achieve this, given access to a dataset of expert demonstrations, we train a long-context generative model to predict expert actions conditioned on a context of past observations and a measure of how ``exploratory'' the expert's behaviors are relative to this context. This enables the model to not only mimic the behavior of an expert, but also, by feeding its past history of interactions into its context, to select different expert behaviors than what have been previously selected, thereby allowing for fast online adaptation and targeted, ``expert-like'' exploration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both simulated locomotion and manipulation settings, as well as on real-world robotic manipulation tasks, illustrating its ability to learn adaptive, exploratory behavior.</description>

      <title>Imitation Learning in Continuous Action Spaces: Mitigating Compounding Error without Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of imitating an expert demonstrator in a continuous state-and-action dynamical system. While imitation learning in discrete settings such as autoregressive language modeling has seen immense success and popularity in recent years, imitation in physical settings such as autonomous driving and robot learning has proven comparably more complex due to the compounding errors problem, often requiring elaborate set-ups to perform stably. Recent work has demonstrated that even in benign settings, exponential compounding errors are unavoidable when learning solely from expert-controlled trajectories, suggesting the need for more advanced policy parameterizations or data augmentation. To this end, we present minimal interventions that provably mitigate compounding errors in continuous state-and-action imitation learning. When the system is open-loop stable, we prescribe "action chunking," i.e., predicting and playing sequences of actions in open-loop; when the system is possibly unstable, we prescribe "noise injection," i.e., adding noise during expert demonstrations. These interventions align with popular choices in modern robot learning, though the benefits we derive are distinct from the effects they were designed to target. Our results draw insights and tools from both control theory and reinforcement learning; however, our analysis reveals novel considerations that do not naturally arise when either literature is considered in isolation.</description>

      <title>C-ZUPT: Stationarity-Aided Aerial Hovering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous systems across diverse domains have underscored the need for drift-resilient state estimation. Although satellite-based positioning and cameras are widely used, they often suffer from limited availability in many environments. As a result, positioning must rely solely on inertial sensors, leading to rapid accuracy degradation over time due to sensor biases and noise. To counteract this, alternative update sources-referred to as information aiding-serve as anchors of certainty. Among these, the zero-velocity update (ZUPT) is particularly effective in providing accurate corrections during stationary intervals, though it is restricted to surface-bound platforms. This work introduces a controlled ZUPT (C-ZUPT) approach for aerial navigation and control, independent of surface contact. By defining an uncertainty threshold, C-ZUPT identifies quasi-static equilibria to deliver precise velocity updates to the estimation filter. Extensive validation confirms that these opportunistic, high-quality updates significantly reduce inertial drift and control effort. As a result, C-ZUPT mitigates filter divergence and enhances navigation stability, enabling more energy-efficient hovering and substantially extending sustained flight-key advantages for resource-constrained aerial systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have emerged as versatile platforms, driving the demand for accurate modeling to support developmental testing. This paper proposes data-driven modeling software for UAV. Emphasizes the utilization of cost-effective sensors to obtain orientation and location data subsequently processed through the application of data filtering algorithms and sensor fusion techniques to improve the data quality to make a precise model visualization on the software. UAV's orientation is obtained using processed Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data and represented using Quaternion Representation to avoid the gimbal lock problem. The UAV's location is determined by combining data from the Global Positioning System (GPS), which provides stable geographic coordinates but slower data update frequency, and the accelerometer, which has higher data update frequency but integrating it to get position data is unstable due to its accumulative error. By combining data from these two sensors, the software is able to calculate and continuously update the UAV's real-time position during its flight operations. The result shows that the software effectively renders UAV orientation and position with high degree of accuracy and fluidity</description>

      <title>GenAI-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning towards Distributed Agent Intelligence: A Generative-RL Agent Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning faces fundamental challenges that conventional approaches have failed to overcome: exponentially growing joint action spaces, non-stationary environments where simultaneous learning creates moving targets, and partial observability that constrains coordination. Current methods remain reactive, employing stimulus-response mechanisms that fail when facing novel scenarios. We argue for a transformative paradigm shift from reactive to proactive multi-agent intelligence through generative AI-based reinforcement learning. This position advocates reconceptualizing agents not as isolated policy optimizers, but as sophisticated generative models capable of synthesizing complex multi-agent dynamics and making anticipatory decisions based on predictive understanding of future interactions. Rather than responding to immediate observations, generative-RL agents can model environment evolution, predict other agents' behaviors, generate coordinated action sequences, and engage in strategic reasoning accounting for long-term dynamics. This approach leverages pattern recognition and generation capabilities of generative AI to enable proactive decision-making, seamless coordination through enhanced communication, and dynamic adaptation to evolving scenarios. We envision this paradigm shift will unlock unprecedented possibilities for distributed intelligence, moving beyond individual optimization toward emergent collective behaviors representing genuine collaborative intelligence. The implications extend across autonomous systems, robotics, and human-AI collaboration, promising solutions to coordination challenges intractable under traditional reactive frameworks.</description>

      <title>humancompatible.interconnect: Testing Properties of Repeated Uses of Interconnections of AI Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems often interact with multiple agents. The regulation of such AI systems often requires that {\em a priori\/} guarantees of fairness and robustness be satisfied. With stochastic models of agents' responses to the outputs of AI systems, such {\em a priori\/} guarantees require non-trivial reasoning about the corresponding stochastic systems. Here, we present an open-source PyTorch-based toolkit for the use of stochastic control techniques in modelling interconnections of AI systems and properties of their repeated uses. It models robustness and fairness desiderata in a closed-loop fashion, and provides {\em a priori\/} guarantees for these interconnections. The PyTorch-based toolkit removes much of the complexity associated with the provision of fairness guarantees for closed-loop models of multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>IteraOptiRacing: A Unified Planning-Control Framework for Real-time Autonomous Racing for Iterative Optimal Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified planning-control strategy for competing with other racing cars called IteraOptiRacing in autonomous racing environments. This unified strategy is proposed based on Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator for Iterative Tasks (i2LQR), which can improve lap time performance in the presence of surrounding racing obstacles. By iteratively using the ego car's historical data, both obstacle avoidance for multiple moving cars and time cost optimization are considered in this unified strategy, resulting in collision-free and time-optimal generated trajectories. The algorithm's constant low computation burden and suitability for parallel computing enable real-time operation in competitive racing scenarios. To validate its performance, simulations in a high-fidelity simulator are conducted with multiple randomly generated dynamic agents on the track. Results show that the proposed strategy outperforms existing methods across all randomly generated autonomous racing scenarios, enabling enhanced maneuvering for the ego racing car.</description>

      <title>Active Probing with Multimodal Predictions for Motion Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigation in dynamic environments requires autonomous systems to reason about uncertainties in the behavior of other agents. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework that combines trajectory planning with multimodal predictions and active probing to enhance decision-making under uncertainty. We develop a novel risk metric that seamlessly integrates multimodal prediction uncertainties through mixture models. When these uncertainties follow a Gaussian mixture distribution, we prove that our risk metric admits a closed-form solution, and is always finite, thus ensuring analytical tractability. To reduce prediction ambiguity, we incorporate an active probing mechanism that strategically selects actions to improve its estimates of behavioral parameters of other agents, while simultaneously handling multimodal uncertainties. We extensively evaluate our framework in autonomous navigation scenarios using the MetaDrive simulation environment. Results demonstrate that our active probing approach successfully navigates complex traffic scenarios with uncertain predictions. Additionally, our framework shows robust performance across diverse traffic agent behavior models, indicating its broad applicability to real-world autonomous navigation challenges. Code and videos are available at https://darshangm.github.io/papers/active-probing-multimodal-predictions/.</description>

      <title>Multi-residual Mixture of Experts Learning for Cooperative Control in Multi-vehicle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming increasingly popular, with their applications now extending beyond just a mode of transportation to serving as mobile actuators of a traffic flow to control flow dynamics. This contrasts with traditional fixed-location actuators, such as traffic signals, and is referred to as Lagrangian traffic control. However, designing effective Lagrangian traffic control policies for AVs that generalize across traffic scenarios introduces a major challenge. Real-world traffic environments are highly diverse, and developing policies that perform robustly across such diverse traffic scenarios is challenging. It is further compounded by the joint complexity of the multi-agent nature of traffic systems, mixed motives among participants, and conflicting optimization objectives subject to strict physical and external constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Residual Mixture of Expert Learning (MRMEL), a novel framework for Lagrangian traffic control that augments a given suboptimal nominal policy with a learned residual while explicitly accounting for the structure of the traffic scenario space. In particular, taking inspiration from residual reinforcement learning, MRMEL augments a suboptimal nominal AV control policy by learning a residual correction, but at the same time dynamically selects the most suitable nominal policy from a pool of nominal policies conditioned on the traffic scenarios and modeled as a mixture of experts. We validate MRMEL using a case study in cooperative eco-driving at signalized intersections in Atlanta, Dallas Fort Worth, and Salt Lake City, with real-world data-driven traffic scenarios. The results show that MRMEL consistently yields superior performance-achieving an additional 4%-9% reduction in aggregate vehicle emissions relative to the strongest baseline in each setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, communication protocols and algorithms are essential for cooperation and collaboration between UAVs. Simulation provides a cost-effective solution for prototyping, debugging, and analyzing protocols and algorithms, avoiding the prohibitive expenses of field experiments. In this paper, we present ``UavNetSim-v1'', an open-source Python-based simulation platform designed for rapid development, testing, and evaluating the protocols and algorithms in UAV networks. ``UavNetSim-v1'' provides most of the functionalities developers may need, including routing/medium access control (MAC) protocols, topology control algorithms and mobility/energy models, while maintaining ease of use. Furthermore, the platform supports comprehensive performance evaluation and features an interactive visualization interface for in-depth algorithm analysis. In short, ``UavNetSim-v1'' lends itself to both rapid prototyping and educational purposes, and can serve as a lightweight yet powerful alternative to mature network simulators for UAV communication research.</description>

      <title>Optimal Design of Satellite Constellation Configurations with Mixed Integer Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing satellite constellation systems involves complex multidisciplinary optimization in which coverage serves as a primary driver of overall system cost and performance. Among the various design considerations, constellation configuration -- how satellites are placed and distributed in space relative to each other -- predominantly determines the resulting coverage. In constellation configuration design, coverage can be considered either as an objective or a constraint, driven by mission objectives. State-of-the-art literature addresses each situation on a case-by-case basis, applying a unique set of assumptions, modeling, and solution methods. Although such a problem-based methodology is valuable, users often face implementation challenges when performing trade-off studies across different mission scenarios, as each scenario must be handled distinctly. In response, we propose a unifying framework consisting of five mixed-integer linear program formulations that are of practical significance, extensible to more complex mission narratives using additional constraints, and capable of obtaining provably optimal constellation configurations. It can handle various metrics and mission scenarios, such as percent coverage, average or maximum revisit times, fixed number of satellites, spatiotemporally varying coverage requirements, and ground-, aerial-, or space-based, static or mobile targets. The paper presents several add-ons, case studies, and comparative analyses to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed framework.</description>

Abstract: This letter investigates the optimal allocation of large language model (LLM) inference workloads across heterogeneous edge data centers (DCs) over time. Each DC features on-site renewable generation and faces dynamic electricity prices and spatiotemporal variability in renewable availability. The central question is: how can inference workloads be optimally distributed to the DCs to minimize energy consumption, carbon emissions, and water usage while enhancing user experience? This letter proposes a novel optimization model for LLM service providers to reduce operational costs and environmental impacts. Numerical results validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Crowding-Out Effect of Investment Herding on Consumption: An Optimal Control Theory Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investment herding, a phenomenon where households mimic the decisions of others rather than relying on their own analysis, has significant effects on financial markets and household behavior. Excessive investment herding may reduce investments and lead to a depletion of household consumption, which is called the crowding-out effect. While existing research has qualitatively examined the impact of investment herding on consumption, quantitative studies in this area remain limited. In this work, we investigate the optimal investment and consumption decisions of households under the impact of investment herding. We formulate an optimization problem to model how investment herding influences household decisions over time. Based on the optimal control theory, we solve for the analytical solutions of optimal investment and consumption decisions. We theoretically analyze the impact of investment herding on household consumption decisions and demonstrate the existence of the crowding-out effect. We further explore how parameters, such as interest rate, excess return rate, and volatility, influence the crowding-out effect. Finally, we conduct a real data test to validate our theoretical analysis of the crowding-out effect. This study is crucial to understanding the impact of investment herding on household consumption and offering valuable insights for policymakers seeking to stimulate consumption and mitigate the negative effects of investment herding on economic growth.</description>

      <title>TGLD: A Trust-Aware Game-Theoretic Lane-Changing Decision Framework for Automated Vehicles in Heterogeneous Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated vehicles (AVs) face a critical need to adopt socially compatible behaviors and cooperate effectively with human-driven vehicles (HVs) in heterogeneous traffic environment. However, most existing lane-changing frameworks overlook HVs' dynamic trust levels, limiting their ability to accurately predict human driver behaviors. To address this gap, this study proposes a trust-aware game-theoretic lane-changing decision (TGLD) framework. First, we formulate a multi-vehicle coalition game, incorporating fully cooperative interactions among AVs and partially cooperative behaviors from HVs informed by real-time trust evaluations. Second, we develop an online trust evaluation method to dynamically estimate HVs' trust levels during lane-changing interactions, guiding AVs to select context-appropriate cooperative maneuvers. Lastly, social compatibility objectives are considered by minimizing disruption to surrounding vehicles and enhancing the predictability of AV behaviors, thereby ensuring human-friendly and context-adaptive lane-changing strategies. A human-in-the-loop experiment conducted in a highway on-ramp merging scenario validates our TGLD approach. Results show that AVs can effectively adjust strategies according to different HVs' trust levels and driving styles. Moreover, incorporating a trust mechanism significantly improves lane-changing efficiency, maintains safety, and contributes to transparent and adaptive AV-HV interactions.</description>

Abstract: Deep learning models incorporating linear SSMs have gained attention for capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data. However, their large parameter sizes pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this study, we propose an efficient parameter reduction method for these models by applying $H^{2}$ model order reduction techniques from control theory to their linear SSM components. In experiments, the LRA benchmark results show that the model compression based on our proposed method outperforms an existing method using the Balanced Truncation, while successfully reducing the number of parameters in the SSMs to $1/32$ without sacrificing the performance of the original models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast-response voltage regulation is essential for data-center Voltage Regulation Modules (VRMs) powering Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads, which exhibit both small-amplitude fluctuations and abrupt full-load steps. This paper introduces a control scheme that integrates a linear controller and a nonlinear controller for variable-frequency Series-Capacitor Buck (SCB) converters. First, an accurate small-signal model is derived via a Switching-Synchronized Sampled State-Space (5S) framework, yielding discrete-time transfer functions and root-locus insights for direct digital design. A critical concern for SCB converters is series-capacitor oscillation during heavy load steps if the strict switching sequence is not maintained. To accelerate large-signal transients, a time-optimal control strategy based on Pontryagins Maximum Principle (PMP) relaxes the switching constraints to compute time-optimal switching sequences. A transition logic is then proposed to integrate the high-bandwidth small-signal controller and the large-signal controller. Simulations demonstrate a rapid output voltage recovery under a heavy load step-up, over ten times faster than a linear controller-only design. Preliminary hardware tests indicate a stable rejection to heavy load disturbances with zero steady-state error.</description>

      <title>REACT: Real-time Entanglement-Aware Coverage Path Planning for Tethered Underwater Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspection of complex underwater structures with tethered underwater vehicles is often hindered by the risk of tether entanglement. We propose REACT (real-time entanglement-aware coverage path planning for tethered underwater vehicles), a framework designed to overcome this limitation. REACT comprises a fast geometry-based tether model using the signed distance field (SDF) map for accurate, real-time simulation of taut tether configurations around arbitrary structures in 3D. This model enables an efficient online replanning strategy by enforcing a maximum tether length constraint, thereby actively preventing entanglement. By integrating REACT into a coverage path planning framework, we achieve safe and optimal inspection paths, previously challenging due to tether constraints. The complete REACT framework's efficacy is validated in a pipe inspection scenario, demonstrating safe, entanglement-free navigation and full-coverage inspection. Simulation results show that REACT achieves complete coverage while maintaining tether constraints and completing the total mission 20% faster than conventional planners, despite a longer inspection time due to proactive avoidance of entanglement that eliminates extensive post-mission disentanglement. Real-world experiments confirm these benefits, where REACT completes the full mission, while the baseline planner fails due to physical tether entanglement.</description>

      <title>Polygonal Obstacle Avoidance Combining Model Predictive Control and Fuzzy Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In practice, navigation of mobile robots in confined environments is often done using a spatially discrete cost-map to represent obstacles. Path following is a typical use case for model predictive control (MPC), but formulating constraints for obstacle avoidance is challenging in this case. Typically the cost and constraints of an MPC problem are defined as closed-form functions and typical solvers work best with continuously differentiable functions. This is contrary to spatially discrete occupancy grid maps, in which a grid's value defines the cost associated with occupancy. This paper presents a way to overcome this compatibility issue by re-formulating occupancy grid maps to continuously differentiable functions to be embedded into the MPC scheme as constraints. Each obstacle is defined as a polygon -- an intersection of half-spaces. Any half-space is a linear inequality representing one edge of a polygon. Using AND and OR operators, the combined set of all obstacles and therefore the obstacle avoidance constraints can be described. The key contribution of this paper is the use of fuzzy logic to re-formulate such constraints that include logical operators as inequality constraints which are compatible with standard MPC formulation. The resulting MPC-based trajectory planner is successfully tested in simulation. This concept is also applicable outside of navigation tasks to implement logical or verbal constraints in MPC.</description>

Abstract: The aerospace industry has experienced significant transformations over the last decade, driven by technological advancements and innovative solutions in goods and personal transportation. This evolution has spurred the emergence of numerous start-ups that now face challenges traditionally encountered by established aerospace companies. Among these challenges is the efficient processing of digital intra-device communication interfaces for onboard equipment - a critical component for ensuring seamless system integration and functionality. Addressing this challenge requires solutions that emphasize clear and consistent interface descriptions, automation of processes, and reduced labor-intensive efforts.
  This paper presents a novel process and toolchain designed to streamline the development of digital interfaces and onboard software, which our team has successfully applied in several completed projects.

      <title>The Reconfigurable Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth observation satellites (EOS) play a pivotal role in capturing and analyzing planetary phenomena, ranging from natural disasters to societal development. The EOS scheduling problem (EOSSP), which optimizes the schedule of EOS, is often solved with respect to nadir-directional EOS systems, thus restricting the observation time of targets and, consequently, the effectiveness of each EOS. This paper leverages state-of-the-art constellation reconfigurability to develop the reconfigurable EOS scheduling problem (REOSSP), wherein EOS are assumed to be maneuverable, forming a more optimal constellation configuration at multiple opportunities during a schedule. This paper develops a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the REOSSP to optimally solve the scheduling problem for given parameters. Additionally, since the REOSSP can be computationally expensive for large-scale problems, a rolling horizon procedure (RHP) solution method is developed. The performance of the REOSSP is benchmarked against the EOSSP, which serves as a baseline, through a set of random instances where problem characteristics are varied and a case study in which Hurricane Sandy is used to demonstrate realistic performance. These experiments demonstrate the value of constellation reconfigurability in its application to the EOSSP, yielding solutions that improve performance, while the RHP enhances computational runtime for large-scale REOSSP instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter proposes a method to integrate auxiliary actuators that enhance the task-space capabilities of commercial underactuated systems, while leaving the internal certified low-level controller untouched. The additional actuators are combined with a feedback-linearizing outer-loop controller, enabling full-pose tracking. We provide conditions under which legacy high-level commands and new actuator inputs can be cohesively coordinated to achieve decoupled control of all degrees of freedom. A comparative study with a standard quadrotor-originally not designed for physical interaction-demonstrates that the proposed modified platform remains stable under contact, while the baseline system diverges. Additionally, simulation results under parameter uncertainty illustrate the robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Distributed Online Feedback Optimization for Real-time Distribution System Voltage Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02487v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the real-time voltage regulation problem in distribution systems employing online feedback optimization (OFO) with short-range communication between physical neighbours. OFO does not need an accurate grid model nor estimated consumption of non-controllable loads, affords fast calculations, and demonstrates robustness to uncertainties and disturbances, which render it particularly suitable for real-time distribution system applications. However, many OFO controllers require centralized communication, making them susceptible to single-point failures. This paper proposes a distributed OFO design based on a nested feedback optimization strategy and analyzes its convergence. The strategy preserves end-users' privacy by keeping voltage data local. Numerical study results demonstrate that the proposed design achieves effective voltage regulation and outperforms other distributed and local approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Dunkelflaute: An analysis of variable renewable energy droughts in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variable renewable energy droughts, also called "Dunkelflaute", emerge as a challenge for climate-neutral energy systems based on variable renewables. Drawing on 38 historic weather years and an advanced identification method, we characterize European drought events for on- and offshore wind power, solar photovoltaics, and renewable technology portfolios. We show that their characteristics heavily depend on the chosen drought threshold, questioning the usefulness of single-threshold analyses. Applying a multi-threshold framework, we quantify how the complementarity of wind and solar power temporally and spatially alleviates drought frequency, duration, and severity within (portfolio effect) and across countries (balancing effect). We identify the most extreme droughts and show how these drive major discharging periods of long-duration storage in a fully renewable European energy system, based on a policy-relevant decarbonization scenario. Such events comprise sequences of shorter droughts of varying severity. The most extreme event occurred in winter 1996/97 and lasted 55 days in a perfectly interconnected setting. While the average renewable availability during this period was still 47% of its long-run mean, we argue that system planners must consider such events when planning for storage and other flexibility technologies. Methodologically, we conclude that using single calendar years is not suitable for modeling weather-resilient energy scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning-Based Reference Governor for Nonlinear Systems With Application to Automotive Fuel Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prediction-based nonlinear reference governor (PRG) is an add-on algorithm to enforce constraints on pre-stabilized nonlinear systems by modifying, whenever necessary, the reference signal. The implementation of PRG carries a heavy computational burden, as it may require multiple numerical simulations of the plant model at each sample time. To this end, this paper proposes an alternative approach based on machine learning, where we first use a regression neural network (NN) to approximate the input-output map of the PRG from a set of training data. During the real-time operation, at each sample time, we use the trained NN to compute a nominal reference command, which may not be constraint admissible due to training errors and limited data. We adopt a novel sensitivity-based approach to minimally adjust the nominal reference while ensuring constraint enforcement. We thus refer to the resulting control strategy as the modified neural network reference governor (MNN-RG), which is significantly more computationally efficient than the PRG. The computational and theoretical properties of MNN-RG are presented. Finally, the effectiveness and limitations of the proposed method are studied by applying it as a load governor for constraint management in automotive fuel cell systems through simulation-based case studies.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel parameterization to characterize unknown linear time-invariant systems using noisy data. The presented parameterization describes exactly the set of all systems consistent with the available data. We then derive verifiable conditions, when the consistency constraint reduces the set to the true system and when it does not have any impact. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to use this parameterization to perform a direct data-driven estimator synthesis with guarantees on the H_{\infty}-norm. Lastly, we conduct numerical experiments to compare our approach to existing methods.</description>

      <title>A New 8/14 Two-Phase Switched Reluctance Motor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06161v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their simple and robust structure, low cost, and simple cooling system, switched reluctance motors (SRMs) face the challenge of low mean torque. A possible solution is to change the structure of SRMs. This article introduces an innovative combination of the number of rotor teeth and stator teeth of a two-phase switch reluctance motor (TPSRM) with eight teeth for the stator and fourteen teeth for the rotor. As a result of its unique design, which has a short path for passing the main flux, it requires less magnetomotive force. This leads to less core and copper loss, resulting in increased efficiency. Each tooth of the stator in a phase develops a positive torque during the rotation of the rotor, which increases the torque and consequently increases the mean torque of the proposed TPSRM. A current hysteresis control (CHC) is simulated by 2D FEM for the proposed 8/14 TPSRM and the conventional 8/12 TPSRM under the same mechanical load on the shaft to get a current hysteresis reference of 15A at the nominal speed of 600 rpm. To verify the novelty and advantages of the suggested TPSRM, it is compared with the conventional 8/12 TPSRM in terms of mean and peak torque, torque density, and core and copper losses were compared. Lastly, the proposed 8/14 TPSRM is shown to have better performance than the conventional 8/12 TPSRM.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Gradient-Tracking-Based Distributed Stochastic Optimization over Directed Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a differentially private gradient-tracking-based distributed stochastic optimization algorithm over directed graphs. In particular, privacy noises are incorporated into each agent's state and tracking variable to mitigate information leakage, after which the perturbed states and tracking variables are transmitted to neighbors. We design two novel schemes for the step-sizes and the sampling number within the algorithm. The sampling parameter-controlled subsampling method employed by both schemes enhances the differential privacy level, and ensures a finite cumulative privacy budget even over infinite iterations. The algorithm achieves both almost sure and mean square convergence for nonconvex objectives. Furthermore, when nonconvex objectives satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, Scheme (S1) achieves a polynomial mean square convergence rate, and Scheme (S2) achieves an exponential mean square convergence rate. The trade-off between privacy and convergence is presented. The effectiveness of the algorithm and its superior performance compared to existing works are illustrated through numerical examples of distributed training on the benchmark datasets "MNIST" and "CIFAR-10".</description>

      <title>Balancing service provision by EV aggregator in different TSO-DSO coordination schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in the distribution system has led to the emergence of a new market actor - the aggregator. The aggregator serves as a facilitator, enabling flexibility asset owners to get access to different markets. In which, EVs aggregators are gaining more attention due to their expanding use and potential to provide services in various types of markets, particularly in the reserve market. Currently, TSO indirectly utilizes these resources under the management of the distribution system operators (DSO), which can negatively impact the distribution grid. Conversely, adjustments from DSOs can impact service provision to TSO due to the shortage of TSO usage information. These factors highlight the importance of evaluating the service provision from aggregators under different TSO-DSO coordination schemes. This paper focuses on the provision of flexibility from electric vehicles (EVs) aggregators for balancing service in the TSO-DSO hybrid-managed and compares it with the DSO-managed coordination schemes. The behavior of aggregators reacting to price fluctuations and TSO requests under different coordination schemes and simulation scenarios is thoroughly evaluated. Additionally, their impact on the grid is analyzed through the DSO's congestion management process and validated using data from a real part of the Dutch distribution network. Results find that the hybrid-managed coordination scheme gives more benefit to the aggregator than the DSO-managed scheme and the EVs aggregator will gain more profit in winter than summer due to more upward regulation service is needed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13407v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive novel deterministic bounds on the approximation error of data-based bilinear surrogate models for unknown nonlinear systems. The surrogate models are constructed using kernel-based extended dynamic mode decomposition to approximate the Koopman operator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Unlike previous methods that require restrictive assumptions on the invariance of the dictionary, our approach leverages kernel-based dictionaries that allow us to control the projection error via pointwise error bounds, overcoming a significant limitation of existing theoretical guarantees. The derived state- and input-dependent error bounds allow for direct integration into Koopman-based robust controller designs with closed-loop guarantees for the unknown nonlinear system. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning for robust dynamic metabolic control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic metabolic control allows key metabolic fluxes to be modulated in real time, enhancing bioprocess flexibility and expanding available optimization degrees of freedom. This is achieved, e.g., via targeted modulation of metabolic enzyme expression. However, identifying optimal dynamic control policies is challenging due to the generally high-dimensional solution space and the need to manage metabolic burden and cytotoxic effects arising from inducible enzyme expression. The task is further complicated by stochastic dynamics, which reduce bioprocess reproducibility. We propose a reinforcement learning framework} to derive optimal policies by allowing an agent (the controller) to interact with a surrogate dynamic model. To promote robustness, we apply domain randomization, enabling the controller to generalize across uncertainties. When transferred to an experimental system, the agent can in principle continue fine-tuning the policy. Our framework provides an alternative to conventional model-based control such as model predictive control, which requires model differentiation with respect to decision variables; often impractical for complex stochastic, nonlinear, stiff, and piecewise-defined dynamics. In contrast, our approach relies on forward integration of the model, thereby simplifying the task. We demonstrate the framework in two $\textit{Escherichia coli}$ bioprocesses: dynamic control of acetyl-CoA carboxylase for fatty-acid synthesis and of adenosine triphosphatase for lactate synthesis.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of the Lur'e problem under positivity constraints, drawing on results from the positive Aizerman conjecture and robustness properties of Metzler matrices. Specifically, we consider a control system of Lur'e type in which not only the linear part includes parametric uncertainty but also the nonlinear sector bound is unknown. We investigate tools from positive linear systems to effectively solve the problems in complicated and uncertain nonlinear systems. By leveraging the positivity characteristic of the system, we derive an explicit formula for the stability radius of Lur'e systems. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to systems with neural network (NN) feedback loops. Building on this approach, we also propose a refinement method for sector bounds of NNs. This study introduces a scalable and efficient approach for robustness analysis of both Lur'e and NN-controlled systems. Finally, the proposed results are supported by illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Faster Reinforcement Learning by Freezing Slow States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study infinite horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) with "fast-slow" structure, where some state variables evolve rapidly ("fast states") while others change more gradually ("slow states"). This structure commonly arises in practice when decisions must be made at high frequencies over long horizons, and where slowly changing information still plays a critical role in determining optimal actions. Examples include inventory control under slowly changing demand indicators or dynamic pricing with gradually shifting consumer behavior. Modeling the problem at the natural decision frequency leads to MDPs with discount factors close to one, making them computationally challenging. We propose a novel approximation strategy that "freezes" slow states during phases of lower-level planning and subsequently applies value iteration to an auxiliary upper-level MDP that evolves on a slower timescale. Freezing states for short periods of time leads to easier-to-solve lower-level problems, while a slower upper-level timescale allows for a more favorable discount factor. On the theoretical side, we analyze the regret incurred by our frozen-state approach, which leads to simple insights on how to trade off regret versus computational cost. Empirically, we benchmark our new frozen-state methods on three domains, (i) inventory control with fixed order costs, (ii) a gridworld problem with spatial tasks, and (iii) dynamic pricing with reference-price effects. We demonstrate that the new methods produce high-quality policies with significantly less computation, and we show that simply omitting slow states is often a poor heuristic.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancement in online optimization and control has provided novel tools to study online linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problems, where cost matrices are time-varying and unknown in advance. In this work, we study the online linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) problem over the manifold of stabilizing controllers that are linearly constrained to impose physical conditions such as sparsity. By adopting a Riemannian perspective, we propose the online Newton on manifold (ONM) algorithm, which generates an online controller on-the-fly based on the second-order information of the cost function sequence. To quantify the algorithm performance, we use the notion of regret, defined as the sub-optimality of the algorithm cumulative cost against a (locally) minimizing controller sequence. We establish a regret bound in terms of the path-length of the benchmark minimizer sequence, and we further verify the effectiveness of ONM via simulations.</description>

      <title>LSTP-Nav: Lightweight Spatiotemporal Policy for Map-free Multi-agent Navigation with LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16370v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safe and efficient multi-agent navigation in dynamic environments remains inherently challenging, particularly when real-time decision-making is required on resource-constrained platforms. Ensuring collision-free trajectories while adapting to uncertainties without relying on pre-built maps further complicates real-world deployment. To address these challenges, we propose LSTP-Nav, a lightweight end-to-end policy for multi-agent navigation that enables map-free collision avoidance in complex environments by directly mapping raw LiDAR point clouds to motion commands. At the core of this framework lies LSTP-Net, an efficient network that processes raw LiDAR data using a GRU architecture, enhanced with attention mechanisms to dynamically focus on critical environmental features while minimizing computational overhead. Additionally, a novel HS reward optimizes collision avoidance by incorporating angular velocity, prioritizing obstacles along the predicted heading, and enhancing training stability. To narrow the sim-to-real gap, we develop PhysReplay-Simlab, a physics-realistic multi-agent simulator, employs localized replay to mine near-failure experiences. Relying solely on LiDA, LSTP-Nav achieves efficient zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on a CPU-only robotic platform, enabling robust navigation in dynamic environments while maintaining computation frequencies above 40 Hz. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LSTP-Nav outperforms baselines with a 9.58\% higher success rate and a 12.30\% lower collision rate, underscoring its practicality and robustness for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Kernel-based Koopman approximants for control: Flexible sampling, error analysis, and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven techniques for analysis, modeling, and control of complex dynamical systems are on the uptake. Koopman theory provides the theoretical foundation for the popular kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition (kEDMD). In this work, we propose a novel kEDMD scheme to approximate nonlinear control systems accompanied by an in-depth error analysis. Key features are regularization-based robustness and an adroit decomposition into micro and macro grids enabling flexible sampling. But foremost, we prove proportionality, i.e., explicit dependence on the distance to the (controlled) equilibrium, of the derived bound on the full approximation error. Leveraging this key property, we rigorously show that asymptotic stability of the data-driven surrogate (control) system implies asymptotic stability of the original (control) system and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Fast Bilateral Teleoperation and Imitation Learning Using Sensorless Force Control via Accurate Dynamics Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of imitation learning has led to increased interest in teleoperating low-cost manipulators to collect demonstration data. However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless, low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by 4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.</description>

      <title>Stream Function-Based Navigation for Complex Quadcopter Obstacle Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a novel stream function-based navigational control system for obstacle avoidance, where obstacles are represented as two-dimensional (2D) rigid surfaces in inviscid, incompressible flows. The approach leverages the vortex panel method (VPM) and incorporates safety margins to control the stream function and flow properties around virtual surfaces, enabling navigation in complex, partially observed environments using real-time sensing. To address the limitations of the VPM in managing relative distance and avoiding rapidly accelerating obstacles at close proximity, the system integrates a model predictive controller (MPC) based on higher-order control barrier functions (HOCBF). This integration incorporates VPM trajectory generation, state estimation, and constraint handling into a receding-horizon optimization problem. The 2D rigid surfaces are enclosed using minimum bounding ellipses (MBEs), while an adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) captures and predicts obstacle dynamics, propagating these estimates into the MPC-HOCBF for rapid avoidance maneuvers. Evaluation is conducted using a PX4-powered Clover drone Gazebo simulator and real-time experiments involving a COEX Clover quadcopter equipped with a 360 degree LiDAR sensor.</description>
