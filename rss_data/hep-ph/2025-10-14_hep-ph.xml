      <title>Revisiting the soft-hard separation in the transverse momentum spectra of $pp$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the separation of soft and hard components in the transverse momentum spectra of charged particles as measured by ALICE in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}= 2.76 TeV, 5.02 TeV and 13 TeV at the LHC. The soft component is described by a Boltzmann fit, while the residual spectra are identified as hard QCD-like fragmentation. After separation, the subtracted spectra show no evolution in the shape or peak position with multiplicity, supporting a two-component interpretation. Mean transverse momenta for both contributions remain nearly constant, while Pythia 8 Monte Carlo simulations confirm these trends. Our results support the two-component description as a robust alternative to hydrodynamical interpretations.</description>

      <title>Massive Feynman integrals at high energies: recent analytic results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-energy behaviour of scattering amplitudes involving massive particles has attracted interest in recent years. In these proceedings, we report on the analytic tool AsyInt for solving massive multi-loop Feynman integrals in the high-energy limit, which are fundamental building blocks for such amplitudes in the full Standard Model. We present recent analytic results for two-loop four-point Feynman integrals with both internal and external masses in this limit, featuring polylogarithmic and elliptic structures.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Catalysis of charmonium in the vector channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of an external magnetic field on the vector charmonium system within the framework of Hilbert moment QCD sum rules. By incorporating magnetic corrections to the perturbative contributions of the QCD sector, we analyze the behavior of the hadronic parameters of the $J/\psi$ resonance -- namely, its continuum threshold $s_0$, decay constant $f_V$, width $\Gamma_V$, and its mass $M_V$, as functions of the magnetic field strength. Our results show that $s_0$ and $f_V$ increase monotonically, while $\Gamma_V$ decreases significantly and $M_V$ remains essentially constant. These behaviors indicate a strengthening of the hadronic state in the presence of a magnetic field, consistent with the phenomenon of magnetic catalysis. Although magnetic catalysis has traditionally been associated with light-quark systems via chiral symmetry breaking, our results demonstrate that similar effects persist in the heavy-quark sector, despite the absence of chiral dynamics.</description>

      <title>Light scalar quarkonia from QCD Laplace sum rule at higher order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review our estimations on the light scalar $\bar{q}q$, $(\bar{q}q')(\bar{q'}q)$ and $\overline{qq'}qq'$ ($q,q'\equiv u,d,s$) states from relativistic Laplace sum rule (LSR) within stability criteria and including higher order perturbative (PT) corrections up to the (estimated) N5LO. We evaluate the QCD spectral functions at Lowest Order (LO) of PT QCD and up to the $D=6$ dimension of quark and gluon condensates. Using stability criteria and the constraint: Pole contribution is larger than the QCD continuum one ($R_{P/C}\geqslant 1$) our results exclude an on-shell mass around $(500-600)$ MeV obtained for values of the QCD continuum threshold $t_c \leqslant(1\sim 1.5)$ GeV$^2$. The complete results for the different scalar states are given in Tables 1 to 3. We conclude from the complete analysis that the assignement of the nature of the scalar mesons is not crystal clear and needs further studies.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Singularities in Feynman Integrals via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a machine-learning framework based on symbolic regression to extract the full symbol alphabet of multi-loop Feynman integrals. By targeting the analytic structure rather than reduction, the method is broadly applicable and interpretable across different families of integrals. It successfully reconstructs complete symbol alphabets in nontrivial examples, demonstrating both robustness and generality. Beyond accelerating computations case by case, it uncovers the analytic structure universally. This framework opens new avenues for multi-loop amplitude analysis and provides a versatile tool for exploring scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound peak in two-color dense QCD: confronting effective models with lattice data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice simulations of two-color, two-flavor Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at finite quark chemical potential have revealed a distinctive peak structure in the sound velocity. Although chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model have been employed to explain this phenomenon, neither approach has fully captured the observed behavior. To address this discrepancy, we have extended the NJL framework by incorporating the Medium Separation Scheme (MSS). This approach isolates medium contributions from divergent integrals, allowing for a more accurate treatment of finite-density effects. Our results indicate a clear increase in the diquark gap ($\Delta$) with increasing chemical potential, consistent with what is also seen in perturbative QCD predictions at high densities. {}Furthermore, the MSS-modified NJL model successfully reproduces the observed peak in the sound velocity.</description>

      <title>Medium modifications of $1P$-wave charmonia $\chi_{cJ}(1P)$ in cold nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we employ the quark-meson coupling model to investigate the mass shifts of $1P$-wave charmonia $\chi_{cJ}(1P)$ ($J=0,1,2$) in cold symmetric nuclear matter by incorporating in-medium loop contributions to the $\chi_{cJ}(1P)$ self-energy within the unquenched picture. At normal nuclear matter density, we obtain significant mass reductions of about 60 MeV for the $\chi_{cJ}(1P)$ states, with the $\chi_{c2}(1P)$ mass shift primarily arising from the vector-vector loop. Our results also indicate the absence of level crossing between the in-medium $\chi_{cJ}(1P)$ mass and the $D\bar{D}$ mass threshold up to $\rho_B &lt; 3\rho_0$-a feature that could be probed in the Compressed Baryonic Matter experiment at FAIR and the Beam Energy Scan program at RHIC.</description>

      <title>Exploring vector-like $B$-quark pair production at CLIC in fully hadronic final states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the discovery potential of the 3 TeV Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) for a singlet vector-like bottom partner $B$ decaying via $B \to tW$. Focusing on the fully hadronic final state $B\bar{B} \to tW tW$, we reconstruct boosted top and $W$ candidates using large-$R$ Valencia jets, supplemented by a merging strategy for partially resolved decays. A systematic scan of the jet-radius parameter identifies $R=0.8$ as the optimal choice, balancing boosted-jet containment with jet multiplicity. Using a cut-based analysis optimized for the $(2t+2W)$ topology and an integrated luminosity of $5~{\rm ab}^{-1}$, CLIC can achieve sensitivity to $m_B \lesssim 1.5~{\rm TeV}$. These results highlight CLIC's excellent capability to probe heavy vector-like quarks in high jet multiplicity environments, extending well beyond the reach of current hadron collider searches.</description>

      <title>Two-loop QCD-corrections to $e^{+} e^{-} \rightarrow Z^{\ast} \rightarrow \boldsymbol{J /\psi}+\boldsymbol{J/ \psi}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a next-to-next-to-leading-order calculation within the nonrelativistic QCD framework for the process of $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow Z^{\ast} \rightarrow J/\psi+J/\psi$ . We find that the NNLO contribution is 2-3 times larger than the next-to-leading-order contribution, which itself is already 3-5 times larger than the leading-order result. In the high-energy limit, we provide analytic expressions for the leading-power coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of the two-loop amplitudes. Our results are directly applicable to the bottomonium process $Z^{\ast} \rightarrow \Upsilon+\Upsilon$. Using the obtained hadronic amplitudes, we predict the decay width of the $Z$ boson into these rare di-charmonium and di-bottomonium final states.</description>

      <title>Perturbative and non-perturbative properties of heavy quark transport in a thermal QCD medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of heavy quark transport in a thermal QCD medium. Based on the Soft-Hard Factorized Model (SHFM), we extend the original perturbative framework to the near-critical temperature region, where non-perturbative effects become significant. The transition behavior of the semi-Quark-Gluon-Plasma (semi-QGP) is described via a temperature-dependent background field incorporated in the background field effective theory. By implementing this approach, we quantitatively evaluate the collisional energy loss and momentum diffusion coefficients of charm and bottom quarks as functions of the incoming energy and medium temperature. Our results show a distinct suppression of both the energy loss and the diffusion coefficients relative to conventional perturbative estimates, especially near the critical temperature. This suppression originates from the emergence of a temperature-dependent color background field, which effectively reduces the color charge screening of the medium. These findings provide important theoretical insight into the phenomenology of heavy-flavor probes in QGP, offering a unified theoretical framework applicable across both high- and low-momentum regimes.</description>

      <title>Production of the exclusive $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow J/\psi+\gamma$ process in proton-proton ultraperipheral collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a next-to-leading-order (NLO) study of $J/\psi + \gamma$ production via photon-photon fusion in proton-proton ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 14$ TeV. The calculation is performed within the nonrelativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD) framework, where we employ photon parton distribution functions derived from the proton's electric-dipole form factor (EDFF) and explicitly retain their dependence on the impact parameter $b$. Our calculation yields cross sections of $155$ fb at leading order and between $107.5$ fb and $130$ fb at NLO in $\alpha_s$, demonstrating a moderate but manageable $\alpha_s$ suppression. Despite this reduction, the process retains a sufficiently large cross section to be observable in future high-luminosity measurements.</description>

      <title>Predictions for $\Lambda_b\to \Lambda_c\tau\bar\nu$ in BLSSM with Inverse seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistent deviations observed in semileptonic $B$ decays, in particular the lepton flavor universality ratios $\mathcal{R}(D^{(*)})$ and $\mathcal{R}(\Lambda_c)$, provide intriguing hints of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). While current measurements remain limited by experimental uncertainties, their lower central values compared to SM expectations motivate further theoretical scrutiny. In this work we study these observables within the $B-L$ Supersymmetric Standard Model with an inverse seesaw (BLSSM-IS). We emphasize the role of penguin diagrams involving charginos, neutralinos, and right-handed sneutrinos, which induce flavor-dependent loop corrections to the effective $W\ell\nu$ vertex. These corrections can suppress the light-lepton decay rates relative to the $\tau$ mode, leading to a modest enhancement of $\mathcal{R}(D^{(*)})$ and, through the sum rule, $\mathcal{R}(\Lambda_c)$. We present updated numerical results illustrating the correlation between mesonic and baryonic observables, showing that the BLSSM-IS framework provides a natural and testable explanation of the current data. Our findings underline the importance of upcoming precision measurements at Belle II and the LHCb upgrade in clarifying the possible role of supersymmetry in lepton flavor universality violation.</description>

      <title>Critical properties of bound states with one-boson-exchange potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we discuss some general critical properties of bound states with one-boson-exchange potential. For simplicity, we first take a system with two identical scalar particles as an example. The interaction between these two scalar particles is described by the exchange of another massive scalar meson under the instantaneous approximation, which results in the Yukawa potential. A highly accurate numerical method is used to determine the critical screening mass value of the system. The resulting critical screening mass for the ground state is consistent with those reported in the literature, agreeing to about 30 significant figures. The highly accurate results for the $l=1$ case are also presented, which are significantly more precise than those previously reported in the literature. Furthermore, we extend the discussion to physical hadronic molecule states, where form factors are introduced in the interaction to describe the structure of hadrons. Our numerical results show that although the binding energies of the hadronic molecule states depend on the cutoff in the form factors, the number of hadronic molecule states is almost independent of the cutoffs across a very wide physical region. This indicates a strong and important property: the number of hadronic molecule states is almost solely determined by the coupling constants and the masses of the exchange particles. This highly accurate numerical method can also be straightforwardly applied to higher $l$ cases or other systems.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar heavy-quarkonium hadroproduction from nonrelativistic fragmentation at NLL/NLO$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive hadroproduction of pseudoscalar heavy quarkonia, $\eta_c$ and $\eta_b$ mesons, in high-energy proton collisions. Our framework bases on the single-parton collinear fragmentation within a variable-flavor number scheme, tailored to describe the moderate to large transverse momentum regime. To this end, we construct a new set of collinear fragmentation functions, denoted as NRFF1.0, which evolve via standard DGLAP equations with a consistent treatment of flavor thresholds. Initial conditions for all parton-induced channels are computed using next-to-leading-order nonrelativistic QCD. We perform our analysis within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization framework, employing the JETHAD numerical interface together with the symJETHAD symbolic engine. These tools allow us to deliver predictions for high-energy observables sensitive to quarkonium final states at 13 TeV LHC. To the best of our knowledge, the NRFF1.0 sets represent the first-ever release of collinear fragmentation functions for heavy quarkonia that consistently includes all partonic channels within collinear factorization.</description>

      <title>Scattering of non-relativistic finite-size particles and puffy dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider the scattering between non-relativistic particles with different finite sizes. We first calculate their interaction potential and apply the partial wave method to obtain their scattering cross section. Our findings show that the particle size can significantly affect the scattering between non-relativistic particles. Then we apply such a study to direct detection of puffy dark matter. We find that the finite size of the target nucleus may introduce non-perturbative effects that differ from the scenario of point-like dark matter. For large-size dark matter particles, this non-perturbative regime in the dark matter nucleus scattering cross section effectively disappears; while for small values of the size-to-range ratio in the scattering process, a significant non-perturbative regime can maintain. Finally, for the direct detection of nugget-type puffy dark matter with a small number of constituent particles, we find that the stability conditions for the formation of bound-state dark matter can provide constraints on the dark matter nucleus scattering cross section.</description>

Abstract: The computation of bounce action in a phase transition involves solving partial differential equations, inherently introducing non-negligible numerical uncertainty. Deriving characteristic temperatures and properties of this transition necessitates both differentiation and integration of the action, thereby exacerbating the uncertainty. In this work, we fit the action curve as a function of temperature to mitigate the uncertainties inherent in the calculation of the phase transition parameters. We find that, after extracting a factor, the sixth-order polynomial yields an excellent fit for the action in the high temperature approximated potential. In a realistic model, the singlet extension of the Standard Model, this method performs satisfactorily across most of the parameter space after trimming the fitting data. This approach not only enhances the accuracy of phase transition calculations but also systematically reduces computation time and facilitates error estimation, particularly in models involving multiple scalar fields. Furthermore, we discussed the possible of using multiple neural networks to predict the action curve from model parameters.</description>

      <title>Multimodal axion emissions from Abelian-Higgs cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that axions can be produced from Abelian-Higgs cosmic strings due to the axion-gauge coupling. The strong magnetic field is confined in the string, and the electric field is induced around the moving string, allowing axion productions from the dynamics of cosmic strings. Our numerical analysis on the string collision shows that a sizable number of axions can be produced at the reconnection, and further emissions occur from moving kinks afterward. Furthermore, the simulation on the string network shows multimodal axion emissions in the sense that axions are produced in both the low-energy and high-energy regimes. The former can contribute to the cold dark matter and the latter can be regarded as dark radiation. We found that the axion with sub-GeV mass can explain the current relic dark matter abundance and simultaneously predicts a sizable amount of dark radiation which can be probed by future observations.</description>

      <title>Topological Landscapes of the BSM Higgs Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the structure of the parameter space in the Singlet Scalar Dark Matter (SSDM) model and the Next-to-Two Higgs Doublet Model (N2HDM) with $\tan\beta = 5$ and $\tan\beta = 45$. Parameter points are classified as allowed or excluded based on compatibility with the Higgs observation constraints. Using a combined framework of Topological Data Analysis (TDA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), we characterize the global geometry and topology of these high-dimensional landscapes. Our findings reveal that the SSDM and the N2HDM Type~I model exhibit finely tuned islands of collider viability. In the case of N2HDM Type~I, we also find that increasing $\tan\beta$ leads to greater topological fragmentation and higher Betti number persistence, indicating enhanced structural complexity. In contrast, the given choice of parameters excludes the entire N2HDM Type II parameter space based on current Higgs measurements. The topological properties serve as important quantitative descriptors for the phenomenological viability of the BSM frameworks. We leverage the above mentioned topological features to train machine learning models for faster characterization of the BSM Higgs sector into allowed and excluded parameter regions.</description>

      <title>Complete-Coverage Searches for Lorentz Violation in the Minimal Matter Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past several decades, dozens of tests have sought Lorentz violation in the nonrelativistic limit of the minimal matter sector of the Standard-Model Extension. Of the 132 Lorentz-violating degrees of freedom that are observable in this limit, 43 remain unconstrained. In this work, we demonstrate how existing experiments and data sets can be used to generate relevant sensitivities to all of these remaining degrees of freedom. We extract limits on all 43 of the previously unconstrained degrees of freedom and make additional improvements on 13 existing limits using published data. Our methods also offer the potential of improvements for 49 degrees of freedom in suitable future experiments. Further, the approach introduced here can be used to leverage data taken at different locations on Earth to achieve independent sensitivities to additional linear combinations of coefficients providing expanded discovery potential.</description>

      <title>Productions of $T_{cc}$ and its SU(3)-flavor symmetry and heavy quark spin symmetry partners in $B_c$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the observation of the doubly charmed tetraquark state $T_{cc}$ at $pp$ collisions in the inclusive processes, we systematically investigate the production of doubly charmed tetraquark states in exclusive $B_c$ decays. In this work, we assume the $T_{cc}$ as a $DD^*$ bound state, and then predict the masses of its heavy quark spin symmetry partner $D^*D^*$ (denoted by $T_{cc}^{*}$) as well as their SU(3)-flavor symmetry partners, i.g., $D_sD^*/D_s^*D$ (denoted by $T_{ccs}^{+}$ and $T_{ccs}^{++}$) and $D^*D_s^*$ (denoted by $T_{ccs}^{*+}$ and $T_{ccs}^{*++}$), using the contact range effective field theory. Within the molecular picture, we compute their partial decays and production rates in $B_c$ meson decays. We identify the decays $B_c \to D^0D^0\pi^+\bar{D}^0 $ and $B_c \to D_s^+ D^{0} \pi^+{D}^{-}$ as promising channels to observe the tetraquark states $T_{cc}^{(*)}$ and $T_{ccs}^{(*)++}$, respectively. Finally, by combining these results with $B_c$ production cross sections, we estimate the expected event yields for these states in the upcoming LHC Run 3 and 4. Our results indicate that the $T_{ccs}^{+}$ and $T_{ccs}^{*++}$ states are likely to be observed in $B_c$ decays, while it is quite difficult for the $T_{cc}$ and $T_{cc}^{*}$ states.</description>

      <title>QCD phase structure &amp; equation of state: A functional perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase structure of QCD remains an open fundamental problem of standard model physics. In particular at finite density, our knowledge is limited. Yet, numerous model studies point towards a rich and complex phase diagram at large density. Functional methods like the functional renormalization group and Dyson-Schwinger equations offer a way to study hot and dense QCD matter directly from first principles. I will discuss the phase structure of QCD and its experimental signatures through the lens of these methods.</description>

      <title>Addressing the $R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D^{(*)}\right)$ puzzle through New Physics four-fermion operators and their impact on $\Lambda_{b}\rightarrow\Lambda_{c}\tau\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lepton Flavor Universality ratio $R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D^{(*)}\right)$ poses a challenge to the Standard Model (SM), as B-factory experiments, BaBar, Belle, and the LHCb show $3.31\sigma$ deviations from their theoretical predictions. Utilizing the latest HFLAV averages and incorporating the branching ratio constraints $60\%$, $30\%$ and $10\%$ from the lifetime of the $B_c$ meson, we determine the values of the Wilson coefficients (WCs) for different New Physics (NP) four-fermion operator with specific Lorentz structures. Our analysis finds that the WC scenario $\left(C_{S_{L}},C_{S_{R}}\right)$ is the most probable, the maximum pull from the SM, and strongly influenced by branching ratio constraints. Furthermore, we identify three degenerate solutions involving $C_{V_{L}}$, $C_{V_{L}}^{\prime}$, $C_{V_{L}}^{\prime\prime}$, and $C_{S_{R}}^{\prime\prime}$ as the second most probable NP scenarios. We then studied the influence of these NP operators on various physical observables in $\Lambda_{b}\rightarrow\Lambda_{c}\tau\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$ decay by using the Lattice QCD form factors. Our results highlighted $C_{S_{L}}^{\prime\prime}$, $C_{S_{R}}$, $C_{T}$, $\left(C_{S_{L}},C_{S_{R}}\right)$, $\left(C_{S_{R}},C_{T}\right)$, and the three degenerate scenarios involving $\left(C_{S_{L}},C_{T}\right)$, $\left(C_{S_{L}}^{\prime},C_{T}^{\prime}\right)$ and $\left(C_{S_{L}}^{\prime\prime},C_{T}^{\prime\prime}\right)$ as strong indicators of NP. The correlation of different physical observables shows a direct correlation between $d\Gamma/dq^{2}$ and $P_{L}^{\tau}$ for WC $\left(C_{S_{L}},C_{S_{R}}\right)$; and between $A_{FB}$ and $P_{L}^{\Lambda_{c}}$ for three degenerate WCs involving $\left(C_{S_{L}},C_{T}\right)$. We hope that the measurements of these observables in ongoing and future experiments will help us scrutinize these constraints on the various NP couplings.</description>

      <title>Hints of Dark Matter Spikes in Low-mass X-ray Binaries: a critical assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three black-hole low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in the Milky Way show rates of period decay which cannot be easily explained by standard mechanisms. Recently, it has been claimed that the anomalous period decays in two of these systems may be explained by dynamical friction due to very high dark matter (DM) densities around the black holes. We critically assess these claims by performing $N$-body simulations of binaries embedded in dense DM ``spikes". We simulate the previously-studied systems XTE J1118+480 and A0620--00, as well as studying the third binary Nova Muscae 1991 for the first time in this context. These simulations show that feedback on the DM distribution plays a crucial role and we rule out previously-claimed shallow DM spikes. We set lower limits on the steepness $\gamma$ of DM density profiles required to explain the period decay in these LMXBs, requiring $\gamma \gtrsim 2.15-2.20$ in XTE J1118+480 and A0620--00 and $\gamma \gtrsim 2.3$ in Nova Muscae 1991. Improved modeling of the long-term evolution of binaries embedded in DM spikes may allow us to exclude even larger densities in future.</description>

      <title>StatTestCalculator: A New General Tool for Statistical Analysis in High Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present StatTestCalculator (STC), a new open-source statistical analysis tool designed for analysis high energy physics experiments. STC provides both asymptotic calculations and Monte Carlo simulations for computing the exact statistical significance of a discovery or for setting upper limits on signal model parameters. We review the underlying statistical formalism, including profile likelihood ratio test statistics for discovery and exclusion hypotheses, and the asymptotic distributions that allow quick significance estimates. We explain the relevant formulas for the likelihood functions, test statistic distributions, and significance metrics (both with and without incorporating systematic uncertainties). The implementation and capabilities of STC are described, and we validate its performance against the widely-used CMS Combine tool. We find excellent agreement in both the expected discovery significances and upper limit calculations. STC is a flexible framework that can accommodate systematic uncertainties and user-defined statistical models, making it suitable for a broad range of analyses.</description>

      <title>Applying Normalizing Flows for spin correlations reconstruction in associated top-quark pair and dark matter production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a unified machine-learning framework based on Normalizing Flows (NFs) for the event-by-event reconstruction of invisible momenta and the subsequent evaluation of spin-sensitive observables in top-quark pair and dark-matter (DM) associated production processes. Building on recent studies in single-top + DM topologies, we extend the research to $t\bar{t}$ + DM final states. Inputs to our networks combine low-level four-momenta and missing transverse energy with high-level kinematic and angular variables. We compare a baseline multilayer perceptron (MLP) regressor, an autoregressive flow, and the conditional $\nu$-Flows model -- trained to learn the full conditional density. In these final states all the models perform well and demonstrate high reconstruction quality in independent regions split by $m_{t\bar{t}}$ for validation purposes. We highlight the potential of this approach to be extended to three- and four-top-quark production.</description>

      <title>The Thrust Distribution at NNLO+NNLL in Higgs Decays to Quarks and Gluons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the thrust distribution in Higgs decays to quarks and gluons, $H\to b\bar{b}$, $H\to c\bar{c}$, and $H\to gg$, including the resummation of large logarithmic corrections that arise in the two-particle limit at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy, and match it to fixed-order results for three-particle decays at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in the strong coupling. The resummation is performed analytically within the ARES framework and combined with the fixed-order results using the logR matching technique. The fixed-order calculation is carried out numerically with the NNLOJET parton-level event generator, using the antenna subtraction method. We perform detailed cross-validation in the two-particle region, demonstrating that the expansion of the NNLL resummed result correctly reproduces the logarithmic structure of the fixed-order calculation to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_\mathrm{s}^3)$, up to a predictable N$^{3}$LL term at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_\mathrm{s}^3L)$. In addition to providing the first NNLO+NNLL accurate predictions for the thrust distribution in Higgs decays to quarks and gluons, we analytically extract the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_\mathrm{s}^2)$ hard-virtual correction $c_2$ and the $\alpha_\mathrm{s}^3L$ term $G_{31}$ in both the $H\to q\bar{q}$ ($q=b,c$) and $H\to gg$ decay channels.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the limits on dark matter annihilation cross-section and decay lifetime in light of electron and positron fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the upper bound on the annihilation cross-section, $\langle\sigma v\rangle$ of a stable dark matter (DM) of mass $5\times10^2-10^{14}$ GeV by considering five different channels: $W^+W^-$, $b\bar{b}$, $\mu^+\mu^-$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, and $e^+e^-$. We use the observed electron and positron fluxes from CALET, DAMPE, HESS, positron flux from AMS-02, and gamma-ray flux from HAWC, GRAPES-3, CASA-MIA to constrain the annihilation cross-section. We also consider unstable DM of mass $10^3-10^{16}$~GeV decaying to $W^+W^-$, $b\bar{b}$, $\mu^+\mu^-$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, and $e^+e^-$ and derive the corresponding lower bound on the DM lifetime, $\tau_{\rm DM}$. We find that the latest data from CALET gives a stringent constraint on $\langle\sigma v\rangle$ in the low DM mass regime. For a typical DM mass of 1 TeV, we show that $\langle\sigma v\rangle_{{\rm DM~DM}\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-}\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^{-24})~\rm cm^3/s$ is disfavored. On the other hand in the low mass regime, the AMS-02 gives a much stringent limit on the DM lifetime, excluding $\tau_{\rm DM\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-}\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{27})$ s for a 1 TeV mass of DM. In the high mass regime, typically $M_{\rm DM}\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ GeV, HAWC and CASA-MIA give the strongest constraints on $\langle\sigma v\rangle$ and $\tau_{\rm DM}$.</description>

      <title>Meson-antimeson mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meson-antimeson transitions are flavor-changing neutral current processes in which the strangeness, charm, or beauty quantum number changes by two units. In the Standard Model (SM) these transitions originate from box diagrams with two W bosons. They permit the preparation of time-dependent, oscillating quantum states which are superpositions of a meson and its antimeson. By studying their decays one gains information on both the meson-antimeson mixing amplitude and the decay amplitude involved and one can measure complex phases quantifying the violation of charge-parity (CP) violation. I present a comprehensive overview on the topic, starting with phenomenological presentations of $K$-$\bar K$, $B_d$-$\bar B_d$, $B_s$-$\bar B_s$, and $D$-$\bar D$ mixing. Highlights are the discovery of the violation of CP and other discrete symmetries, the predictions of the charm quark and its mass and a heavy top quark, and the confirmation of the Kobayashi-Maskawa mechanism of CP violation. Further sections cover the theoretical formalism needed to describe meson-antimeson mixing and to calculate observables in terms of the fundamental parameters of the SM. I discuss the unitarity triangle of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, which is used to visualize how various CP-violating and CP-conserving quantities combine to probe the SM. I describe the emergence of precision flavor physics and the role of reliable theory calculations to link $K$-$\bar K$ mixing to $B_d$-$\bar B_d$ mixing, which was essential to confirm the Kobayashi-Maskawa mechanism, and present the current status of theory predictions. Today, the focus of the field is on physics beyond the SM, because meson-antimeson mixing amplitudes are sensitive to virtual effects of heavy particles with masses which are several orders of magnitude above the reach of current particle colliders.</description>

      <title>Exploring Primordial Black Holes from the Multiverse with Optical Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.09160v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a viable candidate for dark matter if the PBH masses are in the currently unconstrained "sublunar" mass range. We revisit the possibility that PBHs were produced by nucleation of false vacuum bubbles during inflation. We show that this scenario can produce a population of PBHs that simultaneously accounts for all dark matter, explains the candidate event in Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) data, and contains both heavy black holes as observed by LIGO and very heavy seeds of supermassive black holes. We demonstrate with numerical studies that future observations of HSC, as well as other optical surveys, such as LSST, will be able to provide a definitive test for this generic PBH formation mechanism if it is the dominant source of dark matter.</description>

      <title>New Evidence for Extragalactic Einstein Probe Transients associated with Long Gamma-ray Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of extragalactic fast X-ray transients (EFXTs) remains a fundamental open question in high-energy astrophysics. The Einstein Probe (EP) mission provides a transformative opportunity to investigate their nature. While mounting observations of EP-discovered EFXTs (EP-EFXTs) suggest a possible connection to long gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs), an in-depth comparative analysis between them remains lacking. Here, we present a comparative analysis of their cosmic formation histories, revealing that EP-EFXTs and lGRBs share a similar evolutionary trend-showing a marked decline at $z&lt;1.0$ and a plateau beyond $1.0&lt;z&lt;5$-which clearly distinguishes them from short GRBs. This result is derived from a rigorously selected sample of EP-EFXTs, using Lynden-Bell's $c^{-}$ method to reconstruct, for the first time, the luminosity function and formation rate of EP-EFXTs without any assumptions. Our findings provide independent evidence that EP-EFXTs and lGRBs may originate from a common progenitor channel.</description>

      <title>Fractional Aharonov-Bohm effect for retarded potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that the magnetic Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted equally well as being due to a phase shift associated with an electron in an interferometer enclosing a magnetic flux, or as a phase shift associated with the electrons in the solenoid that generates the field. Here the Aharonov-Bohm effect is derived using second-quantized field theory to describe all the electrons as well as the electromagnetic field in a consistent way. The results are in agreement with the usual expression for the Aharonov-Bohm effect when the retardation of the electromagnetic field is negligible, but they predict the possibility of a fractional phase shift when retardation effects are significant.</description>

      <title>Quantum Integration Networks for Efficient Monte Carlo in High-Energy Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo methods play a central role in particle physics, where they are indispensable for simulating scattering processes, modeling detector responses, and performing multi-dimensional integrals. However, traditional Monte Carlo methods often suffer from slow convergence and insufficient precision, particularly for functions with singular features such as rapidly varying regions or narrow peaks. Quantum circuits provide a promising alternative: compared to conventional neural networks, they can achieve rich expressivity with fewer parameters, and the parameter-shift rule provides an exact analytic form for circuit gradients, ensuring precise optimization. Motivated by these advantages, we investigate how sampling strategies and loss functions affect integration efficiency within the \textbf{Quantum Integration Network} (QuInt-Net). We compare adaptive and non-adaptive sampling approaches and examine the impact of different loss functions on accuracy and convergence. Furthermore, we explore three quantum circuit architectures for numerical integration: the data re-uploading model, the quantum signal processing protocol, and deterministic quantum computation with one qubit. The results provide new insights into optimizing QuInt-Nets for applications in high energy physics.</description>

Abstract: We present a historiographical review of algorithms and computer codes developed for solving integration-by-parts relations for Feynman integrals. This procedure is one of the key steps in the evaluation of Feynman integrals, since it enables to express integrals belonging to a given family as linear combinations of master integrals. In this review, we restrict ourselves to considering general algorithms which can, in principle, be applied to any family of Feynman integrals.</description>

      <title>First galaxy ultraviolet luminosity function limits on dark matter-proton scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattering between dark matter (DM) and protons leads to suppressed small-scale fluctuations, with implications for a variety of cosmological observables. In this work, we search for evidence of DM-proton scattering with an interaction cross section $\sigma\!=\!\sigma_0 (\frac{v}{c})^n$ for $n=0,2$ and $4$, corresponding e.g. to velocity-independent contact interactions from heavy mediators, velocity-dependent pseudoscalar-mediated scattering, and higher-order dipole interactions, respectively, using high-redshift ($z \sim4-10$) ultraviolet galaxy luminosity functions (UVLFs) observed by Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We employ an adjusted implementation of GALLUMI combined with the modified Boltzmann solver CLASS DMeff that accounts for interacting DM, and incorporate UVLF data from both blank and lensed HST fields, alongside Planck CMB data and the Pantheon supernova catalog in a Bayesian analysis framework to set constraints on $\sigma_0$. Our results show that including lensed UVLF data, which probe fainter galaxies than the blank HST fields and thus smaller scales, leads to a substantial improvement in the constraints on $\sigma_0$ for $n&gt;0$, surpassing existing bounds from Milky-Way (MW) satellite abundance and CMB anisotropies. For $m_{\chi} = 1\,\rm MeV $, for example, we set the upper bounds at $8.3\times 10^{-26} \, \rm cm^2$ for $n=2$ and $1.2\times 10^{-22} \, \rm cm^2$ for $n=4$. For $n=0$, our bound is within an order of magnitude of those from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and MW satellites.</description>

      <title>A family of three maximally symmetric boost-invariant flows in relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I discuss the constructions of boost-invariant dissipative conformal hydrodynamic flows by elaborating on the geometric procedure by Gubser and Yarom, which starts from a static, maximally symmetric flow on dS$_3\times\mathbb{R}$. Three foliations of dS$_3$ preserve three-dimensional non-Abelian isometry groups, namely, the flat ISO(2)-invariant, the spherical (closed) SO(3)-invariant, and the hyperbolic (open) SO(2,1)-invariant slicings. I show that the fluids that preserve these symmetries, after they have been Weyl transformed to flat spacetime, give rise to three physically distinct and boost-invariant solutions of the relativistic dissipative Navier-Stokes equations: the well-known and widely studied Bjorken and Gubser flows, and a seemingly thus far unexplored solution that arises from the hyperbolic slicing of dS$_3$. The new solution combines the radial expansion characteristic of the Gubser flow with the late-proper-time applicability of Bjorken's solution, and features a finite, radially bounded droplet whose expanding edge resembles a free-streaming shockwave.</description>

      <title>Probing vorticity through femtoscopic correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In heavy-ion collisions, as the two nuclei pass through one another and create hot and dense matter, part of their initial angular momentum is transferred to the fireball, generating a nonzero average vorticity. Understanding heavy-ion collision dynamics and its influence on key observables, including those used to probe the initial state or assess thermodynamics of nuclear matter, requires understanding the magnitude of effects tied to vorticity. In this work, we use simulations of non-central Au+Au collisions at $E_{\rm{kin}}=1.23~A\rm{GeV}$ to show that the rotation of the system impacts the space-time picture of particle emission and, in particular, leaves imprints on proton-pion femtoscopic correlations. Next, we use coarse-graining of the simulation outputs to extract the collective velocity as a function of position and time, shedding light on the dynamical origin of this effect. Moreover, we demonstrate that the displacement between the proton and pion emission centers quantifies the strength of the rotation and propose it as a new signal of vorticity in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Electron-positron pair creation in a supercritical static asymmetric potential well</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electron-positron pair creation in a supercritical static asymmetric potential well, which is composed of a subcritical and a supercritical potential separated by a fixed distance, is investigated using computational quantum field theory. To explain the discrete peaks in the positron energy spectrum, an analytical formula for determining the positions of bound states in a subcritical asymmetric potential well is derived and extended to the supercritical asymmetric potential well in two ways. One of the two methods can not only predict the positions of bound states, but also offer the pair creation rate. This study also reveals that the subcritical potential height can optimize the energy spread of created electrons, providing a new way to produce high-energy electron beams with concentrated energy in experiments. Moreover, it is found that the pair creation rate in a supercritical asymmetric potential well, composed of a subcritical symmetric potential well and a supercritical Sauter potential, exceeds the sum of the pair creation rates produced by each potential individually. This finding suggests a potential method for enhancing pair yield.</description>

Abstract: We show that core-collapsed self-interacting dark matter halos of mass $\sim 10^6\,{M_\odot}$, originally simulated to explain the dense perturber of the GD-1 stellar stream, also reproduce the structural properties inferred for the dense perturber detected in the strong lensing system JVAS B1938+666 from radio observations. Furthermore, these halos are sufficiently compact and dense to gravitationally capture field stars in satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, providing a natural explanation for the origin of Fornax 6, a stellar cluster in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Our results demonstrate that observations of halos with similar masses but residing in different cosmic environments offer a powerful and complementary probe of self-interacting dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves has opened a new window into the Universe through gravitational-wave astronomy. However, high-frequency gravitational waves remain undetected. In this work, we propose that spin systems can be employed to detect gravitational waves in this unexplored frequency regime. We derive the spin's response to gravitational waves and identify three distinct effects: the well-known Gertsenshtein effect, a metric-induced interaction, and the gravitational spin Hall effect. We focus on nuclear spins and utilize nuclear magnetic resonance to enhance the gravitational response, leveraging the advantages of long coherence time, high polarization, and a small gyromagnetic ratio. The proposed experimental scheme is capable of probing gravitational waves in the kilohertz to gigahertz range, with projected sensitivities reaching $\sqrt{S_h}\approx10^{-20}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$.</description>

      <title>Resonant W and Z Boson Production in FSRQ Jets: Implications for Diffuse Neutrino Fluxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blazars, particularly Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), are well-known for their ability to accelerate a substantial population of electrons and positrons, as inferred from multiwavelength radiation observations. Therefore, these astrophysical objects are promising candidates for studying high-energy electron--positron interactions, such as the production of $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons. In this work, we explore the implications of electron--positron annihilation processes in the jet environments of FSRQs, focusing on the resonant production of electroweak bosons and their potential contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux. By modeling the electron distribution in the jet of the FSRQ 3C~279 during a flaring state, we calculate the reaction rates for $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons and estimate the resulting diffuse fluxes from the cosmological population of FSRQs.We incorporate the FSRQ luminosity function and its redshift evolution to account for the population distribution across cosmic time, finding that the differential flux contribution exhibits a pronounced peak at redshift $z \sim 1$. While the expected fluxes remain well below the detection thresholds of current neutrino observatories such as IceCube, KM3NeT, or Baikal-GVD, the expected flux from the $Z$ boson production could account for approximately $10^{-3}$ of the total diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux. These results provide a theoretical benchmark for the role of Standard Model electroweak processes in extreme astrophysical environments and emphasize the interplay between particle physics and astrophysics, illustrating that even rare high-energy interactions can leave a subtle but quantifiable imprint on the diffuse astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Detection of Axion Stars in Galactic Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a linear mode analysis of a uniformly distributed cloud of axion-like particles (ALPs) embedded in a magnetized intergalactic medium, in order to investigate the stability of axion stars under realistic astrophysical conditions. We find that when the frequency $\omega$ of transverse waves is much smaller than the collision frequency $\nu_c$ of the intergalactic plasma, the conversion of ALPs into photons occurs on timescales far longer than the age of the Universe, ensuring stability of the star. In the opposite regime, $\omega \gg \nu_c$, significant axion-to-photon conversion may occur if the condition $\tfrac{\beta^2}{m_a^2-\omega_p^2} &lt; 1$ is satisfied, where $\beta$ depends on the ALP--photon coupling and the magnetic field, $m_a$ is the ALP mass, and $\omega_p$ is the plasma frequency. We have calculated up to second order in perturbations to compute the effect of an ALP star. Since the calculated value of parameter $\beta ^2$ is extremely small in comparison with $\omega^2_p$, we argue that the direct detection of an axion star is highly unlikely in experiments like NCLE.
  However, since the calculated $\beta$ is extremely small compared to $\omega_p$, this requires an unrealistically fine-tuned coincidence between $m_a$ and $\omega_p$. As a consequence we argue that that detection of
  Our results therefore suggest that axion stars remain stable in typical intergalactic environments, though extreme magnetic fields (e.g.\ near magnetars) may lead to different outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crucial role of hydrodynamic instabilities in soliton field theory is revealed. We demonstrate that the essential of soliton formation mechanism is the sound mode instability induced by thermodynamic instability. This instability triggers phase separation, where new thermal phases are generated to produce solitons. These solitons can be regarded as a coexistence state composed of a matter phase and a vacuum phase, with an interface proving surface tension to maintain dynamical equilibrium. The phase separation mechanism naturally allows the existence of vacuum bubbles, characterized by a vacuum phase surrounded by a matter phase with negative pressure. Furthermore, we show that the soliton interface resemble a fluid membrane, whose interface pressure satisfies a Young-Laplace-type relation, resulting in the emergence of the membrane instability induced by surface tension. In the thin-wall limit, the dispersion relation is analytically derived. This instability triggers topological transition of the interface, splitting a cylindrical interface into multiple spheres with a smaller total surface area. Such results highlight the duality between solitons and fluids.</description>

Abstract: Recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, combined with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and DESY5 type Ia supernova (SN) data, indicate a significant deviation from $\Lambda$CDM, which seems to suggest that this deviation can be explained by an interaction between dark energy and dark matter. In this work, we perform a comprehensive analysis by utilizing the latest DESI DR2 BAO data in conjunction with CMB data from ACT, SPT, Planck, and WMAP, along with SN data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We consider four interacting dark energy (IDE) models with different forms of the interaction term $Q$. Our analysis indicates that CMB experiments other than Planck enhance the evidence for an interaction in the IDE models with $Q \propto \rho_{\rm de}$. In particular, when using the SPT+DESI+DESY5 data, the IDE model with $Q = \beta H_0 \rho_{\rm de}$ gives $\beta = -0.4170 \pm 0.1220$, with a deviation from zero reaching $3.4\sigma$ level. When replacing DESY5 with PantheonPlus, this deviation weakens to $2.1\sigma$ level, but remains relatively significant. Furthermore, the Bayes factors of the IDE model with $Q = \beta H_0 \rho_{\rm de}$ are positive in all cases, providing a moderate-to-strong preference over $\Lambda$CDM. Overall, our comprehensive analysis clearly suggests that the IDE models with $Q \propto \rho_{\rm de}$ (especially, $Q = \beta H_0 \rho_{\rm de}$) provide strong evidence supporting the existence of interaction and are more preferred by the current cosmological data.</description>

      <title>GraviGUT unification with revisited Pati-Salam model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a graviGUT unification scheme based on the simple orthogonal group $\mathrm{SO}(1,9 ,\mathbb{C})$ that resolves the chiral duplication of weak isospin in Pati--Salam models. In the conventional $SU(4)\times SU(2)_+\times SU(2)_-$ framework, the unobserved second chiral $SU(2)$ is typically removed by ad hoc high-energy scale breaking. Here we instead \emph{geometrize} it: one $SU(2)$ factor is identified with a chiral half of the Lorentz group, so it belongs to gravity rather than to an additional weak force. This identification becomes natural inside $\mathrm{SO}(1,9 ,\mathbb{C})$, where the algebra decomposes as $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)_{\mathbb{C}}\oplus\mathfrak{so}(6)_{\mathbb{C}}\oplus(\text{coset})$. We construct a parity-symmetric chiral action that, upon breaking \emph{dynamically} selects one chirality: the surviving Yang--Mills factor is identified with $SU(2)_+$, while the opposite chirality persists as the gravitational chiral connection. These lead to concrete phenomenological handles, including graviton and weak-boson vertices with the other fundamental forces in $SU(3)$ and $U(1)$ and parity-sensitive gravitational-wave signatures, that distinguish the $\mathrm{SO}(1,9,\mathbb{C})$ construction from both traditional Pati--Salam and larger, less economical unifications.</description>

      <title>Observation of ballistic plasma and memory in high-energy gauge theory dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories describe the fundamental forces of nature. However, high-energy dynamics, such as the formation of quark-gluon plasmas, is notoriously difficult to model with classical methods. Quantum simulation offers a promising alternative in this regime, yet experiments have mainly probed low energies. Here, we observe the formation of a ballistic plasma and long-time memory effects in high-energy gauge theory dynamics on a high-precision quantum simulator. Both observations are unexpected, as the initial state - fully filled with particle-antiparticle pairs - was thought to rapidly thermalize. Instead, we find correlations spreading ballistically to long distances and a memory of charge clusters. Our observations cannot be explained by many-body scars, but are captured by a new theory of plasma oscillations between electric field and current operators, persisting all the way to the continuum limit of the (1+1)D Schwinger model, of which we simulate a lattice version. Adapting techniques from quantum optics, we visualize plasma oscillations as rotations of Wigner distributions, leading to a novel set of predictions which we test in experiment and numerics. The new framework encompasses both our scenario and scars, which show up as coherent states of the plasma. The experimental surprises we observe in the high-energy dynamics of a simple gauge theory point to the potential of high-precision quantum simulations of gauge theories for general scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>The Magic Barrier before Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the time dependence of anti-flatness in the entanglement spectrum, a measure for non-stabilizerness and lower bound for non-local quantum magic, on a subsystem of a linear SU(2) plaquette chain during thermalization. Tracing the time evolution of a large number of initial states, we find that the anti-flatness exhibits a barrier-like maximum during the time period when the entanglement entropy of the subsystem grows rapidly from the initial value to the microcanonical entropy. The location of the peak is strongly correlated with the time when the entanglement exhibits the strongest growth. This behavior is found for generic highly excited initial computational basis states and persists for coupling constants across the ergodic regime, revealing a universal structure of the entanglement spectrum during thermalization. We conclude that quantitative simulations of thermalization for nonabelian gauge theories require quantum computing. We speculate that this property generalizes to other quantum chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Simple Gradient Flow Equation for the Bounce Solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:1907.02417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent work of Chigusa, Moroi, and Shoji, we propose a new simple gradient flow equation to derive the bounce solution which contributes to the decay of the false vacuum. Our discussion utilizes the discussion of Coleman, Glaser, and Martin and we solve a minimization problem of the kinetic energy while fixing the potential energy. The bounce solution is derived as a scale-transformed of the solution of this problem. We also show that the convergence of our method is robust against a choice of the initial configuration.</description>

Abstract: We present SimpleBounce, a C++ package for finding the bounce solution for the false vacuum decay. This package is based on a flow equation which is proposed by the author and solves Coleman-Glaser-Martin's reduced problem: the minimization problem of the kinetic energy while fixing the potential energy. The bounce configuration is obtained by a scale transformation of the solution of this problem. For models with 1--8 scalar field(s), the bounce action can be calculated with O(0.1) % accuracy in O(0.1) s. This package is available at https://github.com/rsato64/SimpleBounce.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Entanglement and Bell Inequality Violation in Top Anti-Top Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01672v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A top quark and an anti-top quark produced together at colliders have correlated spins. These spins constitute a quantum state that can exhibit entanglement and violate Bell's inequality. In realistic collider experiments, most analyses allow the axes, as well the Lorentz frame to vary event-by-event, thus introducing a dependence on the choice of event-dependent basis leading us to adopt "fictitious states," rather than genuine quantum states. The basis dependence of fictitious states allows for an optimization procedure, which makes the usage of fictitious states advantageous in measuring entanglement and Bell inequality violation. In this work, we show analytically that the basis which diagonalizes the spin-spin correlations is optimal for maximizing spin correlations, entanglement, and Bell inequality violation. We show that the optimal basis is approximately the same as the fixed beam basis (or the rotated beam basis) near the $t\bar t$ production threshold, while it approaches the helicity basis far above threshold. Using this basis, we present the sensitivity for entanglement and Bell inequality violation in $t\bar t$ events at the LHC and a future $e^+e^-$ collider. Since observing Bell inequality violation appears to be quite challenging experimentally, and requires a large dataset in collider experiments, choosing the optimal basis is crucially important to observe Bell inequality violation. Our method and general approach are equally applicable to other systems beyond $t \bar t$, including interactions beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Discovery Potential of Future Electron-Positron Colliders for a 95 GeV Scalar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16806v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Large Electron Positron collider observed an indication for a new Higgs boson with a mass around $95$\,GeV-$100$\,GeV in the process $e^+e^-\to Z^*\to ZS$ with $S\to b\bar b$. The interest in this excess re-emerged with the di-photon signature at $\approx$\,95\,GeV at the Large Hadron Collider. In fact, a combined global significance of $3.4\sigma$ is obtained once $WW$ and $\tau\tau$ signals are included in addition. In this article, we perform a feasibility study for discovering such a new scalar $S$ at future electron-positron colliders using the recoil-mass method applied to $e^{+} e^{-} \to ZS$ with $Z \rightarrow \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ and $S \to b \bar{b}$. For this, we employ a Deep Neural Network to enhance the separation between the Standard Model background and the signal, reducing the required integrated luminosity necessary for discovery by a factor of two to three. As a result, an $SU(2)_L$ singlet Higgs with a mass of $\approx$\,95\,GeV can be observed with more than 5$\sigma$ significance at a 250\,GeV centre-of-mass energy collider with $5~ {\rm ab}^{-1}$ integrated luminosity if it has a mixing angle of at least $0.1$ with the Standard Model Higgs, which means that a discovery can be achieved within the whole 95\% confidence-level region preferred by Large Electron Positron excess. Furthermore, including more decay channels such as $S\to \tau\tau$ and $Z\to e^+e^-$ further enhances the discovery potential of future $e^+e^-$ accelerators, like CEPC, CLIC, FCC-ee and ILC.</description>

      <title>A 95 GeV Higgs boson and spontaneous CP-violation at the finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ATLAS and CMS collaborations reported a diphoton excess in the invariant mass distribution around the 95.4 GeV with a local significance of $3.1\sigma$. Moreover, there is another $2.3\sigma$ local excess in the $b\bar{b}$ final state at LEP in the same mass region. A plausible solution is that the Higgs sector is extended to include an additional Higgs boson with a mass of $95.4$ GeV. We study a complex singlet scalar extension of the two-Higgs-doublet model in which the 95.4 GeV Higgs is from the mixing of three CP-even Higgs fields. In addition, the extended Higgs potential can achieve spontaneous CP-violation at the finite temperature and restore CP symmetry at the present temperature of the Universe. We find that the model can simultaneously explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, the diphoton and $b\bar{b}$ excesses around the 95.4 GeV while satisfying various relevant constraints including the experiments of collider and electric dipole moment.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning-based statistical search strategy for an axion model from flavor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning-based search strategy to explore new physics beyond the Standard Model. The reinforcement learning, which is one of machine learning methods, is a powerful approach to find model parameters with phenomenological constraints. As a concrete example, we focus on a minimal axion model with a global $U(1)$ flavor symmetry. Agents of the learning succeed in finding $U(1)$ charge assignments of quarks and leptons solving the flavor and cosmological puzzles in the Standard Model, and find more than 150 realistic solutions for the quark sector taking renormalization effects into account. For the solutions found by the reinforcement learning-based analysis, we discuss the sensitivity of future experiments for the detection of an axion which is a Nambu-Goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken $U(1)$. We also examine how fast the reinforcement learning-based searching method finds the best discrete parameters in comparison with conventional optimization methods. In conclusion, the efficient parameter search based on the reinforcement learning-based strategy enables us to perform a statistical analysis of the vast parameter space associated with the axion model from flavor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new symmetry-preserving framework for the physics of heavy-light mesons, whose key element is the effective incorporation of flavour-dependent contributions into the corresponding bound-state and quark gap equations. These terms originate from the fully-dressed quark-gluon vertices appearing in the kernels of these equations, and provide a natural distinction between ``light" and ``heavy" quarks. In this approach, only the classical form factor of the quark-gluon vertex is retained, and is evaluated in the so-called ``symmetric" configuration. The standard Slavnov-Taylor identity links this form factor to the quark wave-function, allowing for the continuous transition from light to heavy quarks through the mere variation of the current quark mass in the gap equation. The method is used to compute the masses and decay constants of specific pseudoscalars and vector heavy-light systems, showing good overall agreement with both experimental data and lattice simulations.</description>

Abstract: Composite Higgs models predict the existence of various bound states. Among these are spin-1 resonances. We investigate models containing $\text{SU(2)}_L\times \text{SU(2)}_R$ as part of the unbroken subgroup in the new strong sector. These models predict that there are two neutral and one charged spin-1 resonances mixing sizably with the SM vector bosons. As a consequence, these can be singly produced in Drell-Yan processes at the LHC. We explore their rich LHC phenomenology and show that there are still viable scenarios consistent with existing LHC data where the masses of these states can be as low as about 1.5 TeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04900v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two models of dark matter (DM) that can provide a natural explanation of the excess of $B^+\to K^+ +\,\text{invisible}$ events with respect to the Standard Model (SM) prediction for $B^+\to K^+ \nu\bar\nu$, which has been reported by the Belle II collaboration. Interactions between the dark and the visible sector are mediated by an axion-like particle (ALP) in one case, by the kinetic mixing between a dark photon and the SM photon in the second case. Both models encompass a light fermion singlet as the DM candidate and can account for the observed DM relic abundance through, respectively, the freeze-in and the freeze-out production mechanism, while simultaneously explaining the Belle II excess.</description>

Abstract: The arrival time of electromagnetic signals traveling in chiral cosmic media is investigated in the context of Maxwell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics. Considering the interstellar medium (ISM) as a cold, ionized, chiral plasma, we derive the time delay between two traveling signals, expressed in terms of a modified dispersion measure (DM) which receives additional contribution from the chiral parameters. Faraday rotation angle is also addressed in this chiral plasma scenario, yielding modified rotation measures (RM). Using DMs data from five pulsars, we establish constraints on the chiral parameter magnitude at the order of $10^{-23}$ -- $10^{-22}$ GeV. On the other hand, the Faraday rotation retrieved from RM measurements implied upper constraints as tight as $10^{-36}$ GeV.</description>

Abstract: Can a stationary stone radiate gravitational waves (GWs)? While the answer is typically "no" in flat spacetime, we get a "yes" in inflationary spacetime. In this work, we study the stationary-stone-produced GWs in inflation with a concrete model, where the role of stones is played by massive higher-spin particles. We study particles of spin-2 and higher produced by helical chemical potentials, and show that the induced GWs feature a scale-invariant and helicity-biased power spectrum in the slow-roll limit. Including slow-roll corrections leads to interesting backreactions from the higher-spin boson production, resulting in an intriguing scale-dependence of GWs at small scales. Given the existing observational and theoretical constraints, we identify viable parameter regions capable of generating visibly large GWs for future observations.</description>

      <title>Holographic phase transitions via thermally-assisted tunneling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the thermal bounce solution in holographic models that describes first-order phase transitions between the deconfined and confined phases in strongly-coupled gauge theories. This new, periodic Euclidean solution represents transitions that occur via thermally-assisted tunneling and interpolates between the $O(4)$-symmetric vacuum bubble at zero temperature and the high temperature $O(3)$-symmetric critical bubble associated with classical thermal fluctuations. The exact thermal bounce solution can be used to obtain the bounce action at low temperatures which allows for a more accurate determination of vacuum decay rates, significantly improving previous estimates in holographic models. In particular, provided the phase transition is sufficiently supercooled, new predictions are obtained for the gravitational wave signal strength for critical temperatures ranging from the TeV scale up to $10^{12}$ GeV, some of which are within reach of future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Dirac Scoto Inverse-Seesaw from $A_4$ Flavor Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Dirac scotogenic-like one loop radiative model where the stability of dark matter is intricately linked to the breaking of $A_4$ flavor symmetry. This breaking induces a $Z_2$ dark symmetry, stabilizing the dark matter candidate. The breaking of $A_4 \to Z_2$ leads to cutting the loop and facilitating a "scoto inverse-seesaw" mass mechanism responsible for neutrino mass generation. This elucidates the explicit explanation of two mass-squared differences, $\Delta m^2_{\rm{atm}}$ and $\Delta m^2_{\rm{sol}}$ observed in neutrino oscillations. Our model accounts for normal and inverted ordering of neutrino masses, revealing sharp correlations between $\sum m_i$ and $\langle m_{\beta} \rangle$. It also shows strong compatibility with current data in the $\delta_{CP}$-$\theta_{23}$ plane. Moreover, stringent constraints on scalar masses narrow down the viable dark matter mass regions, accommodating $SU(2)_L$ singlet and doublet scalar dark matter as well as fermionic dark matter. Additionally, our model presents a viable avenue for addressing lepton flavor violating decays while remaining consistent with current experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing dark matter with quantum scale symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of gauge-Yukawa theories with trans-Planckian asymptotic safety, quantum scale symmetry can prevent the appearance in the Lagrangian of couplings that would otherwise be allowed by the gauge symmetry. Such couplings correspond to irrelevant Gaussian fixed points of the renormalization group flow. Their absence in the theory implies that different sectors of the gauge-Yukawa theory are secluded from one another, in similar fashion to the effects of a global or a discrete symmetry. As an example, we impose the trans-Planckian scale symmetry on a model of Grand Unification based on the gauge group SU(6), showing that it leads to the emergence of several fermionic WIMP dark matter candidates whose coupling strengths are entirely predicted by the UV completion.</description>

      <title>95 GeV Higgs boson and nano-Hertz gravitational waves from domain walls in the N2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the diphoton and $b\bar{b}$ excesses at 95.4 GeV, as well as nano-Hertz gravitational waves originating from domain walls, within the framework of the next-to-two-Higgs-doublet model (N2HDM), which extends the two-Higgs-doublet model by introducing a real singlet scalar subject to a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry. The $Z_2$ symmetry is spontaneously broken by the non-zero vacuum expectation value of the singlet scalar, $v_s$, which leads to the formation of domain walls. We discuss two different scenarios: in scenario A, the 95.4 GeV Higgs boson predominantly originates from the singlet field, while in scenario B, it arises mainly from the CP-even components of the Higgs doublets. Taking into account relevant theoretical and experimental constraints, we find that scenario A can fully account for both the diphoton and $b\bar{b}$ excesses at 95.4 GeV within the $1\sigma$ range. Moreover, the peak amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum at a peak frequency of $10^{-9}$ Hz can reach $2 \times 10^{-12}$ for $v_s = 100$ TeV. Scenario B only marginally accounts for the diphoton and $b\bar{b}$ excesses at the $1\sigma$ level, but the peak amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum at the peak frequency of $10^{-9}$ Hz can reach $6\times 10^{-8}$ for $v_s=100$ TeV. The nano-Hertz gravitational wave signals predicted in both scenarios can be tested by the current and future pulsar timing array projects.</description>

      <title>Nature of the $P_c$ states from compositeness criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on a coupled-channel approach, we investigate the structures of four $P_c$ states through compositeness criteria. Toward a more precise description of the states, we have obtained refined fit results of the LHCb data on the $J/\psi p$ invariant mass distribution of the $\Lambda_b^0\to J/\psi p K^-$ decay. Allowing for the fact that each of the four $P_c$ states couples strongly to a nearby $S$-wave channel, three criteria on the compositeness/elementariness are adopted in this study: the pole-counting rule, the spectral density function, and the Gamow wave function. Compositeness information is extracted from the scattering amplitudes and the pole parameters (pole positions and residues), without any preconceived assumptions on the nature of the $P_c$ states, and without any dependence on the model parametrization. Consistently within the framework of all the three methods, it has been found that the $P_c(4312)\,1/2^-$ is mainly composed by $\bar{D}\Sigma_c$, $P_c(4380)\,3/2^-$ by $\bar{D}\Sigma_c^*$, while the $P_c(4440)\,1/2^-$ and $P_c(4457)\,3/2^-$ states both turn out as composite states of $\bar{D}^*\Sigma_c$. The upper limits of the values of their elementariness are estimated to be rather small. This paper provides an additional confirmation of the molecular interpretation for the $P_c$ states in the literature.</description>

      <title>Positivity bounds in scalar-QED EFT at one-loop level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the implication of positivity bounds on loop-generated dim-8 operator coefficients is a nontrivial task, as these bounds only strictly hold when all the contributions are included in the dispersion relation up to a certain loop order in the UV theory. As a step towards more realistic gauge theories such as the Standard Model, in this paper we study the positivity bounds in the Scalar QED Effective Field Theory (EFT) from the scalar-photon scattering ($\gamma\phi \to \gamma\phi$) and the photon-photon scattering ($\gamma\gamma \to \gamma\gamma$), derived from the dispersion relation of the full one-loop EFT amplitudes. Assuming the UV theory is weakly coupled and all heavy particles have spin $\leq1$, the leading dim-8 interaction for both amplitudes are generated at the one-loop level in the UV theory. Gauge invariance imposes strong constraints on the loop structures, while potential IR divergences also require careful treatments. Our findings reveal that, for $\gamma\phi \to \gamma\phi$, while the tree-level bound does not necessarily hold, the one-loop $\beta$-function of the corresponding coefficient always tends to restore the tree-level bound in the IR, unless its actual loop order in the UV theory is further suppressed. For $\gamma\gamma \to \gamma\gamma$, on the other hand, the tree-level positivity bound is still robust at the one-loop level in the UV theory. These findings are verified in two example UV models with a heavy scalar extension. Importantly, the bounds on the $\beta$-functions that we obtain should be considered as an accidental feature at one loop, rather than a fundamental property of the theory.</description>

      <title>QED-IR as Topological Quantum Theory of Dressed States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum electrodynamics in the infrared regime (QED-IR) using the adiabatic approximation and the framework of the functional Berry phase. In this approach, the physical state space is exact, nonperturbatively dressed, and endowed with a topological structure. Electrons do not exist as bare particles, but as topologically protected electron--photon clouds, defining a new kind of ``infrared quantum''. These clouds are weakly bound in energy (with a binding scale estimated at \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{IR}} \sim 0.5~\mathrm{meV}\)) and remain stable provided photon energies stay below this threshold. Crucially, the theory becomes exactly solvable in this regime due to the quantization of the functional Berry flux, which governs the infrared dynamics of the dressed states.
  When hard (high-energy) processes are involved, the topological protection of the dressed states is lifted, and the theory smoothly recovers conventional perturbative QED. In contrast, in the deep infrared, the electromagnetic interaction never fully vanishes, leading to observable effects. We argue that the energy required to dissolve the infrared electron--photon cloud in QED is of order \(\mathrm{meV}\), comparable to the thermal energy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), \(k_B T_{\mathrm{CMB}} \approx 2.3 \times 10^{-4}\,\mathrm{eV}\). However, the observed temperature anisotropies correspond to fluctuations near \(10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}\), far too small to destroy the cloud, though potentially capable of perturbing its topological phase structure. This suggests that CMB deviations could reflect residual topological imprints of the functional infrared dynamics. Finally, we propose that analogous cloud-like structures may manifest in other quantum systems governed by low-energy photon dynamics, such as atomic and molecular environments.</description>

      <title>QCD sum rule study of topped mesons within heavy quark effective theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent CMS observation of a near-threshold enhancement in top quark pair production, we investigate a novel class of hadronic systems containing a single top quark: the topped mesons ($t\bar{q}$, with $\bar q = \bar u, \bar d, \bar s$). In contrast to the extensively studied toponium ($t\bar{t}$) system, analyzed primarily within perturbative QCD, topped mesons offer a complementary nonperturbative probe of QCD dynamics in the heavy quark limit. These states are expected to exhibit longer lifetimes and narrower decay widths than toponium, as only a single top quark undergoes weak decay. We employ QCD sum rules within the framework of heavy quark effective theory to study the structure and mass spectrum of ground-state topped mesons. Our analysis predicts masses near 173.1 GeV, approximately 0.5-0.6 GeV above the top quark pole mass. Compared with singly topped baryons ($tqq$, with $q = u, d, s$) studied concurrently in [arXiv:2507.05895], topped mesons have a simpler quark composition and more favorable decay channels (a topped meson is anticipated to decay weakly into a $\Upsilon$ meson and a charmed meson), enhancing their potential for both theoretical analysis and experimental discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we model $\Upsilon(10753)$ as a $4S$-$3D$ bottomonium mixture and $\Upsilon(10860)$ as a $5S$-$4D$ mixture, and predict the properties of a new bottomonium state, $\Upsilon(10950)$, as the mixing partner of $\Upsilon(10860)$. The mixing angles are derived from dielectron decay widths and mass shifts of these bottomonia. We consider open-bottom meson loops in the decays of the $D$-wave bottomonium components, based on a nonrelativistic effective field theory power counting. We show that the $S$-$D$ mixing scheme is consistent with the experimental data of the decays of $\Upsilon(10860)$ into $\omega\chi_{bJ}$ ($J=0,1,2$) and $\Upsilon(10753)$ into $\omega\chi_{bJ}$ ($J=1,2$). Predictions for the dielectron widths and partial decay widths into $\chi_{bJ}\omega$ for $\Upsilon(10753)$ and $\Upsilon(10950)$ are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a {\em boomerang mechanism} for the explanation of the excess radio background detected by ARCADE. In an early stage, at a temperature $T \sim 100\,{\rm keV}$, a fraction of relic neutrinos is resonantly converted into dark neutrinos by mixing induced by a pre-existing lepton asymmetry. Dark neutrinos decay much later into a dark photon, mixed with photon, and a dark fermion, with a lifetime longer than the age of the Universe, as required by a solution to the excess radio background. This scenario circumvents the upper bound on the neutrino magnetic moment but still implies a testable lower bound.</description>

      <title>When backgrounds become signals: neutrino interactions in xenon-based dark matter detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct detection dark matter experiments have proven to be compelling probes for studying low-energy neutrino interactions with both nuclei and atomic electrons, offering complementary information to accelerator and reactor-based neutrino experiments. Recently, the XENONnT and PandaX-4T collaborations reported the first evidence of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering from $^8\mathrm{B}$ solar neutrinos. Thanks to their excellent background rejection capabilities and distinctive signal signatures, dual-phase time projection chambers are also sensitive to $pp$ solar neutrinos via their elastic scattering off atomic electrons in the target material. Although this signal is subdominant within the Standard Model, it becomes significantly enhanced in many beyond the Standard Model scenarios, offering a unique opportunity to probe new physics in the low-energy regime. While the precision of current neutrino measurements from dark matter detectors remains lower than that achieved by dedicated neutrino experiments, their sensitivity to the tau neutrino component of solar neutrinos helps complete the overall picture, especially when investigating flavor-dependent new physics effects.</description>

      <title>Ultra high energetic neutrinos in their rest frame: can their time of arrival be determined?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the light of the recent observation by the KM3NeT collaboration of an ultrahigh energetic neutrino, we analyse it in its rest frame, where shortly after creation of the neutrino a muon arrives and interacts. Since the neutrino is at rest we use (in this first analysis) a non relativistic Gaussian wave function, and consider its spread. Due to the finite size of the packet, the time of the interaction of the muon will have an uncertainty. This uncertainty is small in the neutrino rest frame, but boosted to our frame, increases 18 orders of magnitude, making it extremely large. This effectively prevents the possibility of the observation of bursts, or the correlation with other events. A similar analysis for less energetic neutrinos show that the uncertainty is smaller than the duration of the observed bursts.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Consequences of an Electroweak $\eta_{\rm w}$ Pseudo-Scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it has been suggested that the spectrum of physical states in the Standard Model may include an ultralight pseudo-scalar, denoted by $\eta_{\rm w}$, in analogy with the $\eta'$ state arising from the strong interactions. We find that typical expectations for the properties of $\eta_{\rm w}$ get challenged by astrophysical constraints on the couplings of ultralight bosons. Our strongest limit sets a lower bound of $\mathcal{O}({\rm 100~TeV})$ on the decay constant of the hypothesized pseudo-scalar. We also briefly discuss whether $\eta_{\rm w}$ could be a dark matter candidate, or the origin of dark energy, but conclude that those identifications appear unlikely. Given the important implications of a potentially overlooked $\eta_{\rm w}$ state for a more complete understanding of the electroweak interactions and a fundamental description of Nature, further theoretical and phenomenological investigations of this possibility and its associated physics are warranted.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the promising prospect of the $B_{c}(2S)$ meson at the coming HL-LHC experiments, the nonleptonic $B_{c}(2S)$ meson weak decays induced by both the $b$ and $c$ decays are investigated with the QCD factorization approach. It is found that branching ratios for the color- and CKM-favored $B_{c}(2S)$ ${\to}$ $B_{s}{\rho}$, $B_{s}{\pi}$ decays can reach up to ${\cal O}(10^{-9})$, which might be measurable. The $B_{c}(2S)$ decays into the final states containing one charmonium are highly suppressed by the CKM factors, and have significantly small branching ratios, ${\cal O}(10^{-12})$ and less, which might be outside the future measurement capability. This paper provides a ready reference for the future experimental study on the hadronic $B_{c}(2S)$ weak decays.</description>

      <title>The rare decays $h^0\rightarrow Z\gamma,V Z$ in the NB-LSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the Higgs rare decays $h^0\rightarrow Z\gamma,V Z$ within the next to minimum B-L supersymmetric model(NB-LSSM), where $V$ represents a vector meson $(\phi,J/\psi,\Upsilon(1S),\rho^0,\omega)$. Compared to the minimal supersymmetric standard model(MSSM), the NB-LSSM introduces three singlet Higgs superfields, which mix with the Higgs doublets and affect the lightest Higgs boson mass and the Higgs couplings. The loop-induced contributions resulting from the effective $h^0Z\gamma$ coupling can produce new physics(NP) contributions, thereby affecting the theoretical predictions of rare decays significantly through the new parameters such as $\kappa$, $\lambda$, $\lambda_2\cdot\cdot\cdot$. The results of this work can provide a reference for probing NP beyond standard model(SM).</description>

      <title>Loop functions of sunset diagrams in 2+1 space-time dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these notes the relativistic $n$-body phase-phase is calculated iteratively in $2+1$ space-time dimensions for all $n$. The obtained result shows a simple power-law behavior $\alpha_n (\mu-M)^{n-2}/\mu$ with a dependence only on the total mass $M=m_1+\dots + m_n$. As a consequence of this feature, the $(n-1)$-loop integrals $J_n(-q^2)$ associated to sunset diagrams with $n$ internal lines can be expressed through of elementary (arctangent and logarithmic) functions, modulo polynomial terms in $q^2$ with regularization-dependent coefficients. An outlook to the analogous situation in $4+1$ space-time dimensions is given by computing the $n$-body phase-phases for $n=2,3,4,5$ with their totally symmetric dependence on the involved masses. Moreover, a digression to $1+1$ space-time dimensions reveals that there the three-body phase-space is already proportional to a complete elliptic integral.</description>

      <title>An end-to-end generative diffusion model for heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We train a generative diffusion model (DM) to simulate ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions from end to end. The model takes initial entropy density profiles as input and produces two-dimensional final particle spectra, successfully reproducing integrated and differential observables. It also captures higher-order fluctuations and correlations. These findings suggest that the generative model has successfully learned the complex relationship between initial conditions and final particle spectra for various shear viscosities, as well as the fluctuations introduced during initial entropy production and hadronization stages, providing an efficient framework for resource-intensive physical goals. The code and trained model are available at https://huggingface.co/Jing-An/DiffHIC/tree/main.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an interesting study of Feynman integral reduction that does not employ integration-by-parts identities. Our approach proceeds by studying the equivalence relations of integral contours in the Feynman parameterization. We find that the integration contour can take a more general form than that given by the Cheng-Wu theorem. We apply this idea to one-loop integrals, and derive universal reduction formulas that can be used to efficiently reduce any one-loop integral. We expect that this approach can be useful in the reduction of multi-loop integrals as well.</description>

      <title>Impact of dineutrons on nuclear compositions of a core-collapse supernova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the nuclear compositions in the central region of a core-collapse supernova, assuming the existence of dineutrons ($^2n$) and tetraneutrons ($^4n$). At 100~ms after core bounce, ${}^2n$ and ${}^4n$ are more abundant than deuterons within radii of approximately 100 and 50~km, respectively. Compared to the model ignoring the existence of ${}^2n$ and ${}^4n$, the mass fraction of neutrons up to a radius of 100~km reduces, while the mass fractions of protons, deuterons, and $\rm{{}^4He}$ increase. Due to the uncertainties in the properties of $^2n$ and $^4n$, we investigate the influence of their binding energies on the nuclear composition. We find the binding energy of $^2n$ has only a modest effect on the overall composition, except for its own mass fraction, while that of $^4n$ has a negligible impact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After obtaining the flavor $D6$-brane gauge fields/their fluctuations in the type IIA dual of T&gt;T_c QCD-like theories at intermediate coupling (via the ${\cal M}$-theory uplift's ${\cal O}(R^4)$ corrections) in the absence/presence of a strong magnetic field, we compute the photoproduction spectral function and get a nice agreement with gauged supergravity backgrounds arXiv:2204.00024 [hep-th]. We demonstrate from the EoS that the holographic dual, in principle, could correspond to several $T&gt;T_c$ scenarios: anisotropic paramagnetic plasma transitioning via a smooth crossover to exotic matter as the universe cools, the stable wormhole, and a paramagnetic pressure/energy-anisotropic plasma. Given that $T&gt;T_c$ QGP is expected to be paramagnetic, see Bali et al '14, the third possibility appears to be the preferred one. We also show that it is not possible that the anisotropic plasma leads to the formation of a compact star. IR renormalization of the DBI action requires a boundary Log-det-Ricci-tensor counter term. {\it Noting (i) photoproduction spectral function determined from gauge field fluctuations receiving ${\cal O}(R^4)$-corrections, if complexified, include a non-analytic-complexified gauge-coupling dependence, and correspond to Contact 3-Structures; (ii) pressure/energy density, etc. determined from world-volume gauge fields and not ${\cal O}(R^4)$-corrected, if complexified, are analytic in the complexified gauge coupling, and correspond to Almost Contact 3-Structures (AC3S) both induced from the $G_2$ structure of a closed seven-fold, we conjecture (i) the lack of $N$-path connectedness in the parameter space associated with AC3S and C3S arXiv:2211.13186[hep-th] to be equivalent to that gauge field fluctuations can not be finite, and (zero-instanton sector) ${\cal O}(R^4)$ non-renormalized gauge fields produce ${\cal O}(R^4)$-corrected gauge fluctuation; (ii) C3S--UV--&gt; AC3S.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed comparison between three formalisms used in recent studies of $DD^*$ scattering, which aim to understand the properties of the doubly-charmed tetraquark, $T_{cc}^+(3875)$. These methods are the three-particle relativistic field theory (RFT) formalism, the two-body Lippmann-Schwinger (LS) equation with chiral effective field theory potentials, and the two-particle relativistic framework proposed by Baiao Raposo and Hansen (BRH approach). In a simplified single-channel setting, we derive the conditions under which the infinite-volume integral equations from the RFT and BRH approaches reduce to the LS form. We present numerical examples showing that differences between these methods can be largely removed by adjusting short-range couplings. We also address a number of technical issues in the RFT approach.</description>

      <title>Insights in $f(Q)$ cosmology: the relevance of the connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of the affine connection in $f(Q)$ gravity, a modified theory where gravity is governed by non-metricity within the symmetric teleparallel framework. Although the connection is constrained to be flat and torsionless, it is not uniquely determined by the metric, allowing for multiple physically distinct formulations. We analyze three such connections compatible with a homogeneous and isotropic universe to show that they yield markedly different cosmological dynamics, even under the same functional form of $f(Q)$. Using both analytical and numerical methods, including a Born-Infeld type model of $f(Q)$, we demonstrate that specific connections can resolve cosmological singularities like the Big Bang and Big Rip, replacing them with smooth de Sitter phases. Others retain singularities but with notable modifications in their behavior. These findings highlight the physical relevance of connection choice in $f(Q)$ gravity and its potential to address fundamental cosmological questions.</description>

      <title>On internal mechanical properties of Electroweak Magnetic Monopoles and their effects on stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By considering properties of the energy-momentum tensor of the electroweak magnetic monopole and its Born-Infeld extension, we attempt to make comments on the stability of these configurations. Specifically, we perform a study of the behaviour of the so-called internal force and pressure of these extended field-theoretic solitonic objects, which are derived from the energy-momentum tensor. Our method is slightly different from the so-called Laue's criterion for stability of nuclear matter, a local form of which had been proposed and applied in the earlier literature to the `t Hooft-Polyakov (HP) magnetic monopole, and found to be violated.By applying our method first to HP monopole, we also observe that, despite its topological stability, the total (finite) internal force (which has only radial components) is directed inwards, towards the centre of the monopole, which would imply instability. Thus this mechanical criterion for stability is arguably violated in the case of the HP monopole, as is the local version of Laue's criterion. The criterion is satisfied for the short-range part of the energy momentum tensor, in which the long-range part, due to the massless photon of the U(1) subgroup, is subtracted. Par contrast, the total internal force of the Cho-Maison (CM) electroweak monopole has both radial and angular components, which diverge at the origin, leading to rotational instabilities. Finally, by studying finite-energy extensions of the CM, either with non-minimal Higgs couplings with the hypercharge sector or hypercharge Born-Infeld type models, we find that the total force, integrated over space, is finite, but it has also angular components in the Born-Infeld case. The latter feature is interpreted as indicating that the Born-Infeld-CM monopole might be subject to rotations upon the action of perturbations, but it does not necessarily imply instabilities of the configuration.</description>

      <title>Chimera baryons and mesons on the lattice: a spectral density analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and test a spectral-density analysis method, based on the introduction of smeared energy kernels, to extract physical information from two-point correlation functions computed numerically in lattice field theory. We apply it to a $Sp(4)$ gauge theory and fermion matter fields transforming in distinct representations, with $N_{\rm f}=2$ Dirac fermions in the fundamental and $N_{\rm as}=3$ in the 2-index antisymmetric representation. The corresponding continuum theory provides the minimal candidate model for a composite Higgs boson with partial top compositeness. We consider a broad class of composite operators, that source flavored mesons and (chimera) baryons, for several finite choices of lattice bare parameters. For the chimera baryons, which include candidate top-quark partners, we provide the first measurements, obtained with dynamical fermions, of the ground state and the lowest excited state masses, in all channels of spin, isospin, and parity. We also measure matrix elements and overlap factors, that are important to realize viable models of partial top compositeness, by implementing an innovative way of extracting this information from the spectral densities. For the mesons, among which the pseudoscalars can be reinterpreted to provide an extension of the Higgs sector of the Standard Model of particle physics, our measurements of the renormalized matrix elements and decay constants are new results. We complement them with an update of existing measurements of the meson masses, obtained with higher statistics and improved analysis. The analysis software is made publicly available, and can be used in other lattice studies, including application to quantum chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from the collapse of density perturbations induced by primordial gravitational waves (PGWs). The PGWs' interpretation of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) corresponds to PBHs formation in the mass range $[10^{-12}-10^{-3}] M_{\odot}$. Importantly, our analysis shows that PGWs' interpretation of recent PTA data remains viable, as it does not lead to PBH overproduction. We derive the amplitude of PGWs by leveraging existing constraints on the PBH abundance across a wide mass range. Notably, these constrained amplitudes predict SGWB signals that would be detectable by future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Neural Posterior Estimation of Neutron Star Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework to constrain the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) from astrophysical observations of masses, radii and tidal deformabilities, using Neural posterior estimation (NPE) with Conditional Normalising Flows (CNF). To ensure that the model conforms with reality, physics-informed constraints are embedded directly into the training loss. This enables efficient, likelihood-free inference of full posterior distributions for key thermodynamic quantities-including pressure, squared speed of sound, and the trace anomaly-conditioned on observational data. Our models are trained on synthetic datasets generated from two agnostic EoS priors: polytropic parametrizations (PT) and gaussian process (GP) reconstructions. These datasets span various scenarios, including the presence or absence of tidal deformability information and observational noise. Across all settings, the method produces accurate and well-calibrated posteriors, with uncertainties reduced when tidal deformability constraints are included. Furthermore, we find that the behavior of normalized predictive dispersions is strongly correlated with the maximum central density inside NSs, suggesting that the model can indirectly infer this physically meaningful quantity. The approach generalizes well across EoS families and accurately reconstructs derivative quantities such as the polytropic index, demonstrating its robustness and potential for probing dense matter in NS cores.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed via their impact on non-local quantum correlations between entangled spin pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by General Relativity (GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedankenexperiment featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating their non-local correlations through spin observables associated to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging, our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through quantum non-locality.</description>

Abstract: Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), particularly when combined with DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data, have reported a scalar spectral index $n_s$ slightly higher than that inferred by {\it Planck}~2018, suggesting a mild tension with the predictions of standard inflationary attractor models. In this work, we revisit the quantum-corrected Higgs inflation scenario within the framework of a non-minimally coupled scalar field theory. Starting from the one-loop effective action, we incorporate radiative corrections through the anomalous scaling parameter ${\bf A_I}$ and derive analytic expressions for the inflationary observables $n_s$ and $r$ in the Einstein frame. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum corrections naturally shift $n_s$ toward higher values while keeping the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ suppressed. For ${\cal N} = 60$, the model predicts $n_s \simeq 0.9743$ and $r \simeq 5.4\times10^{-3}$, in excellent agreement with the latest ACT+DESI (P-ACT-LB) data and fully consistent with the \textit{Planck}~2018 limit $r &lt; 0.036$. The derived constraint $4.36\times10^{-10} &lt; \lambda/\xi^{2} &lt; 10.77\times10^{-10}$ confirms the robustness of the quantum-corrected Higgs framework and indicates that near-future CMB polarization experiments such as CORE, AliCPT, LiteBIRD, and CMB-S4 will be able to probe the predicted parameter space with high precision.</description>
