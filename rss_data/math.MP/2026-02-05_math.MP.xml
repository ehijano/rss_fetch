      <title>Kodaira-Spencer theory for Courant algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying Courant algebroids on dg ringed manifolds, we observe that the associated Roytenberg-Weinstein $L_\infty$ algebra admits a local structure reminiscent of a shifted contact structure. On a dg ringed manifold with an $n$-orientation, its symplectification produces a sheaf of $(2-n)$-shifted symplectic formal moduli problems, which we call the Courant contact model. This construction can be interpreted as a ($\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-graded) theory in the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism whenever $n$ is odd. After developing the procedure of reduction and extension of scalars, we show how twisted backgrounds in type I supergravity naturally lead to Courant algebroids over the Dolbeault complex. Specialising to the case of a Calabi-Yau fivefold, we show that the Courant contact model for that Courant algebroid is equivalent to a central extension of minimal type I BCOV theory. Inspired by this, we extend the conjecture of Costello and Li and place it within the setting of generalized geometry, conjecturing a description of the BV formulation of type I supergravity in general twisted backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Geometric realization of $W$-operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain integrable hierarchies appearing in random matrix theory, enumerative geometry, and conformal field theory are governed by Virasoro/$W$-algebra constraints and their $W$-representations.Motivated by the Gaussian Hermitian $\beta$-ensemble and recent studies of superintegrable partition function hierarchies, we build an explicit bridge from symmetric group class algebras to bosonic Fock spaces and further to geometry.
  On the algebraic side, we decompose the transposition class sum into cut and join channels and recover the classical cut-and-join operator on the ring of symmetric functions. On the geometric side, we use the Grojnowski-Nakajima Fock space identification to realize the ladder operator $E_1=[W_0,p_1]$ as the Hecke correspondence on $\mathrm{Hilb}_n(\mathbb C^2)$, and we interpret the cubic generator $W_0$ as a normal ordered triple incidence correspondence. We then explain how the $\beta$-deformed cubic generator $W_0^{(\beta)}$ arises from the Ward identities/Virasoro constraints of the Gaussian $\beta$-ensemble via a background charge parametrization, clarifying its conformal field theoretic meaning. Finally, using the Grojnowski-Nakajima Heisenberg-Fock isomorphism $\Phi_{\mathrm{Hilb}}:\Lambda\xrightarrow{\sim}\bigoplus_{n\ge0}H_T^*(\Hilb^n(\mathbb C^2))$, we transport the resulting commutator hierarchy to Hilbert schemes, where $E_1$ is realised by the Hecke correspondence (adding one point) and the diagonal correction terms are computed by equivariant localization from the $T$-weights of the tangent bundle $T\Hilb^n(\mathbb C^2)$ and the tautological bundle $\mathcal V$. This provides a geometric realization framework that unifies $\beta$-deformed integrable structures and offers new tools for studying quiver gauge theory partition functions.</description>

      <title>Zak phase and bulk-boundary correspondence in a generalized Dirac-Kronig-Penney model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of a generalized Dirac--Kronig--Penney model, a continuum one-dimensional model for a relativistic quantum chain. By tuning the coupling parameters this model can accommodate five Altland--Zirnbauer--Cartan symmetry classes, three of which (AIII, BDI and D) support non-trivial topological phases in dimension one. We characterize analytically the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian in terms of a spectral function, and numerically compute the Zak phase to probe the bulk topological content of the insulating phases. Our findings reveal that, while the Zak phase is quantized in classes AIII and BDI, it exhibits non-quantized values in class D, challenging its traditional role as a topological marker in continuum settings. We also discuss the bulk-boundary correspondence for a truncated version of the chain, analyzing how the emergence of edge states depends on both the truncation position and the boundary conditions. In classes AIII and BDI, we find that the Zak phase effectively detects edge states as a relative boundary topological index, although the correspondence is highly sensitive to the parameters characterizing the truncation.</description>

      <title>On the commutation of variation and differentiation in nonholonomic Systems: A Chetaev-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The derivation of the equations of motion for nonholonomic systems remains a central issue in analytical mechanics, primarily due to the tension between the d'Alembert-Lagrange differential principle and integral variational approaches. This study investigates the validity of the commutation relation between the variational operator and the time derivative, which is a geometric identity in holonomic manifolds but becomes problematic when dealing with velocity-dependent constraints. By analyzing the transposition rule, we define a formal relationship between the Chetaev variation and the total variation of the constraints. We show that the simultaneous requirement of kinematically admissible variations and the fulfillment of the Chetaev condition is generally incompatible with the standard commutation rule, unless a specific geometric condition - encoded through a skew-symmetric algebraic structure and the Lagrangian derivative of the constraints - is satisfied. Furthermore, this work extends the analysis to systems with multiple constraints introducing the concept of dynamic compensation. While Frobenius' Theorem provides a static criterion for integrability based on individual vector fields, our results suggest that dynamic consistency according to Chetaev's principle emerges as a collective phenomenon. We demonstrate that even when individual constraints are intrinsically non-integrable, their interactions can cancel out deviations from holonomy, maintaining global consistency. Notably, we show that for systems with high constraints this property is satisfied regardless of the constraints' form. These findings broaden the class of analyzable physical systems, suggesting that dynamic consistency is a resilient property that persists even in the absence of simple geometric integrability.</description>

      <title>The trouble with deautonomising higher order maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deautonomisation of birational maps that have the singularity confinement property, i.e. the construction of nonautonomous versions of such maps that preserve the singularity properties of the original, has proven crucial in our understanding of the mathematical properties behind the integrability of second order maps. For example, the deautonomisation procedure led directly to the development of a general theory of discrete Painlev\'e equations, and it seems highly likely it will play a crucial role in any future theory of higher dimensional Painlev\'e equations as well. Generally speaking however, higher order integrable mappings may have non-confined singularities and it is important to understand if, and how, deautonomisation should work for such mappings. In this paper we explore different deautonomisation scenarios on a series of carefully constructed higher order mappings, integrable as well as non-integrable, that possess non-confined singularities and we challenge some common assumptions regarding the co-dimensionality of the singular loci that might play a role in the deautonomisation process. Along the way we also propose a novel procedure to calculate the growth of the multiplicities of singularities that appear in so-called anticonfined singularity patterns, based on an ultradiscrete version of the mapping.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of pure bubble type II blow-up solutions to energy critical wave equation in the 3D radial case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider the focusing, energy-critical wave equation in 3D radial case. According to the soliton resolution conjecture, which has been verified in the radial case, any type II blow-up solution decomposes into a superposition of several decoupled grounds states, a free wave and a small error, as time tends to the blow-up time. We prove that there does not exist any pure bubble type II blow up solutions. In other words, the free wave part is never zero in the soliton resolution of type II blow-up solutions, regardless of the bubble number.</description>

      <title>On the pure traction problem of linear elasticity: a regularized formulation and its robust approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pure traction problem of elasticity appears frequently in engineering applications, and its complexity stems from the fact that its solution is unique only up to (infinitesimal) rigid body motions. When finite elements are employed to approximate this problem, one solution is typically singled out by applying carefully selected boundary conditions on the discrete model or by imposing global constraints on the deformation. However, neither of these strategies is both simple and computationally efficient. In this work, we propose a new approach to solving the pure traction problem that overcomes existing limitations. Our method builds on a regularized form of the problem whose solution is shown to be unique, converges to the original solution of minimal norm, and can be approximated with finite elements in a straightforward way, without additional degrees of freedom. Additionally, we analyze the situation in which the approximation of the solution domain renders the loading of the discretized problem non-equilibrated, making the problem ill-posed. In this case, we propose a regularized predictor--corrector finite element formulation that handles the incompatibilities of the loading, providing a solution that converges to that of the original Neumann problem as the mesh size and the regularizing parameter tend to zero. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for representative problems in mechanics where pure traction boundary conditions appear.</description>

      <title>On the local nature of the de Almeida-Thouless line for mixed \(p\)-spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jagannath and Tobasco~\cite{JagTob} proposed a generalized de Almeida-Thouless (AT) criterion aimed at characterizing the replica symmetric (RS) regime for a broad class of mixed \(p\)-spin glass models with Ising spins. In this paper, we show that this generalized AT condition does not characterize the RS regime in general. Using the Hopf-Lax representation of the Parisi formula, we construct explicit counterexamples within the class of mixed \(p\)-spin models. In particular, we exhibit a model in which the classical AT perturbation is performed around the unique minimizer of the RS free energy, and prove that even in this setting, the AT criterion fails to characterize the RS phase. By contrast, the validity of the classical AT condition for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model remains open.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Boltzmann equation from hard-sphere dynamics (after Y. Deng, Z. Hani, and X. Ma)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a microscopic system of $N$ hard spheres that are initially independent (modulo the exclusion condition on particle positions) and identically distributed in $\mathbb{R}^3$. When the number $N$ of particles goes to infinity and the diameter $\varepsilon$ of the particles goes to zero, and under the weak density assumption $N\varepsilon^2=1$, it has been known since the work of Lanford that the empirical measure for the particles converges to the solution of the Boltzmann equation in a short time interval. In particular, the particles remain dynamically independent, in this limit and in the short time interval where the correlations induced by their collisions remain under control. In a recent work, Y. Deng, Z. Hani and X. Ma successfully obtained the same convergence result in arbitrary large time; more precisely, the convergence result holds for any time interval on which the Boltzmann equation has a regular solution. In this note, we explain a few elements of their proof.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of stochastic primitive equations with relaxed hydrostatic assumption as a higher order approximation of 3D stochastic Navier-Stokes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence of solutions of a stochastic representation of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations to those of their primitive equations counterpart. Our analysis covers both weak and strong convergence regimes, corresponding respectively to rigid-lid and "fully periodic" boundary conditions. Furthermore, we explore the impact of relaxing the hydrostatic assumption in the stochastic primitive equations by retaining martingale terms as deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium. This modified model, obtained through a specific asymptotic scaling accessible only within the stochastic framework, captures non-hydrostatic effects while remaining within the primitive equations formalism. The resulting generalized hydrostatic model has been shown to be well-posed when the additional terms are regularized using a suitable filter for divergence-free noises under suitable assumptions. Within this setting, we demonstrate that the model provides a higher-order approximation of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations for appropriately scaled noises.</description>

      <title>Painleve solitons of AKNS system and irrational algebraic solitons of NLS equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel symmetry decomposition approach is introduced to derive the so-called ``Painleve solitons'' of the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) system. These Painleve solitons propagate against a background governed by a Painleve transcendent, establishing a fundamental generalization of the well-known elliptic solitons concept. We demonstrate that while elliptic solitons arise from the combination of translation invariance and square eigenfunction symmetry, a different symmetry combination-scaling invariance, Galilean invariance, and square eigenfunction symmetry-generates ``Painleve IV solitons'' for the AKNS system. This discovery represents a significant theoretical advance in integrable systems theory. By selecting special solutions of the Painleve IV equation, we obtain explicit forms of several previously unknown classes of solutions for the AKNS system and the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation: irrational algebraic solitons, rational algebraic solitons, and parabolic cylindrical function solitons. These results dramatically expand the known solution landscape of one of the most important integrable models in mathematical physics, with broad implications for nonlinear wave phenomena across multiple physical disciplines including optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, and fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>A General Discussion on Photon Spheres in Different Categories of Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon spheres have attracted considerable interest in the studies of black holes and other astrophysical objects. For different categories of spacetimes (or gravitational sources), the existence of photon spheres and their distributions are dramatically influenced by the geometric and topological properties of spacetimes and characteristics of the corresponding gravitational fields. In this work, we carry out a geometric analysis on photon spheres for different categories of spacetime (including black hole spacetime, ultra-compact object's spacetime, regular spacetime, and naked singularity spacetime). Some universal properties and conclusions are obtained for these spacetimes. We mostly focus on the existence of photon spheres, the total number of photon spheres $n = n_{\text{stable}} + n_{\text{unstable}}$, the subtraction of stable photon sphere and unstable photon sphere $w = n_{\text{stable}} - n_{\text{unstable}}$ in different categories of spacetimes. These conclusions are derived solely from geometric properties of optical geometry of spacetimes, irrelevant to the specific spacetime metric forms. Besides, our results successfully recover some important theorems on photon spheres proposed in recent years.</description>

      <title>The Most Dispersed Subset of Random Points in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a population of $N$ individuals, each having $d\geq 1$ different traits, and an additive measure, called dispersion, which rewards large pairwise separations between traits. The goal is to select $M\leq N$ individuals such that their traits are as dispersed as possible. We compute analytically the full statistics (including large deviation tails) of the maximally achievable dispersion among sub-populations of size $M$ when the traits are independent and identically distributed. Two complementary approaches are developed, one based on a mean-field theory for order statistics, and the other on the replica method from the field of disordered systems. In all dimensions $d$, and for rotationally symmetric distributions, the optimal subset for large populations consists of all points lying outside a $d$-dimensional ball whose radius is determined self-consistently. For a single trait ($d=1$), the statistics of the maximal dispersion can be tackled for finite $N,M$ as well. The formulae we obtained are corroborated by numerical simulations on small instances and by heuristic algorithms that find near-optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>An equivalence of moment closure and nonlinear variational approximation of the Fokker-Planck equation for dilute polymeric flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish rigorously the equivalence between classical moment closure and a nonlinear variational approximation of the Fokker-Planck equation for dilute polymeric flow in the linearized Hookean spring chain setting. The variational formulation is based on the Dirac-Frankel principle applied to a Gaussian approximation manifold endowed with the Fisher-Rao information metric. We show that the invariance of this manifold under the linear configurational dynamics yields an exact evolution for the macroscopic conformation tensor, recovering the classical diffusive Oldroyd-B closure. While the equivalence only holds in the linearized setting, the associated variational framework provides an abstract error representation and a starting point for the systematic construction of reduced approximation schemes for polymeric flows with nonlinear forcing laws.</description>

      <title>A Darboux classification of homogeneous Pfaffian forms on graded manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local classification problem for differential Pfaffian forms on a supermanifold $M$ that are homogeneous with respect to a given homogeneity structure on $M$. The best-known homogeneity structures are those associated with linearity on a vector bundle. The aim is to show that, for a homogeneous form of given degree, there are `Darboux coordinates' which are homogeneous. As a consequence, we obtain Darboux-type normal pictures for homogeneous forms, recovering the classical Darboux theorems, as well as their contact and presymplectic counterparts as special cases.
  To obtain an analog of Darboux's classification in the supergeometric context, we define a class of a differential form $\alpha$ by the rank of the characteristic distribution $\chi(\alpha)$, being the intersection of kernels of $\alpha$ and $d\alpha$. We show that, under suitable regularity and constant-rank assumptions, this distribution completely controls the local equivalence problem for homogeneous Pfaffian forms. Our results hold as well for ordinary (purely even) manifolds.</description>

      <title>Brownian paths as loop-decorated SLEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an application, which takes as input a simple path and a possibly infinite collection of loops, and outputs a continuous path by adding the loops chronologically to the simple path as the simple path encounters them. By studying the regularity properties of this application and using lattice discretisations, we prove that chronologically adding the loops from a Brownian loop soup encountered by an independent radial SLE$_2$ path produces a continuous path which has the law of a planar Brownian motion. This resolves a conjecture of Lawler and Werner.
  This construction produces a coupling between SLE$_2$ and Brownian motion, and we further show that this joint law is the scaling limit of the loop-erased random walk and the random walk itself. The arguments are robust and can be applied for instance in the off-critical setup, where the scaling limit of loop-erased random walk is Makarov and Smirnov's massive SLE$_2$.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Ultracontractivity for a class of Schroedinger Semigroups in $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ by Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first part of this article we present a growth condition on the potential $q$ in the Schr\"odinger operator $H=-\Delta + q(x)$ in $\mathrm{L}^{2}\left( \mathbb{R}^{n} \right)$ that implies Rosen inequalities for the ground state $\varphi$ of $H$, i.e.
  $\forall \varepsilon &gt; 0 \exists \gamma(\varepsilon) &gt; 0 \ : \ - \ln\left( \varphi(x) \right) \leq \varepsilon q(x) + \gamma(\varepsilon)$.
  While these inequalities are not particularly interesting in themselves, they offer Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities which are absolutely essential to prove an intrinsic ultracontractivity of the associated Schr\"odinger semigroup $\mathrm{e}^{-tH}$, i.e.
  $\forall t&gt;0 \exists C_{t} &gt; 0 \ : \ \left| \mathrm{e}^{-tH} u (x) \right| \ \leq \ C_{t} \varphi(x) \| u \|_{2}$
  holds for every $u \in \mathrm{L}^{2}\left( \mathbb{R}^{n} \right)$ almost everywhere in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ which we prove in the second part of this article. For proving Rosen inequalities we focus on solving a radial Schr\"odinger inequality and use Agmon's version of the comparison principle and Young's inequality for increasing functions. We follow the classic method proving intrinsic ultracontractivity of $\mathrm{e}^{-tH}$ by using weighted Sobolev function spaces, weighted Schr\"odinger semigroups and Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities.</description>

      <title>Translating auxiliary symmetries between Schottky uniformization and Jacobi parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explicit description and computation of functions defined on Riemann surfaces of various genera depends on the choice of language: while the Jacobi parametrization is widely known and used, the Schottky uniformization has been proven to provide an alternative approach, useful in particular for (but not limited to) numerical calculations. Despite capturing the geometry of the Riemann surface completely, the two languages are subject to rather different sets of auxiliary symmetries. In this article we translate and compare the symplectic transformations inherent in the Jacobi parametrization to the freedom in choosing M\"obius transformations generating the Schottky group for the Schottky uniformization. Our results are aimed at transferring functional relations expressed in the Schottky language to the Jacobi language and vice versa. An immediate application would be the efficient numerical evaluation of special functions in a physics context by favorably tuning the Schottky cover leading to quicker convergence.</description>

Abstract: We present a class of potentials $q \colon \mathbb{R}^{n} \to (0,\infty)$ that implies the weighted Schr\"odinger semigroup $\varphi^{-1}\mathrm{e}^{-tH}\varphi$ to map a weighted Lebesgue function space $\mathrm{L}_{\mu}^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ into a weighted Lebesgue function space $\mathrm{L}_{\mu}^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ continously at every time $t&gt;0$ by Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for $H=-\Delta + q(x)$ with it's strictly positive ground state $\varphi \colon \mathbb{R}^{n} \to (0,\infty)$. We use the self-adjointness of $\mathrm{e}^{-tH}$ in $\mathrm{L}^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ to infer an intrinsic ultracontractivity, i.e.
  $\forall t&gt;0 \ \exists C_{t} &gt; 0 \ : \ \left| \mathrm{e}^{-tH} u (x) \right| \ \leq \ C_{t} \varphi(x) \| u \|_{2}$

      <title>Generalized quantum theory for accessing nonlinear systems: the case of Levinson-Smith equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a recently developed generalized scheme of quantum mechanics, we touch upon connections with Levinson-Smith classes of nonlinear systems that contain as a particular case the Li\'{e}nard family of differential equations. The latter, which has coefficients of odd and odd symmetry, admits a closed form solution when converted to the Abel form. Analysis of the governing condition shows that one of the nontrivial equilibrium points is stable in character. Other classes of differential equations that we encounter speak of solutions involving Jacobi elliptic functions for a certain combination of underlying parameters, while, for a different set, relevance to position-dependent mass systems is shown. In addition, an interesting off-shoot of our results is the emergence of solitonic-like solutions from the condition of the level surface in the system.</description>

      <title>Real and momentum space analysis of topological phases in 2D d-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism has recently emerged as a third fundamental branch of magnetism, combining the vanishing net magnetization of antiferromagnets with the high-momentum-dependent spin splitting of ferromagnets. This study provides a comprehensive real- and momentum-space analysis of topological phases in two-dimensional d-wave altermagnets. By employing a tight-binding Hamiltonian, we characterize the topological phase transition occurring at a critical intra-sublattice hopping strength ($t_a^C$). We examine the emergence of Dirac nodal points and the resulting Berry curvature singularities, supported by a visual analysis of pseudospin texture winding. Crucially, we analize spin splitting, effective altermagnetic strength, and investigate the transport implications of these phases, uncovering giant conductivity anisotropy and spin-dependent "steering" effects driven by group velocity distribution across the Fermi surface. Beyond bulk properties, we analyze the edge state topology in ribbon geometries through the lens of information-theoretic markers like fidelity-susceptibility and inverse participation ratio, offering an alternative to traditional Chern number calculations. Our results demonstrate that the hybridization of edge states in ultra-narrow nanoribbons opens a controllable energy gap, a feature we exploit to propose a novel topological altermagnetic field-effect transistor design where ballistic and spatially spin-polarized transport can be electrostatically gated. This work establishes a theoretical and information-theoretic framework for "edgetronics" in altermagnetic materials, paving the way for next-generation, high-speed spintronic and "spin-splitter" logic devices and architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precontact manifolds extend contact geometry by weakening the maximal non-integrability condition of the defining $1$-form. We clarify the geometric foundations of this structure by studying general pairs of a $1$-form and a $2$-form under mild regularity conditions. We characterize them through their class, analyse the role of distinguished vector fields, such as Reeb or Liouville fields, and study other associated geometrical objects. Precontact structures are then treated as the special case of pairs formed by a nowhere-vanishing $1$-form and its exterior derivative. We also define Hamiltonian dynamics on precontact manifolds. Several examples are presented to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the dynamics of the logistic map based on a probabilistic characterization in terms of the invariant density. We analyze the relevant regimes of the dynamics (regular, oscillatory, onset chaotic and fully chaotic) in terms of the Fisher information and the Cr\'amer-Rao (CR) complexity. We have found that these informational quantifiers allow to distinguish the dynamical regions of the map, by maximizing the Fisher information in the regular behavior and with the CR complexity exhibiting variations and a maximum near to the Pameau-Maneville scenario. Fisher information as a function of time is examined in the light of Frieden's informational interpretation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. We apply the Equipartition Theorem to propose a definition of temperature for the logistic map, providing a macroscopic signature of the dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Within the synthetic-geometric framework of Lorentzian (pre-)length spaces developed in Kunzinger and S\"amann (Ann. Glob. Anal. Geom. 54(3):399--447, 2018) we introduce a notion of a hyperbolic angle, an angle between timelike curves and related concepts like timelike tangent cone and exponential map. This provides valuable technical tools for the further development of the theory and paves the way for the main result of the article, which is the characterization of timelike curvature bounds (defined via triangle comparison) with an angle monotonicity condition. Further, we improve on a geodesic non-branching result for spaces with timelike curvature bounded below.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the linear spectral problem, which associated with the (n+1)-dimensional generalized Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (gKP) equation, with the Jacobi elliptic function as the external potential is investigated based on the Lam\'{e} function, from which some novel local nonlinear wave solutions on the Jacobi elliptic function have been obtained by Darboux transformation, and the corresponding dynamics have also been discussed. The degenerate solutions of the nonlinear wave solutions on the Jacobi function background for the gKP equation are constructed by taking the modulus of the Jacobi function to be 0 and 1. The findings indicate that there can be various types of nonlinear wave solutions with different ranges of spectral parameters, including soliton and breather waves. Furthermore, the interplay between nonlinearity and dispersion is found to have observable effects on the propagation dynamics of breather waves. These results will be useful for elucidating and predicting nonlinear phenomena in related physical fields, such as fluid mechanics and physical ocean.</description>

      <title>Percolation of thick points of the log-correlated Gaussian field in high dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the set of thick points of the log-correlated Gaussian field contains an unbounded path in sufficiently high dimensions. This contrasts with the two-dimensional case, where Aru, Papon, and Powell (2023) showed that the set of thick points is totally disconnected. This result has an interesting implication for the exponential metric of the log-correlated Gaussian field: in sufficiently high dimensions, when the parameter $\xi$ is large, the set-to-set distance exponent (if it exists) is negative. This suggests that a new phase may emerge for the exponential metric, which does not appear in two dimensions. In addition, we establish similar results for the set of thick points of the branching random walk. As an intermediate result, we also prove that the critical probability for fractal percolation converges to 0 as $d \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>LDPC stabilizer codes as gapped quantum phases: stability under graph-local perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the proof of stability of topological order, due to Bravyi, Hastings and Michalakis, to stabilizer Hamiltonians corresponding to low-density parity check (LDPC) codes without the restriction of geometric locality in Euclidean space. We consider Hamiltonians $H_0$ defined by $[[N,K,d]]$ LDPC codes which obey certain topological quantum order conditions: (i) code distance $d \geq c \log(N)$, implying local indistinguishability of ground states, and (ii) a mild condition on local and global compatibility of ground states; these include good quantum LDPC codes, and the toric code on a hyperbolic lattice, among others. We consider stability under weak perturbations that are quasi-local on the interaction graph defined by $H_0$, and which can be represented as sums of bounded-norm terms. As long as the local perturbation strength is smaller than a finite constant, we show that the perturbed Hamiltonian has well-defined spectral bands originating from the $O(1)$ smallest eigenvalues of $H_0$. The band originating from the smallest eigenvalue has $2^K$ states, is separated from the rest of the spectrum by a finite energy gap, and has exponentially narrow bandwidth $\delta = C N e^{-\Theta(d)}$, which is tighter than the best known bounds even in the Euclidean case. We also obtain that the new ground state subspace is related to the initial code subspace by a quasi-local unitary, allowing one to relate their physical properties. Our proof uses an iterative procedure that performs successive rotations to eliminate non-frustration-free terms in the Hamiltonian. Our results extend to quantum Hamiltonians built from classical LDPC codes, which give rise to stable symmetry-breaking phases. These results show that LDPC codes very generally define stable gapped quantum phases, even in the non-Euclidean setting, initiating a systematic study of such phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Group-Adapted Irreducible Matrix Units for the Walled Brauer Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the representation theory of the algebra of partially transposed permutation operators, $\mathcal{A}^d_{p,p}$, which provides a matrix representation for the abstract walled Brauer algebra. This algebra has recently gained significant attention due to its relevance in quantum information theory, particularly in the efficient quantum circuit implementation of the mixed Schur-Weyl transform. In contrast to previous Gelfand-Tsetlin type approaches, our main technical contribution is the explicit construction of irreducible matrix units in the second-highest ideal that are group-adapted to the action of $\mathbb{C}[S_p]\times \mathbb{C}[S_p]$ subalgebra, where $S_p$ is the symmetric group. This approach suggests a recursive method for constructing irreducible matrix units in the remaining ideals of the algebra. The framework is general and applies to systems with arbitrary numbers of components and local dimensions. In addition, we present a complementary construction method based on tensor networks of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the unitary group. This approach enables the construction of all group-adapted irreducible matrix units, but requires knowledge of certain Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. This method can be successfully applied for a reasonably small number of particles with the support of dedicated software. The obtained results are applied to a special class of operators motivated by the mathematical formalism appearing in all variants of the port-based teleportation protocols through the mixed Schur-Weyl duality. We demonstrate that the given irreducible matrix units are, in fact, eigenoperators for the considered class.</description>

      <title>$p$-adic symplectic geometry of integrable systems and Weierstrass-Williamson theory I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local symplectic theory of integrable systems is fundamental to understand their global theory, as well as the behavior near singularities of fundamental models from classical and quantum mechanics which are known to be integrable, such as the Jaynes-Cummings model and the coupled angular momenta. We establish the foundations of the local symplectic geometry of $p$-adic integrable systems on $4$-dimensional $p$-adic analytic symplectic manifolds, by classifiying all their possible local models. In order to do this we develop a new approach, of independent interest, to the theory of Weierstrass and Williamson concerning the diagonalization of real matrices by real symplectic matrices. We show that this approach can be generalized to $p$-adic matrices, leading to a classification of real $(2n)$-by-$(2n)$ matrices and of $p$-adic $2$-by-$2$ and $4$-by-$4$ matrix normal forms, including, up to dimension $4$, the classification in the degenerate case, for which the literature is limited even in the real case. A combination of these results and the Hardy-Ramanujan formula shows that both the number of $p$-adic matrix normal forms and the number of local models of $p$-adic integrable systems grow almost exponentially with their dimensions, in strong contrast with the real case. These results fit in a program, proposed a decade ago by Voevodsky, Warren and the second author, to develop a $p$-adic theory of integrable systems with the goal of later implementing it using proof assistants. In the present paper we shall prove all of the statements concerning integrable systems; their proofs rely on the $p$-adic analog of the Weierstrass and Williamson theory of matrices. The proofs concerning this new $p$-adic theory of matrices are of an algebraic and arithmetical nature, and we give them in the sequel paper, part II.</description>

      <title>Trotter error and gate complexity of the SYK and sparse SYK models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model is a prominent model of strongly interacting fermions that serves as a toy model of quantum gravity and black hole physics. In this work, we study the Trotter error and gate complexity of the quantum simulation of the SYK model using Lie--Trotter--Suzuki formulas. Building on recent results by Chen and Brand\~{a}o (arXiv:2111.05324), we derive bounds on the first- and higher-order Trotter error of the SYK model, and subsequently find near-optimal gate complexities for simulating these models. For the $k$-local SYK model on $n$ Majorana fermions, at time $t$, our gate complexity estimates for the first-order Lie--Trotter--Suzuki formula scales with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{k+\frac{5}{2}}t^2)$ for even $k$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{k+3}t^2)$ for odd $k$, and the gate complexity of simulations using higher-order formulas scales with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{k+\frac{1}{2}}t)$ for even $k$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{k+1}t)$ for odd $k$. Given that the SYK model has $\Theta(n^k)$ terms, these estimates are close to optimal. These gate complexities can be further improved upon in the context of simulating the time evolution of an arbitrary fixed input state $|\psi\rangle$, leading to a $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$-reduction in gate complexity for first-order and $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$-reduction for higher-order formulas. Regarding the sparse SYK model, which is a simplified variant of the SYK model obtained by deleting all but a $\Theta(n)$ fraction of the terms in a uniformly i.i.d. manner, our average gate complexity estimates for higher-order formulas scale as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{1+\frac{1}{2}} t)$ for even $k$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{2} t)$ for odd $k$. Similar to the full SYK model, we obtain a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$-reduction simulating the time evolution of an arbitrary fixed input state $|\psi\rangle$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate the BCOV theory of deformations of complex structures as a pull-back to the super moduli space of the worldline of a spinning particle. In this approach the appearance of a non-local kinetic term in the target space action has the same origin as the mismatch of pictures in the Ramond sector of super string field theory and is resolved by the same type of auxiliary fields in shifted pictures. The BV-extension is manifest in this description. A compensator for the holomorphic 3-form can be included by resorting to a description in the large Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Disordered harmonic chain with random masses and springs: a combinatorial approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study harmonic chains with i.i.d. random spring constants $K_n$ and i.i.d. random masses $m_n$. We introduce a new combinatorial approach which allows to derive a compact approximate expression for the complex Lyapunov exponent, in terms of the solutions of two transcendental equations involving the distributions of the spring constants and the masses. Our result makes easy the asymptotic analysis of the low frequency properties of the eigenmodes (spectral density and localization) for arbitrary disorder distribution, as well as their high frequency properties. We apply the method to the case of power-law distributions $p(K)=\mu\,K^{-1+\mu}$ with $0&lt;K&lt;1$ and $q(m)=\nu\,m^{-1-\nu}$ with $m&gt;1$ (with $\mu,\:\nu&gt;0$). At low frequency, the spectral density presents the power law $\varrho(\omega\to0)\sim\omega^{2\eta-1}$, where the exponent $\eta$ exhibits first order phase transitions on the line $\mu=1$ and on the line $\nu=1$. The exponent of the non disordered chain ($\eta=1/2$) is recovered when $\langle K_n^{-1}\rangle$ and $\langle m_n\rangle$ are both finite, i.e. $\mu&gt;1$ and $\nu&gt;1$. The Lyapunov exponent (inverse localization length) shows also a power-law behaviour $\gamma(\omega^2\to0)\sim\omega^{2\zeta}$, where the exponent $\zeta$ exhibits several phase transitions~: the exponent is $\zeta=\eta$ for $\mu&lt;1$ or $\nu&lt;1$ ($\langle K_n^{-1}\rangle$ or $\langle m_n\rangle$ infinite) and $\zeta=1$ when $\mu&gt;2$ and $\nu&gt;2$ ($\langle K_n^{-2}\rangle$ and $\langle m_n^2\rangle$ both finite). In the intermediate region it is given by $\zeta=\mathrm{min}(\mu,\nu)/2$. On the transition lines, $\varrho(\omega)$ and $\gamma(\omega^2)$ receive logarithmic corrections. Finally, we also consider the Anderson model with random couplings (random spring chain for ``Dyson type I'' disorder).</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Heisenberg-type lower bounds on spacelike hypersurfaces in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01628v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum theory on curved backgrounds, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is usually discussed in terms of ensemble variances and flat-space commutators. Here we take a different, preparation-based viewpoint tailored to sharp position measurements on spacelike hypersurfaces in general relativity. A projective localization is modeled as a von Neumann-L\"uders projection onto a geodesic ball $B_\Sigma(r)$ of radius $r$ on a Cauchy slice $(\Sigma,h)$, with the post-measurement state described by Dirichlet data. Using DeWitt-type momentum operators adapted to an orthonormal frame, we construct a geometric, coordinate-invariant momentum standard deviation $\sigma_p$ and show that strict confinement to $B_\Sigma(r)$ enforces an intrinsic kinetic-energy floor. The lower bound is set by the first Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the ball, $\sigma_p \ge \hbar\sqrt{\lambda_1}$, and is manifestly invariant under changes of coordinates and foliation. A variance decomposition separates the contribution of the modulus $|\psi|$ from phase-gradient fluctuations and clarifies how the spectral geometry of $(\Sigma,h)$ controls momentum uncertainty. Assuming only minimal geometric information, weak mean-convexity of the boundary yields a universal, scale-invariant Heisenberg-type product bound, $\sigma_p r \ge \pi\hbar/2$, depending only on the proper radius $r$.</description>

      <title>Geodesic structure of spacetime near singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geodesic flows emanating from an arbitrary point $\mathscr{P}$ in a manifold $\mathscr{M}$ carry important information about the geometric properties of $\mathscr{M}$. These flows are characterized by Synge's world function and van Vleck determinant - important bi-scalars that also characterize quantum description of physical systems in $\mathscr{M}$. If $\mathscr{P}$ is a regular point, these bi-scalars have well known expansions around their flat space expressions, quantifying \textit{local flatness} and equivalence principle. We show that, if $\mathscr{P}$ is a singular point, the scaling behavior of these bi-scalars changes drastically, capturing the non-trivial structure of geodesic flows near singularities. This yields remarkable insights into classical structure of spacetime singularities and provides useful tool to study their quantum structure.</description>

      <title>Boundary-driven quantum systems near the Zeno limit: steady states and long-time behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study composite open quantum systems with a finite-dimensional state space ${\mathcal H}_A\otimes {\mathcal H}_B$ governed by a Lindblad equation $\rho'(t) = {\mathcal L}_\gamma \rho(t)$ where ${\mathcal L}_\gamma\rho = -i[H,\rho] + \gamma {\mathcal D} \rho$, and ${\mathcal D}$ is a dissipator ${\mathcal D}_A\otimes I$ acting non-trivially only on part $A$ of the system, which can be thought of as the boundary, and $\gamma$ is a parameter. It is known that the dynamics simplifies for large $\gamma$: after a time of order $\gamma^{-1}$, $\rho(t)$ is well approximated for times small compared to $\gamma^2$ by $\pi_A\otimes R(t)$ where $\pi_A$ is a steady state of ${\mathcal D}_A$, and $R(t)$ is a solution of $\frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}t}R(t) = {\mathcal L}_{P,\gamma}R(t)$ where ${\mathcal L}_{P,\gamma} R := -i[H_P,R] + \gamma^{-1} {\mathcal D}_P R$ with $H_P$ being a Hamiltonian on ${\mathcal H}_B$ and ${\mathcal D}_P$ being a Lindblad generator over ${\mathcal H}_B$. We prove this assuming only that ${\mathcal D}_A$ is ergodic and gapped. In order to better control the long time behavior, and study the steady states $\bar\rho_\gamma$, we introduce a third Lindblad generator ${\mathcal D}_P^\sharp$ that does not involve $\gamma$, but still closely related to ${\mathcal L}_\gamma$. We show that if ${\mathcal D}_P^\sharp$ is ergodic and gapped, then so is ${\mathcal L}_\gamma$ for all large $\gamma$, and if $\bar\rho_\gamma$ denotes the unique steady state for ${\mathcal L}_\gamma$, then $\lim_{\gamma\to\infty}\bar\rho_\gamma = \pi_A\otimes \bar R$ where $\bar R$ is the unique steady state for ${\mathcal D}_P^\sharp$. We show that there is a convergent expansion $\bar\rho_\gamma = \pi_A\otimes\bar R +\gamma^{-1} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^{-k} \bar n_k$ where, defining $\bar n_{-1} := \pi_A\otimes\bar R$, ${\mathcal D} \bar n_k = -i[H,\bar n_{k-1}]$ for all $k\geq 0$.</description>

      <title>Exact Multimode Quantization of Superconducting Circuits via Boundary Admittance and Continued Fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate extraction of linearized quantum circuit models from electromagnetic simulations is essential for the design of superconducting circuits. We present a quantization framework based on the driving-point admittance $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$ seen by a Josephson junction embedded in an arbitrary passive linear environment. By taking the Schur complement of the nodal admittance matrix, we show that the linearized coupled system obeys an eigenvalue-dependent boundary condition, $s Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s) + 1/L_J = 0$, whose roots determine the dressed linear mode frequencies. This boundary condition admits an exact continued fraction representation: any positive-real admittance can be realized as a canonical Cauer ladder, yielding a tridiagonal (Jacobi) structure that enables certified convergence bounds via interlacing theorems.For the full nonlinear Hamiltonian, we treat Josephson junctions in the charge basis, where each cosine potential is exactly tridiagonal, and couple them to cavity modes in the Fock basis; in the general multi-junction case this yields a block-tridiagonal structure solvable by matrix continued fractions, enabling systematic diagonalization across all coupling regimes from dispersive through ultrastrong and deep strong coupling. The resulting quantization procedure is: (i)~compute or measure $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$, (ii)~solve the boundary condition to obtain dressed eigenfrequencies, (iii)~synthesize an equivalent passive network, and (iv)~quantize while retaining the full cosine nonlinearity of the Josephson junction. We prove that junction participation decays as $\mathcal{O}(\omega_n^{-1})$ at high frequencies for any circuit with finite shunt capacitance, ensuring ultraviolet convergence of perturbative corrections without imposed cutoffs.</description>

      <title>Study on Light Propagation through Space-Time Random Media via Stochastic Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, the theory of stochastic partial differential equations is applied to the propagation of light fields in space-time random media. By modeling the fluctuation of refractive index's square of the media as a random field, we demonstrate that the hyperbolic Anderson model is applicable to describing the propagation of light fields in such media. Additionally, several new quantitative characterizations of the stochastic properties that govern the light fields are derived. Furthermore, the validity of the theoretical framework and corresponding results is experimentally verified by analyzing the statistical properties of the propagated light fields after determining the spatial and temporal stochastic features of the random media. The results presented here provide a more accurate theoretical basis for better understanding random phenomena in emerging domains such as free-space optical communication, detection, and imaging in transparent random media. The study could also have practical guiding significance for experimental system design in these fields.</description>

Abstract: We study the small dispersion limit of the intermediate long wave (ILW) equation, specifically on a class of well-behaved initial conditions $u_0$ where the number of solitons in the solution increases without bound. First, we conduct a formal WKB-style analysis on the ILW direct scattering problem, generating approximate eigenvalues and norming constants. We then use this to define a modified set of scattering data and rigorously analyze the associated inverse scattering problem. The main results include demonstrating $L^2$-convergence of the solution at $t = 0$ to the original initial condition $u_0$ and for $0 &lt; t &lt; t_\mathrm{c}$ to the associated solution of invicid Burgers' equation, where $t_\mathrm{c}$ is the time of gradient catastrophe.</description>
