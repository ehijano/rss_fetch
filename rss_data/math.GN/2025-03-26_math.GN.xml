      <title>Weight of convex compact spaces and their boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is proved that if some boundary $B$ of a convex compact subset $X$ of a locally convex linear space has a countable network, then the convex compact space $X$ is metrizable. If the boundary $B$ is a Lindelof $\Sigma$-space, then the network weight $nw(B)$ of $B$ coincides with the weight $w(K)$ of $K$.</description>

      <title>On edge-direction and compact edge-end spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directions of graphs were originally introduced in the study of a cops-and-robbers kind of game, while the study of end spaces has been used to generalize classical graph-theoretical results to infinite graphs, such as Halin's generalization of Menger's theorem. An edge-analogue of end spaces, where finite sets of edges are used instead of vertices as separator agents to form the so-called edge-end space, has been recently used to obtain an edge-analogue of this later result. Inspired by Diestel's correspondence between directions and ends of a graph, we tackle in this paper an edge-analogue of directions, its relation with line graphs, and an edge-analogue of Diestel's correspondence. The results of this study had some implications over edge-end space compactness, which then became a target of inquiry: we thus show an edge-analogue of Diestel's combinatorial characterization for compact end spaces. Non-edge-dominating vertices play an important role in our characterization, which motivated the study of ends and directions using now finite sets of these vertices as separator agents, as done previously for edges, giving rise to other topological spaces associated with graphs. These new direction and end spaces once again motivate an analogue of Diestel's correspondence result, and further generalizations are obtained. All of these constructions define topological space-classes associated with graphs such as edge-end spaces and edge-direction spaces of graphs. The paper organizes these topological space-classes appearing throughout the text with representation results, as it was done by Pitz and Kurkofka, as well as Aurichi, Real and Magalh\~aes J\'unior. Most notably, we show that every compact edge-end space can be represented as the edge-direction space of a connected graph.</description>

      <title>Subfitness in distributive (semi)lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether the set of subfit elements of a distributive semilattice is an ideal. This question was raised by the second author at the BLAST conference in 2022. We show that in general it has a negative solution, however if the semilattice is a lattice, then the solution is positive. This is somewhat unexpected since, as we show, a semilattice is subfit if and only if so is its distributive lattice envelope.</description>
