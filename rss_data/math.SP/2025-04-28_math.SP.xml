      <title>Some Laplacian eigenvalues can be computed by matrix perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on matrix perturbation theory, closed-form analytic expansions are studied for a Laplacian eigenvalue of an undirected, possibly weighted graph, which is close to a unique degree in that graph. An approximation is presented to provide an analytic estimate of a Laplacian eigenvalue and complements bounds on Laplacian eigenvalues in spectral graph theory. Then, we apply the Euler summation and numerically analyze how the structure of graphs influences the convergence of the corresponding Euler series. Moreover, we obtain the explicit form of the perturbation Taylor series and its Euler series of almost regular graphs in which only one node has a unique degree and all remaining nodes have the same degree. We find that the Euler series possesses a superior convergence range than the perturbation Taylor series for almost regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Perturbing the principal Dirichlet eigenfunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the principal Dirichlet eigenfunction $\varphi_U$ when the domain $U$ is a perturbation of a bounded inner uniform domain in a strictly local regular Dirichlet space. We prove that if $U$ is suitably contained in between two inner uniform domains, then $\varphi_U$ admits two-sided bounds in terms of the principal Dirichlet eigenfunctions of the two approximating domains. The main ingredients of our proof include domain monotonicity properties associated to Dirichlet boundary conditions, intrinsic ultracontractivity estimates, and parabolic Harnack inequality. As an application of our results, we give explicit expressions comparable to $\varphi_U$ for certain domains $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, as well as improved Dirichlet heat kernel estimates for such domains. We also prove that under a uniform exterior ball condition on $U$, a point achieving the maximum of $\varphi_U$ is separated away from the boundary, complementing a result of Rachh and Steinerberger arXiv:1608.06604. Our principal Dirichlet eigenfunction estimates are applicable to second-order uniformly elliptic operators in Euclidean space, Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature, and Lie groups of polynomial volume growth.</description>

      <title>Steklov isospectrality of conformal metrics</title>

Abstract: The Steklov spectrum of a smooth compact Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with boundary is the set of eigenvalues counted with multiplicities of its Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. (DN map) This article is devoted to the Steklov spectral inverse problem of recovering the metric $g$, up to natural gauge invariance, from its Steklov spectrum. Positive results are established in dimension $n\geq 3$ for conformal metrics under the assumption that the geodesic flow on the boundary is Anosov with simple length spectrum. The paper combines wave trace formula techniques with the injectivity of the geodesic X-ray transform for functions on closed Anosov manifolds. It is shown that knowledge of the Steklov spectrum determines the jet at the boundary of the underlying Riemannian metric within its conformal class. In this particular context, this parallels the well-known results of the Calder\'on problem, where we are given the entire Dirichlet-to-Neumann map instead. As a simple corollary, assuming real-analyticity of the conformal factor, Steklov isospectral metrics must coincide. Using similar arguments, we are also able to prove under the same assumption of hyperbolicity of the geodesic flow on the boundary, that generically any smooth potential $q$ can be recovered from the Steklov spectrum, in the sense that its jet at the boundary is determined by the spectrum of the DN map for the Schr\"odinger operator with potential $q$. Consequently, in this case, two analytic Steklov isospectral potentials must be equal.</description>
