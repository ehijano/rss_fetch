      <title>Forecasting Mortality Rates: Unveiling Patterns with a PCA-GEE Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used technique in exploratory data analysis, visualization, and data preprocessing, leveraging the concept of variance to identify key dimensions in datasets. In this study, we focus on the first principal component, which represents the direction maximizing the variance of projected data. We extend the application of PCA by treating its first principal component as a covariate and integrating it with Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) for analyzing age-specific death rates (ASDRs) in longitudinal datasets. GEE models are chosen for their robustness in handling correlated data, particularly suited for situations where traditional models assume independence among observations, which may not hold true in longitudinal data. We propose distinct GEE models tailored for single and multipopulation ASDRs, accommodating various correlation structures such as independence, AR(1), and exchangeable, thus offering a comprehensive evaluation of model efficiency. Our study critically evaluates the strengths and limitations of GEE models in mortality forecasting, providing empirical evidence through detailed model specifications and practical illustrations. We compare the forecast accuracy of our PCA-GEE approach with the Li-Lee and Lee-Carter models, demonstrating its superior predictive performance. Our findings contribute to an enhanced understanding of the nuanced capabilities of GEE models in mortality rate prediction, highlighting the potential of integrating PCA with GEE for improved forecasting accuracy and reliability.</description>

      <title>Empirical Determination of Baseball Eras: Multivariate Changepoint Analysis in Major League Baseball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use multivariate change point analysis methods, to identify not only mean shifts but also changes in variance across a wide array of statistical time series. Our primary objective is to empirically discern distinct eras in the evolution of baseball, shedding light on significant transformations in team performance and management strategies. We leverage a rich dataset comprising baseball statistics from the late 1800s to 2020, spanning over a century of the sport's history. Results confirm previous historical research, pinpointing well-known baseball eras, such as the Dead Ball Era, Integration Era, Steroid Era, and Post-Steroid Era. Moreover, the study delves into the detection of substantial changes in team performance, effectively identifying periods of both dynasties and collapses within a team's history. The multivariate change point analysis proves to be a valuable tool for understanding the intricate dynamics of baseball's evolution. The method offers a data-driven approach to unveil structural shifts in the sport's historical landscape, providing fresh insights into the impact of rule changes, player strategies, and external factors on baseball's evolution. This not only enhances our comprehension of baseball, showing more robust identification of eras than past univariate time series work, but also showcases the broader applicability of multivariate change point analysis in the domain of sports research and beyond.</description>

      <title>Mass-Balance MRV for Carbon Dioxide Removal by Enhanced Rock Weathering: Methods, Simulation, and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon dioxide will likely need to be removed from the atmosphere to avoid significant future warming and climate change. Technologies are being developed to remove large quantities of carbon from the atmosphere. Enhanced rock weathering (ERW), where fine-grained silicate minerals are spread on soil, is a promising carbon removal method that can also support crop yields and maintain overall soil health. Quantifying the amount of carbon removed by ERW is crucial for understanding the potential of ERW globally and for building trust in commercial operations. However, reliable and scalable quantification in complex media like soil is challenging and there is not yet a consensus on the best method of doing so. Here we discuss mass-balance methods, where stocks of base cations in soil are monitored over time to infer the amount of inorganic carbon brought into solution by weathering reactions. First, we review the fundamental concepts of mass-balance methods and explain different ways of approaching the mass-balance problem. Then we discuss experimental planning and data collection, suggesting some best practices. Next, we present a software package designed to facilitate a range of tasks in ERW like uncertainty analysis, planning field trials, and validating statistical methods. Finally, we briefly review ways of estimating carbon removal using mass balance before discussing some advantages of Bayesian inference in this context and presenting an example Bayesian model. The model is fit to simulated data and recovers the correct answer with a clear representation of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A pseudo-outcome-based framework to analyze treatment heterogeneity in survival data using electronic health records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important aspect of precision medicine focuses on characterizing diverse responses to treatment due to unique patient characteristics, also known as heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE), and identifying beneficial subgroups with enhanced treatment effects. Estimating HTE with right-censored data in observational studies remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a pseudo-outcome-based framework for analyzing HTE in survival data, which includes a list of meta-learners for estimating HTE, a variable importance metric for identifying predictive variables to HTE, and a data-adaptive procedure to select subgroups with enhanced treatment effects. We evaluate the finite sample performance of the framework under various settings of observational studies. Furthermore, we applied the proposed methods to analyze the treatment heterogeneity of a Written Asthma Action Plan (WAAP) on time-to-ED (Emergency Department) return due to asthma exacerbation using a large asthma electronic health records dataset with visit records expanded from pre- to post-COVID-19 pandemic. We identified vulnerable subgroups of patients with poorer asthma outcomes but enhanced benefits from WAAP and characterized patient profiles. Our research provides valuable insights for healthcare providers on the strategic distribution of WAAP, particularly during disruptive public health crises, ultimately improving the management and control of pediatric asthma.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty estimation in satellite precipitation spatial prediction by combining distributional regression algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To facilitate effective decision-making, gridded satellite precipitation products should include uncertainty estimates. Machine learning has been proposed for issuing such estimates. However, most existing algorithms for this purpose rely on quantile regression. Distributional regression offers distinct advantages over quantile regression, including the ability to model intermittency as well as a stronger ability to extrapolate beyond the training data, which is critical for predicting extreme precipitation. In this work, we introduce the concept of distributional regression for the engineering task of creating precipitation datasets through data merging. Building upon this concept, we propose new ensemble learning methods that can be valuable not only for spatial prediction but also for prediction problems in general. These methods exploit conditional zero-adjusted probability distributions estimated with generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS), spline-based GAMLSS and distributional regression forests as well as their ensembles (stacking based on quantile regression, and equal-weight averaging). To identify the most effective methods for our specific problem, we compared them to benchmarks using a large, multi-source precipitation dataset. Stacking emerged as the most successful strategy. Three specific stacking methods achieved the best performance based on the quantile scoring rule, although the ranking of these methods varied across quantile levels. This suggests that a task-specific combination of multiple algorithms could yield significant benefits.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Design-Based Treatment Effect Estimation in Paired Cluster-Randomized Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Paired cluster-randomized experiments (pCRTs) are common across many disciplines because there is often natural clustering of individuals, and paired randomization can help balance baseline covariates to improve experimental precision. Although pCRTs are common, there is surprisingly no obvious way to analyze this randomization design if an individual-level (rather than cluster-level) treatment effect is of interest. Variance estimation is also complicated due to the dependency created through pairing clusters. Therefore, we aim to provide an intuitive and practical comparison between different estimation strategies in pCRTs in order to inform practitioners' choice of strategy. To this end, we present a general framework for design-based estimation in pCRTs for average individual effects. This framework offers a novel and intuitive view on the bias-variance trade-off between estimators and emphasizes the benefits of covariate adjustment for estimation with pCRTs. In addition to providing a general framework for estimation in pCRTs, the point and variance estimators we present support fixed-sample unbiased estimation with similar precision to a common regression model and consistently conservative variance estimation. Through simulation studies, we compare the performance of the point and variance estimators reviewed. Finally, we compare the performance of estimators with simulations using real data from an educational efficacy trial. Our analysis and simulation studies inform the choice of point and variance estimators for analyzing pCRTs in practice.</description>

      <title>Forecast Linear Augmented Projection (FLAP): A free lunch to reduce forecast error variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel forecast linear augmented projection (FLAP) method is introduced, which reduces the forecast error variance of any unbiased multivariate forecast without introducing bias. The method first constructs new component series which are linear combinations of the original series. Forecasts are then generated for both the original and component series. Finally, the full vector of forecasts is projected onto a linear subspace where the constraints implied by the combination weights hold. It is proven that the trace of the forecast error variance is non-increasing with the number of components, and mild conditions are established for which it is strictly decreasing. It is also shown that the proposed method achieves maximum forecast error variance reduction among linear projection methods. The theoretical results are validated through simulations and two empirical applications based on Australian tourism and FRED-MD data. Notably, using FLAP with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to construct the new series leads to substantial forecast error variance reduction.</description>

      <title>Distributional Regression U-Nets for the Postprocessing of Precipitation Ensemble Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasts have a high socio-economic value due to their role in decision-making in various fields such as transport networks and farming. We propose a global statistical postprocessing method for grid-based precipitation ensemble forecasts. This U-Net-based distributional regression method predicts marginal distributions in the form of parametric distributions inferred by scoring rule minimization. Distributional regression U-Nets are compared to state-of-the-art postprocessing methods for daily 21-h forecasts of 3-h accumulated precipitation over the South of France. Training data comes from the M\'et\'eo-France weather model AROME-EPS and spans 3 years. A practical challenge appears when consistent data or reforecasts are not available.
  Distributional regression U-Nets compete favorably with the raw ensemble. In terms of continuous ranked probability score, they reach a performance comparable to quantile regression forests (QRF). However, they are unable to provide calibrated forecasts in areas associated with high climatological precipitation. In terms of predictive power for heavy precipitation events, they outperform both QRF and semi-parametric QRF with tail extensions.</description>

      <title>Causal inference approach to appraise long-term effects of maintenance policy on functional performance of asphalt pavements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asphalt pavements as the most prevalent transportation infrastructure, are prone to serious traffic safety problems due to functional or structural damage caused by stresses or strains imposed through repeated traffic loads and continuous climatic cycles. The good quality or high serviceability of infrastructure networks is vital to the urbanization and industrial development of nations. In order to maintain good functional pavement performance and extend the service life of asphalt pavements, the long-term performance of pavements under maintenance policies needs to be evaluated and favorable options selected based on the condition of the pavement. A major challenge in evaluating maintenance policies is to produce valid treatments for the outcome assessment under the control of uncertainty of vehicle loads and the disturbance of freeze-thaw cycles in the climatic environment. In this study, a novel causal inference approach combining a classical causal structural model and a potential outcome model framework is proposed to appraise the long-term effects of four preventive maintenance treatments for longitudinal cracking over a 5-year period of upkeep. Three fundamental issues were brought to our attention: 1) detection of causal relationships prior to variables under environmental loading (identification of causal structure); 2) obtaining direct causal effects of treatment on outcomes excluding covariates (identification of causal effects); and 3) sensitivity analysis of causal relationships. The results show that the method can accurately evaluate the effect of preventive maintenance treatments and assess the maintenance time to cater well for the functional performance of different preventive maintenance approaches. This framework could help policymakers to develop appropriate maintenance strategies for pavements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GP) have become popular machine-learning methods for kernel-based learning on datasets with complicated covariance structures. In this paper, we present a novel extension to the GP framework using a contaminated normal likelihood function to better account for heteroscedastic variance and outlier noise. We propose a scalable inference algorithm based on the Sparse Variational Gaussian Process (SVGP) method for fitting sparse Gaussian process regression models with contaminated normal noise on large datasets. We examine an application to geomagnetic ground perturbations, where the state-of-the-art prediction model is based on neural networks. We show that our approach yields shorter prediction intervals for similar coverage and accuracy when compared to an artificial dense neural network baseline.</description>
