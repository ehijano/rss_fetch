      <title>Modelling Prepayment and Default under Changing Credit Market Conditions for a Net Present Value Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model is developed to assess the profitability of loans or mortgages with a specified repayment schedule. Financial institutions face two competing risks: default and prepayment, both influenced by the stochastic evolution of credit market conditions. This study focuses on the Random Net Present Value (RNPV) as a key performance metric. The analysis evaluates the mean and variance of the RNPV at both the individual loan level and the portfolio level, within a unified framework that accounts for borrower behavior and prevailing credit market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Optimal Dividend, Reinsurance, and Capital Injection Strategies for an Insurer with Two Collaborating Business Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers an insurer with two collaborating business lines, and the risk exposure of each line follows a diffusion risk model. The manager of the insurer makes three decisions for each line: (i) dividend payout, (ii) (proportional) reinsurance coverage, and (iii) capital injection (from one line into the other). The manager seeks an optimal dividend, reinsurance, and capital injection strategy to maximize the expected weighted sum of the total dividend payments until the first ruin. We completely solve this problem and obtain the value function and optimal strategies in closed form. We show that the optimal dividend strategy is a threshold strategy, and the more important line always has a lower threshold to pay dividends. The optimal proportion of risk ceded to the reinsurer is decreasing with respect to the aggregate reserve level for each line, and capital injection is only used to prevent the ruin of a business line. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the impact of model parameters on the optimal strategies.</description>

      <title>Quantifying socio-temporal effects of loan delinquency drivers in microfinance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and evaluate a family of discrete-time logit-link (LLink) models (including fixed-effects and frailty extensions) to capture latent heterogeneity in repayment behaviour and quantify the effects of socio-temporal factors in microfinance. Our findings highlight the importance of unobserved borrower risk, revealing that simple random intercept structures are sufficient to model latent heterogeneity in this context. Additionally, socio-temporal variables--such as festive seasons and long school breaks--consistently associate with delinquency transitions, offering key insights into repayment dynamics. While LLink models provide clear interpretability, tree-based methods outperform them in predictive accuracy, making them suitable for multistate classification tasks. Building on this, we propose an optimised classification strategy based on the Matthews Correlation Coefficient to enhance next-state prediction. Overall, our results highlight the benefit of combining interpretable risk modeling with advanced machine learning to support robust, data-driven decision-making in microfinance operations.</description>

      <title>Diversification and Stochastic Dominance: When All Eggs Are Better Put in One Basket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diversification is widely regarded as a reliable way to reduce risk, yet under certain extreme conditions it can have the opposite effect. A simple and striking example of this phenomenon was recently given by Chen et al. (2025), who showed that for independent and identically distributed (iid) Pareto risks with infinite mean, any weighted average is larger -- in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance -- than a single such risk. Our main result -- the \textit{one-basket theorem} -- identifies new sufficient conditions under which this reversal occurs for independent but not necessarily identically distributed risks. We compare a weighted average to its corresponding mixture model, which concentrates all exposure on one of the risks, chosen at random. In the iid case, the mixture has the same distribution as any individual risk, thereby recovering the canonical comparison between a diversified portfolio and full exposure to a single component. The theorem enables weight-specific verification of the stochastic dominance relation and yields new applications, including infinite-mean discrete Pareto risks and the St. Petersburg lottery. We further show that these reversals are boundary cases of a broader pattern: diversification always increases the likelihood of exceeding small thresholds, and under specific conditions, this local effect extends globally, resulting in first-order stochastic dominance.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space-Valued LQ Mean Field Games: An Infinite-Dimensional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01012v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games (MFGs) in Hilbert spaces, generalizing the classic LQ MFG theory to scenarios involving $N$ agents with dynamics governed by infinite-dimensional stochastic equations. In this framework, both state and control processes of each agent take values in separable Hilbert spaces. All agents are coupled through the average state of the population which appears in their linear dynamics and quadratic cost functional. Specifically, the dynamics of each agent incorporates an infinite-dimensional noise, namely a $Q$-Wiener process, and an unbounded operator. The diffusion coefficient of each agent is stochastic involving the state, control, and average state processes. We first study the well-posedness of a system of $N$ coupled semilinear infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations establishing the foundation of MFGs in Hilbert spaces. We then specialize to $N$-player LQ games described above and study the asymptotic behaviour as the number of agents, $N$, approaches infinity. We develop an infinite-dimensional variant of the Nash Certainty Equivalence principle and characterize a unique Nash equilibrium for the limiting MFG. Finally, we study the connections between the $N$-player game and the limiting MFG, demonstrating that the empirical average state converges to the mean field and that the resulting limiting best-response strategies form an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium for the $N$-player game in Hilbert spaces.</description>
