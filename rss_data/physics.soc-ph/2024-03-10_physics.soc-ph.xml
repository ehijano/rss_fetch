      <title>Incorporating Competition into Dual Accessibility Assessment: The Competitive Equilibrium Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a new approach to assessing urban accessibility using the competitive equilibrium method, an adaptation of the balancing cost method that incorporates competition among users into dual accessibility metrics. The need for this method arises from verifying the inability of the balancing cost method to measure the competitive dynamics of transport systems precisely. The method works by continuously updating available opportunities based on the number of competitors, capturing competition effects, and differentiating regions according to demand and supply. The application results in three cities in the interior of S\~ao Paulo demonstrate that competitive equilibrium is significantly more sensitive to employment supply variations and can measure potential competitors by area. In addition, the data used, and the computational tools developed are made available, allowing for the replication of the work and application in future studies.</description>

      <title>Properties of the connected components in projections of random bipartite networks: Effects of clique size fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examined the structure of projections of random bipartite networks characterized by the degree distribution of individual and group nodes through the generating function method. We decomposed a projection into two subgraphs, the giant component, and finite components and analyzed their degree correlation. The projections never exhibit a negative degree correlation. Positive degree correlations in the networks originating from the clique size fluctuation remain after the decomposition at the set of finite components although the values of their clustering coefficient are still finite. The giant component can exhibit either positive or negative degree correlations based on the structure of the projection. However, they are positively correlated in most cases. In addition, we determined the relation between the finite components in a supercritical phase possessing the giant component and the projection in a subcritical phase when the degree distributions for group and individual are Poisson.</description>

      <title>Oppie Op-ed: Reflections on Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Right before Nolan's movie was released, I gave a talk on Oppenheimer, trying to anticipate what elements of Bird and Sherwin's biography on which the movie is based would make it into the movie. In this article, written for the October 2023 edition of the newsletter of the Forum on Science and Society of the APS, I elaborate on some of the elements I missed. I used this article as the basis for a post-movie version of my talk. I corrected some errors and made some additions to this article before submitting it right before Nolan's movie is expected to clean up at the Oscars (links to recordings of the pre- and post-movie versions of my talk are included).</description>

      <title>Assigning Entities to Teams as a Hypergraph Discovery Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a team assignment algorithm based on a hypergraph approach focusing on resilience and diffusion optimization. Specifically, our method is based on optimizing the algebraic connectivity of the Laplacian matrix of an edge-dependent vertex-weighted hypergraph. We used constrained simulated annealing, where we constrained the effort agents can exert to perform a task and the minimum effort a task requires to be completed. We evaluated our methods in terms of the number of unsuccessful patches to drive our solution into the feasible region and the cost of patching. We showed that our formulation provides more robust solutions than the original data and the greedy approach. We hope that our methods motivate further research in applying hypergraphs to similar problems in different research areas and in exploring variations of our methods.</description>

      <title>C.V. Raman as a Science Communicator: A Historical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: C.V. Raman (1888 - 1970) was a creative scientist, enthusiastic teacher and a science celebrity in India. In all these roles, he communicated science effectively. In this essay, I ask how and why did he communicate science. I take a few examples from his research writings and show his ability to explain science lucidly. By looking into his thoughts on teaching and those of his students, I explore Raman, the teacher. Finally, I discuss a few aspects of his methods to communicate science to the public. I emphasize his exposition and reveal a dichotomy.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Timescales of a Complex System: A Bayesian Approach to Temporal Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Changes in the timescales at which complex systems evolve are essential to predicting critical transitions and catastrophic failures. Disentangling the timescales of the dynamics governing complex systems remains a key challenge. With this study, we introduce an integrated Bayesian framework based on temporal network models to address this challenge. We focus on two methodologies: change point detection for identifying shifts in system dynamics, and a spectrum analysis for inferring the distribution of timescales. Applied to synthetic and empirical datasets, these methologies robustly identify critical transitions and comprehensively map the dominant and subsidiaries timescales in complex systems. This dual approach offers a powerful tool for analyzing temporal networks, significantly enhancing our understanding of dynamic behaviors in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Equitable Data-Driven Facility Location and Resource Allocation to Fight the Opioid Epidemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06179v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The opioid epidemic is a crisis that has plagued the United States (US) for decades. One central issue is inequitable access to treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), which puts certain populations at a higher risk of opioid overdose. We integrate a predictive dynamical model and a prescriptive optimization problem to compute high-quality opioid treatment facility and treatment budget allocations for each US state. Our predictive model is a differential equation-based epidemiological model that captures opioid epidemic dynamics. We use a process inspired by neural ODEs to fit this model to opioid epidemic data for each state and obtain estimates for unknown parameters in the model. We then incorporate this epidemiological model into a mixed-integer optimization problem (MIP) that aims to minimize opioid overdose deaths and the number of people with OUD. We develop strong relaxations based on McCormick envelopes to efficiently compute approximate solutions to our MIPs with a mean optimality gap of 3.99%. Our method provides socioeconomically equitable solutions, as it incentivizes investments in areas with higher social vulnerability (from the US Centers for Disease Control's Social Vulnerability Index) and opioid prescribing rates. On average, our approach decreases the number of people with OUD by 9.03 $\pm$ 1.772%, increases the number of people in treatment by 88.75 $\pm$ 26.223%, and decreases opioid-related deaths by 0.58 $\pm$ 0.111% after 2 years compared to baseline epidemiological model predictions. Our solutions show that policy-makers should target adding treatment facilities to counties that have less facilities than their population share and are more socially vulnerable. We demonstrate that our optimization approach should help inform these decisions, as it yields population health benefits in comparison to benchmarks based solely on population and social vulnerability.</description>

      <title>Random matrix statistics and safety rest areas on interstates in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06425v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze physical spacings between locations of safety rest areas on interstates in the United States. We show normalized safety rest area spacings on major interstates exhibit Wigner surmise statistics, which align with the eigenvalue spacings for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble from random matrix theory as well as the one-dimensional gas interactions via the Coulomb potential. We identify economic and geographic regional traits at the state level that exhibit Poissonian statistics, which become more pronounced with increased geographical obstacles in interstate travel. Other regional filters (e.g., historical or political) produced results that did not diverge substantially from the overall Wigner surmise model.</description>
