      <title>A farewell to waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wave nature of particles is a notoriously unintuitive feature of quantum theories. However, it is often deemed essential, due to material particles exhibiting diffraction and interference. Troublingly, Land\'{e} and L\'{e}vy-Leblond have shown that de Broglie wavelengths are not relativistically covariant, making any such wave properties physically inconsistent. In this work we explore whether modern experiments vindicate an alternative view: that apparent waviness in diffraction and interference scenarios emerges as a consequence of quantised interactions between particles. Such a view has historically received very little attention, despite being the exact modern explanation of both the Kapitza-Dirac effect and ultrafast electron diffraction. We study a photon orbital angular momentum realisation of the double slit to prove this explanation capable of unifying quantum interference phenomena. Finally, we demonstrate that the quantum formalism demands that particle momentum is determined at the point of scattering, contravening wave accounts of quantum interference.</description>

      <title>A New Method for Calculating the Energies Associated with Particle Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method in which the energy and mass of elementary particles can be calculated is presented. Gluon gluon interactions within a single elementary particle are considered, and the number of possible interactions per particle is determined. This procedure can be formalized and standardized via a newly introduced microcanonical partition function. The possibility of calculating the energetic relationships provides new and more in-depth insights into the reaction possibilities of the particles. In addition, the application of this method of calculating the partition function to the known quarks themselves suggests that they are composed of even more elementary particles. The properties of these particles match the Rishons of the Harari Shupe preon model. In combination with the Rishon model, the method presented here for calculating the energetic situation of particle reactions provides a profound and new understanding of the processes at an absolute elementary level; this opens new possibilities for the calculation and understanding of particle reactions and might change our understanding of particle physics in fundamental ways.</description>

      <title>Introduction of the G$_2$-Ricci Flow: Geometric Implications for Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and Gauge Boson Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces the G$_2$-Ricci flow on seven-dimensional manifolds with non-zero torsion and explores its physical implications. By extending the Ricci flow to manifolds with G$_2$ structures, we study the evolution of solitonic solutions and their role in spontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge theories. In particular, this model proposes that the masses of the W and Z bosons are determined not by an external scalar field, as in the Higgs mechanism, but by the intrinsic geometric torsion of the manifold. Furthermore, a possible connection between the geometry of extra dimensions and the curvature of our spacetime is explored, with implications for the experimentally observed positive cosmological constant. This approach provides an innovative interpretation of fundamental interactions in theoretical physics, opening new possibilities for studying extra dimensions and the geometry of G$_2$-manifolds.</description>
