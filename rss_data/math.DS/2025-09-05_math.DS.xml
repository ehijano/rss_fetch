      <title>Dominant vertices and attractors' landscape for Boolean networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous works, we introduced the notion of dominant vertices. This is a set of nodes in the underlying network whose evolution determines the whole network's dynamics after a transient time. In this paper, we focus on the case of Boolean networks. We define a reduced graph on the dominant vertices and an induced dynamics on this graph, which we prove is asymptotically equivalent to the original Boolean dynamics. Asymptotic conjugacy ensures that the systems, restricted to their respective attractors, are dynamically equivalent. For a significant class of networks, the induced dynamics is indeed a reduction of the original system. In these cases, the reduction, which is obtained from the structure of dominant vertices, supplies a more tractable system with the same structure of attractors as the original one. Furthermore, the structure of the induced system allows us to establish bounds on the number and period of the attractors, as well as on the reduction of the basin's sizes and transient lengths. We illustrate this reduction by considering a class of networks, which we call clover networks, whose dominant set is a singleton. To get insight into the structure of the basins of attraction of Boolean networks with a single dominant vertex, we complement this work with a numerical exploration of the behavior of a parametrized ensemble of systems of this kind.</description>

      <title>Multi-shooting parameterization methods for invariant manifolds and heteroclinics of 2 DOF Hamiltonian Poincar\'e maps, with applications to celestial resonant dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying 2 degree-of-freedom (DOF) Hamiltonian dynamical systems often involves the computation of stable &amp; unstable manifolds of periodic orbits, due to the homoclinic &amp; heteroclinic connections they can generate. Such study is generally facilitated by the use of a Poincar\'e section, on which the manifolds form 1D curves. A common method of computing such manifolds in the literature involves linear approximations of the manifolds, while the author's past work has developed a nonlinear manifold computation method under the assumption that the periodic orbit intersects the chosen Poincar\'e section only once. However, linear manifold approximations may require large amounts of numerical integration for globalization, while the single-intersection assumption of the previous nonlinear method often does not hold.
  In this paper, a parameterization method is developed and implemented for computing such stable and unstable manifolds even in the case of multiple periodic orbit intersections with a chosen Poincar\'e section. The method developed avoids the need to compose polynomials with Poincar\'e maps - a requirement of some previous related algorithms - by using an intermediate step involving fixed-time maps. The step yields curves near the chosen Poincar\'e section lying on the flow's periodic orbit manifolds, which are used to parameterize and compute the Poincar\'e map manifold curves themselves. These last curves and parameterizations in turn enable highly-accurate computation of heteroclinics between periodic orbits. The method has already been used for various studies of resonant dynamics in the planar circular restricted 3-body problem, which are briefly summarized in this paper, demonstrating the algorithm's utility for real-world investigations.</description>

      <title>Divergence-Kernel method for linear responses and diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the divergence-kernel formula for the linear response (parameter-derivative of marginal or stationary distributions) of random dynamical systems, and formally pass to the continuous-time limit. Our formula works for multiplicative and parameterized noise over any period of time; it does not require hyperbolicity. Then we derive a pathwise Monte-Carlo algorithm for linear responses. With this, we propose a forward-only diffusion generative model and test on simple problems.</description>

      <title>The role of coupling and timescales for interacting tipping elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sudden and abrupt changes can occur in a nonlinear system within many fields of science when such a system crosses a tipping point and rapid changes of the system occur in response to slow changes in an external forcing. These can occur when time-varying inputs cross a bifurcation. If an upstream system loses stability in this way it may cause a downstream system influenced by it to tip, especially if the downstream system evolves on a much faster timescale, in what we call an accelerating cascade of tipping elements. In this paper, we identify the conditions on the coupling and timescales of the systems resulting in various types of tipping (cascade) responses. We also present a prototypical example of a unidirectionally coupled pair of simple tipping elements with hysteresis. This allows us to map out the various types of response as a function of system parameters and to link it to bifurcations of the underlying system that may have multiple timescales.</description>

      <title>On synchronized coded systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of codes with overlapping code words, that we call SPO-codes. The SPO-codes are related to the Markov codes that were introduced in: G. Keller, J. Combinatorial Theory 56, (1991),pp.\ 75--83. The process of generating a coded system from a code extends to SPO-codes. We describe a family of intrinsically ergodic synchronized SPO-coded systems that is closed under topological conjugacy. We construct synchronized subshifts with salient structural features by means of SPO-codes. We construct SPO-coded systems that are not semisynchronized.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of double base expansions and binary shifts with a hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two real bases $q_0, q_1 &gt; 1$, a binary sequence $i_1 i_2 \cdots \in \{0,1\}^\infty$ is the $(q_0,q_1)$-expansion of the number \[ \pi_{q_0,q_1}(i_1 i_2 \cdots) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{i_k}{q_{i_1} \cdots q_{i_k}}. \] Let $U_{q_0,q_1}$ be the set of all real numbers having a unique $(q_0,q_1)$-expansion. When the bases are equal, i.e., $q_0 = q_1 = q$, Allaart and Kong (2019) established the continuity in $q$ of the Hausdorff dimension of the univoque set $U_{q,q}$, building on the work of Komornik, Kong, and Li (2017). We derive explicit formulas for the Hausdorff dimension of $U_{q_0,q_1}$ and the entropy of the underlying subshift for arbitrary $q_0, q_1 &gt; 1$, and prove the continuity of these quantities as functions of $(q_0, q_1)$. Our results also concern general dynamical systems described by binary shifts with a hole, including, in particular, the doubling map with a hole and (linear) Lorenz maps.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Systems as an Example of Invariant Measure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian systems are a classical example in the ergodic theory of flows with an invariant measure. In this matter, we present a brief introduction to measure theory and prove the Poincare recurrence theorem to present the conditions for a system to be conservative. In the following, we discuss the Hamiltonian differential equations, vector fields, and its respective flows as an example of this invariance.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Data-Driven Estimation for Spectral Properties of Koopman Semigroup in Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing the spectral properties of the Koopman operator is crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of complex stochastic dynamical systems. However, the accuracy of data-driven estimation methods, such as Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) and its variants, are heavily dependent on the quality and location of the sampled trajectory data. This paper introduces a novel framework, Reinforced Stochastic Dynamic Mode Decomposition, which integrates Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Stochastic Dynamic Mode Decomposition (SDMD) to automatically guide the data collection process in stochastic dynamical systems. We frame the optimal sampling strategy as an RL problem, where an agent learns a policy to select trajectory initial conditions. The agent is guided by a reward signal based on \emph{spectral consistency}, that is a measure of how well the estimated Koopman eigenpairs describe the system's evolution balanced with an exploration bonus to ensure comprehensive coverage of the state space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using Bandit algorithm, Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms on canonical systems including the double-well potential, the stochastic Duffing oscillator and the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Our results show that the RL agent automatically discovers dynamically significant regions without any prior knowledge of the system. Rigorous theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees for the proposed algorithms, directly linking the final estimation accuracy to the quality of the learned sampling policy. Our work presents a robust, automated methodology for the efficient spectral analysis of complex stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Energy, equilibrium measure and entropy for toric surface maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the ergodic theory of plane rational maps that preserve the natural holomorphic volume form on the algebraic torus. Specifically we construct natural invariant probability measures for a large class of such maps by intersecting the equilibrium currents we constructed in our previous work [DR]. We show further that these measures are mixing and that each admits an underlying geometric product structure. The main result of [DDG3] then implies that the topological entropy of each map covered by our results is the log of its first dynamical degree. In light of examples presented in [BDJ], this implies in particular that the entropy of a rational map can equal the log of a transcendental number.</description>

      <title>Shadowing With Small Diameter Sets Of Bounded Cardinality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine dynamical systems with the property that pseudo-orbits can be traced by small diameter sets with bounded cardinality. In particular, we show that mixing sofic subshifts and surjective dynamical systems with the specification property have this property, and in these systems, it is sufficient to consider small sets of cardinality no more than two. We also prove that a more general class of subshifts, the subshifts of quasi-finite type, exhibit this property.</description>

      <title>A trace pairing and Elliott invariant for groupoid homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an \'{e}tale groupoid, we define a pairing between the Crainic-Moerdijk groupoid homology and the simplex of invariant Borel probability measures on the base space. The main novelty here is that the groupoid need not have totally disconnected base space, and thus the pairing can give more refined information than the measures of clopen subsets of the base space.
  Our principal motivation is $C^*$-algebra theory. The Elliott invariant of a $C^*$-algebra is defined in terms of $K$-theory and traces; it is fundamental in the long-running program to classify simple $C^*$-algebras (satisfying additional necessary conditions). We use our pairing to define a groupoid Elliott invariant, and show that for many interesting groupoids it agrees with the $C^*$-algebraic Elliott invariant of the groupoid $C^*$-algebra: this includes irrational rotation algebras and the $C^*$-algebras arising from orbit breaking constructions studied by the first listed author, Putnam, and Strung. These results can be thought of as establishing a refinement of Matui's HK conjecture for the relevant groupoids.</description>

      <title>Deficiency of equation-finding approach to data-driven modeling of dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding the governing equations from data by sparse optimization has become a popular approach to deterministic modeling of dynamical systems. Considering the physical situations where the data can be imperfect due to disturbances and measurement errors, we show that for many chaotic systems, widely used sparse-optimization methods for discovering governing equations produce models that depend sensitively on the measurement procedure, yet all such models generate virtually identical chaotic attractors, leading to a striking limitation that challenges the conventional notion of equation-based modeling in complex dynamical systems. Calculating the Koopman spectra, we find that the different sets of equations agree in their large eigenvalues and the differences begin to appear when the eigenvalues are smaller than an equation-dependent threshold. The results suggest that finding the governing equations of the system and attempting to interpret them physically may lead to misleading conclusions. It would be more useful to work directly with the available data using, e.g., machine-learning methods.</description>

      <title>A generalization of Littlewood's $L^\alpha$ flat theorem, $\alpha&gt;0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a generalization of Littlewood's criterion on $L^\alpha$-flatness by proving that there is no $L^\alpha$-flat polynomials, $\alpha&gt;0$, within the class of analytic polynomials on the unit circle of the form $ P_n(z)=\sum_{m=1}^{n}c_m z^m, n \in {\mathbb{N}}^*,$ satisfying $$ \sum_{m=1}^{n}|c_m|^2 \leq \frac{K}{n^2} \sum_{m=1}^{n}m^2 |c_m|^2, $$ where $K$ is an absolutely constant. As a consequence, we confirm the $L^\alpha$-Littlewood conjecture, and thereby the $L^1$-Newman and $L^\infty$-Erd\"os conjectures. Our approach combines the $L^\alpha$ Littlewood theorem with the generalized Clarkson's second inequality for $L^\alpha(X,\mathcal{A},m;B)$, with $B$ a Banach spaces and $1 &lt; \alpha \leq 2.$ It follows that there are only finitely many Barker sequences, and we further present several applications in number theory and the spectral theory of dynamical systems. Finally, we construct Gauss-Fresnel polynomials that are Mahler-flat, providing a new proof of the Beller-Newman theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02537v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study linear cocycles generated by nonautonomous delay equations in a proper Hilbert space and their extensions (compound cocycles) to exterior powers. Armed with the recently developed version of the Frequency Theorem, we develop analytic perturbation techniques for comparison of spectral properties (e.g., uniform exponential dichotomies) between such cocycles and cocycles generated by stationary equations. In the basis, there lies an interplay between regularity and structure in PDEs associated with delay equations. In particular, the developed machinery results in effective robust criteria for the absence of closed invariant contours on global attractors arising in nonlinear problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07217v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a number of rigidity results concerning holomorphic dynamical systems admitting rotation quasicircles. Firstly, we show the absence of line fields on the Julia set of any rational map that is geometrically finite away from a number of rotation quasicircles with bounded type rotation number. As an application, we prove combinatorial rigidity associated to the problem of degeneration of Herman rings of the simplest configuration. Secondly, we extend a result of de Faria and de Melo on the $C^{1+\alpha}$ rigidity of critical circle maps with bounded type rotation number to a larger class of dynamical objects, namely critical quasicircle maps. Unlike critical circle maps, critical quasicircle maps may have imbalanced inner and outer criticalities. As a consequence, we prove dynamical universality and exponential convergence of renormalization towards a horseshoe attractor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19393v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an invariant probability measure for the Gauss map, almost all numbers are Diophantine if the log of the partial quotient function is integrable. We show that with respect to a ``continued fraction mixing'' measure for the Gauss map with the log of the partial quotient function non-integrable, almost all numbers are Liouville. We also exhibit Gauss-invariant, ergodic measures with arbitrary irrationality exponent. The proofs are applications of our study of the ``extravagance'' of positive, stationary, stochastic processes. In addition, we prove a Khinchin-type dichotomy for Diophantine approximation with respect to ergodic``weak Renyi measures'' which are ``doubling at $0$''.</description>

      <title>Limitations of deducing measures of limsup sets from measures of finite intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early results by Borel and Cantelli and Erd\H{o}s and Chung have provided bounds for the measure of a limsup set in terms of measures of its constituent sets and their intersections. Recent work by Beresnevich and Velani \cite{Velanipaper} states that, for sequences of balls the measure of the corresponding limsup set being positive is equivalent to a condition on the relationship between measures of these balls and their pairwise intersections. In this paper we show that the condition that the sets are balls is strictly necessary in this statement. Moreover, let $d \in \mathbb{N}$ and let $[0,1]^d$ be equipped with Lebesgue measure $\mu$. Fix $m \in \mathbb{N}$. When we drop the condition that the sets are balls, we can find two sequences of sets $(A_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ and $(B_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $[0,1]^d$ such that $\mu(A_i)=\mu(B_i)$ for all $i \in \mathbb{N}$ and for any sequence $(i_1,i_2,...,i_l)$ where $l \leq m$ we have $\mu(A_{i_1}\cap A_{i_2} \cap... \cap A_{i_l})=\mu(B_{i_1}\cap B_{i_2} \cap... \cap B_{i_l})$ but $\mu(\limsup_{i \rightarrow \infty} A_i)=1$ and $\mu(\limsup_{i \rightarrow \infty} B_i)=0$.</description>

      <title>Sharp iteration asymptotics for transfer operators induced by greedy $\beta$-expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider base-$\beta$ expansions of Parry's type, where $a_0 \geq a_1 \geq 1$ are integers and $a_0&lt;\beta &lt;a_0+1$ is the positive solution to $\beta^2 = a_0\beta + a_1$ (the golden ratio corresponds to $a_0=a_1=1$). The map $x\mapsto \beta x-\lfloor \beta x\rfloor$ induces a discrete dynamical system on the interval $[0,1)$ and we study its associated transfer (Perron-Frobenius) operator $\mathscr{P}$. Our main result can be roughly summarized as follows: we explicitly construct two piecewise affine functions $u$ and $v$ with $\mathscr{P}u=u$ and $\mathscr{P}v=\beta^{-1} v$ such that for every sufficiently smooth $F$ which is supported in $[0,1]$ and satisfies $\int_0^1 F \; \mathrm{d} x=1$, we have $\mathscr{P}^kF= u +\beta^{-k}\big ( F(1)-F(0)\big )v +o(\beta^{-k})$ in $L^\infty$. This is also compared with the case of integer bases, where more refined asymptotic formulas are possible.</description>

      <title>Strong Lyapunov functions for rough systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of {\it strong Lyapunov functions} to investigate the long term behavior of autonomous ordinary differential equations under a multiplicative noise of H\"older continuity, using rough path calculus and the framework of random dynamical systems. We conclude that if such a function exists for the drift then the perturbed system admits the global random pullback attractor which is upper semi-continuous w.r.t. the noise intensity coefficient and the dyadic approximation of the noise. Moreover, in case the drift is globally Lipschitz continuous, then there exists also a numerical attractor for the discritization which is also upper semi-continuous w.r.t. the noise intensity and also converges to the continuous attractor as the step size tends to zero. Several applications are studied, including the pendulum and the Fitzhugh Nagumo neuro-system. We also prove that strong Lyapunov functions could be approximated in practice by Lyapunov neural networks.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and exponential stability for Boussinesq systems on real hyperbolic Manifolds and application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09469v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the global existence and exponential decay of mild solutions for the Boussinesq systems in $L^p$-phase spaces on the framework of real hyperbolic manifold $\mathbb{H}^d(\mathbb{R})$, where $d \geqslant 2$ and $1&lt;p\leq d$. We consider a couple of Ebin-Marsden's Laplace and Laplace-Beltrami operators associated with the corresponding linear system which provides a vectorial matrix semigoup. First, we show the existence and the uniqueness of the bounded mild solution for the linear system by using dispersive and smoothing estimates of the vectorial matrix semigroup. Next, using the fixed point arguments, we can pass from the linear system to the semilinear system to establish the existence of the bounded mild solutions. By using Gronwall's inequality, we establish the exponential stability of such solutions. Finally, we give an application of stability to the existence of periodic mild solutions for the Boussinesq systems.</description>

      <title>Furstenberg--S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy theorem and partition regularity of polynomial equations over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove new combinatorial results about polynomial configurations in large subsets of finite fields. Bergelson--Leibman--McCutcheon (2005) showed that for any polynomial $P(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ with $P(0) = 0$, if $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q$ is a subset of a $q$-element finite field and $A$ does not contains distinct $a, b$ such that $b - a = P(x)$ for some $x$, then $|A| = o(q)$. In fields of sufficiently large characterstic, the bound $o(q)$ can be improved to $O(q^{1/2})$ by the Weil bound. We match this bound in the low characteristic setting and give a complete algebraic characterization of the class of polynomials for which the Furstenberg--S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy theorem holds over finite fields of fixed characteristic.
  Our next main result deals with an enhancement of the Furstenberg--S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy theorem over finite fields. Another consequence of the Weil bound is that if $P(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$, $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q$, and there do not exist elements $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ with $b - a = P(x)$ for some $x$, then $|A| |B| = O(q)$, provided that the characteristic of $\mathbb{F}_q$ is sufficiently large depending on $P$. We provide a complete description of the family of polynomials for which this asymmetric enhancement holds over fields of fixed characteristic, achieving the same quantitative bounds that are available in the high characteristic setting.
  The exponential sum estimates that we produce in dealing with the above problems also allow us to establish partition regularity of families of polynomial equations over finite fields. As an example, we prove: if $P(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ with $P(0) = 0$, then for any $r \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists $N = N(P,r)$ and $c = c(P,r) &gt; 0$ such that if $q &gt; N$ and $\mathbb{F}_q = \bigcup_{i=1}^r{C_i}$, then there are at least $cq^2$ monochromatic solutions to the equation $P(x) + P(y) = P(z)$.</description>

      <title>Bounding Escape Rates and Approximating Quasi-Stationary Distributions of Brownian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Throughout physics Brownian dynamics are used to describe the behaviour of molecular systems. When the Brownian particle is confined to a bounded domain, a particularly important question arises around determining how long it takes the particle to encounter certain regions of the boundary from which it can escape. Termed the first passage time, it sets the natural timescale of the chemical, biological, and physical processes that are described by the stochastic differential equation. Probabilistic information about the first passage time can be studied using spectral properties of the deterministic generator of the stochastic process. In this work we introduce a framework for bounding the leading eigenvalue of the generator which determines the exponential rate of escape of the particle from the domain. The method employs sum-of-squares programming to produce nearly sharp numerical upper and lower bounds on the leading eigenvalue, while also giving good numerical approximations of the associated leading eigenfunction, the quasi-stationary distribution of the process. To demonstrate utility, the method is applied to prototypical low-dimensional problems from the literature.</description>

      <title>Mixed-feedback oscillations in the foraging dynamics of arboreal turtle ants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a model for the dynamics of the flow into and out of a nest for the arboreal turtle ant $\textit{Cephalotes goniodontus}$ during foraging to investigate a possible mechanism for the emergence of oscillations. In our model, there is mixed dynamic feedback between the flow of ants between different behavioral compartments and the amount of pheromone along trails. On one hand, the ants deposit pheromone along the trail, which provides a positive feedback by increasing rates of return to the nest. On the other hand, pheromone evaporation is a source of negative feedback, as it depletes the pheromone and inhibits the return rate. We prove that the model is globally asymptotically stable in the absence of pheromone feedback. Then we show that pheromone feedback can lead to a loss of stability of the equilibrium and onset of sustained oscillations in the flow in and out of the nest via a Hopf bifurcation. This analysis sheds light on a potential key mechanism that enables arboreal turtle ants to effectively optimize their trail networks to minimize traveled path lengths and eliminate graph cycles.</description>
