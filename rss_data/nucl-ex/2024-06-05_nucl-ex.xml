      <title>Femtoscopy at NA61/SHINE using symmetric L\'evy sources in central $^{40}$Ar+$^{45}$Sc from 40$A$ GeV/$c$ to 150$A$ GeV/$c$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent decades of high energy physics research, it was demonstrated that strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) is created in ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. Investigation and understanding of properties of the hadronic matter is among the important goals of NA61/SHINE collaboration at CERN SPS. Mapping of the phase diagram is achieved by varying the collision energy (5 GeV $&lt;\sqrt{s_{\textrm{NN}}}&lt;$17 GeV) and by changing the collision system (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb). We report on the measurement of femtoscopic correlations in intermediate system at intermediate SPS energies. Interpreting the results of measurements within the symmetric L\'evy source formalism, we discuss the values of L\'evy source parameters as a function of average pair transverse mass. One of the physical parameters is particularly important, the L\'evy exponent $\alpha$, which describes the shape of the source and may be related to the critical exponent $\eta$ in the proximity of the critical point. Therefore, measuring it may shed light on the location of the critical endpoint of the QCD phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of denoising diffusion probabilistic models for fast and high-fidelity whole-event simulation in high-energy heavy-ion experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational auto-encoders, and normalizing flows, have been widely used and studied as efficient alternatives for traditional scientific simulations. However, they have several drawbacks, including training instability and inability to cover the entire data distribution, especially for regions where data are rare. This is particularly challenging for whole-event, full-detector simulations in high-energy heavy-ion experiments, such as sPHENIX at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider experiments, where thousands of particles are produced per event and interact with the detector. This work investigates the effectiveness of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) as an AI-based generative surrogate model for the sPHENIX experiment that includes the heavy-ion event generation and response of the entire calorimeter stack. DDPM performance in sPHENIX simulation data is compared with a popular rival, GANs. Results show that both DDPMs and GANs can reproduce the data distribution where the examples are abundant (low-to-medium calorimeter energies). Nonetheless, DDPMs significantly outperform GANs, especially in high-energy regions where data are rare. Additionally, DDPMs exhibit superior stability compared to GANs. The results are consistent between both central and peripheral centrality heavy-ion collision events. Moreover, DDPMs offer a substantial speedup of approximately a factor of 100 compared to the traditional Geant4 simulation method.</description>

      <title>Exploring doubly-heavy tetraquarks in constituent-quark-model based meson-meson coupled-channels approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LHCb Collaboration announced in 2021 the discovery of a new tetraquark-like state, named $T_{cc}^+$, with minimum quark content $cc\bar u\bar d$, close to the $D^0D^{*+}$ threshold. This has motivated countless theoretical works trying to identify the dynamics which is responsible of the formation of such state; in particular, the one performed by us in Ref. \cite{Ortega:2022efc}, where a $D^0D^{*+}$ molecular candidate whose mass, width, scattering length and effective ranges are in reasonable agreement with experimental measurements. We explore herein the possibility of having $T_{cc}^+$ partners in all doubly-heavy tetraquark sectors, considering doubly represented light antiquarks $u$, $d$ or $s$, and taking into account all possible spin-parity quantum numbers. The computation is done using a constituent-quark-model based meson-meson coupled-channels framework which has been tested many times in the last fifteen years describing conventional heavy mesons and baryons, their coupling with hadron-hadron thresholds but also in exploring its application to compact multiquark structures. The advantage of using an approach with such a relatively large history is that it allows us to make predictions because all the parameters have already been constrained from our previous works. Then, from this perspective, we present a parameter-free model-dependent prediction of doubly-heavy tetraquarks that may be partners of the discovered $T_{cc}^+$ state.</description>

      <title>A universal reduced basis for the calibration of covariant energy density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reduced basis method is used to construct a "universal" basis of Dirac orbitals that may be applicable throughout the nuclear chart to calibrate covariant energy density functionals. Relative to our earlier work using the non-relativistic Schr\"odinger equation, the Dirac equation adds an extra layer of complexity due to the existence of negative energy states. However, once this problem is mitigated, the resulting reduced basis is able to accurately and efficiently reproduce the high-fidelity model at a fraction of the computational cost. We are confident that the resulting reduced basis will serve as a foundational element in developing rapid and accurate emulators. In turn, these emulators will play a critical role in the Bayesian optimization of covariant energy density functionals.</description>

      <title>Validating Automated Resonance Evaluation with Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integrity and precision of nuclear data are crucial for a broad spectrum of applications, from national security and nuclear reactor design to medical diagnostics, where the associated uncertainties can significantly impact outcomes. A substantial portion of uncertainty in nuclear data originates from the subjective biases in the evaluation process, a crucial phase in the nuclear data production pipeline. Recent advancements indicate that automation of certain routines can mitigate these biases, thereby standardizing the evaluation process, reducing uncertainty and enhancing reproducibility. This article contributes to developing a framework for automated evaluation techniques testing, emphasizing automated fitting methods that do not require the user to provide any prior information. This approach simplifies the process and reduces the manual effort needed in the initial evaluation stage. It highlights the capability of the framework to validate and optimize subroutines, targeting the performance analysis and optimization of the fitting procedure using high-fidelity synthetic data (labeled experimental data) and the concept of a fully controlled computational experiment. An error metric is introduced to provide a clear and intuitive measure of the fitting quality by quantifying the accuracy and performance across the specified energy. This metric sets a scale for comparison and optimization of routines or hyperparameter selection, improving the entire evaluation process methodology and increasing reproducibility and objectivity.</description>

      <title>First demonstration of a TES based cryogenic Li$_2$MoO$_4$detector for neutrinoless double beta decay search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic calorimetric experiments to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) are highly competitive, scalable and versatile in isotope. The largest planned detector array, CUPID, is comprised of about 1500 individual Li$_2^{100}$MoO$_{4}$ detector modules with a further scale up envisioned for a follow up experiment (CUPID-1T). In this article, we present a novel detector concept targeting this second stage with a low impedance TES based readout for the Li$_2$MoO$_{4}$ absorber that is easily mass-produced and lends itself to a multiplexed readout. We present the detector design and results from a first prototype detector operated at the NEXUS shallow underground facility at Fermilab. The detector is a 2-cm-side cube with 21$\,$g mass that is strongly thermally coupled to its readout chip to allow rise-times of $\sim$0.5$\,$ms. This design is more than one order of magnitude faster than present NTD based detectors and is hence expected to effectively mitigate backgrounds generated through the pile-up of two independent two neutrino decay events coinciding close in time. Together with a baseline resolution of 1.95$\,$keV (FWHM) these performance parameters extrapolate to a background index from pile-up as low as $5\cdot 10^{-6}\,$counts/keV/kg/yr in CUPID size crystals. The detector was calibrated up to the MeV region showing sufficient dynamic range for $0\nu\beta\beta$ searches. In combination with a SuperCDMS HVeV detector this setup also allowed us to perform a precision measurement of the scintillation time constants of Li$_2$MoO$_{4}$. The crystal showed a significant fast scintillation emission with O(10$\,\mu$s) time-scale, more than an order below the detector response of presently considered light detectors suggesting the possibility of further progress in pile-up rejection through better light detectors in the future.</description>

      <title>A novel measurement method for SiPM external crosstalk probability at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are being considered as potential replacements for conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). However, a significant disadvantage of SiPMs is crosstalk (CT), wherein photons propagate through other pixels, resulting in secondary avalanches. CT can be categorized into internal crosstalk and external crosstalk based on whether the secondary avalanche occurs within the same SiPM or a different one. Numerous methods exist for quantitatively estimating the percentage of internal crosstalk (iCT). However, external crosstalk (eCT) has not been extensively studied.
  This article presents a novel measurement method for the probability of emitting an external crosstalk photon during a single pixel avalanche, using a setup involving two identical SiPMs facing each other, and without the need for complex optical designs. The entire apparatus is enclosed within a stainless steel chamber, functioning as a light-tight enclosure, and maintained at liquid nitrogen temperature. The experimental setup incorporates two Sensl J-60035 SiPM chips along with two 0.5-inch Hamamatsu Photonics (HPK) VUV4 S13370-6050CN SiPM arrays. The findings show a linear relationship between the probability of emitting an external crosstalk photon and the SiPM overvoltage for both SiPM samples. Surprisingly, this novel measurement method also rovides measurements of the SiPM photon detection efficiency (PDE) for eCT photons at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Improved description of nuclear charge radii: Global trends beyond $N=28$ shell closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge radii measured with high accuracy provide a stringent benchmark for characterizing nuclear structure phenomena. In this work, the systematic evolution of charge radii for nuclei with $Z=19$-$29$ is investigated through relativistic mean field theory with effective forces NL3, PK1, and NL3$^{*}$. The neutron-proton ($np$) correlation around Fermi surface originated from the unpaired neutron and proton has been taken into account tentatively in order to reduce the overestimated odd-even staggering of charge radii. This improved method can give an available description of charge radii across $N=28$ shell closure. A remarkable observation is that the charge radii beyond $N=28$ shell closure follow the similarly steep increasing trend, namely irrespective of the number of protons in the nucleus. Especially, the latest results of charge radii for nickel and copper isotopes can be reproduced remarkably well. Along $N=28$ isotonic chain, the sudden increase of charge radii is weakened across $Z=20$, but presented evidently across $Z=28$ closed shell. The abrupt changes of charge radii across $Z=22$ are also shown along $N=32$ and $34$ isotones, but the latter with a less slope. This seems to provide a sensitive indicator to identify the new magicity of a nucleus with universal trend of charge radii.</description>

      <title>Elliptic flow of deuterons in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the elliptic flow of deuterons in Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV per colliding nucleon-nucleon pair and show that it can be used to discriminate between direct statistical production and coalescence. The emission from the fireball is parametrized and tuned to reproduce transverse momentum spectra and the elliptic flow of protons and pions. Coalescence leads to higher deuteron elliptic flow than statistical production and agrees better with experimental data. We attribute this observation to the varying size of the nucleon-producing region for the emission in different azimuthal angles.</description>
