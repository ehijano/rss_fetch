      <title>Observer Switching Strategy for Enhanced State Estimation in CSTR Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate state estimation is essential for monitoring and controlling nonlinear chemical reactors, such as continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs), where limited sensor coverage and process uncertainties hinder real-time observability. This paper introduces a novel multi-observer switching framework that combines several advanced estimators: Extended Luenberger Observer (ELO), Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), Quadrature Kalman Filter (QKF), and Particle Filter (PF), operating in parallel. At each sampling instant, a cost function based on the $L_1$ norm and Kullback-Leibler divergence selects the observer, yielding the best agreement with available measurements. The proposed architecture is validated through simulations of both linearized and fully nonlinear CSTR models with up to three reactors in series. Results show that the switching strategy significantly reduces estimation errors compared to single-observer approaches, especially under partial observability and parametric uncertainty. Despite its modular design, the framework remains computationally tractable, making it suitable for real-time industrial applications such as fault detection and model-based predictive control.</description>

      <title>Safe Domains of Attraction for Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems: Characterization and Verifiable Neural Network Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of nonlinear autonomous systems typically involves estimating domains of attraction, which have been a topic of extensive research interest for decades. Despite that, accurately estimating domains of attraction for nonlinear systems remains a challenging task, where existing methods are conservative or limited to low-dimensional systems. The estimation becomes even more challenging when accounting for state constraints. In this work, we propose a framework to accurately estimate safe (state-constrained) domains of attraction for discrete-time autonomous nonlinear systems. In establishing this framework, we first derive a new Zubov equation, whose solution corresponds to the exact safe domain of attraction. The solution to the aforementioned Zubov equation is shown to be unique and continuous over the whole state space. We then present a physics-informed approach to approximating the solution of the Zubov equation using neural networks. To obtain certifiable estimates of the domain of attraction from the neural network approximate solutions, we propose a verification framework that can be implemented using standard verification tools (e.g., $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN and dReal). To illustrate its effectiveness, we demonstrate our approach through numerical examples concerning nonlinear systems with state constraints.</description>

      <title>Implicit Constraint-Aware Off-Policy Correction for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning promises policy improvement from logged interaction data alone, yet state-of-the-art algorithms remain vulnerable to value over-estimation and to violations of domain knowledge such as monotonicity or smoothness. We introduce implicit constraint-aware off-policy correction, a framework that embeds structural priors directly inside every Bellman update. The key idea is to compose the optimal Bellman operator with a proximal projection on a convex constraint set, which produces a new operator that (i) remains a $\gamma$-contraction, (ii) possesses a unique fixed point, and (iii) enforces the prescribed structure exactly. A differentiable optimization layer solves the projection; implicit differentiation supplies gradients for deep function approximators at a cost comparable to implicit Q-learning. On a synthetic Bid-Click auction -- where the true value is provably monotone in the bid -- our method eliminates all monotonicity violations and outperforms conservative Q-learning and implicit Q-learning in return, regret, and sample efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Differential Equation Framework for Modeling Queue Length Dynamics Inspired by Self-Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article develops a stochastic differential equation (SDE) for modeling the temporal evolution of queue length dynamics at signalized intersections. Inspired by the observed quasiperiodic and self-similar characteristics of the queue length dynamics, the proposed model incorporates three properties into the SDE: (i) mean reversion with periodic mean, (ii) multiplicative noise, and (iii) fractional Brownian motion. It replicates key statistical features observed in real data, including the probability distribution function (PDF) and PSD of queue lengths. To our knowledge, this is the first equation-based model for queue dynamics. The proposed approach offers a transparent, data-consistent framework that may help inform and enhance the design of black-box learning algorithms with underlying traffic physics.</description>

      <title>Extracting transient Koopman modes from short-term weather simulations with sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convective features-here represented as warm bubble-like patterns-reveal essential, high-level information about how short-term weather dynamics evolve within a high-dimensional state space. We introduce a data-driven framework that uncovers transient dynamics captured by Koopman modes responsible for these structures and traces their emergence, growth, and decay. Our approach incorporates the sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition into the framework of Koopman mode decomposition, yielding a few number of selected modes whose sparse amplitudes highlight dominant transient structures. By tuning the sparsity weight, we balance reconstruction accuracy and model complexity. We illustrate the methodology on weather simulations, using the magnitude of velocity and vorticity fields as distinct observable datasets. The resulting sparse dominant Koopman modes capture the transient evolution of bubble-like pattern and can reduce the dimensionality of the weather system model, offering an efficient surrogate for diagnostic and forecasting tasks.</description>

      <title>Considering the multi-time scale rolling optimization scheduling method of micro-energy network connected to electric vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale access of electric vehicles to the power grid not only provides flexible adjustment resources for the power system, but the temporal uncertainty and distribution complexity of their energy interaction pose significant challenges to the economy and robustness of the micro-energy network. In this paper, we propose a multi-time scale rolling optimization scheduling method for micro-energy networks considering the access of electric vehicles. In order to solve the problem of evaluating the dispatchable potential of electric vehicle clusters, a charging station aggregation model was constructed based on Minkowski summation theory, and the scattered electric vehicle resources were aggregated into virtual energy storage units to participate in system scheduling. Integrate price-based and incentive-based demand response mechanisms to synergistically tap the potential of source-load two-side regulation; On this basis, a two-stage optimal scheduling model of day-ahead and intra-day is constructed. The simulation results show that the proposed method reduces the scale of "preventive curtailment" due to more accurate scheduling, avoids the threat of power shortage to the safety of the power grid, and has more advantages in the efficiency of new energy consumption. At the same time, intra-day scheduling significantly reduces economic penalties and operating costs by avoiding output shortages, and improves the economy of the system in an uncertain forecasting environment.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Forecasting Accuracy in Dynamic Environments via PELT-Driven Drift Detection and Model Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate time series forecasting models are often compromised by data drift, where underlying data distributions change over time, leading to significant declines in prediction performance. To address this challenge, this study proposes an adaptive forecasting framework that integrates drift detection with targeted model retraining to compensate for drift effects. The framework utilizes the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm to identify drift points within the feature space of time series data. Once drift intervals are detected, selective retraining is applied to prediction models using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Lasso Regressor architectures, allowing the models to adjust to changing data patterns. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on two datasets: a real-world dataset containing electricity consumption and HVAC system data, and a synthetic financial dataset designed to test cross-domain applicability. Initial baseline models were developed without drift detection using extensive feature engineering. After integrating drift-aware retraining, the MLP model achieved a 44% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) and a 39% increase in R^2 on the real-world dataset, while even greater improvements were observed on the synthetic financial dataset. Similar enhancements were achieved with the Lasso Regressor. These results highlight the robustness and generalizability of incorporating drift detection and adaptive retraining to sustain forecasting accuracy across diverse domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a sliding mode controller using the backstepping approach. The controller is employed to synthesize tracking errors and Lyapunov functions. A novel state-space representation is formulated by incorporating the dynamics of the quadrotor and accounting for non-holonomic constraints. The proposed sliding mode controller effectively addresses system nonlinearities and improves tracking of predefined trajectories. Simulation results are presented graphically to demonstrate the controller's performance.</description>

      <title>Techno-economic optimization of hybrid steam-electric energy systems with excess heat utilization and reserve market participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the economic viability and optimal configuration of a hybrid industrial energy system combining an electrode boiler, steam accumulator, and battery energy storage system (BESS). This study optimizes system operation for a specific configuration to minimize net energy costs, defined as energy costs minus profits from price arbitrage and reserve markets. The optimization uses load shifting, peak shaving, and frequency containment reserve market participation with hourly 2024 data from Norway and Germany. Net present value (NPV) analysis was performed to determine the most cost-efficient energy storage configurations. The results show that current investment costs favor steam accumulators over BESS in both countries. However, a reduction in BESS cost will make batteries economically competitive, particularly in Germany, where high price volatility and power-based grid tariffs provide stronger incentives for load shifting and peak shaving. Participation in the FCR market accounted for a 17% and 7% reduction of the net energy costs in Norway and Germany, respectively. Utilization of excess heat, through inlet water preheating, further reduced the net energy costs. Sensitivity analyses confirm that investment costs, especially for BESS, strongly influence optimal system design. These findings offer guidance for industrial flexibility investments across diverse electricity markets.</description>

      <title>Network-Independent Incremental Passivity Conditions for Grid-Forming Inverter Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid-forming inverters control the power transfer between the AC and DC sides of an electrical grid while maintaining the frequency and voltage of the AC side. This paper focuses on ensuring large-signal stability of an electrical grid with inverter-interfaced renewable sources. We prove that the Hybrid-Angle Control (HAC) scheme for grid-forming inverters can exhibit incremental passivity properties between current and voltage at both the AC and DC ports. This incremental passivity can be certified through decentralized conditions. Inverters operating under HAC can, therefore, be connected to other passive elements (e.g. transmission lines) with an immediate guarantee of global transient stability regardless of the network topology or parameters. Passivity of Hybrid Angle Control is also preserved under small-signal (linearized) analyses, in contrast to conventional proportional droop laws that are passivity-short at low frequencies. Passivity and interconnected-stability properties are demonstrated through an example case study.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Knowledge Transfer for a Kalman Fixed-Lag Interval Smoother</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Bayesian knowledge transfer mechanism that leverages external information to improve the performance of the Kalman fixed-lag interval smoother (FLIS) is proposed. Exact knowledge of the external observation model is assumed to be missing, which hinders the direct application of Bayes' rule in traditional transfer learning approaches. This limitation is overcome by the fully probabilistic design, conditioning the targeted task of state estimation on external information. To mitigate the negative impact of inaccurate external data while leveraging precise information, a latent variable is introduced. Favorably, in contrast to a filter, FLIS retrospectively refines past decisions up to a fixed time horizon, reducing the accumulation of estimation error and consequently improving the performance of state inference. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm better exploits precise external knowledge compared to a similar technique and achieves comparable results when the information is imprecise.</description>

      <title>Modeling Uncertainty: From Simulink to Stochastic Hybrid Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulink is widely used in industrial design processes to model increasingly complex embedded control systems. Thus, their formal analysis is highly desirable. However, this comes with two major challenges: First, Simulink models often provide an idealized view of real-life systems and omit uncertainties such as, aging, sensor noise or failures. Second, the semantics of Simulink is only informally defined. In this paper, we present an approach to formally analyze safety and performance of embedded control systems modeled in Simulink in the presence of uncertainty. To achieve this, we 1) model different types of uncertainties as stochastic Simulink subsystems and 2) extend an existing formalization of the Simulink semantics based on stochastic hybrid automata (SHA) by providing transformation rules for the stochastic subsystems. Our approach gives us access to established quantitative analysis techniques, like statistical model checking and reachability analysis. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by analyzing safety and performance in the presence of uncertainty for two smaller case studies.</description>

      <title>PGLib-CO2: A Power Grid Library for Computing and Optimizing Carbon Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sustainable electricity infrastructure requires the explicit integration of carbon emissions into power system modeling and optimization paradigms. However, existing open-source datasets for power system R&amp;D lack generator-level carbon emission profiling, limiting the ability to benchmark and compare various carbon-aware grid operational strategies. To address this gap, this work introduces PGLib-CO2, an open-source extension to the widely adopted PGLib-OPF test case library. PGLib-CO2 enriches standard network cases with CO2 and CO2-equivalent emission intensity factors by expanding the fuel-type categorization used by PGLib-OPF, attaining a realistic generator-level carbon profiling. It is also packaged for both Python's pandapower and Julia's PowerModels.jl, for a seamless, user-friendly integration of emission modeling into grid computation and optimization tasks. The dataset produced by PGLib-CO2 can support grid-based carbon accounting, emission metric evaluation, and integration into AC optimal power flow (OPF) and optimal load shifting (OLS) formulations. We demonstrate PGLib-CO2's utility through case studies that quantify cost-emission trade-offs and optimize a carbon-aware objective function. By standardizing carbon-enhanced test cases, PGLib-CO2 provides an open-source, reproducible foundation for benchmarking carbon-aware computation, facilitating future research in sustainable power system operation.</description>

      <title>Swarm-STL: A Framework for Motion Planning in Large-Scale, Multi-Swarm Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multi-agent systems, signal temporal logic (STL) is widely used for path planning to accomplish complex objectives with formal safety guarantees. However, as the number of agents increases, existing approaches encounter significant computational challenges. Recognizing that many complex tasks require cooperation among multiple agents, we propose swarm STL specifications to describe the collective tasks that need to be achieved by a team of agents. Next, we address the motion planning problem for all the agents in two stages. First, we abstract a group of cooperating agents as a swarm and construct a reduced-dimension state space whose dimension does not increase with the number of agents. The path planning is performed at the swarm level, ensuring the safety and swarm STL specifications are satisfied. Then, we design low-level control strategies for agents within each swarm based on the path synthesized in the first step. The trajectories of agents generated by the two-step policy ensure satisfaction of the STL specifications. We evaluate our two-stage approach in both single-swarm and multi-swarm scenarios. The results demonstrate that all tasks are completed with safety guarantees. Compared to the baseline multi-agent planning approach, our method maintains computational efficiency as the number of agents increases, since the computational time scales with the number of swarms rather than the number of agents.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Meta-Learning Framework for Anomaly Forecasting in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems via Physics-Inspired Simulation and Deep Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid meta-learning framework for forecasting and anomaly detection in nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by nonstationary and stochastic behavior. The approach integrates a physics-inspired simulator that captures nonlinear growth-relaxation dynamics with random perturbations, representative of many complex physical, industrial, and cyber-physical systems. We use CNN-LSTM architectures for spatio-temporal feature extraction, Variational Autoencoders (VAE) for unsupervised anomaly scoring, and Isolation Forests for residual-based outlier detection in addition to a Dual-Stage Attention Recurrent Neural Network (DA-RNN) for one-step forecasting on top of the generated simulation data. To create composite anomaly forecasts, these models are combined using a meta-learner that combines forecasting outputs, reconstruction errors, and residual scores. The hybrid ensemble performs better than standalone models in anomaly localization, generalization, and robustness to nonlinear deviations, according to simulation-based experiments. The framework provides a broad, data-driven approach to early defect identification and predictive monitoring in nonlinear systems, which may be applied to a variety of scenarios where complete physical models might not be accessible.</description>

      <title>Quadrotor Morpho-Transition: Learning vs Model-Based Control Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadrotor Morpho-Transition, or the act of transitioning from air to ground through mid-air transformation, involves complex aerodynamic interactions and a need to operate near actuator saturation, complicating controller design. In recent work, morpho-transition has been studied from a model-based control perspective, but these approaches remain limited due to unmodeled dynamics and the requirement for planning through contacts. Here, we train an end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) controller to learn a morpho-transition policy and demonstrate successful transfer to hardware. We find that the RL control policy achieves agile landing, but only transfers to hardware if motor dynamics and observation delays are taken into account. On the other hand, a baseline MPC controller transfers out-of-the-box without knowledge of the actuator dynamics and delays, at the cost of reduced recovery from disturbances in the event of unknown actuator failures. Our work opens the way for more robust control of agile in-flight quadrotor maneuvers that require mid-air transformation.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Test Platform for Vision Language Model (VLM)-Integrated Real-World Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated notable promise in autonomous driving by offering the potential for multimodal reasoning through pretraining on extensive image-text pairs. However, adapting these models from broad web-scale data to the safety-critical context of driving presents a significant challenge, commonly referred to as domain shift. Existing simulation-based and dataset-driven evaluation methods, although valuable, often fail to capture the full complexity of real-world scenarios and cannot easily accommodate repeatable closed-loop testing with flexible scenario manipulation. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical real-world test platform specifically designed to evaluate VLM-integrated autonomous driving systems. Our approach includes a modular, low-latency on-vehicle middleware that allows seamless incorporation of various VLMs, a clearly separated perception-planning-control architecture that can accommodate both VLM-based and conventional modules, and a configurable suite of real-world testing scenarios on a closed track that facilitates controlled yet authentic evaluations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed platform`s testing and evaluation ability with a case study involving a VLM-enabled autonomous vehicle, highlighting how our test framework supports robust experimentation under diverse conditions.</description>

      <title>Hard Contacts with Soft Gradients: Refining Differentiable Simulators for Learning and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contact forces pose a major challenge for gradient-based optimization of robot dynamics as they introduce jumps in the system's velocities. Penalty-based simulators, such as MuJoCo, simplify gradient computation by softening the contact forces. However, realistically simulating hard contacts requires very stiff contact settings, which leads to incorrect gradients when using automatic differentiation. On the other hand, using non-stiff settings strongly increases the sim-to-real gap. We analyze the contact computation of penalty-based simulators to identify the causes of gradient errors. Then, we propose DiffMJX, which combines adaptive integration with MuJoCo XLA, to notably improve gradient quality in the presence of hard contacts. Finally, we address a key limitation of contact gradients: they vanish when objects do not touch. To overcome this, we introduce Contacts From Distance (CFD), a mechanism that enables the simulator to generate informative contact gradients even before objects are in contact. To preserve physical realism, we apply CFD only in the backward pass using a straight-through trick, allowing us to compute useful gradients without modifying the forward simulation.</description>

      <title>Pose State Perception of Interventional Robot for Cardio-cerebrovascular Procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In response to the increasing demand for cardiocerebrovascular interventional surgeries, precise control of interventional robots has become increasingly important. Within these complex vascular scenarios, the accurate and reliable perception of the pose state for interventional robots is particularly crucial. This paper presents a novel vision-based approach without the need of additional sensors or markers. The core of this paper's method consists of a three-part framework: firstly, a dual-head multitask U-Net model for simultaneous vessel segment and interventional robot detection; secondly, an advanced algorithm for skeleton extraction and optimization; and finally, a comprehensive pose state perception system based on geometric features is implemented to accurately identify the robot's pose state and provide strategies for subsequent control. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed method's high reliability and accuracy in trajectory tracking and pose state perception.</description>

      <title>A Novel Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation Design for 100G Coherent Passive Optical Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancements in coherent Passive Optical Network (PON) technologies featuring 100G and higher data rates, this paper addresses the urgent requirement for sophisticated simulation and MAC layer development within the domain of coherent Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) PON and coherent Time and Frequency Division Multiplexing (TFDM) PON networks. The ever-growing demand for latency-sensitive services and expanding user populations in next-generation 100G and beyond coherent PONs, underscores the crucial need for low-latency bandwidth management and efficient Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) mechanisms. In this paper, we present a pioneering analysis of two established DBAs from the perspective of temporal misalignments. Subsequently, a novel DBA algorithm tailored for coherent PONs featuring 100 Gbps data rate and up to 512 end-users is introduced, named the Hybrid-Switch DBA. This innovative approach allows for adaptive switching of the DBA scheme in response to real-time traffic conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first attempt to address the misalignment problem of DBA and proposes a novel DBA solution for both TDM- and TFDM-based coherent PON networks. This research significantly contributes to the development of coherent TDM PON and coherent TFDM PON networks by enhancing the efficiency of bandwidth allocation and addressing the challenges associated with misalignments in DBA mechanisms. As optical access networks continue to evolve to meet the ever-increasing demands of modern communication services, the Hybrid-Switch DBA algorithm presented in this paper offers a promising solution for optimizing network performance and accommodating latency-sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>Barrier Method for Inequality Constrained Factor Graph Optimization with Application to Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Factor graphs have demonstrated remarkable efficiency for robotic perception tasks, particularly in localization and mapping applications. However, their application to optimal control problems -- especially Model Predictive Control (MPC) -- has remained limited due to fundamental challenges in constraint handling. This paper presents a novel integration of the Barrier Interior Point Method (BIPM) with factor graphs, implemented as an open-source extension to the widely adopted g2o framework. Our approach introduces specialized inequality factor nodes that encode logarithmic barrier functions, thereby overcoming the quadratic-form limitations of conventional factor graph formulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first g2o-based implementation capable of efficiently handling both equality and inequality constraints within a unified optimization backend. We validate the method through a multi-objective adaptive cruise control application for autonomous vehicles. Benchmark comparisons with state-of-the-art constraint-handling techniques demonstrate faster convergence and improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: We provide the first known algorithm that provably achieves $\varepsilon$-optimality within $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\varepsilon)$ function evaluations for the discounted discrete-time LQR problem with unknown parameters, without relying on two-point gradient estimates. These estimates are known to be unrealistic in many settings, as they depend on using the exact same initialization, which is to be selected randomly, for two different policies. Our results substantially improve upon the existing literature outside the realm of two-point gradient estimates, which either leads to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\varepsilon^2)$ rates or heavily relies on stability assumptions.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Theta Method for Systems with Multiple Time-Delayed Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper focuses on the numerical stability and accuracy of implicit time-domain integration (TDI) methods when applied for the solution of a power system model impacted by time delays. Such a model is generally formulated as a set of delay differential algebraic equations (DDAEs) in non index-1 Hessenberg form. In particular, the paper shows that numerically stable ordinary differential equation (ODE) methods, such as the trapezoidal and the Theta method, can become unstable when applied to a power system that includes a significant number of delayed variables. Numerical stability is discussed through a scalar test delay differential equation, as well as through a matrix pencil approach that accounts for the DDAEs of any given dynamic power system model. Simulation results are presented in a case study based on the IEEE 39-bus system.</description>

      <title>From Data to Control: A Formal Compositional Framework for Large-Scale Interconnected Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a compositional data-driven methodology with noisy data for designing fully-decentralized safety controllers applicable to large-scale interconnected networks, encompassing a vast number of subsystems with unknown mathematical models. Our compositional scheme leverages the interconnection topology and breaks down the network analysis into the examination of distinct subsystems. This is accompanied by utilizing a concept of control storage certificates (CSCs) to capture joint dissipativity-type properties among subsystems. These CSCs are instrumental in a compositional derivation of a control barrier certificate (CBC) specialized for the interconnected network, thereby ensuring its safety. In our data-driven scheme, we gather only a single noise-corrupted input-state trajectory from each unknown subsystem within a specified time frame. By fulfilling a specific rank condition, this process facilitates the construction of a CSC for each subsystem. Following this, by adhering to compositional dissipativity reasoning, we compose CSCs derived from noisy data and build a CBC for the unknown network, ensuring its safety over an infinite time horizon, while providing correctness guarantees. We demonstrate that our compositional data-driven approach significantly enhances the design of a CBC and its robust safety controller under noisy data across the interconnected network. This advancement is achieved by reducing the computational complexity from a polynomial growth in relation to network dimension, when using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization, to a linear scale based on the number of subsystems. We apply our data-driven findings to a variety of benchmarks, involving physical networks with unknown models and diverse interconnection topologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive stability results for finite control set and mixed-integer model predictive control with a downstream oversampling phase. The presentation rests upon the inherent robustness of model predictive control with stabilizing terminal conditions and techniques for solving mixed-integer optimal control problems by continuous optimization. Partial outer convexification and binary relaxation transform mixed-integer problems into common optimal control problems. We deduce nominal asymptotic stability for the resulting relaxed system formulation and implement sum-up rounding to restore efficiently integer feasibility on an oversampling time grid. If fast control switching is technically possible and inexpensive, we can approximate the relaxed system behavior in the state space arbitrarily close. We integrate input perturbed model predictive control with practical asymptotic stability. Numerical experiments illustrate practical relevance of fast control switching.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Critic Augmentation for Hierarchical Multi-Agent EV Charging Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18047v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advanced bidirectional EV charging and discharging technology, aimed at supporting grid stability and emergency operations, has driven a growing interest in workplace applications. It not only reduces electricity expenses but also enhances the resilience in handling practical matters, such as peak power limitation, fluctuating energy prices, and unpredictable EV departures. Considering these factors systematically can benefit energy efficiency in office buildings and for EV users simultaneously. To employ AI to address these issues, we propose HUCA, a novel real-time charging control for regulating energy demands for both the building and EVs. HUCA employs hierarchical actor-critic networks to dynamically reduce electricity costs in buildings, accounting for the needs of EV charging in the dynamic pricing scenario. To tackle the uncertain EV departures, we introduce a new critic augmentation to account for departure uncertainties in evaluating the charging decisions, while maintaining the robustness of the charging control. Experiments on real-world electricity datasets under both simulated certain and uncertain departure scenarios demonstrate that HUCA outperforms baselines in terms of total electricity costs while maintaining competitive performance in fulfilling EV charging requirements. A case study also manifests that HUCA effectively balances energy supply between the building and EVs based on real-time information, showcasing its potential as a key AI-driven solution for vehicle charging control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models that contain intersample behavior are important for control design of systems with slow-rate outputs. The aim of this paper is to develop a system identification technique for fast-rate models of systems where only slow-rate output measurements are available, e.g., vision-in-the-loop systems. In this paper, the intersample response is estimated by identifying fast-rate models through least-squares criteria, and the limitations of these models are determined. In addition, a method is developed that surpasses these limitations and is capable of estimating unique fast-rate models of arbitrary order by regularizing the least-squares estimate. The developed method utilizes fast-rate inputs and slow-rate outputs and identifies fast-rate models accurately in a single identification experiment. Finally, both simulation and experimental validation on a prototype wafer stage demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on multirate time-domain simulations of power system models. It proposes a matrix pencil-based approach to evaluate the spurious numerical deformation introduced into power system dynamics by a given multirate integration scheme. Moreover, it considers the problem of multirate partitioning and discusses a strategy for allocating state and algebraic variables to fast and slow subsystems based on modal participation factors (PFs). The suitability and features of the proposed approach are illustrated through numerical simulations that assess the accuracy effects of interfacing, as well as of various prediction and solution methods.</description>

      <title>Exact Characterization of Aggregate Flexibility via Generalized Polymatroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well established that the aggregate flexibility inherent in populations of distributed energy resources (DERs) can be leveraged to mitigate the intermittency and uncertainty associated with renewable generation, while also providing ancillary grid services. To enable this, aggregators must effectively represent the flexibility in the populations they control to the market or system operator. A key challenge is accurately computing the aggregate flexibility of a population, which can be formally expressed as the Minkowski sum of a collection of polytopes, a problem that is generally computationally intractable. However, the flexibility polytopes of many DERs exhibit structural symmetries that can be exploited for computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce generalized polymatroids, a family of polytopes, into the flexibility aggregation literature. We demonstrate that individual flexibility sets belong to this family, enabling efficient computation of their exact Minkowski sum. For homogeneous populations of DERs we further derive simplifications that yield more succinct representations of aggregate flexibility. Additionally, we develop an efficient optimization framework over these sets and propose a vertex-based disaggregation method, to allocate aggregate flexibility among individual DERs. Finally, we validate the optimality and computational efficiency of our approach through comparisons with existing methods.</description>

      <title>Fast Contact Detection via Fusion of Joint and Inertial Sensors for Parallel Robots in Human-Robot Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast contact detection is crucial for safe human-robot collaboration. Observers based on proprioceptive information can be used for contact detection but have first-order error dynamics, which results in delays. Sensor fusion based on inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of accelerometers and gyroscopes is advantageous for reducing delays. The acceleration estimation enables the direct calculation of external forces. For serial robots, the installation of multiple accelerometers and gyroscopes is required for dynamics modeling since the joint coordinates are the minimal coordinates. Alternatively, parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential to use only one IMU on the end-effector platform, which already presents the minimal coordinates of the PR. This work introduces a sensor-fusion method for contact detection using encoders and only one low-cost, consumer-grade IMU for a PR. The end-effector accelerations are estimated by an extended Kalman filter and incorporated into the dynamics to calculate external forces. In real-world experiments with a planar PR, we demonstrate that this approach reduces the detection duration by up to 50% compared to a momentum observer and enables the collision and clamping detection within 3-39ms.</description>

      <title>TIP-Search: Time-Predictable Inference Scheduling for Market Prediction under Uncertain Load</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes TIP-Search, a time-predictable inference scheduling framework for real-time market prediction under uncertain workloads. Motivated by the strict latency demands in high-frequency financial systems, TIP-Search dynamically selects a deep learning model from a heterogeneous pool, aiming to maximize predictive accuracy while satisfying per-task deadline constraints. Our approach profiles latency and generalization performance offline, then performs online task-aware selection without relying on explicit input domain labels. We evaluate TIP-Search on three real-world limit order book datasets (FI-2010, Binance BTC/USDT, LOBSTER AAPL) and demonstrate that it outperforms static baselines with up to 8.5% improvement in accuracy and 100% deadline satisfaction. Our results highlight the effectiveness of TIP-Search in robust low-latency financial inference under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>From Ground to Sky: Architectures, Applications, and Challenges Shaping Low-Altitude Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a novel low-altitude wireless network (LAWN), which is a reconfigurable, three-dimensional (3D) layered architecture. In particular, the LAWN integrates connectivity, sensing, control, and computing across aerial and terrestrial nodes that enable seamless operation in complex, dynamic, and mission-critical environments. Different from the conventional aerial communication systems, LAWN's distinctive feature is its tight integration of functional planes in which multiple functionalities continually reshape themselves to operate safely and efficiently in the low-altitude sky. With the LAWN, we discuss several enabling technologies, such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), semantic communication, and fully-actuated control systems. Finally, we identify potential applications and key cross-layer challenges. This article offers a comprehensive roadmap for future research and development in the low-altitude airspace.</description>
