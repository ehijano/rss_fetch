      <title>Virtual reality and web browser visualization of high-intensity laser-matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Virtual Beamline (VBL) application, an interactive web-based platform for visualizing high-intensity laser-matter simulations (and experimental data in the future). Developed at ELI Beamlines facility, VBL integrates a custom-built WebGL engine with WebXR-based Virtual Reality (VR) support, allowing users to explore complex plasma dynamics in non-VR mode on a computer screen or in fully immersive VR mode using a head-mounted display. The application runs directly in a standard web browser, ensuring broad accessibility. VBL enhances the visualization of particle-in-cell simulations by efficiently processing and rendering four main data types: point particles, 1D lines, 2D textures, and 3D volumes. By utilizing interactive 3D visualization, it overcomes the limitations of traditional 2D representations, offering enhanced spatial understanding and real-time manipulation of visualization parameters such as time steps, data layers, colormaps. The user can interactively explore the visualized data by moving their body or using a controller for navigation, zooming, and rotation. These interactive capabilities improve data exploration and interpretation, making the platform valuable for both scientific analysis and educational outreach. We demonstrate the application of VBL in visualizing various high-intensity laser-matter interaction scenarios, including ion acceleration, electron acceleration, $\gamma$-flash generation, electron-positron pair production, attosecond and spiral pulse generation. The visualizations are hosted online and freely accessible on our server. These studies highlight VBL's ability to provide an intuitive and dynamic approach to exploring large-scale simulation datasets, enhancing research capabilities and knowledge dissemination in high-intensity laser-matter physics.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Particle Heating in Shocks and Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particles are heated efficiently through energy conversion processes such as shocks and magnetic reconnection in collisionless plasma environments. While empirical scaling laws for the temperature increase have been obtained, the precise mechanism of energy partition between ions and electrons remains unclear. Here we show, based on coupled theoretical and observational scaling analyses, that the temperature increase, $\Delta T$, depends linearly on three factors: the available magnetic energy per particle, the Alfv\'{e}n Mach number (or reconnection rate), and the characteristic spatial scale $L$. Based on statistical datasets obtained from Earth's plasma environment, we find that $L$ is on the order of (1) the ion gyro-radius for ion heating at shocks, (2) the ion inertial length for ion heating in magnetic reconnection, and (3) the hybrid inertial length for electron heating in both shocks and magnetic reconnection. With these scales, we derive the ion-to-electron ratios of temperature increase as $\Delta T_{\rm i}/\Delta T_{\rm e} = (3\beta_{\rm i}/2)^{1/2}(m_{\rm i}/m_{\rm e})^{1/4}$ for shocks and $\Delta T_{\rm i}/\Delta T_{\rm e} = (m_{\rm i}/m_{\rm e})^{1/4}$ for magnetic reconnection, where $\beta_{\rm i}$ is the ion plasma beta, and $m_{\rm i}$ and $ m_{\rm e}$ are the ion and electron particle masses, respectively. We anticipate that this study will serve as a starting point for a better understanding of particle heating in space plasmas, enabling more sophisticated modeling of its scaling and universality.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Hall Effect Implementations in Hall-Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is no standard numerical implementation of the Hall effect, which is one of the non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects. Numerical instability arises when a simple implementation is used, in which the Hall electric field is added to the electric field to update magnetic fields without further modifications to the numerical scheme. In this paper, several implementations proposed in the literature are compared to identify an approach that provides stable and accurate results. We consider two types of implementations of the Hall effect. One is a modified version of the Harten-Lax-van Leer method (Hall-HLL) in which the phase speeds of whistler waves are adopted as the signal speeds; the other involves adding a fourth-order hyper-resistivity to a Hall-MHD code. Based on an extensive series of test calculations, we found that hyper-resistivity yields more accurate results than the Hall-HLL, particularly in problems where the whisler-wave timescale is shorter than the the timescale of physical processes of interest. Through both von Neumann stability analysis and numerical experiments, an appropriate coefficient for the hyper-resistivity is determined.</description>

      <title>Symplectic integration of guiding-center equations in canonical coordinates for general toroidal fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15278v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symplectic integrators with long-term preservation of integrals of motion are introduced for the guiding-center model of plasma particles in toroidal magnetic fields of general topology. An efficient transformation to canonical coordinates from cylindrical and flux-like coordinates is discussed and applied using one component of the magnetic vector potential as a spatial coordinate. This choice is efficient in both, theoretical and numerical developments and marks a generalization of magnetic flux coordinates. The transformation enables the application of conventional symplectic integration schemes formulated in canonical coordinates, as well as variational integrators on the guiding-center system, without requiring magnetic flux coordinates. Symplectic properties and superior efficiency of the implicit midpoint scheme compared to conventional non-symplectic methods are demonstrated on perturbed tokamak fields with magnetic islands and stochastic regions. The presented results mark a crucial step towards gyrokinetic models that conserve physical invariants.</description>

      <title>Chaos aided regime of Laser/Electromagnetic Energy Absorption by plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absorption of laser energy by plasma is of paramount importance for various applications. Collisional and resonant processes are often invoked for this purpose. However, in some contexts (e.g. in vacuum and the JxB heating), the energy transfer occurs even when plasma is collisionless, and there is no resonant process involved. The energy absorption in these cases has been attributed to the sheath electrostatic fields that get generated as the electrons are pulled out in the vacuum from the plasma medium. The origin of irreversibility aiding the absorption, in these cases, remains to be understood. Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations using the OSIRIS 4.0 platform have been carried out. The nearby trajectories of lighter electron species involved in the interaction with the laser show exponential separation. This is confirmed by the positive Lyapunov index and also by other characterizations. The observations in these cases are contrasted with the electron cyclotron resonant case, which shows negligible chaos in the electron trajectories despite the energy absorption percentage being high.</description>

      <title>Laser pulse focusing and energetic electron generation by magnetized plasma lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient mechanism of laser pulse focusing with the help of shaped underdense plasma target immersed in inhomogeneous magnetic field has been demonstrated. These studies have been carried out with the help of 2-D Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation employing the OSIRIS 4.0 platform. It is shown that the divergent magnetic field profile compresses the EM wave pulse in the transverse direction. A comparative investigation with plane and lens shaped plasma geometries has also been conducted to find an optimal configuration for focusing the laser at the desirable location. Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that when the electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) layer is placed at a suitable location where the laser is focused, a highly energetic electron beam gets generated.</description>

      <title>Terahertz radiation generation by laser-resonant excitation of terahertz surface magnetoplasmons on a graphene-n-InSb semiconductor interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for the laser-excitation of terahertz surface magnetoplasmons via the linear mode conversion of terahertz radiation on a graphene sheet deposited on an n-type semiconductor in presence of an external magnetic field parallel to the semiconductor surface. An obliquely incident p-polarized laser beam interacting with the graphene n-InSb semiconductor surface, imparts linear oscillatory velocity to the free electrons. This oscillatory velocity couples with the modulated electron density to generate a linear current density, which resonantly excites terahertz surface magnetoplasmons. It is shown that the amplitude of terahertz surface magnetoplasmons wave can be tuned by adjusting the external magnetic field ($\text{B}_{0}$), the graphene's Fermi energy ($\text{E}_\text{F}$), the semiconductor's temperature (T), and the incident angle ($\theta$) of laser. This mechanism has the potential to enable the development of an actively tunable plasmonic device.</description>

      <title>On the linear structure of the interlaced Alfv\'en vortices in the tail of Uranus at solstice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incompressible vortex flow are observed in a large variety of astrophysical plasmas such as the convection zone and the atmosphere of stars, in astrophysical jets in stellar winds and in planetary magnetospheres. More specifically, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations have shown that two large scale interlaced Alfv\'enic vortices structure the magnetic tail of Uranus at solstice time. Assuming identical vortices, we compute the general linear structure of the flow near their centers within the frame of ideal MHD. We then use the analytic results to interpret and qualify the vortices observed in a 3D MHD simulation of a fast rotating Uranus-type planet.</description>

      <title>Turbulent power: a discriminator between sheaths and CMEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) directed at the Earth often drive large geomagnetic storms. Here we use velocity, magnetic field and proton density data from 152 CMEs that were sampled in-situ at 1 AU by the WIND spacecraft. We Fourier analyze fluctuations of these quantities in the quiescent pre-CME solar wind, sheath and magnetic cloud. We quantify the extent by which the power in turbulent (magnetic field, velocity and density) fluctuations in the sheath exceeds that in the solar wind background and in the magnetic cloud. For instance, the mean value of the power per unit volume in magnetic field fluctuations in the sheath is 76.7 times that in the solar wind background, while the mean value of the power per unit mass in velocity fluctuations in the sheath is 9 times that in the magnetic cloud. Our detailed results show that the turbulent fluctuation power is a useful discriminator between the ambient solar wind background, sheaths and magnetic clouds and can serve as a useful input for space weather prediction.</description>

      <title>A Unified Phenomenology of Ion Heating in Low-$\beta$ Plasmas: Test-Particle Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that two prominent theories of ion heating in low-$\beta$ collisionless plasmas -- stochastic and quasi-linear heating -- represent similar physical processes in turbulence with different normalized cross helicities. To capture both, we propose a simple phenomenology based on the power in scales at which critically balanced fluctuations reach their smallest parallel scale. Simulations of test ions interacting with turbulence confirm our scalings across a wide range of different ion and turbulence properties, including with a steep ion-kinetic transition range as relevant to the solar wind.</description>
