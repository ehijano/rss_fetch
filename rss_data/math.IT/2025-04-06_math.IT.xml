      <title>Low-Complexity Permutational Index Modulation for Noncoherent Massive SIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a massive SIMO scheme for wireless communications with one-shot noncoherent detection. It is based on permutational index modulation over OFDM. Its core principle is to convey information on the ordering in which a fixed collection of values is mapped onto a set of OFDM subcarriers. A spherical code is obtained which provides improved robustness against channel impairments. A simple detector based on the sorting of quadratic metrics of data is proposed. By exploiting statistical channel state information and hardening, it reaches a near-ML error performance with a low-complexity implementation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Erasure Codes and Codes on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct constant-sized ensembles of linear error-correcting codes over any fixed alphabet that can correct a given fraction of adversarial erasures at rates approaching the Singleton bound arbitrarily closely. We provide several applications of our results:
  1. Explicit constructions of strong linear seeded symbol-fixing extractors and lossless condensers, over any fixed alphabet, with only a constant seed length and optimal output lengths;
  2. A strongly explicit construction of erasure codes on bipartite graphs (more generally, linear codes on matrices of arbitrary dimensions) with optimal rate and erasure-correction trade-offs;
  3. A strongly explicit construction of erasure codes on non-bipartite graphs (more generally, linear codes on symmetric square matrices) achieving improved rates;
  4. A strongly explicit construction of linear nearly-MDS codes over constant-sized alphabets that can be encoded and decoded in quasi-linear time.</description>

      <title>On Fundamental Limits for Fluid Antenna-assisted Integrated Sensing and Communications for Unsourced Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the unsourced random access (URA) problem for integrated sensing and commutations (ISAC). Recent results reveal that conventional multiple access strategies for ISAC such as treating interference as noise (TIN) and time-division multiple access (TDMA) can be easily overwhelmed and fail to support the increasingly surging number of active users. Hence, the unsourced ISAC (UNISAC) system model has emerged as a promising enabler for the future ISAC networks. To advance this work, we adopt a more realistic channel model and propose to utilize fluid antenna system (FAS) for UNISAC. The achievable performance bound and floor of the proposed FAS-UNISAC are derived to validate the great potential. Our results demonstrate that promising improvement on the available user volume and the sensing and communication capability can be obtained due to the spatial diversities inherent within fluid antenna.</description>

      <title>Fairness vs. Equality: RSMA-Based Multi-Target and Multi-User Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the tradeoff between sensing and communication in an ISAC system comprising multiple sensing targets and communication users. A dual-functional base station conducts downlink data transmission services based on RSMA for multiple users, while sensing surrounding multiple targets. To enable effective multicast communications and ensure fair and balanced multi-target sensing and under a constrained power budget, we propose a multi-target sensing enhancement scheme incorporating fairness-aware BF, common rate splitting, and sensing power allocation. The proposed scheme minimizes the sensing CRB, while maximizing communication rate demands. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for both sensing CRB and communication rates. Building upon them, we formulate an optimization problem aiming to minimize the sensing CRB, while maximizing the communication rates. Considering the non-convex nature of the original optimization problem poses significant computational challenges, we transform the tradeoff optimization into a Pareto-optimal problem by employing Taylor series expansion, semi-definite relaxation, successive convex approximation, and penalty function to transform the non-convex problem and associated constraints into tractable forms. Extensive simulations validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate significant advantages of the proposed RSMA-based fairness-aware BF over non-orthogonal multiple access, space division multiple access, and orthogonal multiple access, through comprehensive comparisons in two key aspects: CRB performance improvement and sensing-communication tradeoff characteristics. The proposed optimization framework exhibits remarkable superiority in enhancing both sensing accuracy and communication quality for ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Superresolution imaging with entanglement-enhanced telescopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-baseline interferometry will be possible using pre-shared entanglement between two telescope sites to mimic the standard phase-scanning interferometer, but without physical beam combination. We show that spatial-mode sorting at each telescope, along with pre-shared entanglement, can be used to realize the most general multimode interferometry on light collected by any number of telescopes, enabling achieving quantitative-imaging performance at the ultimate limit pursuant to the baseline as afforded by quantum theory. We work out an explicit example involving two telescopes imaging two point sources.</description>

      <title>Shannon Weights for binary dynamical recurrent sources of zero entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A probabilistic source is defined as the set of infinite words (over a given denumerable alphabet) endowed with a probability $\mu$. The paper deals with general binary sources where the distribution of any symbol (0 or 1) may depend on an unbounded part of the previous history. The paper studies Shannon weights: whereas the classical Shannon entropy ${\cal E}_{\mu}$ is the average amount of information brought by one symbol of the emitted word, the Shannon weight sequence deals with the average amount of information $m_{\mu}(n)$ that is brought by the emitted prefix of length $n$. For a source with a non zero entropy, the estimate $m_{\mu}(n)\sim{\cal E}_{\mu} \cdot n$ thus holds. The paper considers the model of dynamical sources, where a source word isemitted as an encoded trajectory of a dynamical system of the unit interval, when endowed with probability $\mu$. It focus on sources with zero entropy and gives explicit constructions for sources whose Shannon weight sequence satisfies $m_{\mu}(n)=o(n)$, with a prescribed behaviour. In this case, sources with zero entropy lead to dynamical systems built on maps with an indifferent fixed point. This class notably contains the celebrated Farey source, which presents well-known intermittency phenomena. Methods are based on analytic combinatorics and generating functions, and they are enlarged, in the present dynamical case, with dynamical systems tools (mainly transfer operators).</description>

      <title>Constant Rate Isometric Embeddings of Hamming Metric into Edit Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A function $\varphi: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^N$ is called an isometric embedding of the $n$-dimensional Hamming metric space to the $N$-dimensional edit metric space if, for all $x, y \in \{0,1\}^n$, the Hamming distance between $x$ and $y$ is equal to the edit distance between $\varphi(x)$ and $\varphi(y)$. The rate of such an embedding is defined as the ratio $n/N$. It is well known in the literature how to construct isometric embeddings with a rate of $\Omega(\frac{1}{\log n})$. However, achieving even near-isometric embeddings with a positive constant rate has remained elusive until now.
  In this paper, we present an isometric embedding with a rate of 1/8 by discovering connections to synchronization strings, which were studied in the context of insertion-deletion codes (Haeupler-Shahrasbi [JACM'21]). At a technical level, we introduce a framework for obtaining high-rate isometric embeddings using a novel object called misaligners. As an immediate consequence of our constant rate isometric embedding, we improve known conditional lower bounds for various optimization problems in the edit metric, but now with optimal dependency on the dimension.
  We complement our results by showing that no isometric embedding $\varphi:\{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^N$ can have rate greater than 15/32 for all positive integers $n$. En route to proving this upper bound, we uncover fundamental structural properties necessary for every Hamming-to-edit isometric embedding. We also prove similar upper and lower bounds for embeddings over larger alphabets.
  Finally, we consider embeddings $\varphi:\Sigma_{\text{in}}^n\to \Sigma_{\text{out}}^N$ between different input and output alphabets, where the rate is given by $\frac{n\log|\Sigma_{\text{in}}|}{N\log|\Sigma_{\text{out}}|}$. In this setting, we show that the rate can be made arbitrarily close to 1.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Unique-Neighbor Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recall that a binary linear code of length $n$ is a linear subspace $\mathcal{C} = \{x\in\mathbb{F}_2^n\mid Ax=0\}$. Here the parity check matrix $A$ is a binary $m\times n$ matrix of rank $m$. We say that $\mathcal{C}$ has rate $R=1-\frac mn$. Its distance, denoted $\delta n$ is the smallest Hamming weight of a non-zero vector in $\mathcal{C}$. The rate vs.\ distance problem for binary linear codes is a fundamental open problem in coding theory, and a fascinating question in discrete mathematics. It concerns the function $R_L(\delta)$, the largest possible rate $R$ for given $0\le\delta\le1$ and arbitrarily large length $n$. Here we investigate a variation of this fundamental question that we describe next.
  Clearly, $\mathcal{C}$ has distance $\delta n$, if and only if for every $0&lt;n'&lt;\delta n$, every $m\times n'$ submatrix of $A$ has a row of odd weight. Motivated by several problems from coding theory, we say that $A$ has the unique-neighbor property with parameter $\delta n$, if every such submatrix has a row of weight $1$. Let $R_U(\delta)$ be the largest possible asymptotic rate of linear codes with a parity check matrix that has this stronger property. Clearly, $R_U(\cdot),R_L(\cdot)$ are non-increasing functions, and $R_U(\delta)\le R_L(\delta)$ for all $\delta$. Also, $R_U(0)=R_L(0)=1$, and $R_U(1)=R_L(1)=0$, so let $0\le\delta_U \le\delta_L\le1$ be the smallest values of $\delta$ at which $R_U$ resp.\ $R_L$ vanish. It is well known that $\delta_L=\frac12$ and we conjecture that $\delta_U$ is strictly smaller than $\frac12$, i.e., the rate of linear codes with the unique-neighbor property is more strictly bounded. While the conjecture remains open, we prove here several results supporting it.
  The reader is not assumed to have any specific background in coding theory, but we occasionally point out some relevant facts from that area.</description>

      <title>An algorithm for computing generalized Hamming weights and the Sage package GHWs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the Brouwer-Zimmermann algorithm, which is the most efficient general algorithm for computing the minimum distance of a random linear code, to the case of generalized Hamming weights. We also adapt this algorithm to compute the relative generalized Hamming weights of a nested pair of linear codes. In the package GHWs we provide an implementation of this algorithm in Sage, as well as several other utilities for working with generalized Hamming weights. With this implementation, we show that the proposed algorithm is faster than the naive approach of computing the generalized Hamming weights using the definition.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with Sparsity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02672v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a novel approach to solving the sparsity-constrained Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SCONMF) problem, which requires decomposing a non-negative data matrix into the product of two lower-rank non-negative matrices, X=WH, where the mixing matrix H has orthogonal rows HH^T=I, while also satisfying an upper bound on the number of nonzero elements in each row. By reformulating SCONMF as a capacity-constrained facility-location problem (CCFLP), the proposed method naturally integrates non-negativity, orthogonality, and sparsity constraints. Specifically, our approach integrates control-barrier function (CBF) based framework used for dynamic optimal control design problems with maximum-entropy-principle-based framework used for facility location problems to enforce these constraints while ensuring robust factorization. Additionally, this work introduces a quantitative approach for determining the ``true" rank of W or H, equivalent to the number of ``true" features - a critical aspect in ONMF applications where the number of features is unknown. Simulations on various datasets demonstrate significantly improved factorizations with low reconstruction errors (as small as by 150 times) while strictly satisfying all constraints, outperforming existing methods that struggle with balancing accuracy and constraint adherence.</description>

      <title>Quickest Change Detection for Multiple Data Streams Using the James-Stein Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of quickest change detection is studied in the context of detecting an arbitrary unknown mean-shift in multiple independent Gaussian data streams. The James-Stein estimator is used in constructing detection schemes that exhibit strong detection performance both asymptotically and non-asymptotically. Our results indicate that utilizing the James-Stein estimator in the recently developed window-limited CuSum test constitutes a uniform improvement over its typical maximum likelihood variant. That is, the proposed James-Stein version achieves a smaller detection delay simultaneously for all possible post-change parameter values and every false alarm rate constraint, as long as the number of parallel data streams is greater than three. Additionally, an alternative detection procedure that utilizes the James-Stein estimator is shown to have asymptotic detection delay properties that compare favorably to existing tests. The second-order asymptotic detection delay term is reduced in a predefined low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space, while second-order asymptotic minimaxity is preserved. The results are verified in simulations, where the proposed schemes are shown to achieve smaller detection delays compared to existing alternatives, especially when the number of data streams is large.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Assisted Jamming Mitigation with Movable Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reveals the potential of movable antennas in enhancing anti-jamming communication. We consider a legitimate communication link in the presence of multiple jammers and propose deploying a movable antenna array at the receiver to combat jamming attacks. We formulate the problem as a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio maximization, by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming and antenna element positioning. Due to the non-convexity and multi-fold difficulties from an optimization perspective, we develop a deep learning-based framework where beamforming is tackled as a Rayleigh quotient problem, while antenna positioning is addressed through multi-layer perceptron training. The neural network parameters are optimized using stochastic gradient descent to achieve effective jamming mitigation strategy, featuring offline training with marginal complexity for online inference. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal anti-jamming performance thereby significantly improving the efficiency in strategy determination.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Knowledge Distillation Using Partial Information Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation deploys complex machine learning models in resource-constrained environments by training a smaller student model to emulate internal representations of a complex teacher model. However, the teacher's representations can also encode nuisance or additional information not relevant to the downstream task. Distilling such irrelevant information can actually impede the performance of a capacity-limited student model. This observation motivates our primary question: What are the information-theoretic limits of knowledge distillation? To this end, we leverage Partial Information Decomposition to quantify and explain the transferred knowledge and knowledge left to distill for a downstream task. We theoretically demonstrate that the task-relevant transferred knowledge is succinctly captured by the measure of redundant information about the task between the teacher and student. We propose a novel multi-level optimization to incorporate redundant information as a regularizer, leading to our framework of Redundant Information Distillation (RID). RID leads to more resilient and effective distillation under nuisance teachers as it succinctly quantifies task-relevant knowledge rather than simply aligning student and teacher representations.</description>
