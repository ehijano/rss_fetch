      <title>Improving Harmonic Analysis using Multitapering: Precise frequency estimation of stellar oscillations using the harmonic F-test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Patil et. al 2024a, we developed a multitaper power spectrum estimation method, mtNUFFT, for analyzing time-series with quasi-regular spacing, and showed that it not only improves upon the statistical issues of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, but also provides a factor of three speed up in some applications. In this paper, we combine mtNUFFT with the harmonic F-test to test the hypothesis that a strictly periodic signal or its harmonic (as opposed to e.g. a quasi-periodic signal) is present at a given frequency. This mtNUFFT/F-test combination shows that multitapering allows detection of periodic signals and precise estimation of their frequencies, thereby improving both power spectrum estimation and harmonic analysis. Using asteroseismic time-series data for the Kepler-91 red giant, we show that the F-test automatically picks up the harmonics of its transiting exoplanet as well as certain dipole ($l=1$) mixed modes. We use this example to highlight that we can distinguish between different types of stellar oscillations, e.g., transient (damped, stochastically-excited) and strictly periodic (undamped, heat-driven). We also illustrate the technique of dividing a time-series into chunks to further examine the transient versus periodic nature of stellar oscillations. The harmonic F-test combined with mtNUFFT is implemented in the public Python package tapify (https://github.com/aaryapatil/tapify), which opens opportunities to perform detailed investigations of periodic signals in time-domain astronomy.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Linear Magnetic Holes with Magnetic Mirror Properties in Hybrid Simulations of Solar Wind Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic holes (MHs) are coherent magnetic field dips whose size ranges from fluid to kinetic scale, ubiquitously observed in the heliosphere and in planetary environments. Despite the longstanding effort in interpreting the abundance of observations, the origin and properties of MHs are still debated. In this letter, we investigate the interplay between plasma turbulence and MHs, using a 2D hybrid simulation initialized with solar wind parameters. We show that fully developed turbulence exhibits localized elongated magnetic depressions, whose properties are consistent with linear MHs frequently encountered in space. The observed MHs develop self-consistently from the initial magnetic field perturbations, by trapping hot ions with large pitch angles. Ion trapping produces an enhanced perpendicular temperature anysotropy that makes MHs stable for hundreds of ion gyroperiods, despite the surrounding turbulence. We introduce a new quantity, based on local magnetic field and ion temperature values, to measure the efficiency of ion trapping, with potential applications to the detection of MHs in satellite measurements. We complement this method by analyzing the ion velocity distribution functions inside MHs. Our diagnostics reveal the presence of trapped gyrotropic ion populations, whose velocity distribution is consistent with a loss cone, as expected for the motion of particles inside a magnetic mirror. Our results have potential implications for the theoretical and numerical modelling of MHs.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing the Light Curves and Absolute Parameters of Twenty Contact Binary Stars Using TESS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reanalyzing contact binaries with space-based photometric data and investigating possible parameter changes can yield accurate samples for theoretical studies. We investigated light curve solutions and fundamental parameters for twenty contact binary systems. The most recent Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data is used to analyze. The target systems in the investigation have an orbital period of less than 0.58 days. Light curve solutions were performed using the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code version 2.4.9. The results show that systems had various mass ratios from q=0.149 to q=3.915, fillout factors from f=0.072 to f=0.566, and inclinations from i=52.8deg to i=87.3deg. The effective temperature of the stars was less than 7016 K, which was expected given the features of most contact binary stars. Twelve of the target systems' light curves were asymmetrical in the maxima, showing the O'Connell effect, and a starspot was required for light curve solutions. The estimation of the absolute parameters of the binary systems was presented using the a-P empirical relationship and discussed. The orbital angular momentum (J_0) of the systems was calculated. The positions of the systems were also depicted on the M-L, M-R, q-L_ratio, M_tot-J_0, and T-M diagrams.</description>

      <title>Refinement of global coronal and interplanetary magnetic field extrapolations constrained by remote-sensing and in-situ observations at the solar minimum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar magnetic fields are closely related to various physical phenomena on the sun, which can be extrapolated with different models from photospheric magnetograms. However, the Open Flux Problem (OFP), the underestimation of the magnetic field derived from the extrapolated model, is still unsolved. To minimize the impact of the OFP, we propose three evaluation parameters to quantitatively evaluate magnetic field models and determine the optimal free parameters in the models by constraining the coronal magnetic fields (CMFs) and the interplanetary magnetic fields (IMFs) with real observations. Although the OFP still exists, we find that magnetic field lines traced from the coronal models effectively capture the intricate topological configurations observed in the corona, including streamers and plumes. The OFP is lessened by using the HMI synoptic map instead of the GONG daily synoptic maps, and the PFSS+PFCS model instead of the CSSS model. For Carrington Rotation (CR) 2231 at the solar minimum, we suggest that the optimal parameters for the PFSS+PFCS model are $R_{\mathrm{ss}} = 2.2-2.5\ R_{\mathrm{sun}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{scs}} = 10.5-14.0\ R_{\mathrm{sun}}$, as well as for the CSSS model are $R_{\mathrm{cs}} = 2.0 - 2.4\ R_{\mathrm{sun}}$, $R_{\mathrm{ss}} = 11.0 - 14.7\ R_{\mathrm{sun}}$ and $a = 1.0\ R_{\mathrm{sun}}$. Despite the IMFs at 1 AU being consistent with the measurements by artificially increasing the polar magnetic fields, the IMFs near the sun are still underestimated. The OFP might be advanced by improving the accuracy of both the weak magnetic fields and polar magnetic fields, especially considering magnetic activities arising from interplanetary physical processes.</description>

      <title>Correction for the Weakening Magnetic Field within the Sunspot Umbra Observed by ASO-S/FMG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic field inside the sunspot umbra, as observed by the Full-disk MagnetoGraph (FMG) onboard the Advanced Space based Solar Observatory (ASO-S), was found to be experiencing a weakening. To address this issue, we employed a method developed by Xu et al. (2021) to correct the weakening in the data of 20 active regions observed by FMG during the period spanning December 29, 2022, to July 23, 2023. Research has revealed that the onset of magnetic field weakening occurs at a minimum magnetic field strength of 705 G, with the peak strength reaching up to 1931 G. We computed the change ratio (R1) of the unsigned magnetic flux within the sunspot umbra, considering measurements both before and after correction. The change ratio (R1) spans from 26% to 124%, indicating a significant increase in the unsigned magnetic flux within sunspot umbrae observed by FMG after correction. To illustrate this, we selected four active regions for comparison with data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). After correction, it is found that the unsigned magnetic flux in sunspot umbrae measured by FMG aligns more closely with that of HMI. This supports the effectiveness of the corrective method for FMG, despite imperfections, particularly at the umbra-penumbra boundary.</description>

      <title>Electron acceleration and transport in the 2023-03-06 solar flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated in detail the M5.8 class solar flare that occurred on 2023-03-06. This flare was one of the first strong flares observed by the Siberian Radioheliograph in the microwave range and the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory in the X-ray range. The flare consisted of two separate flaring events (a "thermal" and a "cooler" ones), and was associated with (and probably triggered by) a filament eruption. During the first part of the flare, the microwave emission was produced in an arcade of relatively short and low flaring loops. During the second part of the flare, the microwave emission was produced by energetic electrons trapped near the top of a large-scale flaring loop; the evolution of the trapped electrons was mostly affected by the Coulomb collisions. Using the available observations and the GX Simulator tool, we created a 3D model of the flare, and estimated the parameters of the energetic electrons in it.</description>

      <title>PT and anti-PT symmetries for astrophysical waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Discrete symmetries have found numerous applications in photonics and quantum mechanics, but remain little studied in fluid mechanics, particularly in astrophysics. Aims: We aim to show how PT and anti-PT symmetries determine the behaviour of linear perturbations in a wide class of astrophysical problems. They set the location of Exceptional Points in the parameter space and the associated transitions to instability, and are associated to the conservation of quadratic quantities that can be determined explicitly. Methods: We study several classical local problems: the gravitational instability of isothermal spheres and thin discs, the Schwarzschild instability, the Rayleigh-B\'enard instability and acoustic waves in dust-gas mixtures. We calculate the locations and the order of the Exceptional Points with a method of resultant, as well as the conserved quantities in the different regions of the parameter space using Krein theory. Results: All problems studied here exhibit discrete symmetries, even though Hermiticity is broken by different physical processes (self-gravity, buoyancy, diffusion, drag). This analysis provides genuine explanations for certain instabilities, and for the existence of regions in the parameter space where waves do not propagate. Those correspond to breaking of PT and anti-PT symmetries respectively. Not all instabilities are associated to symmetry breaking (e.g. the Rayleigh-Benard instability).</description>

      <title>Barium stars as tracers of s-process nucleosynthesis in AGB stars III. Systematic deviations from the AGB models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barium (Ba) stars help to verify asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star nucleosynthesis models since they experienced pollution from an AGB binary companion and thus their spectra carry the signatures of the slow neutron capture process (s process). For 180 Ba stars, we searched for AGB stellar models that match the observed abundance patterns. We employed three machine learning algorithms as classifiers: a Random Forest method, developed for this work, and the two classifiers used in our previous study. We studied the statistical behaviour of the s-process elements in the observational sample to investigate if the AGB models systematically under- or overpredict the abundances observed in the Ba stars and show the results in the form of violin plots of the residuals between spectroscopic abundances and model predictions. We find a significant trend in the residuals that implies an underproduction of the elements Nb, Mo, and Ru in the models relative to the observations. This may originate from a process (e.g. the intermediate neutron-capture process, i process) at the metallicity of the Ba stars not yet included in the AGB models. Correlations are found between the residuals of these elements, suggesting a common origin for the deviations. In addition, there is a weak metallicity dependence of their residuals. The s-process temperatures derived with the [Zr/Fe] - [Nb/Fe] thermometer have an unrealistic value for the majority of our stars. The most likely explanation is that at least a fraction of these elements are not produced in a steady-state s process, and instead may be due to processes not included in the AGB models. The mass distribution of the identified models confirms that our sample of Ba stars was polluted by low-mass AGB stars. Most of the matching AGB models require low accreted mass, but a few systems with high accreted mass are needed to explain the observations. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Concurrent Particle Acceleration and Pitch-Angle Anisotropy Driven by Magnetic Reconnection: Ion-Electron Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle acceleration and pitch-angle anisotropy resulting from magnetic reconnection are investigated in highly magnetized ion-electron plasmas. By means of fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that magnetic reconnection generates anisotropic particle distributions $f_s \left( {|\cos \alpha|,\varepsilon} \right)$, characterized by broken power laws in the particle energy spectrum $f_s (\varepsilon) \propto \varepsilon^{-p}$ and pitch angle $\langle \sin^2 \alpha \rangle \propto \varepsilon^m$. Their characteristics are determined by the ratio of the guide field to the reconnecting field ($B_g/B_0$) and the plasma magnetization ($\sigma_0$). Below the break energy $\varepsilon_0$, ion and electron energy spectra are extremely hard ($p_&lt;\lesssim 1$) for any $B_g/B_0$ and $\sigma_0 \gtrsim 1$, while above $\varepsilon_0$, the spectral index steepens ($p_&gt; \gtrsim 2$), displaying high sensitivity to both $B_g/B_0$ and $\sigma_0$. The pitch angle displays power-law ranges with negative slopes ($m_&lt;$) below and positive slopes ($m_&gt;$) above $\varepsilon_{\min \alpha}$, steepening with increasing $B_g/B_0$ and $\sigma_0$. The ratio $B_g/B_0$ regulates the redistribution of magnetic energy between ions ($\Delta E_i$) and electrons ($\Delta E_e$), with $\Delta E_i \gg \Delta E_e$ for $B_g/B_0 \ll 1$, $\Delta E_i \sim \Delta E_e$ for $B_g/B_0 \sim 1$, and $\Delta E_i \ll \Delta E_e$ for $B_g/B_0 \gg 1$, with $\Delta E_i/\Delta E_e$ approaching unity when $\sigma_0 \gg 1$. The anisotropic distribution of accelerated particles results in an optically thin synchrotron power spectrum $F_\nu(\nu) \propto\nu^{(2-2p+m)/(4+m)}$ and a linear polarization degree $\Pi_{\rm lin} = (p+1)/(p+7/3+m/3)$. Pitch-angle anisotropy also induces temperature anisotropy and eases synchrotron cooling, along with producing beamed radiation, potentially responsible for frequency-dependent variability.</description>

      <title>Probing Intracluster Dynamics and Evolution of Globular Clusters through Cataclysmic Variable Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical interactions in globular clusters (GCs) significantly impact the formation and evolution of binary sources, including cataclysmic variables (CVs). This study investigates the connection between dynamical states of GCs and X-ray luminosity ($L_{x}$) distributions of CV populations through both simulations and actual observations. Utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation tool, MOCCA, we categorize the simulated GCs into three different evolutionary stages which are referred to as Classes I/II/III. Significant differences are found in the $L_{x}$ distributions of the CVs among these three Classes. In observational aspects, we have analyzed 179 CV candidates in 18 GCs observed by the {\it Chandra} X-ray Observatory. By dividing these GCs into three Families of different dynamical ages, namely Families I/II/III, the $L_{x}$ distributions of the CV candidates also show significant differences among these three Families. Both simulations and observational results suggest that CVs in more dynamically evolved clusters (Class/Family III) exhibit brighter X-ray emission. This highlights the influence of the dynamical status of a GC on the properties of its hosted compact binaries. Similar to blue stragglers, CV populations can serve as tracers of a GC's dynamical history. Our findings provide insights for understanding the interplay between intracluster dynamics and the evolution of compact binaries in GCs.</description>

      <title>The GAPS programme at TNG. LVII. TOI-5076b: A warm sub-Neptune planet orbiting a thin-to-thick-disk transition star in a wide binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. We report the confirmation of a new transiting exoplanet orbiting the star TOI-5076. Methods. We present our vetting procedure and follow-up observations which led to the confirmation of the exoplanet TOI-5076b. In particular, we employed high-precision {\it TESS} photometry, high-angular-resolution imaging from several telescopes, and high-precision radial velocities from HARPS-N. Results. From the HARPS-N spectroscopy, we determined the spectroscopic parameters of the host star: T$\rm_{eff}$=(5070$\pm$143) K, log~g=(4.6$\pm$0.3), [Fe/H]=(+0.20$\pm$0.08), and [$\alpha$/Fe]=0.05$\pm$0.06. The transiting planet is a warm sub-Neptune with a mass m$\rm_p=$(16$\pm$2) M$\rm_{\oplus}$, a radius r$\rm_p=$(3.2$\pm$0.1)~R$\rm_{\oplus}$ yielding a density $\rho_p$=(2.8$\pm$0.5) g cm$^{-3}$. It revolves around its star approximately every 23.445 days. Conclusions. The host star is a metal-rich, K2V dwarf, located at about 82 pc from the Sun with a radius of R$_{\star}$=(0.78$\pm$0.01) R$_{\odot}$ and a mass of M$_{\star}$=(0.80$\pm$0.07) M$_{\odot}$. It forms a common proper motion pair with an M-dwarf companion star located at a projected separation of 2178 au. The chemical analysis of the host-star and the Galactic-space velocities indicate that TOI-5076 belongs to the old population of thin-to-thick-disk transition stars. The density of TOI-5076b suggests the presence of a large fraction by volume of volatiles overlying a massive core. We found that a circular orbit solution is marginally favored with respect to an eccentric orbit solution for TOI-5076b.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetric characterisation of exoplanet host stars in preparation of the Ariel mission. Magnetic environment of HD 63433</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19052</link>

Abstract: The accurate characterisation of the stellar magnetism of planetary host stars has been gaining momentum, especially in the context of transmission spectroscopy investigations of exoplanets. Indeed, the magnetic field regulates the amount of energetic radiation and stellar wind impinging on planets, as well as the presence of inhomogeneities on the stellar surface that hinder the precise extraction of the planetary atmospheric absorption signal. We initiated a spectropolarimetric campaign to unveil the magnetic field properties of known exoplanet hosting stars included in the current list of potential Ariel targets. In this work, we focus on HD 63433, a young solar-like star hosting two sub-Neptunes and an Earth-sized planet. These exoplanets orbit within 0.15 au from the host star and have likely experienced different atmospheric evolutionary paths. We analysed optical spectropolarimetric data collected with ESPaDOnS, HARPSpol, and Neo-Narval to compute the magnetic activity indices (log R'_HK , H$\alpha$, and Ca ii infrared triplet), measure the longitudinal magnetic field, and reconstruct the large-scale magnetic topology via Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI). The magnetic field map was then employed to simulate the space environment in which the exoplanets orbit. The reconstructed stellar magnetic field has an average strength of 24 G and it features a complex topology with a dominant toroidal component, in agreement with other stars of a similar spectral type and age. Our simulations of the stellar environment locate 10% of the innermost planetary orbit inside the Alfv\'en surface and, thus, brief magnetic connections between the planet and the star can occur. The outer planets are outside the Alfv\'en surface and a bow shock between the stellar wind and the planetary magnetosphere could potentially form.</description>

      <title>Photometric Completeness Modelled With Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In almost any study involving optical/NIR photometry, understanding the completeness of detection and recovery is an essential part of the work. The recovery fraction is, in general, a function of several variables including magnitude, color, background sky noise, and crowding. We explore how completeness can be modelled, {with the use of artificial-star tests,} in a way that includes all of these parameters \emph{simultaneously} within a neural network (NN) framework. The method is able to manage common issues including asymmetric completeness functions and the bilinear dependence of the detection limit on color index. We test the method with two sample HST (Hubble Space Telescope) datasets: the first involves photometry of the star cluster population around the giant Perseus galaxy NGC 1275, and the second involves the halo-star population in the nearby elliptical galaxy NGC 3377. The NN-based method achieves a classification accuracy of $&gt;$\,94\%, and produces results entirely consistent with more traditional techniques for determining completeness. Additional advantages of the method are that none of the issues arising from binning of the data are present, and that a recovery probability can be assigned to every individual star in the real photometry. Our data, models, and code (called COINTOSS) can be found online on Zenodo at the following link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8306488.</description>

      <title>Kinematic origin of white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood</title>

Abstract: Thanks to the recent space-borne mission Gaia, there is a nearly complete sample of white dwarfs up to about 100 parsecs from the Sun, which may have very diverse origins. We aim to compute the Galactic orbits for white dwarfs observed in our Solar neighborhood, in order to analyze the most probable regions of the Galaxy where they could have formed, the distribution of their orbital parameters, as well as the observational biases introduced when constructing the local sample. We used a detailed Galactic orbit integration package, in conjunction with a detailed population synthesis code specifically designed to replicate the different Galactic components of the white dwarf population. Synthetic stars are generated based on the current observational sample, and subsequently, their orbital integration allows for the reconstruction of the population past history. Our kinematic analysis reveals that the majority of thin disk, thick disk, and halo white dwarfs will have left our 100 pc neighborhood in approximately 3.30, 1.05, and 0.6 Myr, respectively. The spatial distribution of the integrated thin disk orbits suggests that 68 percent of these stars were formed at less than 1 kpc from the Sun, while most of thick disk members suffered from radial disk migration. The local halo white dwarfs typically belong to the "inner halo", being their orbits mostly planar and not extending beyond R = 20-25 kpc. Despite the observational bias, the distribution of orbital parameters is well represented by the observed sample. The Solar neighborhood is a transitory concept, which must be taken into account when analyzing the overall properties of such a population, such as its age distribution, metallicities or formation history. Even so, the kinematic properties observed by recent missions such as Gaia are representative of the total population up to a distance of approximately 500 pc [abridged].</description>

      <title>The K2 Asteroseismic KEYSTONE sample of Dwarf and Subgiant Solar-Like Oscillators. I: Data and Asteroseismic parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The KEYSTONE project aims to enhance our understanding of solar-like oscillators by delivering a catalogue of global asteroseismic parameters (${\Delta\nu}$ and ${\nu_{\rm max}}$) for 173 stars, comprising mainly dwarfs and subgiants, observed by the K2 mission in its short-cadence mode during campaigns 6-19. We derive atmospheric parameters and luminosities using spectroscopic data from TRES, astrometric data from $\textit{Gaia}$, and the infrared flux method (IRFM) for a comprehensive stellar characterisation. Asteroseismic parameters are robustly extracted using three independent methods, complemented by an iterative refinement of the spectroscopic analyses using seismic ${\log g}$ values to enhance parameter accuracy. Our analysis identifies new detections of solar-like oscillations in 159 stars, providing an important complement to already published results from previous campaigns. The catalogue provides homogeneously derived atmospheric parameters and luminosities for the majority of the sample. Comparison between spectroscopic ${T_{\rm eff}}$ and those obtained from the IRFM demonstrates excellent agreement. The iterative approach to spectroscopic analysis significantly enhances the accuracy of the stellar properties derived.</description>

      <title>Improving Power Spectrum Estimation using Multitapering: Efficient asteroseismic analyses for understanding stars, the Milky Way, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asteroseismic time-series data have imprints of stellar oscillation modes, whose detection and characterization through time-series analysis allows us to probe stellar interior physics. Such analyses usually occur in the Fourier domain by computing the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram, an estimator of the power spectrum underlying unevenly-sampled time-series data. However, the LS periodogram suffers from the statistical problems of (1) inconsistency (or noise) and (2) bias due to high spectral leakage. Here, we develop a multitaper power spectrum estimator using the Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (mtNUFFT) to tackle the inconsistency and bias problems of the LS periodogram. Using a simulated light curve, we show that the mtNUFFT power spectrum estimate of solar-like oscillations has lower variance and bias than the LS estimate. We also apply our method to the Kepler-91 red giant, and combine it with PBjam peakbagging to obtain mode parameters and a derived age estimate of $3.97 \pm 0.52$ Gyr. PBjam allows the improvement of age precision relative to the $4.27 \pm 0.75$ Gyr APOKASC-2 (uncorrected) estimate, whereas partnering mtNUFFT with PBjam speeds up peakbagging thrice as much as LS. This increase in efficiency has promising implications for Galactic archaeology, in addition to stellar structure and evolution studies. Our new method generally applies to time-domain astronomy and is implemented in the public Python package tapify, available at https://github.com/aaryapatil/tapify.</description>

      <title>Giant branch planetary systems: Dynamical and radiative evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In seven billion years, the Sun will be dead. As stars like the Sun pass from their present state to that of a dead white dwarf star, they undergo two phases of extremely high luminosity and radius -- the red giant branch and the asymptotic giant branch -- during which they will lose half or more of their mass. These changes to the star have a significant impact on orbiting planets, asteroids and comets. The large stellar radius (beyond the current orbit of the Earth) leads to the engulfment of bodies entering the stellar envelope, a process enhanced by strong tidal interactions. The high luminosity affects bodies' orbits and physical properties, while mass loss can later trigger the destabilisation of bodies around white dwarfs. It is necessary to understand these processes to understand both the future of our Solar System, and to interpret growing observations of planetary systems around evolved stars.</description>
