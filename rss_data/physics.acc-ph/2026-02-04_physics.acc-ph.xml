      <title>Monochromation of pulsed electron beams with terahertz radiation at a planar mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exquisite control of electron beam energy is required for many electron spectroscopy and imaging applications. For both continuous and pulsed beams, the beam energy spread is fundamentally limited by the electron source, and is typically a sizable fraction of an electron-volt. In this paper, we present a means to reduce electron beam energy spread after emission to the level of a few 10s of meV rms using femtosecond photoemission and an interaction with laser-derived single- to few-cycle terahertz (THz) radiation. We show analytically and in particle tracking simulations that this interaction can remove energy spread stored in both the transverse and longitudinal degrees of freedom. We analytically formulate the limit of energy spread that this technique can achieve, and map the non-ideal affects arising at high frequencies. The interaction is mediated by the beam's passage through a mirror which is reflective to terahertz radiation but allows transmission of the majority of the electron beam (e.g. a wire mesh). This method then only requires beam current losses of a few tens of percent, far smaller than what is achieved in prism and slit-based electron monochromators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper recalls the principles of the finite-element methods (FEM) theory and declines its application in the EN-MME group, for the numerical modelling and study of particle accelerator equipment.

      <title>A numerical study on plasma acceleration processes with ion dynamics at the sub-nanosecond timescale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma wakefield acceleration is a groundbreaking technique for accelerating particles, capable of sustaining gigavolt-per-meter accelerating fields. Understanding the physical mechanisms governing the recovery of plasma accelerating properties over time is essential for successfully achieving high-repetition-rate plasma acceleration, a key requirement for applicability in both research and commercial settings. In this paper, we present numerical simulations of the early-stage plasma evolution based on the parameters of the SPARC_LAB hydrogen plasma recovery time experiment (Pompili et al., Comm. Phys. 7, 241 (2024)), employing spatially resolved Particle-in-Cell and fluid models. The experiment reports on a non-monotonic dependence of the plasma recovery time on the initial plasma density, an effect for which ion motion has been invoked as a contributing factor. The simulations presented here provide further insight into the role of ion dynamics in shaping this behavior. Furthermore, comparing Particle-in-Cell and fluid approaches allows us to assess the quality of fluid models for describing this class of plasma dynamics.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum dynamics of vortex particles in accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments with spin-polarized beams of leptons and hadrons typically employ plane-wave states with definite momenta and energies. In contrast, vortex states represent cylindrical waves carrying a well-defined orbital angular momentum projection along the propagation direction. This projection can be arbitrarily large, endowing such particles with magnetic moments orders of magnitude greater than those of plane-wave states. Consequently, vortex particles could complement - or even replace - spin-polarized beams in high-energy collisions, enabling access to observables beyond the reach of the conventional states. Although relativistic vortex beams have yet to be realized, we investigate the radiative and non-radiative dynamics of angular momentum for vortex particles in accelerators. We compute the timescale for angular momentum loss via photon emission, finding it significantly longer than typical acceleration times. The non-radiative dynamics is governed by precession, with the orbital angular momentum precessing at a frequency markedly different from that of spin. Similar to spin tunes in circular accelerators, this can induce resonances that disrupt the beam's orbital momentum - occurring far more frequently for vortex beams than for spin-polarized ones. Thus, vortex particle acceleration can be more feasible in linacs, while Siberian snakes could serve as a tool for angular momentum manipulations.</description>

      <title>First Experimental Demonstration of Beam Storage by Three-Dimensional Spiral Injection Scheme for Ultra-Compact Storage Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional spiral injection scheme enables storage in ultra-compact rings with nanosecond revolution period. We report the first successful storage of a $297\,\mathrm{keV/}c$ electron beam in a $22\,\mathrm{cm}$ weak-focusing storage ring with a $4.7\,\mathrm{ns}$ revolution period using multi-turn vertical kick with a $140\,\mathrm{ns}$ kicker pulse. Using a scintillating-fiber detector, we observe a signal exceeding $5\sigma$ of the pre-injection rms noise for $\geq 1\,\mathrm{\mu s}$, confirming beam storage. By varying the weak-focusing field configuration and measuring the stored beam distribution, we show that the storage beam resides within the predicted region by Monte Carlo simulations. This result is a key proof-of-principle for realizing ultra-compact storage rings for next-generation precision measurements including the muon experiments at J-PARC and PSI.</description>

      <title>Muon beams towards muonium physics: progress and prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in accelerator technology have led to significant improvements in the quality of muon beams over the past decades. Investigations of the muon and muonium enable precise measurements of fundamental constants, as well as searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Furthermore, by utilizing muon beams with high intensity and polarization, studies of the dynamics of the muon and muonium within atomic level can offer valuable insights into materials science. This review presents recent progress and prospects at the frontiers of muon beams and high-precision muonium physics. It also provides an overview of novel methods and detection techniques to achieve high sensitivities in different areas, including particle physics, nuclear physics, materials science and beyond.</description>
