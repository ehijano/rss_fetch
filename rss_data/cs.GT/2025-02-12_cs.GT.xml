      <title>Practical approach to $2$-Euclidean Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An election is a pair $(C,V)$ of candidates and voters. Each vote is a ranking (permutation) of the candidates. An election is $d$-Euclidean if there is an embedding of both candidates and voters into $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that voter $v$ prefers candidate $a$ over $b$ if and only if $a$ is closer to $v$ than $b$ is to $v$ in the embedding. For $d\geq 2$ the problem of deciding whether $(C,V)$ is $d$-Euclidean is $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete.
  In this paper, we propose practical approach to recognizing and refuting $2$-Euclidean preferences. We design a new class of forbidden substructures that works very well on practical instances. We utilize the framework of integer linear programming (ILP) and quadratically constrained programming (QCP). We also introduce reduction rules that simplify many real-world instances significantly. Our approach beats the previous algorithm of Escoffier, Spanjaard and Tydrichov\'a~[Algorithmic Recognition of 2-Euclidean Preferences, ECAI 2023] both in number of resolved instances and the running time. In particular, we were able to lower the number of unresolved PrefLib instances from $343$ to $60$. Moreover, $98.7\%$ of PrefLib instances are resolved in under $1$ second using our approach.</description>

      <title>Decision-Making Under Complete Uncertainty: You Will Regret Not Being Greedy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a probabilistic game-theoretic model to study the properties of the worst-case regret of the greedy strategy under complete (Knightian) uncertainty. In a game between a decision-maker (DM) and an adversarial agent (Nature), the DM observes a realization of product ratings for each product. Upon observation, the DM chooses a strategy, which is a function from the set of observations to the set of products. We study the theoretical properties, including the worst-case regret of the greedy strategy that chooses the product with the highest observed average rating. We prove that, with respect to the worst-case regret, the greedy strategy is optimal and that, in the limit, the regret of the greedy strategy converges to zero. We validate the model on data collected from Google reviews for restaurants, showing that the greedy strategy not only performs according to the theoretical findings but also outperforms the uniform strategy and the Thompson Sampling algorithm.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Aspects of Strategic Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic trading in modern financial markets is widely acknowledged to exhibit strategic, game-theoretic behaviors whose complexity can be difficult to model. A recent series of papers (Chriss, 2024b,c,a, 2025) has made progress in the setting of trading for position building. Here parties wish to buy or sell a fixed number of shares in a fixed time period in the presence of both temporary and permanent market impact, resulting in exponentially large strategy spaces. While these papers primarily consider the existence and structural properties of equilibrium strategies, in this work we focus on the algorithmic aspects of the proposed model. We give an efficient algorithm for computing best responses, and show that while the temporary impact only setting yields a potential game, best response dynamics do not generally converge for the general setting, for which no fast algorithm for (Nash) equilibrium computation is known. This leads us to consider the broader notion of Coarse Correlated Equilibria (CCE), which we show can be computed efficiently via an implementation of Follow the Perturbed Leader (FTPL). We illustrate the model and our results with an experimental investigation, where FTPL exhibits interesting behavior in different regimes of the relative weighting between temporary and permanent market impact.</description>

      <title>Insuperable strategies in two-player and reducible multi-player games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real populations are seldom found at the Nash equilibrium strategy. The present work focuses on how population size can be a relevant evolutionary force diverting the population from its expected Nash equilibrium. We introduce the concept of insuperable strategy, a strategy that guarantees that no other player can have a larger payoff than the player that adopts it. We show that this concept is different from the rationality assumption frequently used in game theory and that for small populations the insuperable strategy is the most probable evolutionary outcome for any dynamics that equal game payoff and reproductive fitness. We support our ideas with several examples and numerical simulations. We finally discuss how to extend the concept to multiplayer games, introducing, in a limited way, the concept of game reduction.</description>

      <title>Satisfaction-Aware Incentive Scheme for Federated Learning in Industrial Metaverse: DRL-Based Stackbelberg Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial Metaverse leverages the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to integrate data from diverse devices, employing federated learning and meta-computing to train models in a distributed manner while ensuring data privacy. Achieving an immersive experience for industrial Metaverse necessitates maintaining a balance between model quality and training latency. Consequently, a primary challenge in federated learning tasks is optimizing overall system performance by balancing model quality and training latency. This paper designs a satisfaction function that accounts for data size, Age of Information (AoI), and training latency. Additionally, the satisfaction function is incorporated into the utility functions to incentivize node participation in model training. We model the utility functions of servers and nodes as a two-stage Stackelberg game and employ a deep reinforcement learning approach to learn the Stackelberg equilibrium. This approach ensures balanced rewards and enhances the applicability of the incentive scheme for industrial Metaverse. Simulation results demonstrate that, under the same budget constraints, the proposed incentive scheme improves at least 23.7% utility compared to existing schemes without compromising model accuracy.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization for Building Social-Influence-Free Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Social Bayesian Optimization (SBO), a vote-efficient algorithm for consensus-building in collective decision-making. In contrast to single-agent scenarios, collective decision-making encompasses group dynamics that may distort agents' preference feedback, thereby impeding their capacity to achieve a social-influence-free consensus -- the most preferable decision based on the aggregated agent utilities. We demonstrate that under mild rationality axioms, reaching social-influence-free consensus using noisy feedback alone is impossible. To address this, SBO employs a dual voting system: cheap but noisy public votes (e.g., show of hands in a meeting), and more accurate, though expensive, private votes (e.g., one-to-one interview). We model social influence using an unknown social graph and leverage the dual voting system to efficiently learn this graph. Our theoretical findigns show that social graph estimation converges faster than the black-box estimation of agents' utilities, allowing us to reduce reliance on costly private votes early in the process. This enables efficient consensus-building primarily through noisy public votes, which are debiased based on the estimated social graph to infer social-influence-free feedback. We validate the efficacy of SBO across multiple real-world applications, including thermal comfort, team building, travel negotiation, and energy trading collaboration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study prompting-based approaches with Large Language Models (LLMs) for modifying documents so as to promote their ranking in a competitive search setting. Our methods are inspired by prior work on leveraging LLMs as rankers. We evaluate our approach by deploying it as a bot in previous ranking competitions and in competitions we organized. Our findings demonstrate that our approach effectively improves document ranking while preserving high levels of faithfulness to the original content and maintaining overall document quality.</description>

      <title>Approximating Human Strategic Reasoning with LLM-Enhanced Recursive Reasoners Leveraging Multi-agent Hypergames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-driven multi-agent-based simulations have been gaining traction with applications in game-theoretic and social simulations. While most implementations seek to exploit or evaluate LLM-agentic reasoning, they often do so with a weak notion of agency and simplified architectures. We implement a role-based multi-agent strategic interaction framework tailored to sophisticated recursive reasoners, providing the means for systematic in-depth development and evaluation of strategic reasoning. Our game environment is governed by the umpire responsible for facilitating games, from matchmaking through move validation to environment management. Players incorporate state-of-the-art LLMs in their decision mechanism, relying on a formal hypergame-based model of hierarchical beliefs. We use one-shot, 2-player beauty contests to evaluate the recursive reasoning capabilities of the latest LLMs, providing a comparison to an established baseline model from economics and data from human experiments. Furthermore, we introduce the foundations of an alternative semantic measure of reasoning to the k-level theory. Our experiments show that artificial reasoners can outperform the baseline model in terms of both approximating human behaviour and reaching the optimal solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for any $\epsilon&gt;0$ the probability that a randomly drawn game has a pure $\epsilon$-equilibrium goes to 1 as the number of agents gets large. This contrasts sharply with the known fact that if $\epsilon = 0$, that is, for pure Nash equilibrium, the probability is asymptotically $1- 1/e\approx 0.63$.</description>

      <title>A Formal Separation Between Strategic and Nonstrategic Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:1812.11571v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is common to make a distinction between "strategic" behavior and other forms of intentional but "nonstrategic" behavior: typically, that strategic agents model other agents while nonstrategic agents do not. However, a crisp boundary between these concepts has proven elusive. This problem is pervasive throughout the game theoretic literature on bounded rationality and particularly critical in parts of the behavioral game theory literature that make an explicit distinction between the behavior of "nonstrategic" level-0 agents and "strategic" higher-level agents (e.g., the level-k and cognitive hierarchy models). Overall, work discussing bounded rationality rarely gives clear guidance on how the rationality of nonstrategic agents must be bounded, instead typically just singling out specific decision rules (e.g., randomizing uniformly, playing toward the best case, optimizing the worst case) and informally asserting that they are nonstrategic. In this work, we propose a new, formal characterization of nonstrategic behavior. Our main contribution is to show that it satisfies two properties: (1) it is general enough to capture all purportedly "nonstrategic" decision rules of which we are aware in the behavioral game theory literature; (2) behavior that obeys our characterization is distinct from strategic behavior in a precise sense.</description>

      <title>Equitable Core Imputations for Max-Flow, MST and $b$-Matching Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study fair allocation of profit (or cost) for three central problems from combinatorial optimization: Max-Flow, MST and $b$-matching. The essentially unequivocal choice of solution concept for this purpose would be the core, because of its highly desirable properties. However, recent work [Vaz24] observed that for the assignment game, an arbitrary core imputation makes no fairness guarantee at the level of individual agents. To rectify this deficiency, special core imputations, called equitable core imputations, were defined - there are two such imputations, leximin and leximax - and efficient algorithms were given for finding them. For all three games, we start by giving examples to show that an arbitrary core imputation can be excessively unfair to certain agents. This led us to seek equitable core imputations for our three games as well. However, the ubiquitous tractable vs intractable schism separates the assignment game from our three games, making our task different from that of [Vaz24]. As is usual in the presence of intractability, we resorted to defining the Owen set for each game and algorithmically relating it to the set of optimal dual solutions of the underlying combinatorial problem. We then give polynomial time algorithms for finding equitable imputations in the Owen set. The motivation for this work is two-fold: the emergence of automated decision-making, with a special emphasis on fairness, and the plethora of industrial applications of our three games.</description>

      <title>Paying to Do Better: Games with Payments between Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In repeated games, such as auctions, players typically use learning algorithms to choose their actions. The use of such autonomous learning agents has become widespread on online platforms. In this paper, we explore the impact of players incorporating monetary transfer policies into their agents' algorithms, aiming to influence behavior in their favor through the dynamics between the agents. Our focus is on understanding when players have incentives to make use of monetary transfers, how such payments may affect learning dynamics, and what the implications are for welfare and its distribution among the players. We propose a simple and general game-theoretic model to capture such scenarios. Our results on general games show that in a very broad class of games, self-interested players benefit from letting their learning agents make payments to other learners during the game dynamics, and that in many cases, this kind of behavior improves welfare for all players. Our results on first- and second-price auctions show that in equilibria of the ``payment policy game,'' the agents' dynamics reach strong collusive outcomes with low revenue for the auctioneer. These results raise new questions and highlight a challenge for mechanism design in systems where automated learning agents can benefit from interacting with their peers in the digital ecosystem and outside the boundaries of the mechanism.</description>

      <title>Basins of Attraction in Two-Player Random Ordinal Potential Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the class of two-person ordinal potential games where each player has the same number of actions $K$. Each game in this class admits at least one pure Nash equilibrium and the best-response dynamics converges to one of these pure Nash equilibria; which one depends on the starting point. So, each pure Nash equilibrium has a basin of attraction.
  We pick uniformly at random one game from this class and we study the joint distribution of the sizes of the basins of attraction. We provide an asymptotic exact value for the expected basin of attraction of each pure Nash equilibrium, when the number of actions $K$ goes to infinity.</description>

Abstract: Cooperative 2-matching games are a generalization of cooperative matching games, where the value function is given by maximum-weight b-matchings, for a vertex capacity vector $b \leq 2$. We show how to separate over the core of 2-matching games in polynomial time, fixing a small flaw in the literature, and prove the existence of a compact extended formulation for it.</description>

      <title>Fair Division Beyond Monotone Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies fair division of divisible and indivisible items among agents whose cardinal preferences are not necessarily monotone. We establish the existence of fair divisions and develop approximation algorithms to compute them.
  We address two complementary valuation classes, subadditive and nonnegative, which go beyond monotone functions. Considering both the division of cake (divisible resources) and allocation of indivisible items, we obtain fairness guarantees in terms of (approximate) envy-freeness (EF) and equability (EQ)
  In the context of envy-freeness, we prove that an EF division of a cake always exists under cake valuations that are subadditive and globally nonnegative. This result complements the nonexistence of EF allocations for burnt cakes known for more general valuations. In the indivisible-items setting, we establish the existence of EF3 allocations for subadditive and globally nonnegative valuations. In addition, we obtain universal existence of EF3 allocations under nonnegative valuations.
  We study equitability under nonnegative valuations. Here, we prove that EQ3 allocations always exist when the agents' valuations are nonnegative. Also, in the indivisible-items setting, we develop an approximation algorithm that, for given nonnegative valuations, finds allocations that are equitable within additive margins.
  Our results have combinatorial implications. For instance, the developed results imply the universal existence of proximately equitable graph cuts: Given any graph $G=(V,E)$ and integer $k$ (at most $|V|$), there always exists a partition $V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k \neq \emptyset$ of the vertex set such that the cut function values of the parts, $V_i$, are additively within $5 \Delta +1$ of each other; here, $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of $G$. Further, such a partition can be computed efficiently.</description>

      <title>Isotonic Mechanism for Exponential Family Estimation in Machine Learning Peer Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11160v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2023, the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) required authors with multiple submissions to rank their submissions based on perceived quality. In this paper, we aim to employ these author-specified rankings to enhance peer review in machine learning and artificial intelligence conferences by extending the Isotonic Mechanism to exponential family distributions. This mechanism generates adjusted scores that closely align with the original scores while adhering to author-specified rankings. Despite its applicability to a broad spectrum of exponential family distributions, implementing this mechanism does not require knowledge of the specific distribution form. We demonstrate that an author is incentivized to provide accurate rankings when her utility takes the form of a convex additive function of the adjusted review scores. For a certain subclass of exponential family distributions, we prove that the author reports truthfully only if the question involves only pairwise comparisons between her submissions, thus indicating the optimality of ranking in truthful information elicitation. Moreover, we show that the adjusted scores improve dramatically the estimation accuracy compared to the original scores and achieve nearly minimax optimality when the ground-truth scores have bounded total variation. We conclude with a numerical analysis of the ICML 2023 ranking data, showing substantial estimation gains in approximating a proxy ground-truth quality of the papers using the Isotonic Mechanism.</description>

      <title>Satisficing Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a solution concept in which each agent $i$ does not necessarily optimize but selects one of their top $k_i$ actions. Our concept accounts for heterogeneous agents' bounded rationality. We show that there exist satisficing equilibria in which all but one agent best-respond and the remaining agent plays at least a second-best action in asymptotically almost all games. Additionally, we define a class of approximate potential games in which satisficing equilibria are guaranteed to exist. Turning to foundations, we characterize satisficing equilibrium via decision theoretic axioms and we show that a simple dynamic converges to satisficing equilibria in almost all large games. Finally, we apply the satisficing lens to two classic games from the literature.</description>

      <title>A Quadratic Lower Bound for Stable Roommates Solvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their seminal work on the Stable Marriage Problem (SM), Gale and Shapley introduced a generalization of SM referred to as the Stable Roommates Problem (SR). An instance of SR consists of a set of $2n$ agents, and each agent has preferences in the form of a ranked list of all other agents. The goal is to find a one-to-one matching between the agents that is stable in the sense that no pair of agents have a mutual incentive to deviate from the matching. Unlike the (bipartite) stable marriage problem, in SR, stable matchings need not exist. Irving devised an algorithm that finds a stable matching or reports that none exists in $O(n^2)$ time. In their influential 1989 text, Gusfield and Irving posed the question of whether $\Omega(n^2)$ time is required for SR solvability -- the task of deciding if an SR instance admits a stable matching.
  In this paper we provide an affirmative answer to Gusfield and Irving's question. We show that any (randomized) algorithm that decides SR solvability requires $\Omega(n^2)$ adaptive Boolean queries to the agents' preferences (in expectation). Our argument follows from a reduction from the communication complexity of the set disjointness function. The query lower bound implies quadratic time lower bounds for Turing machines, and memory access lower bounds for random access machines. Thus, we establish that Irving's algorithm is optimal (up to a logarithmic factor) in a very strong sense.</description>
