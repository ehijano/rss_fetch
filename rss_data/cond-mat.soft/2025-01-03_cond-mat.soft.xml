      <title>A Functional Human Liver Tissue Model: 3D Bioprinted Co-culture Discoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reduce costs and delays related to developing new and effective drugs, there is a critical need for improved human liver tissue models. Here we describe an approach for 3D bioprinting functional human liver tissue models, in which we fabricate disc-shaped structures (discoids) 200 {\mu}m in thickness and 1-3 mm in diameter, embedded in a highly permeable support medium made from packed microgels. We demonstrate that the method is precise, accurate, and scalable; up to 100 tissues per hour can be manufactured with a variability and error in diameter of about 4%. Histologic and immunohistochemical evaluation of printed discs reveal self-organization, cell cohesion, and key liver marker expression. During the course of 3-4 weeks in culture, the tissues stably synthesize albumin and urea at high levels, outperforming spheroid tissue models. We find the tissues express more than 100 genes associated with molecular absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) at levels within the range of human liver. The liver tissue models exhibit enzymatic formation of metabolites after exposure to multiple test compounds. Together, these results demonstrate the promise of 3D printed discoids for pharmacological and toxicological applications.</description>

      <title>Angstrom-scale ionic streaming when electrical double-layer concept fails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A knowledge gap exists for flows and transport phenomena at the Angstrom scale when the Poisson Nernst Planck equation based on the concept of electrical double layer (EDL) fails. We discovered that streaming conductance becomes pressure dependent in Angstrom channels using latent track membranes. The streaming current emerges only when the applied pressure exceeds a threshold value, which is inconsistent with the existing knowledge as a constant. With increasing channel size, we found that the pressure dependent streaming conductance phenomenon weakens and vanishes into a constant streaming conductance regime when the mean channel radius exceeds 2 nm. The effective surface potential derived from the stream conductance that divides conduction anomalously increases as the channel narrows. We suspect the pressure dependent streaming current is due to the reinforced Coulomb interaction between counterions and deprotonated carboxyl groups at the surface, which is close to the ion channel but different from the electrified 2D materials. The streaming current emerged due to hydrodynamic friction when the counterions were released from the surface. We approximated the stochastic process of counterion dissociation by 1D Kramer escape theory framework and defined the Damkohler Number to describe the transition from nonlinear streaming conductance regime to linear regime as functions of applied pressure and channel radius and well explained the enhanced effective surface potential in confinement.</description>

      <title>Nematic liquid crystal flow driven by time-varying active surface anchoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the generation of diverse material flow regimes in nematic liquid cells as driven by time-variable active surface anchoring, including no-net flow, oscillatory flow, steady flow, and pulsating flow. Specifically, we numerically simulate a passive nematic fluid inside a cell bounded with two flat solid boundaries at which the time-dependent anchoring is applied with the dynamically variable surface anchoring easy axis. We show that different flow regimes emerge as the result of different anchoring driving directions (i.e. co-rotating or counter-rotating) and relative phase of anchoring driving. The flow magnitude is tunable by cell thickness and anchoring driving frequency. More generally, this work aims towards possible applications of responsive time-variable surfaces, including photonics or synthetic active matter.</description>

      <title>Thick liquid crystalline cholesteric shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the phase behavior of thick shells of cholesteric liquid crystals with tangential anchoring at the shell boundary. For achiral liquid crystal, we demonstrate a thickness-dependent transition from a configuration featuring four disclination line connecting the inner and outer surfaces to a state free of defect in the bulk, where each surface is topologically isolated and features two boojums. Incorporating chirality stabilizes novel defect arrangements, including a mixed state combining boojums and disclination lines and blue phases at high chirality and we demonstrate that shell thickness strongly modulates these transitions. Finally, we exploit the metastability features of the observed phases to obtain an elastically induced rearrangement of the shell surfaces during a cholesteric hysteresis cycle, stabilizing an alternative configuration that minimizes the free energy at low chirality. Our work paves the way for exploring dynamic behaviors under external fields, mixed anchoring conditions, or active flows.</description>

      <title>Phase behavior of Cacio and Pepe sauce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Pasta alla Cacio e pepe" is a traditional Italian dish made with pasta, pecorino cheese, and pepper. Despite its simple ingredient list, achieving the perfect texture and creaminess of the sauce can be challenging. In this study, we systematically explore the phase behavior of Cacio and pepe sauce, focusing on its stability at increasing temperatures for various proportions of cheese, water, and starch. We identify starch concentration as the key factor influencing sauce stability, with direct implications for practical cooking. Specifically, we delineate a regime where starch concentrations below 1% (relative to cheese mass) lead to the formation of system-wide clumps, a condition determining what we term the "Mozzarella Phase" and corresponding to an unpleasant and separated sauce. Additionally, we examine the impact of cheese concentration relative to water at a fixed starch level, observing a lower critical solution temperature that we theoretically rationalized by means of a minimal effective free-energy model. Finally, we present a scientifically optimized recipe based on our findings, enabling a consistently flawless execution of this classic dish.</description>

      <title>A Novel Velocity Discretization for Lattice Boltzmann Method: Application to Compressible Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) has emerged as a powerful tool in computational fluid dynamics and material science. However, standard LBM formulation imposes some limitations on the applications of the method, particularly compressible fluids. In this paper, we introduce a new velocity discretization method to overcome some of these challenges. In this new formulation, the particle populations are discretized using a bump function that has a mean and a variance. This introduces enough independent degrees of freedom to set the equilibrium moments to the moments of Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution up to and including the third moments. Consequently, the correct macroscopic fluid dynamics equations for compressible fluids are recovered. We validate our method using several benchmark simulations.</description>

      <title>Gating and tunable confinement of active colloids within patterned environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active colloidal particles typically exhibit a pronounced affinity for accumulating and being captured at boundaries. Here, we engineer long-range repulsive interactions between colloids that self-propel under an electric field and patterned obstacles. As a result of these interactions, particles turn away from obstacles and avoid accumulation. We show that by tuning the applied field frequency, we precisely and rapidly control the effective size of the obstacles and therefore modulate the particle approach distance. This feature allows us to achieve gating and tunable confinement of our active particles whereby they can access regions between obstacles depending on the applied field. Our work provides a versatile means to directly control confinement and organization, paving the way towards applications such as sorting particles based on motility or localizing active particles on demand.</description>

      <title>Measuring the effective stress parameter using the multiphase lattice Boltzmann method and investigating the source of its hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective stress parameter, $\chi$, is essential for calculating the effective stress in unsaturated soils. Experimental measurements have captured different relationships between $\chi$ and the degree of saturation, $S_r$; however, they have not been able to justify the particular shapes of the $\chi$-$S_r$ curves. Theoretical solutions express $\chi$ as a function of $S_r$ and the air-water interfacial area, $a_{wn}$; however, $a_{wn}$ is difficult to predict, limiting further investigation of $\chi$ variation. We seek an alternative approach for studying $\chi$ by simulating the pore-scale distribution of the two fluid phases in unsaturated soils using the multiphase lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). We develop an algorithm for measuring $\chi$ based on the suction and surface tension forces applied to each grain. Using this algorithm, we simulate the $\chi$-$S_r$ curve over a full hydraulic cycle for a synthetic 3D granular soil column with immobile grains. We find that $\chi=1$ at $S_r=1$ and $\chi=0$ at $S_r=0$, while $\chi&gt;S_r$ for all other saturations. The maximum divergence of $\chi$ from $S_r$ happens at the transition from/to the pendular regime. We also observe that the $\chi$-$S_r$ curve is hysteretic; $\chi$ is larger during wetting (imbibition) compared to drying (drainage) due to larger contribution of surface tension forces.</description>

      <title>Self-reconfiguring colloidal active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cells and microorganisms employ dynamic shape changes to enable steering and avoidance for efficient spatial exploration and collective organization. In contrast, active colloids, their synthetic counterparts, currently lack similar abilities and strategies. Through physical interactions alone, here we create active colloidal molecules that spontaneously reconfigure their structure, unlike traditional active particles. We find that self-reconfiguration decouples reorientational dynamics from rotational diffusivity and bestows our active molecules additional reorientation capabilities. During encounters with neighbors, rapid conformational changes lead to self-steering and avoidance. At higher area fractions, reconfiguration-induced avoidance fully inhibits characteristic dynamic clustering, motility-induced phase separation and flocking; instead, the system retains a homogeneous structure comprising well-separated active units. Self-reconfiguring systems therefore present an exciting path towards autonomous motion beyond that of classical synthetic active matter.</description>

      <title>Morphogenesis of cheese flowers through scraping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "Tete de moine" Swiss cheese is generally served by scraping the surface of a cylindrical loaf with a sharp tool. This produces thin sheets of cheese that are strongly wrinkled at the edge, resembling frilly flowers and enhancing the tasting experience. In this work we unveil the physical mechanisms at play in this scraping-induced morphogenesis. We measure the deformation of the cheese during scraping and show that plastic deformation occurs everywhere, but find a larger plastic contraction in the inner part of the flower, causing its buckling into shape. We show that it surprisingly derives from the lower friction coefficient evidenced on the cheese close to its crust. Our analysis provides the tools for a better control of chip morphogenesis through plasticity in the shaping of other delicacies, but also in metal cutting.</description>

      <title>Achievable Information-Energy Exchange in a Brownian Information Engine through Potential Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The information engine extracts work from a single heat bath using mutual information obtained during the operation cycle. This study investigates the influence of the potential shaping in a Brownian information engine (BIE) in harnessing the information from thermal fluctuations. We have designed a BIE by considering an overdamped Brownian particle inside a confined potential and introducing an appropriate symmetric feedback cycle. We find that the upper bound of the extractable work for a BIE with a monostable centrosymmetric confining potential, with a stable state at the potential centre, depends on the bath temperature and the convexity of the confinement. A concave confinement is more efficient for an information-energy exchange. For a bistable confinement with an unstable centre and two symmetric stable basins, one can find an engine-to-refrigeration transition beyond a certain barrier height related to the energy difference between the energy barrier and the stable basins. Finally, we use the concavity-induced gain in information harnessing to device a BIE in the presence of a multistable potential that can harvest even more energy than monostable confinement.</description>

      <title>New Insights into the Dependence of Glass Transition Temperature and Dynamic Fragility on Molecular Weight in Oligomers and Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an earlier preprint (V. V. Ginzburg, O. V. Gendelman, R. Casalini, and A. Zaccone, arxiv:2409.17291), we demonstrated that the dynamic (relaxation time) and volume equations of state for many amorphous polymers are near-universal -- each material is characterized by two governing parameters -- the glass transition temperature, T_{g}, and the elementary relaxation time, /tau_{el}. The dynamic fragility, m, is uniquely related to /tau_{el}. The earlier analysis was based on the data for high polymers (degree of polymerization, N &gt; 200, and molecular weight, Mw &gt; 20,000 g/mol). Here, we investigate the dependence of T_{g} and /tau_{el} on N (or, equivalently, on the molecular weight, M). We consider the dielectric spectroscopy data for homologous series of four polymers: polystyrene (PS), poly-(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP), poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), and polybutadiene (PB). It is shown that the relaxation time curves for various oligomers can be successfully collapsed onto the same master curve as the high polymers. The glass transition temperature and the dynamic fragility are found to be linear functions of 1/M, in agreement with the Fox-Flory equation. The scaling results are interpreted based on the SL-TS2 theory, ensuring that the model description is consistent with the Boyer rules for the coefficients of thermal expansion above and below T_{g}, as well as the thermodynamical scaling for the pressure dependence of the relaxation time.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Dissipative Particle Dynamics Simulations of Lipid Bilayers with the MDPD-MARTINI Force-Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body dissipative particle dynamics (MDPD) offers a significant speed-up in the simulation of various systems, including soft matter, in comparison with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on Lennard-Jones nteractions, which is crucial for describing phenomena characterized by large time and length scales. Moreover, it has recently been shown that the MARTINI force-field coarse-graining approach is applicable in MDPD, thus rendering feasible the simulation of complex systems as in MD MARTINI for ever larger systems for longer physical times. Here, simulations of various lipid membranes were performed by using the MDPD-MARTINI coarse-grained (CG) force-field, relevant properties were calculated, and comparison with standard MD MARTINI CG simulations and experimental data was made. Thus insights into structural properties of these bilayer systems and further evidence regarding the transferability of the MDPD-MARTINI models are provided. In this regard, this is a natural next step in the development of the general-purpose MDPD-MARTINI CG force-field, which generally provides significant speed-ups in both computational and physical simulated times, in comparison with standard CG MD simulations.</description>

      <title>Self-diffusive dynamics of active Brownian particles at moderate densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Active Brownian Particle (ABP) model has become a prototype of self-propelled particles. ABPs move persistently at a constant speed $V$ along a direction that changes slowly by rotational diffusion, characterized by a coefficient $\Dr$. Persistent motion plus random reorientations generate a random walk at long times with a diffusion coefficient that, for isolated ABPs in two dimensions, is given by $D_0=V^2/(2\Dr)$. Here we study the density effects on the self-diffusive dynamics using a recently proposed kinetic theory for ABPs, in which persistent collisions are described as producing a net displacement on the particles. On intermediate timescales, where many collisions have taken place but the director of the tagged particle has not yet changed, an effective stochastic dynamics emerges, characterized by an effective reduced streaming velocity $V_\text{eff}$ and anisotropic diffusion, with coefficients explicitly depending on density. Based on this result, an effective theoretical and numerical approach is proposed in which the particles follow stochastic dynamics with mean-field interactions based on the local density. Finally, on time scales larger than $\Dr^{-1}$, the tagged particle shows an effective diffusive motion with a coefficient $D=V_\text{eff}^2/(2\Dr)$. The dependence of $V_\text{eff}$ on density indicates that the kinetic theory is limited to are fractions smaller than 0.42, and beyond this limit unphysical results appear.</description>

      <title>Competing Hexagonal and Square Lattices on a Spherical Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural properties of packed soft-core particles provide a platform to understand the cross-pollinated physical concepts in solid-state- and soft-matter physics. Confined on spherical surface, the traditional differential geometry also dictates the overall defect properties in otherwise regular crystal lattices. Using molecular dynamics simulation of the Hertzian model as a tool, we report here the emergence of new types of disclination patterns: domain and counter-domain defects, when hexagonal and square patterns coexist. A new angle is presented to understand the incompatibility between tiling lattice shapes and the available spherical areal shapes, which is common in nature -- from molecular systems in biology to backbone construction in architectures.</description>

      <title>Can hydrodynamic interactions destroy travelling waves formed by non-reciprocity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective chasing dynamics of non-reciprocally coupled densities leads to stable travelling waves which can be mapped to a model for emergent flocking. In this work, we couple the non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model (NRCH) to a fluid to minimally describe scalar active mixtures in a suspension, with the aim to explore the stability of the waves, i.e. the emergent flock in the presence of self-generated fluid flows. We show that the emergent polarity is linearly unstable to perturbations for a specific sign of the active stress recalling instabilities of orientational order in a fluid. Using numerical simulations, we find however that non-reciprocity stabilizes the waves against the linear instability in a large region of the phase space.</description>

      <title>Close-contact melting on hydrophobic textured surfaces: Confinement and meniscus effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of close-contact melting (CCM) on gas-trapped hydrophobic surfaces, with specific focus on the effects of geometrical confinement and the liquid-air meniscus below the liquid film. By employing dual-series and perturbation methods, we obtain numerical solutions for the effective slip lengths associated with velocity $\lambda$ and temperature $\lambda_t$ fields, across various values of aspect ratio $\Lambda$ (defined as the ratio of the film thickness $h$ to the structure's periodic length $l$) and gas-liquid fraction $\phi$. Asymptotic solutions of $\lambda$ and $\lambda_t$ for $\Lambda\ll 1$ and $\Lambda \gg 1$ are derived and summarized for different surface structures, interface shapes and $\Lambda$, which reveal a different trend for $\lambda$ and $\Lambda \ll 1$ and the presence of a meniscus. In the context of constant-pressure CCM, our results indicate that transverse-grooves surfaces consistently reduced the heat transfer. However, longitudinal grooves can enhance heat transfer under the effects of confinement and meniscus when $\Lambda \lessapprox 0.1$ and $\phi &lt; 1 - 0.5^{2/3} \approx 0.37$. For gravity-driven CCM, the parameters of $l$ and $\phi$ determine whether the melting rate is enhanced, reduced, or nearly unaffected. We construct a phase diagram based on the parameter matrix $(\log_{10} l, \phi)$to delineate these three regimes. Lastly, we derived two asymptotic solutions for predicting the variation in time of the unmelted solid height.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics without Boost-Invariance from Kinetic Theory: From Perfect Fluids to Active Flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the hydrodynamic equations of perfect fluids without boost invariance [1] from kinetic theory. Our approach is to follow the standard derivation of the Vlasov hierarchy based on an a-priori unknown collision functional satisfying certain axiomatic properties consistent with the absence of boost invariance. The kinetic theory treatment allows us to identify various transport coefficients in the hydrodynamic regime. We identify a drift term that effects a relaxation to an equilibrium where detailed balance with the environment with respect to momentum transfer is obtained. We then show how the derivative expansion of the hydrodynamics of flocks can be recovered from boost non-invariant kinetic theory and hydrodynamics. We identify how various coefficients of the former relate to a parameterization of the so-called equation of kinetic state that yields relations between different coefficients, arriving at a symmetry-based understanding as to why certain coefficients in hydrodynamic descriptions of active flocks are naturally of order one, and others, naturally small. When inter-particle forces are expressed in terms of a kinetic theory influence kernel, a coarse-graining scale and resulting derivative expansion emerge in the hydrodynamic limit, allowing us to derive diffusion terms as infrared-relevant operators distilling different parameterizations of microscopic interactions. We conclude by highlighting possible applications.</description>

      <title>Chiral induced Spin Polarized Electron Current: Origin of the Chiral Induced Spin Selectivity Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the chiral induced spin selectivity effect has provided a novel tool to study how active physical and chemical mechanism may differ in chiral enantiomers, however, the origin of the effect itself is yet an open question. In this article, it is theoretically shown that two aspects have to be fulfilled for the chiral induced spin selectivity effect to arise. First, chirality is a necessary condition for breaking spin-degeneracy in molecular structures that do not comprise heavy elements. Second, dissipation is indispensable for the molecule to develop a non-vanishing spin-polarization. These theoretical conclusions are illustrated in terms of a few examples, showing the necessity of the two aspects to be coordinated for the emergence of the chiral induced spin selectivity effect.</description>

      <title>Swimming mode determines how well mesoscale swimmers shield their odor in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Marine organisms manipulate their surrounding flow through their swimming dynamics, which affects the transport of their own odor cues. We demonstrate by direct numerical simulations how a group of mesoscale swimmers immersed in a turbulent flow alters the shape of the odor plume they release in the water. Odor mixing is enhanced by increased velocity fluctuations and a swimmer-induced flow circulation which widen the odor plume at close range while speeding up dilution of the chemical trace. Beyond a short-range increase in the likelihood of being detected, swimming considerably reduces detections with effects that can persist at distances of the order of ten times the size of the group or more. We find that puller-like swimmers are more effective at olfactory shielding than pusher-like swimmers. We trace this difference back to the dynamics at the swimmer location, which tends to trap odor at the source for pushers and to dilute it for pullers. Olfactory shielding is robust to changes in the conditions, and is more pronounced for weak turbulent Reynolds numbers and large swimmer Reynolds numbers. Our results suggest that olfactory shielding may play a role in the emergence of different swimming modalities by marine organisms.</description>

      <title>Momentum tunnelling between nanoscale liquid flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The world of nanoscales in fluidics is the frontier where the continuum of fluid mechanics meets the atomic, and even quantum, nature of matter. While water dynamics remains largely classical under extreme confinement, several experiments have recently reported coupling between water transport and the electronic degrees of freedom of the confining materials. This avenue prompts us to reconsider nanoscale hydrodynamic flows under the perspective of interacting excitations, akin to condensed matter frameworks. Here we show, using a combination of many-body theory and molecular simulations, that the flow of a liquid can induce the flow of another liquid behind a separating wall, at odds with the prediction of continuum hydrodynamics. We further show that the range of this 'flow tunnelling' can be tuned through the solid's electronic excitations, with a maximum occurring when these are at resonance with the liquid's charge density fluctuations. Flow tunnelling is expected to play a role in global transport across nanoscale fluidic networks, such as lamellar graphene oxide or MXene membranes. It further suggests exploiting the electronic properties of the confining walls for manipulating liquids via their dielectric spectra, beyond the nature and characteristics of individual molecules.</description>

      <title>Derivation of an effective plate theory for parallelogram origami from bar and hinge elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic origami patterns made with repeating unit cells of creases and panels bend and twist in complex ways. In principle, such soft modes of deformation admit a simplified asymptotic description in the limit of a large number of cells. Starting from a bar and hinge model for the elastic energy of a generic four parallelogram panel origami pattern, we derive a complete set of geometric compatibility conditions identifying the pattern's soft modes in this limit. The compatibility equations form a system of partial differential equations constraining the actuation of the origami's creases (a scalar angle field) and the relative rotations of its unit cells (a pair of skew tensor fields). We show that every solution of the compatibility equations is the limit of a sequence of soft modes -- origami deformations with finite bending energy and negligible stretching. Using these sequences, we derive a plate-like theory for parallelogram origami patterns with an explicit coarse-grained quadratic energy depending on the gradient of the crease-actuation and the relative rotations of the cells. Finally, we illustrate our theory in the context of two well-known origami designs: the Miura and Eggbox patterns. Though these patterns are distinguished in their anticlastic and synclastic bending responses, they show a universal twisting response. General soft modes captured by our theory involve a rich nonlinear interplay between actuation, bending and twisting, determined by the underlying crease geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical affinities are responsible for driving active matter systems out of equilibrium. At the nano-scale, molecular machines interact with the surrounding environment and are subjected to external forces. The mechano-chemical coupling which arises naturally in these systems reveals a complex interplay between chemical and mechanical degrees of freedom with strong impact on their active mechanism. By considering various models far from equilibrium, we show that the tuning of applied forces give rise to a nonlinear response that causes a non-monotonic behaviour in the machines' activity. Our findings have implications in understanding, designing, and triggering such processes by controlled application of external fields, including the collective dynamics of larger non-equilibrium systems where the total dissipation and performance might be affected by internal and inter-particle interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a surface instability observed during the extrusion of extremely soft elastic solids in confined geometries. Due to their unique rheological properties, these soft solids can migrate through narrow gaps by continuously everting the bulk material. The extrusion front spontaneously buckles in the direction transverse to the flow, resulting in a furrow-like morphology that deepens over time. We characterize the distinct features of this instability using experiments and theory and contrast the results with known elastic surface instabilities. Our study may provide insights into various processes involving the extrusion-like deformations of soft solids, including biomaterials.</description>

      <title>Active matter as the underpinning agency for extraordinary sensitivity of biological membranes to electric fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interaction of electric fields with biological cells is indispensable for many physiological processes. Thermal electrical noise in the cellular environment has long been considered as the minimum threshold for detection of electrical signals by cells. However, there is compelling experimental evidence that the minimum electric field sensed by certain cells and organisms is many orders of magnitude weaker than the thermal electrical noise limit estimated purely under equilibrium considerations. We resolve this discrepancy by proposing a non-equilibrium statistical mechanics model for active electromechanical membranes and hypothesize the role of activity in modulating the minimum electrical field that can be detected by a biological membrane. Active membranes contain proteins that use external energy sources to carry out specific functions and drive the membrane away from equilibrium. The central idea behind our model is that active mechanisms, attributed to different sources, endow the membrane with the ability to sense and respond to electric fields that are deemed undetectable based on equilibrium statistical mechanics. Our model for active membranes is capable of reproducing different experimental data available in the literature by varying the activity. Elucidating how active matter can modulate the sensitivity of cells to electric signals can open avenues for a deeper understanding of physiological and pathological processes.</description>

      <title>Delayed phosphate release can highly improve energy efficiency of muscle contraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although the power stroke of myosin and the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) are pivotal in the conversion of ATP's chemical energy into mechanical work occurring in various biological processes, the precise sequence of these two events remains a subject of heated debate due to the involved tiny spatiotemporal scale. Here, we take a different path and choose to investigate how Pi-release that is not directly coupled with the power stroke affects muscle contraction in silico. Utilizing a mechanics model developed for the structural unit of muscle that systematically integrates the chemomechanical cycle of individual myosins, we find that relatively slow Pi-release can markedly improve energy efficiency during muscle contraction. Our model's predictions are largely consistent with experimental data and our analysis suggests that a gradual Pi-release may offer a route to finely adjust the stability of a working myosin on the actin filament, thereby indirectly modulating the power stroke to influence muscle performance. We believe that this work can provide important insights into the kinetics and the function of Pi-release in the regulation of forces and motions generated by myosins for cellular processes.</description>

      <title>Flexible framework of computing binding free energy using the energy representation theory of solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Host-guest binding plays a crucial role in the functionality of various systems, and its efficiency is often quantified using the binding free energy, which represents the free-energy difference between the bound and dissociated states. Here, we propose a methodology to compute the binding free energy based on the energy representation (ER) theory of solution that enables us to evaluate the free-energy difference between the systems of interest with the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Unlike the other free-energy methods, such as the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR), the ER theory does not require the MD simulations for hypothetical intermediate states connecting the systems of interest, leading to reduced computational costs. By constructing the thermodynamic cycle of the binding process that is suitable for the ER theory, a robust calculation of the binding free energy is realized. We apply the present method to the self-association of \textit{N}-methylacetamide (NMA) in different solvents and the binding of aspirin to $\beta$-cyclodextrin (CD) in water. In the former case, the present method estimates that the binding free energy decreases as the solvent polarity decreases. This trend is consistent with the experimental finding. For the latter system, the binding free energies for the two representative CD-aspirin bound complexes, primary (P) and secondary (S) complexes, are estimated to be $-5.2\pm 0.1$ and $-5.03\pm 0.09~\mathrm{kcalmol^{-1}}$, respectively. These values are satisfactorily close to those from the BAR method [$-4.2\pm 0.2$ and $-4.1\pm 0.2\mathrm{kcal~mol^{-1}}$ for P and S, respectively]. Furthermore, the interaction-energy component analysis reveals that the van der Waals interaction between aspirin and CD dominantly contributes to the stabilization of the bound complexes, that is in harmony with the well-known binding mechanism in the CD systems.</description>

      <title>The balance between paraelectricity and ferroelectricity in non-chiral smectic homologs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-chiral liquid crystals (LCs) exhibiting ferroelectricity, distinguished by their dynamic responsiveness to external stimuli and high spontaneous polarization, provide renewed impetus for research into this area of soft matter and open novel application possibilities. Consequently, identifying structural elements within LC compounds that promote ferroelectricity in non-chiral systems is of critical importance. In this work, two homologs of rod-like compounds, with phenyl and ester groups in the rigid core substituted by fluorine atoms, differing by a single methylene unit, were synthesized and comprehensively analyzed using complementary experimental techniques and quantum-mechanical modeling. This systematic study presents the first documented instance in which such a minimal structural modification markedly influences the polarity of smectic phases in two homologs, without substantially altering phase transition temperatures, particularly the sequence and temperature ranges of smectic and nematic phases. Additionally, findings reveal that the longer homolog, which exhibits paraelectric phases, demonstrates a pronounced capacity to maintain ferroelectric phases in mixtures. These results provide new insights into the critical structure-property relationships between molecular architecture and ferroelectric characteristics in LCs, facilitating the targeted design of non-chiral compounds with polar phases. Moreover, the properties of the studied mixtures underscore the potential to develop multicomponent LC mixtures with stable ferroelectric properties in a broad temperature range, a feature of considerable significance for practical applications.</description>
