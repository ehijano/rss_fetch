      <title>Evaluation of Wafer-Scale SOT-MRAM for Analog Crossbar Array Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog crossbar arrays consisting of emerging memory devices can greatly alleviate the computational strain required by vector matrix multiplications for neural network applications. The ability to produce spin orbit torque-magnetic random-access memory (SOT-MRAM) at wafer-scale positions SOT-MRAM as a strong memory candidate. In this work, we fabricate and measure 300 mm-compatible SOT-MRAM with 150% tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, fast (2 ns) and low voltage (&lt;1 V) operation, low energy dissipation (350 fJ), low write noise (0.1%), and low device-to-device variation of 10%. Through 2-bit quantization aware training and noisy training as mitigation techniques, the measured SOT-MRAM devices attain 95% on MNIST. The bi-stable anisotropy and stochastic switching of SOT-MRAM can additionally be leveraged for stochastic training of binary neural networks, able to reach ideal accuracy for a single device. Lastly, the devices were evaluated on implementation of probabilistic graph modeling and the interplay of tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, probability curve distribution, and conductance noise was shown to reduce potential errors in implementation. Through these results, SOT-MRAM is shown to be a uniquely effective candidate for implementation of crossbar accelerators in memory- and energy-limited applications, able to take advantage of stochastic operation and bi-stability to beneficial results in neural network applications.</description>

      <title>Sweet-spot protection of hole spins in sparse arrays via spin-dependent magneto-tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in the scaling of spin qubits have led to the development of sparse architectures where spin qubits are distributed across multiple quantum dots. This distributed approach enables qubit manipulation through hopping and flopping modes, as well as protocols for spin shuttling to entangle spins beyond nearest neighbors. Therefore, understanding spin tunneling across quantum dots is fundamental for the improvement of sparse array encodings. Here, we develop a microscopic theory of a minimal sparse array formed by a hole in a double quantum dot. We show the existence of spin-dependent magnetic corrections to the tunnel couplings that help preserve existing sweet spots, even for quantum dots with different $g$-factors, and introduce new ones that are not accounted for in the simplest models. Our analytical and numerical results explain observed sweet spots in state-of-the-art shuttling and cQED experiments, are relevant to hopping and flopping modes, and apply broadly to sparse array encodings of any size.</description>

      <title>Selective Parametric Amplification of Degenerate Modes in Electrostatically Transduced Coupled Beam Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric excitation in coupled mechanical systems has enabled advances in sensing, computation, and phonon control. The function of distinct phase modes using parametric driving remains insufficiently explored. Here, we investigate the nonlinear and parametric response of degenerate phase modes in a Double Ended Tuning Fork (DETF) resonator. Our measurements reveal pronounced nonlinearity and parametric amplification in the out-phase mode, attributed to the dominant contribution of the coupling beam, while the in-phase mode remains predominantly linear. Uniquely, we demonstrate parametric excitation through the coupling spring, enabling selective amplification and de-amplification controlled via the relative phase between harmonic and parametric drives. A parametric gain of $\sim$13 dB is achieved in the out-phase mode, with phase-dependent modulation of amplification, indicating its suitability for signal processing, logic operations, and memory elements based on degenerate modes. These results establish a new approach to exploiting mode-specific nonlinear dynamics in coupled resonators for emerging applications in sensing and phononic control.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced Electronic Band Dynamics and Defect-mediated Surface Potential Evolution in PdSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES) combined with density functional theory to investigate ultrafast carrier dynamics in low-symmetry layered semiconducting PdSe$_2$. The indirect bandgap is determined to be 0.55~eV. Following photoexcitation above this gap, we resolve a valence band shift and broadening, both lasting less than a picosecond, consistent with bandgap renormalization and carrier scattering, indicative of strong many-body interactions. Subsequently, hot carriers populate the conduction band minimum and are captured by defect states. A surface photovoltage (SPV) of $\sim$ 67~meV emerges, persisting for over 50~ps, driven by defect-assisted charge separation. The formation of native vacancies, promoted by the low-symmetry lattice, likely gives rise to the mid-gap states responsible for this long-lived SPV response. Detailed analysis of TR-ARPES spectra disentangles the contributions of bandgap renormalization, carrier scattering, defect states, and SPV. These findings establish PdSe$_2$ as a prototypical layered quantum material exhibiting exotic photoresponses on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Hall-Type and Unidirectional Spin Pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional spin pumping, driven by magnetization dynamics, is longitudinal since the pumped spin current flows normal to the interface between the ferromagnet and the conductor. We predict \textit{Hall-type/transverse} and \textit{unidirectional} spin pumping into conductors by near-field electromagnetic radiation emitted by, \textit{e.g.}, magnetization dynamics. The joint effect of the electric and magnetic fields results in a pure spin current flowing parallel to the interface, i.e., a Hall-type spin pumping, which is highly efficient due to the strong coupling to the electric field. Such a transverse spin current is unidirectional, with the spatial distribution controlled by the magnetization direction. Our finding reveals a robust approach for generating and manipulating spin currents in future low-dimensional spintronic and orbitronic devices.</description>

      <title>Exciton dynamics in equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bound electron-hole pairs known as excitons govern the optical properties of insulating solids. While their behavior in equilibrium is well-understood theoretically, the nonequilibrium regime at high excitation densities-where phenomena like electron-hole liquids emerge - is less explored. This thesis presents a first-principles study of excitons in two-dimensional materials. We use the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation to investigate their properties from equilibrium to nonequilibrium conditions. We first demonstrate how increasing photo-excited carrier density leads to a redshift-blueshift crossover of excitons. We then show that electron-phonon interactions critically modify optical spectra and exciton lifetimes at finite temperatures. Finally, we unify these effects to demonstrate the formation of an electron-hole liquid phase above a critical carrier density and below a critical temperature. Our work identifies how enhanced Coulomb interactions in two dimensions can stabilize this phase at significantly higher temperatures, proposing promising material candidates for observing these collective states.</description>

      <title>Experimental Milestones Towards Majorana Braiding with Acoustic Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we show the first experimental implementation of the fully general Kitaev chain with complex-valued order parameter $\Delta$ and site-varying synthetic chemical potential $\mu$, using a passive multilayer acoustic resonator design and fabrication. Our laboratory model faithfully reproduces the key symmetries and the topological phase diagram of the model, and displays robust Majorana-like edge modes spatially localized at smoothly engineered domain walls and energetically localized in the middle of the bulk spectral gap. We demonstrate precise control over mode positioning through smooth spatial variations of $\mu$, and validate the stability of the modes and of the spectral gap under continuous and complex variations of $\Delta$ -- both critical requirements for topological braiding operations. These results establish and validate the fundamental building blocks for experimental implementation of complete braiding protocols, opening concrete pathways toward accessible non-abelian physics and topologically protected information processing.</description>

      <title>Giant orbital Zeeman effects in a magnetic topological van der Waals interphase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures allow the engineering of electronic and magnetic properties by the stacking different two-dimensional vdW materials. For example, orbital hybridisation and charge transfer at a vdW interface may result in electric fields across the interface that give rise to Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In magnetic vdW heterostructures, this in turn can drive the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction which leads to a canting of local magnetic moments at the vdW interface and may thus stabilise novel 2D magnetic phases. While such emergent magnetic "interphases" offer a promising platform for spin-based electronics, direct spectroscopic evidence for them is still lacking. Here, we report Zeeman effects with Land\'e $g$-factors up to $\approx230$ at the interface of graphene and the vdW ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. They arise from a magnetic interphase in which local-moment canting and itinerant orbital moments generated by the non-trivial band topology of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ conspire to cause a giant asymmetric level splitting when a magnetic field is applied. Exploiting the inelastic phonon gap of graphene, we can directly access the buried vdW interface to the Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. Systematically analyzing the Faraday-like screening of the tip electric field by the graphene, we demonstrate the tunability of the constitutional interface dipole, as well as the Zeeman effect, by tip gating. Our findings are supported by density functional theory and electrostatic modelling.</description>

      <title>Impact of hydrogenation on the structure, chemistry, and electrical properties of flame-synthesized carbon nanoparticle films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between hydrogen atoms and carbon nanoparticles is a fundamental process governing the properties of carbonaceous materials in environments ranging from combustion systems to the interstellar medium. This study investigates the effects of controlled atomic hydrogen exposure on young and mature soot nanoparticles, generated in premixed ethylene-air flames, and deposited on substrates. We employed a multi-technique approach to characterize the chemical, mechanical, and electrical evolution of the films. In-situ infrared spectroscopy revealed non-monotonic behavior: an initial increase in aliphatic CH bonds was observed, followed by a decrease at higher hydrogen fluences. This was accompanied by a continuous decrease in the aromatic C=C signal. Atomic force microscopy showed a significant increase in the Young's modulus of the film for both sample types after hydrogenation. This mechanical change was correlated with an increase in the I(D)/I(G) ratio from Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, both macroscopic current vs. voltage and local scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements demonstrated a notable increase in electrical conductivity. For single just-formed soot particles, moreover, a hydrogen-induced transformation from a semiconductive to a semi-metallic nature was observed. The collective evidence points towards an H-induced CC cross-linking mechanism within the nanoparticle films. We propose that atomic hydrogen facilitates the formation of radical sites, which promotes covalent bond formation between adjacent particles or molecular units, creating a more interconnected and rigid network, with smaller interlayer distance. These findings provide crucial insights into the structural evolution of carbonaceous materials in hydrogen-rich environments, with direct implications for understanding soot formation and for the tailored design of carbon-based materials.</description>

      <title>Mutual enhancement of altermagnetism and ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider theoretically the possibility of coexisting ferroelectric and metallic altermagnetic order, which has recently been predicted in insulating and semiconducting systems via ab initio calculations. Solving self-consistently a mean-field Hubbard model, accounting also for the energy cost of distorting the lattice to produce an electric polarization, our results show that metallic altermagnetism and ferroelectricity suppress or enhance each other depending on the doping level of the system. Close to half-filling, the system can lower its energy by becoming altermagnetic, but at the expense of losing the electric polarization. Away from half-filling, the coexistence of ferroelectricity and altermagnetism is much more robust toward an increase in the energy cost associated with the deformation of the lattice. Therefore, our results suggest that filling fractions corresponding to doping relatively far away from half-filling constitute the most promising regime to look for coexistent ferroelectricity and metallic altermagnetism with mutual enhancement. Moreover, we propose a way to electrically tune altermagnetism between nodal and nodeless phases as well as achieving coexistence of a nodal and nodeless phase for the two spin species.</description>

      <title>A Review of AI-Driven Approaches for Nanoscale Heat Conduction and Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat conduction and radiation are two of the three fundamental modes of heat transfer, playing a critical role in a wide range of scientific and engineering applications ranging from energy systems to materials science. However, traditional physics-based simulation methods for modeling these processes often suffer from prohibitive computational costs. In recent years, the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the modeling of nanoscale heat conduction and radiation. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent AI-driven developments in modeling heat conduction and radiation at the nanoscale. We first discuss the ML techniques for predicting phonon properties, including phonon dispersion and scattering rates, which are foundational for determining material thermal properties. Next, we explore the role of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) in molecular dynamics simulations and their applications to bulk materials, low-dimensional systems, and interfacial transport. We then review the ML approaches for solving radiative heat transfer problems, focusing on data-driven solutions to Maxwell's equations and the radiative transfer equation. We further discuss the ML-accelerated inverse design of radiative energy devices, including optimization-based and generative model-based methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions, including data availability, model generalization, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability. Through this survey, we aim to provide a foundational understanding of how AI techniques are reshaping thermal science and guiding future research in nanoscale heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Invariants for (2+1)D bosonic crystalline topological insulators for all 17 wallpaper groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in (2+1) dimensions with symmetry $G = G_{\text{space}}\times K$, where $G_{\text{space}}$ is a general wallpaper group and $K=\text{U}(1),\mathbb{Z}_N, \text{SO}(3)$ is an internal symmetry. In each case we propose a set of many-body invariants that can detect all the different phases predicted from real space constructions and group cohomology classifications. They are obtained by applying partial rotations and reflections to a given ground state, combined with suitable operations in $K$. The reflection symmetry invariants that we introduce include `double partial reflections', `weak partial reflections' and their `relative' or `twisted' versions which also depend on $K$. We verify our proposal through exact calculations on ground states constructed using real space constructions. We demonstrate our method in detail for the groups p4m and p4g, and in the case of p4m also derive a topological effective action involving gauge fields for orientation-reversing symmetries. Our results provide a concrete method to fully characterize (2+1)D crystalline topological invariants in bosonic SPT ground states.</description>

      <title>Weak-Memory Dynamics in Discrete Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete dynamics arise naturally in systems with broken temporal translation symmetry and are typically described by first-order recurrence relations representing classical or quantum Markov chains. When memory effects induced by hidden degrees of freedom are relevant, however, higher-order discrete evolution equations are generally required. Focusing on linear dynamics, we identify a well-delineated weak-memory regime where such equations can, on an intermediate time scale, be systematically reduced to a unique first-order counterpart acting on the same state space. We formulate our results as a mathematical theorem and work out two examples showing how they can be applied to stochastic Floquet dynamics under coarse-grained and quantum collisional models.</description>

      <title>An introduction to Markovian open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a concise, pedagogical introduction to the dynamic field of open quantum systems governed by Markovian master equations. We focus on the mathematical and physical origins of the Lindblad equation, its unraveling in terms of pure-state trajectories, the structure of steady states with emphasis on the role of symmetry and conservation laws, and a sampling of the novel physical phenomena that arise from nonunitary dynamics (dissipation and measurements). This is far from a comprehensive summary of the field. Rather, the objective is to provide a conceptual foundation and physically illuminating examples that are useful to graduate students and researchers entering this subject. There are exercise problems and references for further reading throughout the notes.</description>

      <title>Digitized Counterdiabatic Quantum Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose digitized counterdiabatic quantum sampling (DCQS), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for efficient sampling from energy-based models, such as low-temperature Boltzmann distributions. The method utilizes counterdiabatic protocols, which suppress non-adiabatic transitions, with an iterative bias-field procedure that progressively steers the sampling toward low-energy regions. We observe that the samples obtained at each iteration correspond to approximate Boltzmann distributions at effective temperatures. By aggregating these samples and applying classical reweighting, the method reconstructs the Boltzmann distribution at a desired temperature. We define a scalable performance metric, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the total variation distance, to quantify convergence toward the exact Boltzmann distribution. DCQS is validated on one-dimensional Ising models with random couplings up to 124 qubits, where exact results are available through transfer-matrix methods. We then apply it to a higher-order spin-glass Hamiltonian with 156 qubits executed on IBM quantum processors. We show that classical sampling algorithms, including Metropolis-Hastings and the state-of-the-art low-temperature technique parallel tempering, require up to three orders of magnitude more samples to match the quality of DCQS, corresponding to an approximately 2x runtime advantage. Boltzmann sampling underlies applications ranging from statistical physics to machine learning, yet classical algorithms exhibit exponentially slow convergence at low temperatures. Our results thus demonstrate a robust route toward scalable and efficient Boltzmann sampling on current quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Exchange Field of Surface Spin Impurities via DC Voltages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in scanning tunneling microscopy have enabled quantum-coherent control of single surface spins via all-electric electron spin resonance (ESR). Such control requires magnetoelectric coupling, since spin resonance is a magnetic effect. We show that a magnetic tip induces a bias-dependent exchange field on a localized Anderson impurity via virtual particle exchange with the magnetic lead. This field differs from Heisenberg exchange and can be tuned, reversed, or suppressed by the bias voltage. Our model reproduces bias-controlled resonance shifts for S = 1/2 titanium atoms and Fe(II) phthalocyanine, enabling spin control via the exchange field and revealing the magnetoelectric mechanism behind all-electric ESR for spin-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Dressed basis sets for the modeling of exchange interactions in double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the microscopic modeling of exchange interactions between double semiconductor quantum dots used as spin qubits. Starting from a reference full configuration interaction (CI) calculation for the two-particle wave functions, we build a reduced basis set of dressed states that can describe the ground-state singlets and triplets over the whole operational range with as few as one hundred basis functions (as compared to a few thousands for the full CI). This enables fast explorations of the exchange interactions landscape as well as efficient time-dependent simulations. We apply this methodology to a double hole quantum dot in germanium, and discuss the physics of exchange interactions in this system. We show that the net exchange splitting results from a complex interplay between inter-dot tunneling, Coulomb exchange and correlations. We analyze, moreover, the effects of confinement, strains and Rashba interactions on the anisotropic exchange and singlet-triplet mixings at finite magnetic field. We finally illustrate the relevance of this methodology for time-dependent calculations on a singlet-triplet qubit.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Topological States without Dimension Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological insulators exhibit boundary states protected by bulk band topology, a principle first established in quantum systems and later extended to classical waves, including phononics. Conventionally, an $n$-dimensional bulk with nontrivial topology hosts $(n-1)$-dimensional topologically protected boundary states, which may be further gapped out by breaking the symmetry that protects them, potentially leading to the emergence of $(n-2)$-dimensional, or even lower-dimensional topological states, as in higher-order topological insulators. In this work, we introduce an alternative mechanism for gapping out topological states and forming new topological modes within the resulting gap without further unit-cell symmetry breaking or dimension reduction. Using one- and two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models, we show that controlled repositioning of topological domain walls enables the construction of hierarchical unit cells that gap out the original domain-wall states while preserving the underlying symmetry. This process produces higher-hierarchical-level topological states, characterized by a generalized winding number, and can be iterated to realize multiple - potentially infinite - hierarchical levels of topological states. Our approach expands the conventional topological classification and offers a versatile route for engineering complex networks of protected modes in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Collective Fluorescence of Graphene Quantum Dots on a surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the organization of graphene quantum dots on the surface of monocrystalline halide perovskite. We show that graphene quantum dots tends to aggregate on the surface of perovskite unlike in solution or on other substrates, even at very low concentration of the initial solution that should yield single-molecule samples. Spectral analysis on small clusters shows a back-and-forth dynamical transition between an uncoupled, monomer-like state, and an excimer state. Following this "dance" between states, a drastic one-way increase in fluorescence intensity combined with a shortening of the excited state lifetime has been observed on some clusters. This behavior is related to the emission of a collective state that may be a consequence of the dynamical organization of graphene quantum dots under illumination on the surface of the perovksite.</description>

      <title>Quantum Bipolar Thermoelectricity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermoelectricity is generally understood as a classical effect emerging from energy-dependent transport asymmetries. Here we uncover a purely quantum mechanism, where a superconducting S-I-S' tunnel junction in thermal equilibrium develops a nonlinear bipolar thermoelectric response owing to the dynamical Coulomb blockade and the emission-absorption imbalance of a cold electromagnetic bath. Two representative environments are analysed, revealing Seebeck coefficients up to 100 $\mu$V/K for realistic junction parameters. Because the response directly reflects the spectral properties of the surrounding environment, our results suggest that bipolar quantum thermoelectricity could provide a new route for spectroscopic sensing of electromagnetic modes and for designing low-temperature thermoelectric devices with environmentally engineered performance.</description>

      <title>Unconventional criticality in $O(D)$-invariant loop-constrained Landau theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an unconventional phase transition in ferroelectrics where the polarization field is constrained to be divergence-free, allowing only loop-like configurations. This local constraint fundamentally alters the critical behavior, driving the system beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. A renormalization group analysis shows that the polarization acquires an unusually large anomalous dimension, $\eta\approx 0.239$ in three dimensions, far exceeding the typical values in $O(3)$-invariant systems. We attribute this effect to an emergent gauge symmetry originating from the zero divergence constraint. Such gauge-field behavior is reminiscent of fractionalized phases, revealing a fundamental connection between constrained ferroelectrics and emergent gauge phenomena in correlated matter.</description>

      <title>Shubnikov-de Haas Oscillations in 2D $\text{PtSe}_2$: A fermiological Charge Carrier Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High magnetic field and low temperature transport is carried out in order to characterize the charge carriers of $\text{PtSe}_2$. In particular, the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations arising at applied magnetic field strengths $\gtrsim 4.5\,\text{T}$ are found to occur exclusively in plane and emerge at a layer thickness of $\approx 18\,\text{nm}$, increasing in amplitude and decreasing in frequency for thinner $\text{PtSe}_2$ flakes. Moreover, the quantum transport time, Berry phase, Dingle temperature and cyclotron mass of the charge carriers are ascertained. The emergence of weak antilocalization (WAL) lies in contrast to the presence of magnetic moments from Pt vacancies. An explanation is provided on how WAL and the Kondo effect can be observed within the same material. Detailed information about the charge carriers and transport phenomena in $\text{PtSe}_2$ is obtained, which is relevant for the design of prospective spintronic and orbitronic devices and for the realization of orbital Hall effect-based architectures.</description>
