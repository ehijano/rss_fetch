      <title>Instanton Density Operator in Lattice QCD from Higher Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A natural definition for instanton density operator in lattice QCD has been long desired. We show this problem is, and has to be, resolved by higher category theory. The problem is resolved by refining at a conceptual level the Yang-Mills theory on lattice, in order to recover the homotopy information in the continuum, which would have been lost if we put the theory on lattice in the traditional way.
  The refinement needed is a generalization -- through the lens of higher category theory -- of the familiar process of Villainization that captures winding in lattice XY model and Dirac quantization in lattice Maxwell theory. The apparent difference is that Villainization is in the end described by principal bundles, hence familiar, but more general topological operators can only be captured on the lattice by more flexible structures beyond the usual group theory and fibre bundles, hence the language of categories becomes natural and necessary. The key structure we need for our particular problem is called multiplicative bundle gerbe, based upon which we can construct suitable structures to naturally define the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten term, 3d skyrmion density operator and 4d hedgehog defect for lattice $S^3$ (pion vacua) non-linear sigma model, and the 3d Chern-Simons term, 4d instanton density operator and 5d Yang monopole defect for lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory.
  In a broader perspective, higher category theory enables us to rethink more systematically the relation between continuum quantum field theory and lattice quantum field theory. We sketch a proposal towards a general machinery that constructs the suitably refined lattice degrees of freedom for a given non-linear sigma model or gauge theory in the continuum, realizing the desired topological operators on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Inclusive reactions from finite Minkowski spacetime correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need to determine scattering amplitudes of few-hadron systems for arbitrary kinematics expands a broad set of subfields of modern-day nuclear and hadronic physics. In this work, we expand upon previous explorations on the use of real-time methods, like quantum computing or tensor networks, to determine few-body scattering amplitudes. Such calculations must be performed in a finite Minkowski spacetime, where scattering amplitudes are not well defined. Our previous work presented a conjecture of a systematically improvable estimator for scattering amplitudes constructed from finite-volume correlation functions. Here we provide further evidence that the prescription works for larger kinematic regions than previously explored as well as a broader class of scattering amplitudes. Finally, we devise a new method for estimating the order of magnitude of the error associated with finite time separations needed for such calculations. In units of the lightest mass of the theory, we find that to constrain amplitudes using real-time methods within $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$, the spacetime volumes must satisfy $mL \sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^2)$ and $ mT\sim \mathcal{O}(10^2-10^4)$.</description>

      <title>Coupled-channel $J^{--}$ meson resonances from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend an earlier calculation within lattice QCD of excited light meson resonances with $J^{PC}=1^{--}, 2^{--}, 3^{--}$ at the SU(3) flavor point in the singlet representation, by considering the octet representation. In this case the resonances appear in coupled-channel amplitudes, which we determine, establishing the relative strength of pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar to pseudoscalar-vector decays. Combining the new octet results with the prior results for the singlet, we perform a plausible extrapolation to the physical quark mass, and compare to experimental $\rho^\star_J, K^\star_J, \omega^\star_J$ and $\phi^\star_J$ resonances.</description>

      <title>QCD in the chiral SU(3) limit from baryon masses on Lattice QCD ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The baryon masses on CLS ensembles are used to determine the LEC that characterize QCD in the flavor-SU(3) limit with vanishing up, down, and strange quark masses. Here we reevaluate some of the baryon masses on flavor-symmetric ensembles with much-improved statistical precision, in particular for the decuplet states. These additional results then lead to a more significant chiral extrapolation of the Lattice data set to its chiral SU(3) limit. Our results are based on the chiral Lagrangian with baryon octet and decuplet fields considered at the one-loop level. Finite-box and discretization effects of the Lattice data are considered systematically. While in our global fit of the data we insist on large-Nc sum rules for the LEC that enter at N3LO, all other LEC are unconstrained. In particular, we obtain values for the chiral limit of the pion decay constant and the isospin-limit of the quark-mass ratio compatible with the FLAG report.</description>

      <title>Light quark mass dependence of nucleon mass to two-loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nucleon self energy through the sixth chiral order in the covariant $SU(2)$ chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT) in the single baryon sector. The validity of the extended on-mass-shell (EOMS) renormalization scheme is explicitly verified to two-loop order, manifested by the miraculous cancellation of all nonlocal divergences and power-counting-breaking (PCB) terms that are nonanalytic in pion mass. Using the $\sigma_{\pi N}$ term determined from the latest lattice simulation to constrain some unknown higher-order low energy constants (LECs), we predict the nucleon mass in the chiral limit to be $856.6\pm 1.7$ MeV. It is found that the EOMS scheme exhibits quite satisfactory convergence behavior through ${\cal O}(q^6)$ around physical point. We also predict the pion mass dependence of the nucleon mass to the accuracy of ${\cal O}(q^6)$, which is in satisfactory agreement with the recent lattice results over a wide range of pion mass.</description>

      <title>Single Particle Spectrum of Doped $\mathrm{C}_{20}\mathrm{H}_{12}$-Perylene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo study of doped perylene $\mathrm{C}_{20}\mathrm{H}_{12}$ described with the Hubbard model. Doped perylene can be used for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) or as acceptor material in organic solar cells. Therefore, central to this study is a scan over charge chemical potential. A variational basis of operators allows for the extraction of the single-particle spectrum through a mostly automatic fitting procedure. Finite chemical potential simulations suffer from a sign problem which we ameliorate through contour deformation. The on-site interaction is kept at $U/\kappa = 2$. Discretization effects are handled through a continuum limit extrapolation. Our first-principles calculation shows significant deviation from non-interacting results especially at large chemical potentials.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar and vector tetraquarks $bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pseudoscalar and vector four-quark states $bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$ are studied in the context of the QCD sum rule method. We model $T_{\mathrm{ PS}} $ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ as structures built of diquarks $ b^{T}C\gamma_{5}b$, $\overline{c}C\overline{c}^{T}$ and $b^{T}C\gamma _{5}b$ , $\overline{c}C\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{5}\overline{c}^{T}$, respectively, with $ C$ being the charge conjugation matrix. The spectroscopic parameters of the tetraquarks $T_{\mathrm{PS}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$, i.e., their masses and current couplings are calculated using QCD two-point sum rule method. We evaluate the full widths of $T_{\mathrm{PS}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ by taking into account their kinematically allowed decay channels. In the case of the pseudoscalar particle they are processes $T_{\mathrm{PS}} \to B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{\ast -}$, $B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{-}(1^{3}P_{0})$ and $B_{c}^{\ast -}B_{c}^{-}(1^{1}P_{1})$. The vector state $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ can dissociate to meson pairs $2 B_{c}^{-}$, $2 B_{c}^{\ast -}$ and $ B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{-}(1^{1}P_{1})$. Partial widths of these decays are determined by the strong couplings at relevant tetraquark-meson-meson vertices, which evaluated in the context of the three-point sum rule approach. Predictions obtained for the mass and full width of the pseudoscalar $m =(13.092\pm 0.095)~\mathrm{GeV}$, $\Gamma _{\mathrm{PS} }=(63.7\pm 9.4)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and vector $\widetilde{m} =(13.15\pm 0.10)~ \mathrm{GeV}$, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{V}}=(57.5.3\pm 8.6)~\mathrm{MeV}$ tetraquarks can be useful for analyses of different four-quark resonances.</description>

      <title>Cross Validation in Stochastic Analytic Continuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Analytic Continuation (SAC) of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) imaginary-time correlation function data is a valuable tool in connecting many-body models to experiments. Recent developments of the SAC method have allowed for spectral functions with sharp features, e.g. narrow peaks and divergent edges, to be resolved with unprecedented fidelity. Often times, it is not known what exact sharp features are present a priori, and, due to the ill-posed nature of the analytic continuation problem, multiple spectral representations may be acceptable. In this work, we borrow from the machine learning and statistics literature and implement a cross validation technique to provide an unbiased method to identify the most likely spectrum. We show examples using imaginary-time data generated by QMC simulations and synthetic data generated from artificial spectra. Our procedure, which can be considered a form of "model selection," can be applied to a variety of numerical analytic continuation methods, beyond just SAC.</description>

      <title>Random Disks of Constant Curvature: the Lattice Story</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We lay the groundwork for a UV-complete formulation of the Euclidean Jackiw-Teitelboim two-dimensional models of quantum gravity when the boundary lengths are finite, emphasizing the discretized approach. The picture that emerges is qualitatively new. For the disk topology, the problem reduces to counting so-called self-overlapping curves, that are closed loops that bound a distorted disk, with an appropriate multiplicity. We build a matrix model that does the correct counting. The theories in negative, zero and positive curvatures have the same UV description but drastically different macroscopic properties. The Schwarzian theory emerges in the limit of very large and negative cosmological constant in the negative curvature model, as an effective theory valid on distance scales much larger than the curvature length scale. In positive curvature, we argue that large geometries are ubiquitous and that the theory exists only for positive cosmological constant. Our discussion is pedagogical and includes a review of several relevant topics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the constraints on low-energy coefficients of the $\nu$SMEFT generalization of the Standard Model effective theory in the simple case of a $\text{U}(1)^\prime$ enlargement of the Standard Model gauge group. In particular, we analyse the constraints imposed by the requirement that the extended theory remains free of gauge anomalies. We present the cases of explicit realisations, showing the obtained correlations among the coefficients of $d=6$ operators.</description>

      <title>Calculating the two-photon exchange contribution to $K_L\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework within which both the real and imaginary parts of the complex, two-photon exchange amplitude contributing to $K_L\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ decay can be calculated using lattice QCD. The real part of this two-photon amplitude is of approximately the same size as that coming from a second-order weak strangeness-changing neutral-current process. Thus a test of the standard model prediction for this second-order weak process depends on an accurate result of this two-photon amplitude. A limiting factor of our proposed method comes from low-energy three-particle $\pi\pi\gamma$ states. The contribution from these states will be significantly distorted by the finite volume of our calculation -- a distortion for which there is no available correction. However, a simple estimate of the contribution of these three-particle states suggests their contribution to be at most a few percent allowing their neglect in a lattice calculation with a 10% target accuracy.</description>

      <title>Parallel Tempered Metadynamics: Overcoming potential barriers without surfing or tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At fine lattice spacings, Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations of QCD and other gauge theories with or without fermions are plagued by slow modes that give rise to large autocorrelation times. This can lead to simulation runs that are effectively stuck in one topological sector, a problem known as topological freezing. Here, we demonstrate that for a relevant set of parameters, Metadynamics can be used to unfreeze 4-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory. However, compared to local update algorithms and the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm, the computational overhead is significant in pure gauge theory, and the required reweighting procedure may considerably reduce the effective sample size. To deal with the latter problem, we propose modifications to the Metadynamics bias potential and the combination of Metadynamics with parallel tempering. We test the new algorithm in 4-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory and find that it can achieve topological unfreezing without compromising the effective sample size, thereby reducing the autocorrelation times of topological observables by at least two orders of magnitude compared to conventional update algorithms. Additionally, we observe significantly improved scaling of autocorrelation times with the lattice spacing in 2-dimensional U(1) gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the Grabowska-Kaplan framework, originally proposed for lattice chiral gauge theories, to QCD. We show that the resulting theory contains a conserved and gauge invariant singlet axial current, both on the lattice and in the continuum limit. This must give rise to a difference with QCD, with the simplest possibility being a superfluous Nambu-Goldstone boson in the physical spectrum not present in QCD. We find a similar unwanted conserved current in the recent "disk" formalism [Kaplan, Kaplan &amp; Sen], this time limiting ourselves to the continuum formulation. A similar problem is expected when either of these formalisms is used for its original goal of constructing lattice chiral gauge theories. Finally we discuss a conjecture about the possible dynamics that might be associated with the unwanted conserved current, and the fate of 't Hooft vertices.</description>

      <title>Using massless fields for observing black hole features in the collapsed phase of Euclidean dynamical triangulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07081v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on an old computation of propagators of massless scalar fields on an ensemble of configurations in the 4D path integral of Euclidean dynamical triangulations in the collapsed (crumpled) phase. The resulting quantum average is used to calculate the scale factor of a rotational invariant metric in a 4-dimensional space. This new scale factor is non-zero at the origin, which we assume to be caused by the presence of the well-known singular structure in the collapsed phase. It depends on an overall integration constant. A transformation to a metric in (1+3)-dimensions reveals Euclidean black hole features at an instant in time, with a horizon separating interior and exterior parts. Effective Einstein equations in the presence of a `geometric condensate' are assumed, and computed with the software OGRe. We find similarities with the energy density and pressure of gravastars, as well as remnants, and investigate their dependence on the integration constant.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulations of Hadron Dynamics in the Schwinger Model using 112 Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hadron wavepackets are prepared and time evolved in the Schwinger model using 112 qubits of IBM's 133-qubit Heron quantum computer ibm_torino. The initialization of the hadron wavepacket is performed in two steps. First, the vacuum is prepared across the whole lattice using the recently developed SC-ADAPT-VQE algorithm and workflow. SC-ADAPT-VQE is then extended to the preparation of localized states, and used to establish a hadron wavepacket on top of the vacuum. This is done by adaptively constructing low-depth circuits that maximize the overlap with an adiabatically prepared hadron wavepacket. Due to the localized nature of the wavepacket, these circuits can be determined on a sequence of small lattices using classical computers, and then robustly scaled to prepare wavepackets on large lattices for simulations using quantum computers. Time evolution is implemented with a second-order Trotterization. To reduce both the required qubit connectivity and circuit depth, an approximate quasi-local interaction is introduced. This approximation is made possible by the emergence of confinement at long distances, and converges exponentially with increasing distance of the interactions. Using multiple error-mitigation strategies, up to 14 Trotter steps of time evolution are performed, employing 13,858 two-qubit gates (with a CNOT depth of 370). The propagation of hadrons is clearly identified, with results that compare favorably with Matrix Product State simulations. Prospects for a near-term quantum advantage in simulations of hadron scattering are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the inverse moment of the $B_s$-meson light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA), denoted as $\lambda_{B_s}$ and defined within the heavy quark effective theory, through the calculation of $B_s \to \eta_s$ form factors. The presence of the $s$-quark inside the $B_s$-meson dictates a notable departure of approximately $20\%$ in the $\lambda_{B_s}$ value compared to the non-strange case $\lambda_{B_q}$, as computed within the QCD sum rule approach, albeit with significant uncertainty. First, we compute the decay constant of the $\eta_s$-meson utilizing two-point sum rules while retaining finite $s$-quark mass contributions. Next, we constrain the parameter $\lambda_{B_s}$ by calculating $B_s \to \eta_s$ form factors within the light-cone sum rule approach, using $B_s$-meson LCDAs, and leveraging Lattice QCD estimates at zero momentum transfer from the HPQCD collaboration. Our findings yield $\lambda_{B_s}$ = 480 $\pm$ 92 MeV when expressing the $B_s$-meson LCDAs in the Exponential model, consistent with previous QCD sum rule estimate yet exhibiting a 1.5-fold improvement in uncertainty. Furthermore, we compare the form factor predictions, based on the extracted $\lambda_{B_s}$ value, with earlier analyses for other channels such as $B_s \to D_s$ and $B_s \to K$.</description>

      <title>Phases and Duality in Fundamental Kazakov-Migdal Model on the Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the fundamental Kazakov-Migdal (FKM) model on a generic graph, whose partition function is represented by the Ihara zeta function weighted by unitary matrices. The FKM model becomes unstable in the critical strip of the Ihara zeta function. We discover a duality between small and large couplings, associated with the functional equation of the Ihara zeta function for regular graphs. Although the duality is not precise for irregular graphs, we show that the effective action in the large coupling region can be represented by a summation of all possible Wilson loops on the graph similar to that in the small coupling region. We estimate the phase structure of the FKM model both in the small and large coupling regions by comparing it with the Gross-Witten-Wadia (GWW) model. We further validate the theoretical analysis through detailed numerical simulations.</description>
