      <title>Low-temperature "Depletion" of Superfluid Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landau theory of superfluidity associates low-temperature flow of the normal component with the phonon wind. This picture does not apply to superfluids in which Galilean invariance is broken either by disorder, or porous media, or lattice potential, and the phonon wind is no longer responsible for depletion of the superfluid component. Based on Popov's hydrodynamic action with aharmonic terms, we present a general theory for temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness at low $T$, which reproduces Landau result as a special case when several parameters of the hydrodynamic action are fixed by the Galilean invariance. At the technical level, the theory of low-temperature depletion in a $d$-dimensional quantum superfluid maps onto the problem of finite-size corrections in a $(d+1)$-dimensional anisotropic (pseudo-)classical-field system with U(1)-symmetric complex-valued action. We validate our theory with numeric simulations of interacting lattice bosons and the J-current model. In a broader context, our approach reveals universal low-temperature thermodynamics of superfluids.</description>

      <title>Tunable Field-Linked $s$-wave Interactions in Dipolar Fermi Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin mixtures of degenerate fermions are a cornerstone of quantum many-body physics, enabling superfluidity, polarons, and rich spin dynamics through $s$-wave scattering resonances. Combining them with strong, long-range dipolar interactions provides highly flexible control schemes promising even more exotic quantum phases. Recently, microwave shielding gave access to spin-polarized degenerate samples of dipolar fermionic molecules, where tunable $p$-wave interactions were enabled by field-linked resonances available only by compromising the shielding. Here, we study the scattering properties of a fermionic dipolar spin mixture and show that a universal $s$-wave resonance is readily accessible without compromising the shielding. We develop a universal description of the tunable $s$-wave interaction and weakly bound tetratomic states based on the microwave-field parameters. The $s$-wave resonance paves the way to stable, controllable and strongly-interacting dipolar spin mixtures of deeply degenerate fermions and supports favorable conditions to reach this regime via evaporative cooling.</description>

      <title>Supersolid Phases in Ultracold Gases of Microwave Shielded Polar Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme to realize the supersolid phase in ultracold gases of microwave-shielded polar molecules by engineering an additional anisotropy in inter-molecular dipolar interaction via an elliptically polarized microwave. It is shown through quantum Monte-Carlo calculations that the interplay of the anisotropies between the interaction and trapping potential gives rise to rich quantum phases. Particularly, it is found that the supersolid phase emerges in the parameter regime accessible to current experiments. Our study paves the way for exploring the properties of supersolid phases in ultracold gases of polar molecules.</description>

      <title>An anomalous particle-exchange mechanism for two isolated Bose gases merged into one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an isolated ideal Bose system with a fixed energy, the number of microstates depends solely on the configurations of bosons in excited states, implying zero entropy for particles in the ground state. When two such systems merge, the resulting entropy is less than the sum of the individual entropies. This entropy decrease is numerically shown to arise from an effectively but anomalous exchange of particles in excited states, where $\overline{N}!/(\overline{N}_{1}!\overline{N}_{2}!)&lt;1$. Here, $\overline{N}$, $\overline{N}_{1}$, and $\overline{N}_{2}$ are real decimals representing, respectively, the mean number of particles in excited states in the merged system and the two individual systems before merging, with $\overline{N}&lt;\overline{N}_{1}+\overline{N}_{2}$.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch Band Theory for 2D Geometry-Dependent Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by boundary-localized eigenstates under open boundary conditions, represents the key feature of the non-Hermitian lattice systems. Although the non-Bloch band theory has achieved success in depicting the NHSE in one-dimensional (1D) systems, its extension to higher dimensions encounters a fundamental hurdle in the form of the geometry-dependent skin effect (GDSE), where the energy spectra and the boundary localization of the eigenstates rely on the lattice geometry. In this work, we establish the non-Bloch band theory for two-dimensional (2D) GDSE, by introducing a strip generalized Brillouin zone (SGBZ) framework. Through taking two sequential 1D thermodynamic limits, first along a major axis and then along a minor axis, we construct geometry-dependent non-Bloch bands, unraveling that the GDSE originates from the competition between incompatible SGBZs. Based on our theory, we derive for the first time a crucial sufficient condition for the GDSE: the non-Bloch dynamical degeneracy splitting of SGBZ eigenstates, where a continuous set of degenerate complex momenta breaks down into a discrete set. Moreover, our SGBZ formulation reveals that the Amoeba spectrum contains the union of all possible SGBZ spectra, which bridges the gap between the GDSE and the Amoeba theory. The proposed SGBZ framework offers a universal roadmap for exploring non-Hermitian effects in 2D lattice systems, opening up new avenues for the design of novel non-Hermitian materials and devices with tailored boundary behaviors.</description>

      <title>Vortex Detection from Quantum Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum solutions to differential equations represent quantum data -- states that contain relevant information about the system's behavior, yet are difficult to analyze. We propose a toolbox for reading out information from such data, where customized quantum circuits enable efficient extraction of flow properties. We concentrate on the process referred to as quantum vortex detection (QVD), where specialized operators are developed for pooling relevant features related to vorticity. Specifically, we propose approaches based on sliding windows and quantum Fourier analysis that provide a separation between patches of the flow field with vortex-type profiles. First, we show how contour-shaped windows can be applied, trained, and analyzed sequentially, providing a clear signal to flag the location of vortices in the flow. Second, we develop a parallel window extraction technique, such that signals from different contour positions are coherently processed to avoid looping over the entire solution mesh. We show that Fourier features can be extracted from the flow field, leading to classification of datasets with vortex-free solutions against those exhibiting Lamb-Oseen vortices. Our work exemplifies a successful case of efficiently extracting value from quantum data and points to the need for developing appropriate quantum data analysis tools that can be trained on them.</description>

      <title>Quantum channel for modeling spin-motion dephasing in Rydberg chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum channel to model the dissipative dynamics resulting from the coupling between spin and motional degrees of freedom in chains of neutral atoms with Rydberg interactions. The quantum channel acts on the reduced spin state obtained under the frozen gas approximation, modulating its elements with time-dependent coefficients. These coefficients can be computed exactly in the perturbative regime, enabling efficient modeling of spin-motion dephasing in systems too large for exact methods. We benchmark the accuracy of our approach against exact diagonalization for small systems, identifying its regime of validity and the onset of perturbative breakdown. We then apply the quantum channel to compute fidelity loss during transport of single-spin excitations across extended Rydberg chains in regimes intractable via exact diagonalization. By revealing the quantum-classical crossover, these results establish a bound on the maximum chain length for efficient entanglement distribution. The quantum channel significantly reduces the complexity of simulating spin dynamics coupled to motional degrees of freedom, providing a practical tool for estimating the impact of spin-motion coupling in near-term experiments with Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Dynamical structure factor and a new method to measure the pairing gap in two-dimensional attractive Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement of the pairing gap plays an essential role in studying the physical properties of superconductors or superfluids. We develop a strategy for measure the pairing gap through the dynamical excitations. With the random phase approximation (RPA), the dynamical excitations of a two-dimensional attractive Fermi-Hubbard model are studied by calculating the dynamical structure factor. Two distinct collective modes are investigated: a Goldstone phonon mode at the transferred momentum ${\bf q}=\left[0,0\right]$ and a roton mode at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$. The roton mode demonstrates a sharp molecular peak in the low-energy regime. Remarkably, the area under the roton molecular peak scales with the square of the pairing gap, which persists even in three-dimensional and spin-orbit coupled (SOC) optical lattices. This result provides a potential strategy to measure the pairing gap of lattice systems experimentally by measuring the dynamical structure factor at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$.</description>

      <title>Collapse of a quantum vortex in an attractive two-dimensional Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally and numerically study the collapse dynamics of a quantum vortex in a two-dimensional atomic superfluid following a fast interaction ramp from repulsion to attraction. We find the conditions and time scales for a superfluid vortex to radially converge into a quasi-stationary density profile, demonstrating the spontaneous formation of a vortex soliton-like structure in an atomic Bose gas. We record an emergent self-similar dynamics caused by an azimuthal modulational instability, which amplifies initial density perturbations and leads to the eventual splitting of a solitonic ring profile or direct fragmentation of a superfluid into disordered, but roughly circular arrays of Townes soliton-like wavepackets. These dynamics are qualitatively reproduced by simulations based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. However, a discrepancy in the magnitude of amplified density fluctuations predicted by our mean-field analysis suggests the presence of effects beyond the mean-field approximation. Our study sets the stage for exploring out-of-equilibrium dynamics of vortex quantum matter quenched to attractive interactions and their universal characteristics.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional bosonic droplets in a harmonic trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a system of bosons in a two-dimensional harmonic trap. In the limit of strong attractive interactions, the bosons make a droplet insensitive to external confinement. For weak interactions, in contrast, the ground state is given by the harmonic trap. In this work, we conduct a variational study of the transition between these two limits. We find that this transition occurs abruptly at the critical interaction strength whose value is universal if scaled appropriately with the number of particles. To connect the abrupt change in the properties of the system to the classical description of phase transitions, we analyze the static response of the Bose gas related to the isothermal compressibility. Finally, we perform numerically exact calculations for a few particles to demonstrate the effects of finite range interactions on this transition. We conclude that finite range effects wash out the point of transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent currents flowing in spatially closed tracks define one of the most iconic concepts in mesoscopic physics. They have been studied in solid-state platforms such as superfluids, superconductors and metals. Cold atoms trapped in magneto-optical toroidal circuits and driven by suitable artificial gauge fields allow us to study persistent currents with unprecedented control and flexibility of the system's physical conditions. Here, we review persistent currents of ultracold matter. Capitalizing on the remarkable progress in driving different atomic species to quantum degeneracy, persistent currents of single or multicomponent bosons/fermions, and their mixtures can be addressed within the present experimental know-how. This way, fundamental concepts of quantum science and many-body physics, like macroscopic quantum coherence, solitons, vortex dynamics, fermionic pairing and BEC-BCS crossover can be studied from a novel perspective. Finally, we discuss how persistent currents can form the basis of new technological applications like matter-wave gyroscopes and interferometers.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek scaling of the superfluid-supersolid transition in an elongated dipolar gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate interaction quenches crossing from a superfluid to a supersolid state in a dipolar quantum gas of ${}^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ atoms, trapped in an elongated tube with periodic boundary conditions, via the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. A freeze-out time is observed through a delay in supersolid formation after crossing the critical point. We compute the density-density correlations at the freeze-out time and extract the frozen correlation length for the solid order. An analysis of the freeze-out time and correlation length versus the interaction quench rate allows us to extract universal exponents corresponding to the relaxation time and correlation length based on predictions of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Over several orders of magnitude, clear power-law scaling is observed for both the freeze-out time and the correlation length, and the corresponding exponents are compatible with predictions based on the excitation spectrum calculated via Bogoliubov theory. Defects due to independent local breaking of translational symmetry, contributing to globally incommensurate supersolid order, are identified, and their number at the freeze-out time is found to also scale as a power law. Our results support the hypothesis of a continuous transition whose universality class remains to be determined but appears to differ from that of the (1+1)D XY model.</description>

      <title>Saturation of thermal and spin conductances in a dissipative superfluid junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermionic superfluid junctions typically exhibit suppressed thermal and spin transport due to the presence of a pairing gap but allow coherent particle transport. While dissipation generally weakens coherent transport, it can also induce excitations that open other transport channels. In this work, we experimentally study a one-dimensional superfluid junction of strongly interacting fermions with local particle loss and observe dissipation-induced thermal and spin transport that appear to saturate at strong dissipation. Notably, in this regime, the measured thermal and spin conductances are comparable to the universal quantized conductance of one-dimensional ideal Fermi gas. Qualitatively similar behavior is observed for two dissipation mechanisms, either spin-imbalanced or pairwise losses. Our findings provide new insights into transport in interacting open quantum systems and suggest possibilities of dissipative control of spin and thermoelectric transport.</description>

      <title>A Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield bound with a first-order system in the $2D$ Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04092v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bounded from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but ``dressed'' by the condensate profile) and the second to the ``skewness'' of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations that satisfy a system of two first-order partial differential equations. When such a BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are also satisfied. The analytic solutions of this BPS system in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed, and the implications of these results are outlined.</description>

      <title>Band-edge superfluid of Bose-Einstein condensates in the spin-orbit-coupled Zeeman lattice</title>

Abstract: Since the first experimental realization of Bose-Einstein condensates in a spin-orbit-coupled Zeeman lattice, a wide range of applications have been found in these systems. Here, we systematically study the ground-state phase diagram of the systems. We address that the band-edge phase in the ground-state phase diagram is exotic and exists in a very broad parameter regime. The superfluidity of the band-edge states is identified by elementary excitations and superfluid fraction.</description>

      <title>Observation of many-body coherence in quasi-one-dimensional attractive Bose gases</title>

Abstract: Macroscopic coherence is an important feature of quantum many-body systems exhibiting collective behaviors, with examples ranging from atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, and quantum liquids to superconductors. Probing many-body coherence in a dynamically unstable regime, however, presents an intriguing and outstanding challenge in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here, we experimentally study the first- and second-order coherence of degenerate quasi-one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases quenched from repulsive to modulationally unstable attractive interaction regimes. The resulting dynamics, monitored by in-situ density and matter-wave interference imaging, reveals phase-coherent density wave evolutions arising from the interplay between noise-amplified density modulations and dispersive shock waves of broad interest within nonlinear physics. At longer times, the gases become phase-scrambled, exhibiting a finite correlation length. Interestingly, following an interaction quench back to the repulsive regime, we observe that quasi-long-range coherence can be spontaneously re-established. This captivating rephasing dynamics can be attributed to the nucleation and annihilation of density defects in the quasi-1D geometry. These results shed light on out-of-equilibrium phase coherence in quantum many-body systems in a regime where beyond mean-field effects may arise and theoretical approaches have not been well-established.</description>

      <title>The Streda Formula for Floquet Systems: Topological Invariants and Quantized Anomalies from Cesaro Summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The St\v{r}eda formula establishes a fundamental connection between the topological invariants characterizing the bulk of topological matter and the presence of gapless edge modes. In this work, we extend the St\v{r}eda formula to periodically driven systems, providing a rigorous framework to elucidate the unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet systems, while offering a link between Floquet winding numbers and tractable response functions. Using the Sambe representation of periodically driven systems, we analyze the response of the unbounded Floquet density of states to a magnetic perturbation. This Floquet-St\v{r}eda response is regularized through Ces\`aro summation, yielding a well-defined, quantized result within spectral gaps. The response features two physically distinct contributions: a quantized charge flow between edge and bulk, and an anomalous energy flow between the system and the drive, offering new insight into the nature of anomalous edge states. This result rigorously connects Floquet winding numbers to the orbital magnetization density of Floquet states and holds broadly, from clean to disordered and inhomogeneous systems. This is further supported by providing a real-space formulation of the Floquet-St\v{r}eda response, which introduces a local topological marker suited for periodically driven settings. In translationally-invariant systems, the framework yields a remarkably simple expression for Floquet winding numbers involving geometric properties of Floquet-Bloch bands. A concrete experimental protocol is proposed to extract the Floquet-St\v{r}eda response via particle-density measurements in systems coupled to engineered baths. Finally, by expressing the topological invariants through the magnetic response of the Floquet density of states, this approach opens a promising route toward the topological characterization of interacting driven phases.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Dynamic Range of Sub-Quantum-Limit Measurements via Quantum Deamplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15061v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Balancing high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range is a fundamental challenge in measurement science, as improving one often compromises the other. While traditional quantum metrology has prioritized enhancing local sensitivity, a large dynamic range is crucial for applications such as atomic clocks, where extended phase interrogation times contribute to wider phase range. In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism that extends dynamic range at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses two sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled probe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum interferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting dynamics. Further expansion of dynamic range is possible by using sequential quantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes. Additionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced by a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum amplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art atomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient pathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.</description>
