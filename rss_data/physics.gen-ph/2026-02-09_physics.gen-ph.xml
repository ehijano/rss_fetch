      <title>Noether's theorem for the conditional principle of least action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the first Noether's theorem to the theories whose field equations result from the requirement of conditional extremum of the action. The key ingredient of the extension is the gauge symmetry of the differential equations constraining the admissible class of field configurations. We consider a special type of global symmetries of the action which we call conditional symmetries. Such global symmetries must be special cases of gauge transformations of the constraint equations. We construct conservation laws that follow from the conditional symmetries of action. We also prove the converse theorem which connects the conserved currents to the conditional symmetries of action. The general method is illustrated by several mechanical and field-theoretical examples.</description>

      <title>Quantum states of macrosystems and entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper examines and critiques the expression of entropy as the logarithm of the number of quantum states of a physical system. Boltzmann method of expressing entropy as the logarithm of the number of states of a gas with a given total energy is analyzed. We demonstrate that entropy is the product of subquantum processes and show that entropy is expressed as the ratio of the logarithm of the maximum number of realizations, over the observation period, of a macroscopic system's states with a given total energy, to the number of occurrences of its quantum states over this time.</description>

      <title>High-Level Fault-Tolerant Abstractions for Quantum-Gate Circuit Design and Synthesis: PQC and Topological Anyon Architectures (TQC) for Categorical Computations in SU(2)_3 TQFT and D-brane Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a dual-architecture quantum simulation framework for modeling morphisms and stability conditions in the bounded derived category $\mathbf{D}^b(\mathrm{Coh}(X))$, with applications to D-brane physics on K\"ahler and non-K\"ahler manifolds. Two physically executable quantum realizations are constructed: parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) implemented on conventional gate-based qubit platforms, and a topological quantum computing (TQC) realization using braiding and fusion of Fibonacci anyons modeled via SU(2)$_3$ modular tensor categories.In the PQC model, we encode slope functionals S(F) and stability constraints as variational observables, mapping derived morphisms to unitaries that evolve over parameterized angles. The output expectation values simulate quantum-corrected Chern class inequalities with deformation terms $\delta$, capturing quantum corrections to classical geometric stability. In the TQC model, we engineer braid group representations to implement functorial transformations such as spherical twists and autoequivalences as sequences of fault-tolerant braid operations. This bifurcated approach provides a robust engineering pipeline for simulating categorical stability and homological algebra on quantum hardware, bridging abstract derived category theory with executable quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>Discrete Noether Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1409</link>
      <description>arXiv:1405.1409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple implementation of Noether's theorem for discrete symmetries in relativistic continuum field theories is presented. The associated conserved current is exemplified by charge conjugation and a cyclic symmetry. In addition, the quantum version of current conservation for discrete symmetries is briefly discussed.</description>
