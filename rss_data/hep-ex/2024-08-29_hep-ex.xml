      <title>Longitudinal double spin asymmetry of $\pi^{\pm}$-tagged jet, $\Lambda$, $\overline{\Lambda}$, and $K_S^0$ in polarized $p+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ $\rm{GeV}$ at STAR</title>

Abstract: Understanding the origin of the proton spin is one of the most fundamental and challenging questions in QCD. Much progress has been made since the first surprising result by the EMC experiment in the late 1980s. However, the helicity distributions of strange quarks and anti-quarks inside the proton are still not well constrained by the experimental data. Measurement of the longitudinal double spin asymmetry $A_{LL}$ of the inclusive jets tagged with a $\pi^{\pm}/\pi^-$ carrying high jet momentum fraction, $z$, in $p+p$ collisions can provide further constraints on the gluon helicity distribution in the proton. In addition, the $A_{LL}$ of $\Lambda$, $\overline{\Lambda}$ and $K_S^0$ in the longitudinally polarized $p+p$ collisions may shed light on the strange quark and anti-quark helicity distributions. In this contribution, we report the preliminary results on the $A_{LL}$ measurements of inclusive jets tagged with a high-$z$ $\pi^{\pm}$, and the $\Lambda$, $\overline{\Lambda}$ and $K_S^0$. We utilize the longitudinally polarized $p+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ $\rm{GeV}$ collected by the STAR experiment with an integrated luminosity of about 52 $\rm{pb^{-1}}$.</description>

      <title>A roadmap for neutrino detection at LHC, HL-LHC and SPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SND@LHC is a new detector for neutrino physics at LHC. Its experimental configuration makes it possible to distinguish between all three neutrino flavours, opening a unique opportunity to probe physics of heavy flavour production at the LHC in the region that is not accessible to ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. It can also explore lepton flavour universality in the neutral sector, and search for feebly interacting particles. The detector has been commissioned and installed in 2021-2022. A first set of data has since then been collected, providing the first observation of neutrinos produced at a collider. This paper discusses the detector technologies being used to study high-energy neutrinos at the LHC, and their performance in terms of physics reach. The necessary upgrades to operate at high-luminosity LHC are presented, as well as a proposed experiment to perform neutrino measurements at the newly approved Beam Dump Facility.</description>

      <title>Ultralight dark matter detection with levitated ferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Levitated ferromagnets act as ultraprecise magnetometers, which can exhibit high quality factors due to their excellent isolation from the environment. These instruments can be utilized in searches for ultralight dark matter candidates, such as axionlike dark matter or dark-photon dark matter. In addition to being sensitive to an axion-photon coupling or kinetic mixing, which produce physical magnetic fields, ferromagnets are also sensitive to the effective magnetic field (or ``axion wind") produced by an axion-electron coupling. While the dynamics of a levitated ferromagnet in response to a DC magnetic field have been well studied, all of these couplings would produce AC fields. In this work, we study the response of a ferromagnet to an applied AC magnetic field and use these results to project their sensitivity to axion and dark-photon dark matter. We pay special attention to the direction of motion induced by an applied AC field, in particular, whether it precesses around the applied field (similar to an electron spin) or librates in the plane of the field (similar to a compass needle). We show that existing levitated ferromagnet setups can already have comparable sensitivity to an axion-electron coupling as comagnetometer or torsion balance experiments. In addition, future setups can become sensitive probes of axion-electron coupling, dark-photon kinetic mixing, and axion-photon coupling, for ultralight dark matter masses $m_\mathrm{DM}\lesssim\mathrm{feV}$.</description>

      <title>Production and in-medium modification of $\phi$ mesons in proton-nucleus reactions from a transport approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Production and in-medium modification of hidden strange $\phi$ mesons are studied in proton-nucleus reactions - p+C, p+Cu and p+Pb - at 12 GeV/c, partially measured by the KEK E325 collaboration via the dilepton decay mode. This work is based on the off-shell microscopic Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, which provides the dynamical description of strongly interacting hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom in dense matter, and especially makes it possible to simulate in-medium off-shell dynamics of the $\phi$ meson in the reactions studied. Different in-medium scenarios for the modification of the $\phi$ meson spectral function in nuclear matter are investigated: i) dropping pole mass, ii) collisional broadening and iii) simultaneous dropping pole mass and collisional broadening. Even though the $\phi$ meson production in p+A reactions occurs only at densities around or below normal nuclear matter density $\rho_0$, we find visible modifications of the generated dilepton spectra for the in-medium scenarios compared to the vacuum distribution.</description>

      <title>Tracking the baryon number with nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryon quantum number is believed to be conserved since baryogenesis in the early Universe. While fractionally charged valence quarks are understood conventionally to each carry a baryon number of 1/3, the baryon junction, a non-perturbative Y-shaped topology of neutral gluons, has also been proposed as an alternative entity tracing the baryon number. Neither scenario has been verified experimentally. The STAR Collaboration reports measurements at mid-rapidity of baryon number ($\boldsymbol{B}$) over the electric charge number difference ($\boldsymbol{\Delta Q}$) in isobar nuclear collisions, and the net-proton yield along rapidity in photonuclear collisions. A larger $\boldsymbol{B/\Delta Q}$ ratio and less asymmetric net-proton yield are observed than predicted from models assigning baryon number to valence quarks. These findings, corroborated by previous measurements in Au+Au collisions, disfavor the valence quark picture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light of the recent data for $\bar{B}_{(s)}\to D^{(*)}_{(s)}P$ and $\bar{B}_{(s)}\to D_{(s)}V$ decays, we perform a model-independent phenomenological analysis in the presence of quasi-elastic rescattering. With the Wilson coefficients including contributions beyond the standard model, lifetimes of $B$ meson as well as the $B^0_d-\bar{B}^0_d$ mixing are investigated for clarifying correlations among the observables. We show that parameter regions for quasi-elastic rescattering, the size of color-suppressed tree amplitudes and new physics are constrained due to the lifetime data. As a consequence, it is revealed that this scenario can be testable by the future LHCb measurement of width difference in $B^0_d-\bar{B}^0_d$ mixing and semi-leptonic CP asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Modelling the underlying event in photon-initiated processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling the underlying event in high-energy hadronic collisions is important for physics at colliders. This includes lepton colliders, where low-virtuality photons accompanying the lepton beam(s) may develop hadronic structure. Similarly, photon-induced collisions also occur in proton or heavy-ion beam experiments. While the underlying event in proton-proton collisions has been the subject of much study at the LHC, studies of hadronic-photon-induced underlying event are now of increasing interest in light of planned future lepton and lepton-hadron colliders, as well as the photon-induced processes in ultra-peripheral collisions at the LHC. Here we present an investigation of the underlying event in photon-initiated processes, starting from the PYTHIA models used to describe LHC and Tevatron data, and revisiting HERA and LEP2 data. While no single tune describes all the data with different beam configurations, we find that a good agreement can still be found within the same model by adjusting the relevant parameters separately for $\gamma\gamma$, $\gamma p$ and $pp$. This suggests that the basic model of multiparton interaction implemented in PYTHIA can be applied for different beam configurations. Furthermore, we find that a reasonable agreement for $\gamma\gamma$ and $\gamma p$ data, and for $pp$ data at an LHC reference energy, can be found within a single parametrization, but $pp$ collisions would prefer a stronger energy dependence, leading to too many multiparton interactions in lower energy photon-induced collisions. On this basis, we make some recommendations for simulations of photon-induced processes, such as $\gamma \gamma$ events at the LHC or FCC and $ep$ or $eA$ collisions at the EIC, and suggest possibilities for improvements in the modelling.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Type-II and Type-III seesaw model for the muon $g-2$ anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the muon anomalous dipole moment $a_\mu$ in a model that extends the Standard Model with a scalar triplet and a vector-like lepton triplet. Different from previous studies, we find that there is still viable parameter space in this model to explain the discrepancy $\Delta a_\mu=a_{\mu}(\mathrm{Exp})-a_{\mu}(\mathrm{SM})$. While being consistent with the current data of neutrino mass, precision electroweak measurements and the perturbativity of couplings, our model can provide new physics contribution $a_\mu^\textrm{NP}$ to cover the central region of $\Delta a_\mu$ with new scalar and fermion mass as low as around TeV. This mass scale is allowed by the current collider searches for doubly charged scalars and vector-like leptons, and they can be tested at future high energy and/or high luminosity colliders.</description>

      <title>Probing Lorentz invariance with a high-energy neutrino flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-of-flight measurements of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos can be used to probe Lorentz invariance, a pillar of modern physics. If Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) occurs, it could cause neutrinos to slow down, with the delay scaling linearly or quadratically with their energy. We introduce non-parametric statistical methods designed to detect LIV-induced distortions in the temporal structure of a high-energy neutrino flare as it travels to Earth from a distant astrophysical source, independently of the intrinsic timing properties of the source. Our approach, illustrated using the 2014/2015 TeV-PeV neutrino flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056 detected by IceCube, finds that the LIV energy scale must exceed 10^{14} GeV (linear) or 10^9 GeV (quadratic). Our methods provide a robust means to investigate LIV by focusing solely on a neutrino flare, without relying on electromagnetic counterparts, and account for realistic energy and directional uncertainties. For completeness, we compare our limits inferred from TXS 0506+056 to the sensitivity inferred from multi-messenger detection of tentative coincidences between neutrinos and electromagnetic emission from active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events.</description>

      <title>Prospect for measurement of the CP-violating phase $\phi_s$ in the $B_{s}\rightarrow J/\psi \phi$ channel at a future Z factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10565v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CP-violating phase $\phi_s$, the \Bs decay width ($\Gamma_s$), and the \Bs decay width difference ($\Delta\Gamma_s$) are sensitive probes to new physics and can constrain the heavy quark expansion theory. The potential for the measurement at future $Z$ factories is studied in this manuscript. It is found that operating at Tera-$Z$ mode, the expected precision can reach: $\sigma(\phi_s) = 4.6~\mathrm{mrad}$, $\sigma(\Delta\Gamma_s) = 2.4~\mathrm{ns^{-1}}$ and $\sigma(\Gamma_s) = 0.72~\mathrm{ns^{-1}}$. The precision of $\phi_s$ is 40\% larger than the expected precision with the LHCb experiment at HL-LHC. If operating at 10-Tera-$Z$ mode, the precision of $\phi_s$ can be measured at 45\% of the precision obtained from the LHCb experiment at HL-LHC. However, the measurement of $\Gamma_s$ and $\Delta\Gamma_s$ cannot benefit from the excellent time resolution and tagging power of the future $Z$-factories. Only operating at 10-Tera-$Z$ mode can the $\Gamma_s$ and $\Delta\Gamma_s$ reach an 18\% larger precision than the precision expected to be obtained from LHCb at HL-LHC. The control of penguin contamination at the future Z-factories is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Differential cross-sections are measured for the production of four charged leptons in association with two jets. These measurements are sensitive to final states in which the jets are produced via the strong interaction as well as to the purely-electroweak vector boson scattering process. The analysis is performed using proton-proton collision data collected by ATLAS at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and with an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$. The data are corrected for the effects of detector inefficiency and resolution and are compared to state-of-the-art Monte Carlo event generator predictions. The differential cross-sections are used to search for anomalous weak-boson self-interactions that are induced by dimension-six and dimension-eight operators in Standard Model effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Search for charged-lepton-flavour violating $\mu\tau qt$ interactions in top-quark production and decay in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}= 13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search for charged-lepton-flavour violating $\mu\tau qt$ ($q=u,c$) interactions is presented, considering both top-quark production and decay. The data analysed correspond to 140 $\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}= $13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The analysis targets events containing two muons with the same electric charge, a hadronically decaying $\tau$-lepton and at least one jet, with exactly one $b$-tagged jet, produced by a $\mu\tau qt$ interaction. Agreement with the Standard Model expectation within $1.6\sigma$ is observed, and limits are set at the 95% CL on the charged-lepton-flavour violation branching ratio of $\mathcal{B}(t \to \mu\tau q) &lt; 8.7 \times 10^{-7}$. An Effective Field Theory interpretation is performed yielding 95% CL limits on Wilson coefficients, dependent on the flavour of the associated light quark and the Lorentz structure of the coupling. These range from $|c_{\mathsf{lequ}}^{3(2313)}| / \Lambda^{2} &lt; 0.10\textrm{ TeV}^{-2}$ for $\mu\tau ut$ to $|c_{\mathsf{ lequ}}^{1(2323)}| / \Lambda^{2} &lt; 1.8\textrm{ TeV}^{-2}$ for $\mu\tau ct$. An additional interpretation is performed for scalar leptoquark production inducing charged lepton flavour violation, with fixed inter-generational couplings. Upper limits on leptoquark coupling strengths are set at the 95% CL, ranging from $\lambda^{\textrm{LQ}} = $1.3 to $\lambda^{\textrm{LQ}} = $3.7 for leptoquark masses between 0.5 and 2.0 TeV.</description>

      <title>Search for pair-produced higgsinos decaying via Higgs or $Z$ bosons to final states containing a pair of photons and a pair of $b$-jets with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search is presented for the pair production of higgsinos $\tilde{\chi}$ in gauge-mediated supersymmetry models, where the lightest neutralinos $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$ decay into a light gravitino $\tilde{G}$ in association with either a Higgs $h$ or a $Z$ boson. The search is performed with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider using 139 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. It targets final states in which a Higgs boson decays into a photon pair, while the other Higgs or $Z$ boson decays into a $b\bar{b}$ pair, with missing transverse momentum associated with the two gravitinos. Search regions dependent on the amount of missing transverse momentum are defined by the requirements that the diphoton mass should be consistent with the mass of the Higgs boson, and the $b\bar{b}$ mass with the mass of the Higgs or $Z$ boson. The main backgrounds are estimated with data-driven methods using the sidebands of the diphoton mass distribution. No excesses beyond Standard Model expectations are observed and higgsinos with masses up to 320 GeV are excluded, assuming a branching fraction of 100% for $\tilde{\chi}_1^0\rightarrow h\tilde{G}$. This analysis excludes higgsinos with masses of 130 GeV for branching fractions to $h\tilde{G}$ as low as 36%, thus providing complementarity to previous ATLAS searches in final states with multiple leptons or multiple $b$-jets, targeting different decays of the electroweak bosons.</description>

      <title>Search for the non-resonant production of Higgs boson pairs via gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion in the $b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$ final state in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>

Abstract: A search for the non-resonant production of Higgs boson pairs in the $HH\rightarrow b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$ channel is performed using 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $13$ TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The analysis strategy is optimised to probe anomalous values of the Higgs boson self-coupling modifier $\kappa_\lambda$ and of the quartic $HHVV$ ($V = W,Z$) coupling modifier $\kappa_{2V}$. No significant excess above the expected background from Standard Model processes is observed. An observed (expected) upper limit $\mu_{HH}&lt;5.9$ $(3.3)$ is set at 95% confidence-level on the Higgs boson pair production cross-section normalised to its Standard Model prediction. The coupling modifiers are constrained to an observed (expected) 95% confidence interval of $-3.1 &lt; \kappa_\lambda &lt; 9.0$ ($-2.5 &lt; \kappa_\lambda &lt; 9.3$) and $-0.5 &lt; \kappa_{2V} &lt; 2.7$ ($-0.2 &lt; \kappa_{2V} &lt; 2.4$), assuming all other Higgs boson couplings are fixed to the Standard Model prediction. The results are also interpreted in the context of effective field theories via constraints on anomalous Higgs boson couplings and Higgs boson pair production cross-sections assuming different kinematic benchmark scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity and transverse momentum dependence of charge-balance functions in pPb and PbPb collisions at LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the charge-dependent two-particle angular correlation function in proton-lead (pPb) collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV and lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV are reported. The pPb and PbPb data sets correspond to integrated luminosities of 186 nb$^{-1}$ and 0.607 nb$^{-1}$, respectively, and were collected using the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The charge-dependent correlations are characterized by balance functions of same- and opposite-sign particle pairs. The balance functions, which contain information about the creation time of charged particle pairs and the development of collectivity, are studied as functions of relative pseudorapidity ($\Delta \eta$) and relative azimuthal angle ($\Delta \phi$), for various multiplicity and transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) intervals. A multiplicity dependence of the balance function is observed in $\Delta \eta$ and $\Delta \phi$ for both systems. The width of the balance functions decreases toward high-multiplicity collisions in the momentum region $\lt$ 2 GeV, for pPb and PbPb results. Integrals of the balance functions are presented in both systems, and a mild dependence of the charge-balancing fractions on multiplicity is observed. No multiplicity dependence is observed at higher transverse momentum. The data are compared with HYDJET, HIJING and AMPT generator predictions, none of which capture completely the multiplicity dependence seen in the data. The comparison of results with different center-of-mass energies suggest that the balance functions become narrower at higher energies, which is consistent with the idea of delayed hadronization and the effect of radial flow.</description>

      <title>New Physics at Neutron Beam Dump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a new utility of neutrons, usually treated as an experimental nuisance causing unwanted background, in probing new physics signals. They can either be radiated from neutrons (neutron bremsstrahlung) or appear through secondary particles from neutron-on-target interactions, dubbed "neutron beam dump". As a concrete example, we take the FASER/FASER2 experiment as a "factory" of high-energy neutrons that interact with the iron dump. We find that neutron-initiated bremsstrahlung contributions are comparable to proton-initiated ones, in terms of the resulting flux and the range of couplings that can be probed. The neutron bremsstrahlung can be used to probe dark gauge bosons with non-zero neutron coupling. In particular, we investigate protophobic gauge bosons and find that FASER/FASER2 can probe new parameter space. We also illustrate the possibility of neutron-induced secondary particles by considering axion-like particles with electron couplings. We conclude that the physics potential of FASER/FASER2 in terms of new physics searches can be greatly extended and improved with the inclusion of neutron interactions.</description>

      <title>DEMPgen: Physics event generator for Deep Exclusive Meson Production at Jefferson Lab and the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is increasing interest in deep exclusive meson production (DEMP) reactions, as they provide access to Generalized Parton Distributions over a broad kinematic range, and are the only means of measuring pion and kaon charged electric form factors at high $Q^2$. Such investigations are a particularly useful tool in the study of hadronic structure in QCD's transition regime from long-distance interactions described in terms of meson-nucleon degrees of freedom, to short-dist ance interactions governed by hard quark-gluon degrees of freedom. To assist the planning of future experimental investigations of DEMP reactions in this transition regime, such as at Jefferson Lab and the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), we have written a special purpose event generator, DEMPgen. Several types of DEMP reactions can be generated: $t$-channel $p(e,e^{\prime}\pi^+)n$, $p(e,e^{\prime}K^+)\Lambda[\Sigma^0]$, and $\vec{n}(e,e^{\prime}\pi^-)p$ from a polarized $^3$He target. DEMPgen is modular in form, so that additional reactions can be added over time. The generator produces kinematically-complete reaction events which are absolutely-normalized, so that projected event rates can be predicted, and detector resolution requirements studied. The event normalization is based on parameterizations of theoretical models, appropriate to the kinematic regime under study. Both fixed target modes and collider beam modes are supported. This paper presents the structure of the generator, the model parameterizations used for absolute event weighting, the kinematic distributions of the generated particles, some initial results using the generator, and instructions for its use.</description>

      <title>Radiative transitions of $\chi_{_{cJ}}\to\psi\gamma$ and $\chi_{_{bJ}}\to\Upsilon\gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter equation, according to the $J ^ {PC}$ of quarkonia, we find that their wave functions all contain multiple partial waves, rather than pure waves. In the radiative electromagnetic transitions $\chi_{_{cJ}}$$\rightarrow$$\gamma\psi$ and $\chi_{_{bJ}}$$\rightarrow$$\gamma\Upsilon$ ($J=0,1,2$), the main wave of quarkonium gives the non-relativistic contribution, while other waves provide the relativistic corrections. Our results indicate that the relativistic effect of charmonium, especially highly excited states, is significant. Such as the relativistic effects of $\chi_{_{cJ}}(2P)\to\gamma\psi(1S)$ ($J=0,1,2$) are $\{49.7\%,~30.9\%,~37.5\%\}$, much larger than the corresponding $\{17.8\%,~7.08\%,~12.9\%\}$ of $\chi_{_{bJ}}(2P)\rightarrow\gamma\Upsilon(1S)$. The decay of $\chi_{_{cJ}}(2P)\to\gamma\psi$ can be used to distinguish between $\chi_{_{c0}}(3860)$ and $\chi_{_{c0}}(3915)$, which particle is the charmonium $\chi_{_{c0}}(2P)$. Although our result of $\chi_{_{c1}}(3872)$$\rightarrow$$\gamma\psi(2S)$ is consistent with data, but the one of $\chi_{_{c1}}(3872)$$\rightarrow$$\gamma\psi(1S)$ is much larger than data, so whether $\chi_{_{c1}}(3872)$ is the conventional $\chi_{_{c1}}(2P)$ remains an open question. The undiscovered $\Upsilon(1D)$ and $\Upsilon(2D)$ have large production rates in decays of $\chi_{_{b0}}(2P)\rightarrow\gamma\Upsilon(1D)$ and $\chi_{_{bJ}}(3P)\rightarrow\gamma\Upsilon(2D)$ ($J=0,1$), respectively. To search for $\chi_{_{bJ}}(3P)$ $(J=0,1,2)$, the most competitive channels are the decays $\chi_{_{bJ}}(3P)\rightarrow\gamma\Upsilon(3S)$. And the best way to find $\chi_{_{b2}}(1F)$ is to search for the decay of $\chi_{_{b2}}(1F)\rightarrow\gamma\Upsilon(1D)$.</description>

      <title>Parton distribution functions and fragmentation functions of spin-1 hadrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structure functions of the spin-1 deuteron will be investigated experimentally from the late 2020's at various facilities such as Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, nuclotron-based ion collider facility, and electron-ion colliders. We expect that a new high-energy spin-physics field could be created by these projects. In this paper, the current theoretical status is explained for the structure functions of spin-1 hadrons, especially on parton distribution functions, transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions, and fragmentation functions. Related multiparton distribution functions are also shown.</description>

      <title>LO, NLO, and NNLO Parton Distributions for LHC Event Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present NNPDF4.0MC, a variant of the NNPDF4.0 set of parton distributions (PDFs) at LO, NLO and NNLO, with and without inclusion of the photon PDF, suitable for use with Monte Carlo (MC) event generators, which require PDFs to satisfy additional constraints in comparison to standard PDF sets. These requirements include PDF positivity down to a low scale $Q\sim 1$ GeV, smooth extrapolation in the very small and large $x$ regions, and numerically stable results even in extreme regions of phase space for all PDFs. We compare the NNPDF4.0MC PDFs to their baseline NNPDF4.0 counterparts, and to the NNPDF2.3LO set entering the Monash tune of the Pythia8 event generator. We briefly assess the phenomenological impact of these PDFs on the cross-sections for hard and soft QCD processes at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Parity and Lepton Masses in the Left Right Symmetric Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Curiously in the minimal left right symmetric model, chiral symmetry that protects the electron's mass (m_e), due to parity (P) implies the vanishing of its neutrino mixing angles. We break this symmetry softly (or spontaneously if it is gauged) to generate the observed large neutrino mixing angles at the tree-level. The electron then acquires its mass on RGE running due to its neutrino's mixing, and in turn determines the B-L gauge symmetry breaking scale (v_R) to be $10^{10} GeV \lesssim v_R \leq 10^{15} GeV. $ If the muon's mass is also generated radiatively, the B-L breaking scale is $\sim 10^{14-15}$ GeV. Regardless of the high scale of v_R, this is a testable model since on RGE running and P breaking, a large strong CP phase ($\bar{\theta} &gt;&gt; 10^{-10}$) which depends logarithmically on $v_R$ is generated if there is $\mathcal{O}(1)$ CP violation in leptonic Yukawa couplings. Hence we expect that leptonic CP phases including the Dirac CP phase $\delta_{CP}$ of the PMNS matrix must be consistent with 0 or 180^o to within a degree, which can be verified or excluded by neutrino experiments such as DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande. In lieu of P, if charge conjugation C is used, the same results follow. However with C and no P, axions would likely need to be added anyway, in which case there is no constraint on \delta_{CP}.</description>
