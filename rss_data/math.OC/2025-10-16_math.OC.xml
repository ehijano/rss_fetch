      <title>DeepMartingale: Duality of the Optimal Stopping Problem with Expressivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a martingale representation, we introduce a novel deep-learning approach, which we call DeepMartingale, to study the duality of discrete-monitoring optimal stopping problems in continuous time. This approach provides a tight upper bound for the primal value function, even in high-dimensional settings. We prove that the upper bound derived from DeepMartingale converges under very mild assumptions. Even more importantly, we establish the expressivity of DeepMartingale: it approximates the true value function within any prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$ under our architectural design of neural networks whose size is bounded by $\tilde{c}\,D^{\tilde{q}}\varepsilon^{-\tilde{r}}$, where the constants $\tilde{c}, \tilde{q}, \tilde{r}$ are independent of the dimension $D$ and the accuracy $\varepsilon$. This guarantees that DeepMartingale does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Numerical experiments demonstrate the practical effectiveness of DeepMartingale, confirming its convergence, expressivity, and stability.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Effectiveness and Equity in Kidney Exchange Programs for Novel Compatibility Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kidney Exchange Programs (KEPs) promote access to living donor trans- plantation for patients suffering from end stage renal disease. The HLA compatibility between transplant recipients and donors plays an important role when solving the matching problems occuring in KEPs. Compatibility defines the feasible solution space and often occurs in a weighted form in the objective function. Recently, the paradigms used to express HLA com- patibility have advanced substantially from antigens to alleles and eplets. We show how KEP effectiveness and equity vary with these three paradigms. The equity analysis focuses on ethnic inequities and the result confirm that moving from antigen to allele and eplet paradigms may enlarge inequities. We present new optimization models based on equity weighting that rem- edy ethnic inequities for all three paradigms without sacrificing access to transplant.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov methods for input-to-state stability of time-varying evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that (local) input-to-state stability ((L)ISS) and integral input-to-state stability (iISS) of time-varying infinite-dimensional systems in abstract spaces follows from the existence of a {corresponding} Lyapunov function. In particular, input-to-state stability of linear time-varying control systems in Hilbert spaces with bounded input operators is discussed. Methods for the construction of non-coercive LISS/iISS Lyapunov functions are presented for a certain class of time-varying semi-linear evolution equations. Two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the results.</description>

      <title>On leveraging constrained smooth additive regression models for global optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world decision-making processes rely on solving mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems. However, finding high-quality solutions to MINLPs is often computationally demanding. This has motivated the development of specialized algorithms that take advantage of the structure of some MINLPs to improve their tractability. In this work, we propose the Mixed-integer Smoothing Surrogate Optimization with Constraints (MiSSOC) approach, a novel optimization algorithm that builds and solves surrogate problems for complex MINLPs which are more tractable in practice. MiSSOC integrates statistical modeling into mathematical optimization by approximating complex functions in an MINLP using smooth additive regression models with $B-$splines. Expert knowledge can be incorporated into the building phase of the approximating functions through shape constraints related to sign (or bounds), monotonicity and convexity over the observed domain. Thus, MiSSOC fills a gap in the literature by building surrogates that are both data-driven and knowledge-driven. The surrogate problem is formulated by replacing the original complex functions with their approximations. The proposed MiSSOC algorithm is evaluated through a set of experiments, including benchmark instances and a real-world case study. MiSSOC is tested with different state-of-the-art solvers and with the tailored Sequential Convex MINLP (SC-MINLP) algorithm. The latter exploits the separable structure of the surrogate functions, which results from the approximating functions being sums of piecewise univariate polynomials. MiSSOC is benchmarked against solving the original MINLPs directly. The results show that MiSSOC is an effective approach for addressing complex MINLPs through surrogate modeling, particularly when used in combination with the SC-MINLP algorithm.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Electric School Buses for Disaster Recovery: Optimizing Routing and Energy Scheduling via Branch-and-Price</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural disasters threaten the resilience of power systems, causing widespread power outages that disrupt critical loads (e.g., hospitals) and endanger public safety. Compared to the conventional restoration methods that often have long response times, leveraging government-controlled electric school buses (ESBs) with large battery capacity and deployment readiness offers a promising solution for faster power restoration to critical loads during disasters while traditional maintenance is underway. Therefore, we study the problem of routing and scheduling a heterogeneous fleet of ESBs to satisfy the energy demand of critical isolated loads around disasters addressing the following practical aspects: combined transportation and energy scheduling of ESBs, multiple back-and-forth trips of ESBs between isolated loads and charging stations, and spatial-wise coupling among multiple ESB routes. We propose an efficient mixed-integer programming model for routing and scheduling ESBs, accounting for the practical aspects, to minimize the total restoration cost over a planning horizon. We develop an efficient exact branch-and-price (B&amp;P) algorithm and a customized heuristic B&amp;P algorithm integrating dynamic programming and labeling algorithms. Numerical results based on a real case study of San Antonio disaster shelters and critical facilities demonstrate that our proposed exact B&amp;P and heuristic B&amp;P algorithms are computationally 121 and 335 times faster, respectively, than Gurobi. Using network sparsity to incorporate the limitation in shelter-ESB type compatibility in the model demonstrates that the total restoration cost increases, on average, by 207% as the network becomes fully sparse compared to fully connected. The capacity utilization metric reflects that the proposed practical ESB routing and scheduling enables an ESB to meet the energy demand 4.5 times its effective usable capacity.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Optimization over Discrete Spaces using Projection to Continuous Latent Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based optimization of complex systems over discrete decision spaces is a challenging computational problem. Specifically, discrete decision spaces lead to a combinatorial explosion of possible alternatives, making it computationally prohibitive to perform simulations for all possible combinations. In this work, we present a new approach to handle these issues by transforming/projecting the discrete decision space into a continuous latent space using a probabilistic model know as Variational AutoEncoders. The transformation of the decision space facilitates the implementation of Bayesian optimization (BO), which is an efficient approach that strategically navigates the space to reduce the number of expensive simulations. Here, the key observation is that points in the latent space correspond to decisions in the original mixed-discrete space, but the latent space is much easier to navigate using BO. We illustrate the benefits of our approach through a couple of case studies that aim to design complex distillation systems: the recovery of caprylic acid from water by liquid-liquid extraction and the separation of an azeotropic mixture using a thermally couple column know as extractive dividing wall column.</description>

      <title>Column Generation Using Domain-Independent Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Column generation and branch-and-price are leading methods for large-scale exact optimization. Column generation iterates between solving a master problem and a pricing problem. The master problem is a linear program, which can be solved using a generic solver. The pricing problem is highly dependent on the application but is usually discrete. Due to the difficulty of discrete optimization, high-performance column generation often relies on a custom pricing algorithm built specifically to exploit the problem's structure. This bespoke nature of the pricing solver prevents the reuse of components for other applications. We show that domain-independent dynamic programming, a software package for modeling and solving arbitrary dynamic programs, can be used as a generic pricing solver. We develop basic implementations of branch-and-price with pricing by domain-independent dynamic programming and show that they outperform a world-leading solver on static mixed integer programming formulations for seven problem classes.</description>

      <title>Hedging against Black Swans in Day-Ahead Energy Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renewable generators must commit to day-ahead market bids despite uncertainty in both production and real-time prices. While forecasts provide valuable guidance, rare and unpredictable extreme events (so-called black swans) can cause substantial financial losses. This paper models the nomination problem as an instance of optimal transport-based distributionally robust optimization (OT-DRO), a principled framework that balances risk and performance by accounting not only for the severity of deviations but also for their likelihood. The resulting formulation yields a tractable, data-driven strategy that remains competitive under normal conditions while providing effective protection against extreme price spikes. Using four years of Finnish wind farm and market data, we demonstrate that OT-DRO consistently outperforms forecast-based nominations and significantly mitigates losses during black swan events.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Tensor PCA via Normalized Stochastic Gradient Ascent with Overparameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Order-$k$ ($k \geq 4$) spiked tensor model for the tensor principal component analysis (PCA) problem: given $N$ i.i.d. observations of a $k$-th order tensor generated from the model $\mathbf{T} = \lambda \cdot v_*^{\otimes k} + \mathbf{E}$, where $\lambda &gt; 0$ is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), $v_*$ is a unit vector, and $\mathbf{E}$ is a random noise tensor, the goal is to recover the planted vector $v_*$.
  We propose a normalized stochastic gradient ascent (NSGA) method with overparameterization for solving the tensor PCA problem. Without any global (or spectral) initialization step, the proposed algorithm successfully recovers the signal $v_*$ when $N\lambda^2 \geq \widetilde{\Omega}(d^{\lceil k/2 \rceil})$, thereby breaking the previous conjecture that (stochastic) gradient methods require at least $\Omega(d^{k-1})$ samples for recovery. For even $k$, the $\widetilde{\Omega}(d^{k/2})$ threshold coincides with the optimal threshold under computational constraints, attained by sum-of-squares relaxations and related algorithms. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the overparameterized stochastic gradient method not only establishes a significant initial optimization advantage during the early learning phase but also achieves strong generalization guarantees. This work provides the first evidence that overparameterization improves statistical performance relative to exact parameterization that is solved via standard continuous optimization.</description>

      <title>Recursive Target Body Approach for Low-Thrust Multiple Gravity-Assist Sequence Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to automate the design of Multiple Gravity-Assist (MGA) transfers between planets using low-thrust propulsion. In particular, during the preliminary design phase of space missions, the combinatorial complexity of MGA sequencing is very large, and current optimization approaches require extensive experience and can take many days to simulate. Therefore, a novel optimization approach is developed here -- called the Recursive Target Body Approach (RTBA) -- that uses the hodographic-shaping low-thrust trajectory representation together with a unique combination of tree-search methods to automate the optimization of MGA sequences. The approach gradually constructs the optimal MGA sequence by recursively evaluating the optimality of subsequent gravity-assist targets. Another significant contribution to the novelty of this work is the use of parallelization in an original way involving the Generalized Island Model (GIM) that enables the use of new figures of merit to further increase the robustness and accelerate the convergence. An Earth-Jupiter transfer with a maximum of three gravity assists is considered as a reference problem. The RTBA takes 21.5 hours to find an EMJ transfer with 15.4 km/s $\Delta V$ to be the optimum. Extensive tuning improved the quality of the MGA trajectories substantially, and as a result a robust low-thrust trajectory optimization could be ensured. A distinct group of highly fit MGA sequences is consistently found that can be passed on to a higher-fidelity method. In conclusion, the RTBA can automatically and reliably be used for the preliminary optimization of low-thrust MGA trajectories.</description>

      <title>Towards Exact Temporal Aggregation of Time-Coupled Energy Storage Models via Active Constraint Set Identification and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series aggregation (TSA) methods aim to construct temporally aggregated optimization models that accurately represent the output space of their full-scale counterparts while using a significantly reduced dimensionality in the input space. This paper presents the first approach that achieves an exact TSA of a full-scale power system model -- even in the presence of energy storage time-coupling constraints -- by leveraging active constraint sets and dual information. This advances the state of the art beyond existing TSA approaches, which typically cannot guarantee solution accuracy or rely on iterative procedures to determine the required number of representative periods. To bridge the gap between our theoretical analysis and their practical application, we employ machine learning approaches, i.e., classification and clustering, to inform TSA in models that co-schedule variable renewable energy sources and energy storage. Numerical results demonstrate substantially improved computational performance relative to the full-scale model, while maintaining high solution accuracy.</description>

      <title>Optimality-Based Control Space Reduction for Infinite-Dimensional Control Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider linear model reduction in both the control and state variables for unconstrained linear-quadratic optimal control problems subject to time-varying parabolic PDEs. The first-order optimality condition for a state-space reduced model naturally leads to a reduced structure of the optimal control. Thus, we consider a control- and state-reduced problem that admits the same minimizer as the solely state-reduced problem. Lower and upper \emph{a posteriori} error bounds for the optimal control and a representation for the error in the optimal function value are provided. These bounds are used in an adaptive algorithm to solve the control problem. We prove its convergence and numerically demonstrate the advantage of combined control and state space reduction.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Averaged Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend flow matching to ensembles of linear systems in both deterministic and stochastic settings. Averaging over system parameters induces memory leading to a non-Markovian interpolation problem for the stochastic case. In this setting, a control law that achieves the distributional controllability is characterized as the conditional expectation of a Volterra-type control. This conditional expectation in the stochastic settings motivates an open-loop characterization in the noiseless-deterministic setting. Explicit forms of the conditional expectations are derived for special cases of the given distributions and a practical numerical procedure is presented to approximate the control inputs. A by-product of our analysis is a numerical split between the two regimes. For the stochastic case, history dependence is essential and we implement the conditional expectation with a recurrent network trained using independent sampling. For the deterministic case, the flow is memoryless and a feedforward network learns a time-varying gain that transports the ensemble. We show that to realize the full target distribution in this deterministic setting, one must first establish a deterministic sample pairing (e.g., optimal-transport or Schrodinger-bridge coupling), after which learning reduces to a low-dimensional regression in time.</description>

      <title>A three-step framework for noisy image segmentation in brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is essential for noninvasive generation of high-quality images of human tissues. Accurate segmentation of MRI data is critical for medical applications like brain anatomy analysis and disease detection. However, challenges such as intensity inhomogeneity, noise, and artifacts complicate this process. To address these issues, we propose a three-step framework exploiting the idea of Cartoon-Texture evolution to produce a denoised and debiased MR image. The first step involves identifying statistical information about the nature of the noise using a suitable image decomposition. In the second step, a multiplicative intrinsic component model is applied to a smother version of the image, simultaneously reconstructing the bias and removing noise using noise information from the previous step. At the final step, standard clustering techniques are used to create an accurate segmentation. Additionally, we present a convergence analysis of the ADMM scheme for solving the nonlinear optimization problem with multiaffine constraints resulting from the second step. Numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, especially in noisy brain segmentation, both from a qualitative and a quantitative viewpoint, compared to similar methods.</description>

      <title>Hybrid multi-population traffic flow model: Optimal control for a mean-field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling heterogeneous and multi-lane traffic flow is essential for understanding and controlling complex transportation systems. In this work, we consider three vehicle populations: two classes of human-driven vehicles (cars and trucks) and autonomous vehicles, the latter characterized by controlled acceleration. Compared to single-population models, multi-population modeling poses greater challenges, primarily due to the increased number of parameters required to describe lane-changing behavior and the added complexity in passing to the mean-field limit. We model multi-lane traffic as a hybrid dynamical system, combining continuous dynamics within each lane and discrete events corresponding to lane-changing maneuvers. We then formulate and analyze the optimal control problem associated with such hybrid systems from both microscopic and mesoscopic perspectives. Using techniques from $\Gamma$-convergence, we prove the existence of solutions to the optimal control problem in the mean-field limit of a finite-dimensional hybrid system. Finally, we present numerical simulations illustrating the impact of trucks on overall traffic efficiency.</description>

      <title>Generalized Reduced Jacobian Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work, we presented the reduced Jacobian method (RJM) as an extension of Wolfe's reduced gradient method to multicriteria (multiobjective) optimization problems dealing with linear constraints. This approach reveals that using a reduction technique of the Jacobian matrix of the objective avoids scalarization. In the present work, we intend to generalize RJM to handle nonlinear constraints too. In fact, we propose a generalized reduced Jacobian (GRJ) method that extends Abadie-Carpentier's approach for single-objective programs. To this end, we adopt a global reduction strategy based on the fundamental theorem of implicit functions. In this perspective, only a reduced descent direction common to all the criteria is computed by solving a simple convex program. After establishing an Armijo-type line search condition that ensures feasibility, the resulting algorithm is shown to be globally convergent, under mild assumptions, to a Pareto critical (KKT-stationary) point. Finally, experimental results are presented, including comparisons with other deterministic and evolutionary approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the stability and global convergence of a coupled actor-critic gradient flow for infinite-horizon and entropy-regularised Markov decision processes (MDPs) in continuous state and action space with linear function approximation under Q-function realisability. We consider a version of the actor critic gradient flow where the critic is updated using temporal difference (TD) learning while the policy is updated using a policy mirror descent method on a separate timescale. We demonstrate stability and exponential convergence of the actor critic flow to the optimal policy. Finally, we address the interplay of the timescale separation and entropy regularisation and its effect on stability and convergence.</description>

      <title>On Complexity of Model-Based Derivative-Free Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many applications of mathematical optimization, one may wish to optimize an objective function without access to its derivatives. These situations call for derivative-free optimization (DFO) methods. Among the most successful approaches in practice are model-based trust-region methods, such as those pioneered by M.J.D Powell. While relatively complex to implement, these methods are now available in standard scientific computing platforms, including MATLAB and SciPy. However, theoretical analysis of their computational complexity lags behind practice. In particular, it is important to bound the number of function evaluations required to achieve a desired level of accuracy. In this paper we systematically derive complexity bounds for classical model-based trust-region methods and their modern variations. We establish, for the first time, that these methods can have the same worst case complexity than any other known DFO method.</description>

      <title>Quantum Search in Superposed Quantum Lattice Gas Automata and Lattice Boltzmann Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the scope of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) grows to encompass ever larger problem scales, so does the interest in whether quantum computing can provide an advantage. In recent years, Quantum Lattice Gas Automata (QLGA) and Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Methods (QLBM) have emerged as promising candidates for quantum-native implementations of CFD solvers. Though the progress in developing QLGA and QLBM algorithms has been significant, it has largely focused on the development of models rather than applications. As a result, the zoo of QLGA and QLBM algorithms has grown to target several equations and to support many extensions, but the practical use of these models is largely limited to quantum state tomography and observable measurement. This limitation is crucial in practice, because unless very specific criteria are met, such measurements may cancel out any potential quantum advantage. In this paper, we propose an application based on discrete optimization and quantum search, which circumvents flow field measurement altogether. We propose methods for simulating many different lattice configurations simultaneously and describe how the usage of amplitude estimation and quantum search can provide an asymptotic quantum advantage. Throughout the paper, we provide detailed complexity analyses of gate-level implementations of our circuits and consider the benefits and costs of several encodings.</description>

      <title>Exact Dynamics of Multi-class Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for analyzing the training and learning rate dynamics on a variety of high- dimensional optimization problems trained using one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with data generated from multiple anisotropic classes. We give exact expressions for a large class of functions of the limiting dynamics, including the risk and the overlap with the true signal, in terms of a deterministic solution to a system of ODEs. We extend the existing theory of high-dimensional SGD dynamics to Gaussian-mixture data and a large (growing with the parameter size) number of classes. We then investigate in detail the effect of the anisotropic structure of the covariance of the data in the problems of binary logistic regression and least square loss. We study three cases: isotropic covariances, data covariance matrices with a large fraction of zero eigenvalues (denoted as the zero-one model), and covariance matrices with spectra following a power-law distribution. We show that there exists a structural phase transition. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the zero-one model and the power-law model with sufficiently large power, SGD tends to align more closely with values of the class mean that are projected onto the "clean directions" (i.e., directions of smaller variance). This is supported by both numerical simulations and analytical studies, which show the exact asymptotic behavior of the loss in the high-dimensional limit.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Regret-Queue Length Tradeoff in Online Learning for Two-Sided Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a two-sided market, wherein, price-sensitive heterogeneous customers and servers arrive and join their respective queues. A compatible customer-server pair can then be matched by the platform, at which point, they leave the system. Our objective is to design pricing and matching algorithms that maximize the platform's profit, while maintaining reasonable queue lengths. As the demand and supply curves governing the price-dependent arrival rates may not be known in practice, we design a novel online-learning-based pricing policy and establish its near-optimality. In particular, we prove a tradeoff among three performance metrics: $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma})$ regret, $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma/2})$ average queue length, and $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$ maximum queue length for $\gamma \in (0, 1/6]$, significantly improving over existing results [1]. Moreover, barring the permissible range of $\gamma$, we show that this trade-off between regret and average queue length is optimal up to logarithmic factors under a class of policies, matching the optimal one as in [2] which assumes the demand and supply curves to be known. Our proposed policy has two noteworthy features: a dynamic component that optimizes the tradeoff between low regret and small queue lengths; and a probabilistic component that resolves the tension between obtaining useful samples for fast learning and maintaining small queue lengths.</description>

      <title>Small-time approximate controllability of the logarithmic Schr\''dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Schr{\"o}dinger equations with logarithmic nonlinearity and bilinear controls, posed on $\mathbb{T}^d$ or $\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove their small-time global $L^2$-approximate controllability. The proof consists in extending to this nonlinear framework the approach introduced by the first and third authors in \cite{beauchard-pozzoli2} to control the linear equation: it combines the small-time controllability of phases and gradient flows. Due to the nonlinearity, the required estimates are more difficult to establish than in the linear case. The proof here is inspired by WKB analysis. This is the first result of (small-time) global approximate controllability, for nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equations, with bilinear controls.</description>

      <title>Jump Processes with Self-Interactions: Large Deviation Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a pure jump process $\{X_t\}_{t\ge 0}$ with values in a finite state space $S= \{1, \ldots, d\}$ for which the jump rates at time instant $t$ depend on the occupation measure $L_t \doteq t^{-1} \int_0^t \delta_{X_s}\,ds$. Such self-interacting chains arise in many contexts within statistical physics and applied probability. Under appropriate conditions, a large deviation principle is established for the pair $(L_t, R_t)$, as $t \to \infty$, where $R_t$ is the empirical flux process associated with the jump process. We show that the rate function takes a simple form that can be viewed as a dynamical generalization of the classical Donsker and Varadhan rate function for the analogous quantities in the setting of Markov processes, in particular, unlike the Markovian case, the rate function is not convex. Since the state process is non-Markovian, different techniques are needed than in the setting of Donsker and Varadhan and our proofs rely on variational representations for functionals of Poisson random measures and stochastic control methods.</description>

      <title>Seesaw: Accelerating Training by Balancing Learning Rate and Batch Size Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasing the batch size during training -- a ''batch ramp'' -- is a promising strategy to accelerate large language model pretraining. While for SGD, doubling the batch size can be equivalent to halving the learning rate, the optimal strategy for adaptive optimizers like Adam is less clear. As a result, any batch-ramp scheduling, if used at all, is typically tuned heuristically. This work develops a principled framework for batch-size scheduling and introduces Seesaw: whenever a standard scheduler would halve the learning rate, Seesaw instead multiplies it by $1/\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the batch size, preserving loss dynamics while reducing serial steps. Theoretically, we provide, to our knowledge, the first finite-sample proof of equivalence between learning-rate decay and batch-size ramp-up for SGD on noisy linear regression, and we extend this equivalence to normalized SGD, a tractable proxy for Adam, under a variance-dominated regime observed in practice. Empirically, on 150M/300M/600M-parameter models trained at Chinchilla scale using a constant (critical) batch size, Seesaw matches cosine decay at equal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by $\approx 36\%$, approaching the theoretical limit implied by our analysis.</description>

      <title>Online Proportional Apportionment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, the problem of apportioning the seats of a legislative body has been viewed as a one-shot process with no dynamic considerations. While this approach is reasonable for some settings, dynamic aspects play an important role in many others. We initiate the study of apportionment problems in an online setting. Specifically, we introduce a framework for proportional apportionment with no information about the future. In this model, time is discrete and there are $n$ parties that receive a certain share of the votes at each time step. An online algorithm needs to irrevocably assign a prescribed number of seats at each time, ensuring that each party receives its fractional share rounded up or down, and that the cumulative number of seats allocated to each party remains close to its cumulative share up to that time.
  We study deterministic and randomized online apportionment methods. For deterministic methods, we construct a family of adversarial instances that yield a lower bound, linear in $n$, on the worst-case deviation between the seats allocated to a party and its cumulative share. We show that this bound is best possible and is matched by a natural greedy method. As a consequence, a method guaranteeing that the cumulative number of seats assigned to each party up to any step equals its cumulative share rounded up or down (global quota) exists if and only if $n\leq 3$. Then, we turn to randomized allocations and show that, for $n\leq 3$, we can randomize over methods satisfying global quota with the additional guarantee that each party receives, in expectation, its proportional share in every step. Our proof is constructive: Any method satisfying these properties can be obtained from a flow on a recursively constructed network. We showcase the applicability of our results to obtain approximate solutions in the context of online dependent rounding procedures.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of stochastic variance reduced gradient for linear inverse problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) is an accelerated version of stochastic gradient descent based on variance reduction, and is promising for solving large-scale inverse problems. In this work, we analyze SVRG and a regularized version that incorporates a priori knowledge of the problem, for solving linear inverse problems in Hilbert spaces. We prove that, with suitable constant step size schedules and regularity conditions, the regularized SVRG can achieve optimal convergence rates in terms of the noise level without any early stopping rules, and standard SVRG is also optimal for problems with nonsmooth solutions under a priori stopping rules. The analysis is based on an explicit error recursion and suitable prior estimates on the inner loop updates with respect to the anchor point. Numerical experiments are provided to complement the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>A Human-Vector Susceptible--Infected--Susceptible Model for Analyzing and Controlling the Spread of Vector-Borne Diseases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an epidemic model for the spread of vector-borne diseases. The model, which is built extending the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible model, accounts for two populations -- humans and vectors -- and for cross-contagion between the two species, whereby humans become infected upon interaction with carrier vectors, and vectors become carriers after interaction with infected humans. We formulate the model as a system of ordinary differential equations and leverage monotone systems theory to rigorously characterize the epidemic dynamics. Specifically, we characterize the global asymptotic behavior of the disease, determining conditions for quick eradication of the disease (i.e., for which all trajectories converge to a disease-free equilibrium), or convergence to a (unique) endemic equilibrium. Then, we incorporate two control actions: namely, vector control and incentives to adopt protection measures. Using the derived mathematical tools, we assess the impact of these two control actions and determine the optimal control policy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a semismooth Newton-based augmented Lagrangian method for reconstructing sparse sources in inverse acoustic scattering problems. The semismooth Newton method can be iterated in the space of measurements instead of the unknown source to be reconstructed. It is highly efficient, especially when the measurement data is much less than the acoustic source. The source can be calculated from Fenchel-Rockafellar duality theory. We can obtain lots of acceleration and leverage the computational cost. The numerical examples show the high efficiency of the proposed semismooth Newton-based methods.</description>

      <title>Computation of attractor dimension and maximal sums of Lyapunov exponents using polynomial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two approaches are presented for computing upper bounds on Lyapunov exponents and their sums, and on Lyapunov dimension, among all trajectories of a dynamical system governed by ordinary differential equations. The first approach expresses a sum of Lyapunov exponents as a time average in an augmented dynamical system and then applies methods for bounding time averages. This generalizes the work of Oeri &amp; Goluskin (Nonlinearity 36:5378-5400, 2023), who bounded the single leading Lyapunov exponent. The second approach considers a different augmented dynamical system, where bounds on sums of Lyapunov exponents are implied by stability of certain sets, and such stability is verified using Lyapunov function methods. Both of our approaches also can be adapted to directly compute bounds on Lyapunov dimension, which in turn implies bounds on the fractal dimension of a global attractor. For systems of ordinary differential equations with polynomial right-hand sides, all of our bounding formulations lead to polynomial optimization problems with sum-of-squares constraints. These sum-of-squares problems can be solved computationally for any particular system to yield numerical bounds, provided the number of variables and degree of polynomials is not prohibitive. Most of our upper bounds are proven to be sharp under relatively weak assumptions. In the case of the polynomial optimization problems, sharpness means that upper bounds converge to the exact values as polynomial degrees are raised. Computational examples demonstrate upper bounds that are sharp to several digits, including for a six-dimensional dynamical system where sums of Lyapunov exponents are maximized on periodic orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.05315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a general class of two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems where the ambiguity set is constrained by fixed marginal probability laws that are not necessarily discrete. We derive primal and dual formulations of this class of problems and subsequently develop a numerical algorithm for computing approximate optimizers as well as approximate worst-case probability measures. Moreover, our algorithm computes both an upper bound and a lower bound for the optimal value of the problem, where the difference between the computed bounds provides a direct sub-optimality estimate of the computed solution. Most importantly, the sub-optimality can be controlled to be arbitrarily close to 0 by appropriately choosing the inputs of the algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we apply it to three prominent instances of two-stage DRO problems in task scheduling, multi-product assembly, and supply chain network design with edge failure. The ambiguity sets in these problem instances involve a large number of continuous or discrete marginals. The numerical results showcase that the proposed algorithm computes high-quality robust decisions along with non-conservative sub-optimality estimates.</description>

      <title>A hierarchy of convex relaxations for the total variation distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two measures $\mu$, $\nu$ on Rd that satisfy Carleman's condition, we provide a numerical scheme to approximate as closely as desired the total variation distance between $\mu$ and $\nu$. It consists of solving a sequence (hierarchy) of convex relaxations whose associated sequence of optimal values converges to the total variation distance, an additional illustration of the versatility of the Moment-SOS hierarchy. Indeed each relaxation in the hierarchy is a semidefinite program whose size increases with the number of involved moments. It has an optimal solution which is a couple of degree-2n pseudo-moments which converge, as n grows, to moments of the Hahn-Jordan decomposition of $\mu$-$\nu$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of the Nonlinear Stochastic Fokker--Planck Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a control problem for the nonlinear stochastic Fokker--Planck equation. This equation describes the evolution of the distribution of nonlocally interacting particles affected by a common source of noise. The system is directed by a controller that acts on the drift term with the goal of minimising a cost functional. We establish the well-posedness of the state equation, prove the existence of optimal controls, and formulate a stochastic maximum principle (SMP) that provides necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the control problem. The adjoint process arising in the SMP is characterised by a nonlocal (semi)linear backward SPDE for which we study existence and uniqueness. We also rigorously connect the control problem for the nonlinear stochastic Fokker--Planck equation to the control of the corresponding McKean--Vlasov SDE that describes the motion of a representative particle. Our work extends existing results for the control of the Fokker--Planck equation to nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. In particular, the sufficient SMP, which we obtain by exploiting the special structure of the Fokker--Planck equation, seems to be novel even in the linear deterministic setting. We illustrate our results with an application to a model of government interventions in financial systems, supplemented by numerical illustrations.</description>

      <title>A robust optimization approach to flow decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the minimum flow decomposition problem (MFD) to incorporate uncertain edge capacities and tackle it from the perspective of robust optimization. In the classical flow decomposition problem, a network flow is decomposed into a set of weighted paths from a fixed source node to a fixed sink node that precisely represents the flow distribution across all edges. MFD problems permeate multiple important applications, including reconstructing genomic sequences to representing the flow of goods or passengers in distribution networks. Inspired by these applications, we generalize the MFD to an inexact case with bounded flow values, provide a detailed analysis, and explore different variants that are solvable in polynomial time. Moreover, we introduce the concept of robust flow decomposition by incorporating uncertain bounds and applying different robustness concepts to handle the uncertainty. Finally, we present two different adjustably robust problem formulations and perform computational experiments illustrating the benefit of adjustability.</description>

      <title>Stochastic and incremental subgradient methods for convex optimization on Hadamard spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a foundation for optimization, convexity is useful beyond the classical settings of Euclidean and Hilbert space. The broader arena of nonpositively curved metric spaces, which includes manifolds like hyperbolic space, as well as metric trees and more general CAT(0) cubical complexes, supports primal tools like proximal operations for geodesically convex functions. However, the lack of linear structure in such spaces complicates dual constructions like subgradients. To address this hurdle, we introduce a new type of subgradient for functions on Hadamard spaces, based on Busemann functions. Our notion supports generalizations of classical stochastic and incremental subgradient methods, with guaranteed complexity bounds. We illustrate with subgradient algorithms for $p$-mean problems in general Hadamard spaces, in particular computing medians in BHV tree space.</description>

      <title>The Golden Ratio Primal-Dual Algorithm with Two New Stepsize Rules for Convex-Concave Saddle Point Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two stepsize strategies for the extended Golden Ratio primal-dual algorithm (E-GRPDA) designed to address structured convex optimization problems in finite-dimensional real Hilbert spaces. The first rule features a non-increasing primal stepsize that remains bounded below by a positive constant and is updated adaptively at each iteration, eliminating the need to compute the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of the function and the norm of the operator, without using backtracking. The second stepsize rule is adaptive, adjusting based on the local smoothness of the smooth component function and the norm of the operator involved. In other words, we present an adaptive version of the E-GRPDA algorithm. We prove that E-GRPDA achieves an ergodic sublinear convergence rate with both stepsize rules, based on the function-value residual and constraint violation rather than on the so-called primal-dual gap function. Additionally, we establish an R-linear convergence rate for E-GRPDA with the first stepsize rule, under standard assumptions and with appropriately chosen parameters. Through numerical experiments on various convex optimization problems, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches and compare their performance to existing ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06814v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a seminal work of Zhang and Sra, gradient descent methods for geodesically convex optimization were comprehensively studied. In particular, Zhang and Sra derived a comparison inequality that relates the iterative points in the optimization process. Since their seminal work, numerous follow-ups have studied different downstream usages of their comparison lemma.
  In this work, we introduce the concept of quasilinearization to optimization, presenting a novel framework for analyzing geodesically convex optimization. By leveraging this technique, we establish state-of-the-art convergence rates -- for both deterministic and stochastic settings -- under weaker assumptions than previously required. The technique of quasilinearization may prove valuable for other non-Euclidean optimization problems.</description>

      <title>VALVEFIT: An analysis-suitable B-spline-based surface fitting framework for patient-specific modeling of tricuspid valves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Patient-specific computational modeling of the tricuspid valve (TV) is vital for the clinical assessment of heart valve diseases. However, this process is hindered by limitations inherent in the medical image data, such as noise and sparsity, as well as by complex valve dynamics. We present VALVEFIT, a novel GPU-accelerated and differentiable B-spline surface fitting framework that enables rapid reconstruction of smooth, analysis-suitable geometry from point clouds obtained via medical image segmentation. We start with an idealized TV B-spline template surface and optimize its control point positions to fit segmented point clouds via an innovative loss function, balancing shape fidelity and mesh regularization. Novel regularization terms are introduced to ensure that the surface remains smooth, regular, and intersection-free during large deformations. We demonstrate the robustness and validate the accuracy of the framework by first applying it to simulation-derived point clouds that serve as the ground truth. We further show its robustness across different point cloud densities and noise levels. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the framework toward fitting point clouds obtained from real patients at different stages of valve motion. An isogeometric biomechanical valve simulation is then performed on the fitted surfaces to show their direct applicability toward analysis. VALVEFIT enables automated patient-specific modeling with minimal manual intervention, paving the way for the future development of direct image-to-analysis platforms for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Strategic Plan for Transition to Campus-Scale Clean Electricity Using Multi-Stage Stochastic Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decarbonization of energy systems at energy-intensive sites is an essential component of global climate mitigation, yet such transitions involve substantial capital requirements, ongoing technological progress, and the operational complexities of renewable integration. This study presents a dynamic strategic planning framework that applies multi-stage stochastic programming to guide clean electricity transitions at the campus level. The model jointly addresses technology investment, storage operation, and grid interaction decisions while explicitly incorporating uncertainties in future technology cost trajectories and efficiency improvements. By enabling adaptive, stage-wise decision-making, the framework provides a structured approach for large electricity consumers seeking to achieve self-sufficient and sustainable energy systems. The approach is demonstrated through a case study of Middle East Technical University (Ankara, Turkey), which has committed to achieving carbon-neutral electricity by 2040. Through the integration of solar photovoltaics, wind power, and lithium-ion batteries, the model links long-term investment planning with operational-level dynamics by incorporating high-resolution demand and meteorological data. Our findings from the case study, sensitivity analyses, and comparisons with simplified models indicate that accounting for uncertainty and temporal detail is crucial for both the economic viability and operational feasibility of campus-scale clean electricity transitions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel extrapolation coefficient scheme within a new extrapolation term and develop an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm. We establish that the algorithm achieves a sublinear convergence rate. The proposed scheme only requires the Lipschitz constant estimate sequence to satisfy mild initial conditions, under which a key equality property can be derived to support the convergence analysis. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and practical performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear optimization-based control policies, such as those those arising in nonlinear Model Predictive Control, have seen remarkable success in recent years. These policies require solving computationally demanding nonlinear optimization programs online at each time-step. The resulting solution map, viewed as a function of the measured state of the system and design parameters, may not be differentiable, which poses significant challenges if the control policy is embedded in a gradient-based policy optimization scheme. We propose a principled way to regularize the nonlinear optimization problem, obtaining a surrogate derivative even if when the original problem is not differentiable. The surrogate problem is differentiable by design and its solution map coincides with the solution of the unregularized problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a free-final-time optimal control problem and a receding-horizon nonlinear MPC example.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Power Grid Restoration Under Uncertainty Considering Coupled Transportation-Power Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Restoring power distribution systems after extreme events such as tornadoes presents significant logistical and computational challenges. The complexity arises from the need to coordinate multiple repair crews under uncertainty, manage interdependent infrastructure failures, and respect strict sequencing and routing constraints. Existing methods often rely on deterministic heuristics or simplified models that fail to capture the interdependencies between power and transportation networks, do not adequately model uncertainty, and lack representation of the interrelated dynamics and dependencies among different types of repair crews--leading to suboptimal restoration outcomes. To address these limitations, we develop a stochastic two-stage mixed-integer programming framework for proactive crew allocation, assignment, and routing in power grid restoration. The primary objective of our framework is to minimize service downtime and enhance power restoration by efficiently coordinating repair operations under uncertainty. Multiple repair crews are modeled as distinct agents, enabling decentralized coordination and efficient task allocation across the network. To validate our approach, we conduct a case study using the IEEE 8500-node test feeder integrated with a real transportation network from the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) region. Additionally, we use tornado event data from the DFW area to construct realistic failure scenarios involving damaged grid components and transportation links. Results from our case study demonstrate that the proposed method enables more coordinated and efficient restoration strategies. The model facilitates real-time disaster response by supporting timely and practical power grid restoration, with a strong emphasis on interoperability and crew schedule coordination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a model predictive control (MPC) policy for station keeping on a Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO). The proposed policy achieves full-state tracking of a reference NRHO via a multiple-maneuver control horizon, each spaced one revolution apart to abide by typical mission operation requirements. We prove that the proposed policy is recursively feasible, and perform numerical evaluation in an output-feedback setting by incorporating a navigation filter and realistic operational uncertainties, where the proposed MPC is compared against the state-of-the-art station-keeping algorithm adopted for the Gateway. Our approach successfully maintains the spacecraft in the vicinity of the reference NRHO at a similar cumulative cost as existing station-keeping methods without encountering phase deviation issues, a common drawback of existing methods with one maneuver per revolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent successes of Inverse Optimization (IO) across various application domains, we propose a novel offline Reinforcement Learning (ORL) algorithm for continuous state and action spaces, leveraging the convex loss function called ``sub-optimality loss" from the IO literature. To mitigate the distribution shift commonly observed in ORL problems, we further employ a robust and non-causal Model Predictive Control (MPC) expert steering a nominal model of the dynamics using in-hindsight information stemming from the model mismatch. Unlike the existing literature, our robust MPC expert enjoys an exact and tractable convex reformulation. In the second part of this study, we show that the IO hypothesis class, trained by the proposed convex loss function, enjoys ample expressiveness and achieves competitive performance comparing with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the low-data regime of the MuJoCo benchmark while utilizing three orders of magnitude fewer parameters, thereby requiring significantly fewer computational resources. To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we provide an open-source package implementing the proposed algorithms and the experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread utilization of language models in modern applications is inconceivable without Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques, such as low-rank adaptation ($\texttt{LoRA}$), which adds trainable adapters to selected layers. Although $\texttt{LoRA}$ may obtain accurate solutions, it requires significant memory to train large models and intuition on which layers to add adapters. In this paper, we propose a novel method, $\texttt{WeightLoRA}$, which overcomes this issue by adaptive selection of the most critical $\texttt{LoRA}$ heads throughout the optimization process. As a result, we can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters while maintaining the capability to obtain consistent or even superior metric values. We conduct experiments for a series of competitive benchmarks and DeBERTa, BART, and Llama models, comparing our method with different adaptive approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of $\texttt{WeightLoRA}$ and the superior performance of $\texttt{WeightLoRA+}$ in almost all cases.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Coordinate Momentum in SignSGD and Muon: Memory-Optimized Zero-Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04430v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose $\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach for resource-constrained LLM adaptation.

      <title>A predictive modular approach to constraint satisfaction under uncertainty - with application to glycosylation in continuous monoclonal antibody biosimilar production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper proposes a modular-based approach to constraint handling in process optimization and control. This is partly motivated by the recent interest in learning-based methods, e.g., within bioproduction, for which constraint handling under uncertainty is a challenge. The proposed constraint handler, called predictive filter, is combined with an adaptive constraint margin and a constraint violation cost monitor to minimize the cost of violating soft constraints due to model uncertainty and disturbances. The module can be combined with any controller and is based on minimally modifying the controller output, in a least squares sense, such that constraints are satisfied within the considered horizon. The proposed method is computationally efficient and suitable for real-time applications. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated through a realistic simulation case study of glycosylation constraint satisfaction in continuous monoclonal antibody biosimilar production using Chinese hamster ovary cells, for which the metabolic network model consists of 23 extracellular metabolites and 126 reactions.</description>

      <title>Provable Mixed-Noise Learning with Flow-Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Bayesian inverse problems with mixed noise, modeled as a combination of additive and multiplicative Gaussian components. While traditional inference methods often assume fixed or known noise characteristics, real-world applications, particularly in physics and chemistry, frequently involve noise with unknown and heterogeneous structure. Motivated by recent advances in flow-based generative modeling, we propose a novel inference framework based on conditional flow matching embedded within an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to jointly estimate posterior samplers and noise parameters. To enable high-dimensional inference and improve scalability, we use simulation-free ODE-based flow matching as the generative model in the E-step of the EM algorithm. We prove that, under suitable assumptions, the EM updates converge to the true noise parameters in the population limit of infinite observations. Our numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of combining EM inference with flow matching for mixed-noise Bayesian inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Machine Unlearning Meets Adversarial Robustness via Constrained Interventions on LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), more customization is needed to ensure privacy-preserving and safe generation. We address this objective from two critical aspects: unlearning of sensitive information and robustness to jail-breaking attacks. We investigate various constrained optimization formulations that address both aspects in a \emph{unified manner}, by finding the smallest possible interventions on LLM weights that either make a given vocabulary set unreachable or embed the LLM with robustness to tailored attacks by shifting part of the weights to a \emph{safer} region. Beyond unifying two key properties, this approach contrasts with previous work in that it doesn't require an oracle classifier that is typically not available or represents a computational overhead. Surprisingly, we find that the simplest point-wise constraint-based intervention we propose leads to better performance than max-min interventions, while having a lower computational cost. Comparison against state-of-the-art defense methods demonstrates superior performance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A control-based spatial source reconstruction in fractional heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article addresses the inverse source problem for a nonlocal heat equation involving the fractional Laplacian. The primary goal is to reconstruct the spatial component of the source term from partial observations of the system's state and its time derivative over a subset of the domain. A reconstruction formula for the Fourier coefficients of the unknown source is derived, leveraging the null controllability property of the fractional heat equation when the fractional order lies in the interval $s\in(1/2,1)$. The methodology builds on spectral analysis and Volterra integral equations, providing a robust framework for recovering spatial sources under limited measurement data. Numerical experiments confirm the accuracy and stability of the proposed approach.</description>
