      <title>Scaling Equilibrium Propagation to Deeper Neural Network Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibrium propagation has been proposed as a biologically plausible alternative to the backpropagation algorithm. The local nature of gradient computations, combined with the use of convergent RNNs to reach equilibrium states, make this approach well-suited for implementation on neuromorphic hardware. However, previous studies on equilibrium propagation have been restricted to networks containing only dense layers or relatively small architectures with a few convolutional layers followed by a final dense layer. These networks have a significant gap in accuracy compared to similarly sized feedforward networks trained with backpropagation. In this work, we introduce the Hopfield-Resnet architecture, which incorporates residual (or skip) connections in Hopfield networks with clipped $\mathrm{ReLU}$ as the activation function. The proposed architectural enhancements enable the training of networks with nearly twice the number of layers reported in prior works. For example, Hopfield-Resnet13 achieves 93.92\% accuracy on CIFAR-10, which is $\approx$3.5\% higher than the previous best result and comparable to that provided by Resnet13 trained using backpropagation.</description>

      <title>The Dragon Hatchling: The Missing Link between the Transformer and Models of the Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between computing systems and the brain has served as motivation for pioneering theoreticians since John von Neumann and Alan Turing. Uniform, scale-free biological networks, such as the brain, have powerful properties, including generalizing over time, which is the main barrier for Machine Learning on the path to Universal Reasoning Models.
  We introduce `Dragon Hatchling' (BDH), a new Large Language Model architecture based on a scale-free biologically inspired network of \$n\$ locally-interacting neuron particles. BDH couples strong theoretical foundations and inherent interpretability without sacrificing Transformer-like performance.
  BDH is a practical, performant state-of-the-art attention-based state space sequence learning architecture. In addition to being a graph model, BDH admits a GPU-friendly formulation. It exhibits Transformer-like scaling laws: empirically BDH rivals GPT2 performance on language and translation tasks, at the same number of parameters (10M to 1B), for the same training data.
  BDH can be represented as a brain model. The working memory of BDH during inference entirely relies on synaptic plasticity with Hebbian learning using spiking neurons. We confirm empirically that specific, individual synapses strengthen connection whenever BDH hears or reasons about a specific concept while processing language inputs. The neuron interaction network of BDH is a graph of high modularity with heavy-tailed degree distribution. The BDH model is biologically plausible, explaining one possible mechanism which human neurons could use to achieve speech.
  BDH is designed for interpretability. Activation vectors of BDH are sparse and positive. We demonstrate monosemanticity in BDH on language tasks. Interpretability of state, which goes beyond interpretability of neurons and model parameters, is an inherent feature of the BDH architecture.</description>

      <title>Norm-Q: Effective Compression Method for Hidden Markov Models in Neuro-Symbolic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMM) are commonly used in generation tasks and have demonstrated strong capabilities in neuro-symbolic applications for the Markov property. These applications leverage the strengths of neural networks and symbolic reasoning to create robust and interpretable AI systems. However, they may inherit and amplify the shortcomings of both approaches. Both components require dense computation and data transfer, and their communication further hinders performance. This paper proposes Norm-Q, a normalized linear quantization approach for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, such as HMMs. We reduce the bit width of the data with minimal impact, thereby alleviating memory and bandwidth stress and enabling deployment on potential custom hardware. Our method introduces a normalized quantization-aware expectation maximization process for probabilistic model training. The experimental results show that Norm-Q achieves a higher compression rate with reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods. In the case of the constrained generation task of large language models, we successfully quantize an HMM of 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and, at most, 3 bits with acceptable loss. Notably, the Norm-Q method can achieve a compression rate of 99% for the weights of the HMM. The code is open source at https://github.com/superstarghy/Norm-Q.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Spatialized Brain-Body-Environment System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain-body-environment framework studies adaptive be- havior through embodied and situated agents, emphasizing interactions between brains, biomechanics, and environmen- tal dynamics. However, many models often treat the brain as a network of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), neglecting finer spatial properties which can not only increase model complexity but also constrain observable neural dy- namics. To address this limitation, we propose a spatially ex- tended approach using partial differential equations (PDEs) for both the brain and body. As a case study, we revisit a pre- viously developed model of a child swinging, now incorpo- rating spatial dynamics. By considering the spatio-temporal properties of the brain and body, we analyze how input loca- tion and propagation along a PDE influence behavior. This approach offers new insights into the role of spatial organiza- tion in adaptive behavior, bridging the gap between abstract neural models and the physical constraints of embodied sys- tems. Our results highlight the importance of spatial dynam- ics in understanding brain-body-environment interactions.</description>

      <title>CIMNAS: A Joint Framework for Compute-In-Memory-Aware Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory (CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters, quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of 73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at https://github.com/OlgaKrestinskaya/CIMNAS.</description>

      <title>Real-time Noise Detection and Classification in Single-Channel EEG: A Lightweight Machine Learning Approach for EMG, White Noise, and EOG Artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular (EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering (targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD) analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and &gt;90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB). Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96% classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces. This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.</description>

      <title>A general optimization framework for mapping local transition-state networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how complex systems transition between states requires mapping the energy landscape that governs these changes. Local transition-state networks reveal the barrier architecture that explains observed behaviour and enables mechanism-based prediction across computational chemistry, biology, and physics, yet current practice either prescribes endpoints or randomly samples only a few saddles around an initial guess. We present a general optimization framework that systematically expands local coverage by coupling a multi-objective explorer with a bilayer minimum-mode kernel. The inner layer uses Hessian-vector products to recover the lowest-curvature subspace (smallest k eigenpairs), the outer layer optimizes on a reflected force to reach index-1 saddles, then a two-sided descent certifies connectivity. The GPU-based pipeline is portable across autodiff backends and eigensolvers and, on large atomistic-spin tests, matches explicit-Hessian accuracy while cutting peak memory and wall time by orders of magnitude. Applied to a DFT-parameterized N\'eel-type skyrmionic model, it recovers known routes and reveals previously unreported mechanisms, including meron-antimeron-mediated N\'eel-type skyrmionic duplication, annihilation, and chiral-droplet formation, enabling up to 32 pathways between biskyrmion (Q=2) and biantiskyrmion (Q=-2). The same core transfers to Cartesian atoms, automatically mapping canonical rearrangements of a Ni(111) heptamer, underscoring the framework's generality.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Measures: Discriminative Capacity of Representational Similarity Metrics Across Model Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04622v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory, silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity. Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families. These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.</description>

      <title>Graph Coloring for Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When different objectives conflict with each other in multi-task learning, gradients begin to interfere and slow convergence, thereby potentially reducing the final model's performance. To address this, we introduce SON-GOKU, a scheduler that computes gradient interference, constructs an interference graph, and then applies greedy graph-coloring to partition tasks into groups that align well with each other. At each training step, only one group (color class) of tasks are activated, and the grouping partition is constantly recomputed as task relationships evolve throughout training. By ensuring that each mini-batch contains only tasks that pull the model in the same direction, our method improves the effectiveness of any underlying multi-task learning optimizer without additional tuning. Since tasks within these groups will update in compatible directions, multi-task learning will improve model performance rather than impede it. Empirical results on six different datasets show that this interference-aware graph-coloring approach consistently outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task optimizers. We provide extensive theory showing why grouping and sequential updates improve multi-task learning, with guarantees on descent, convergence, and accurately identifying what tasks conflict or align.</description>
