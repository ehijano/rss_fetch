      <title>Palette Sparsification for Graphs with Sparse Neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A celebrated palette sparsification result of Assadi, Chen, and Khanna states that in every $n$-vertex graph of maximum degree $\Delta$, sampling $\Theta(\log n)$ colors per vertex from $\{1,\ldots,\Delta+1\}$ almost certainly allows for a proper coloring from the sampled colors. Alon and Assadi extended this work proving a similar result for $O(\Delta/\log \Delta)$-coloring triangle-free graphs. Apart from being interesting results from a combinatorial standpoint, their results have various applications to the design of graph coloring algorithms in different models of computation.
  In this work, we focus on graphs with sparse neighborhoods. We say a graph $G = (V,E)$ is $k$-locally-sparse if for each vertex $v \in V$, the subgraph $G[N(v)]$ contains at most $k$ edges. A celebrated result of Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov shows that such graphs are $O(\Delta/\log (\Delta/\sqrt{k}))$-colorable. For any $\alpha\in(0,1)$ and $k\ll\Delta^{2\alpha}$, let $G$ be a $k$-locally-sparse graph. We show the following for $q=\Theta\left(\Delta/\log\left(\Delta^\alpha/\sqrt{k}\right)\right)$:
  1. Sampling $O(\Delta^\alpha+\sqrt{\log n})$ colors per vertex is sufficient to obtain a proper $q$-coloring of $G$ from the sampled colors.
  2. There exists a single-pass streaming algorithm which computes a proper $q$-coloring of $G$ with high probability using $\tilde O(n\Delta^{2\alpha})$ space.
  3. There exists a randomized non-adaptive sublinear-time algorithm which computes a proper $q$-coloring of $G$ with high probability using at most $\tilde O\left(n^{\frac32+\frac{\alpha}{2-2\alpha}}\right)$ queries.
  Our results recover and improve upon earlier work of Alon and Assadi. A key element in our proof is a proposition regarding correspondence coloring in the so-called color-degree setting, which improves upon recent work of Anderson, Kuchukova, and the author and is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On a generalization of corner trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Corner trees, introduced in "Even-Zohar and Leng, 2021, Proceedings of the 2021 ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms", allow for the efficient counting of certain permutation patterns.
  Here we identify corner trees as a subset of finite (strict) double posets, which we term twin-tree double posets. They are contained in both twin double posets and tree double posets, giving candidate sets for generalizations of corner tree countings. We provide the generalization of an algorithm proposed by Even-Zohar/Leng to a class of tree double posets, thereby enlarging the space of permutations that can be counted in O(n^{5/3}).</description>

      <title>Real-World Networks are Low-Dimensional: Theoretical and Practical Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting the dimensionality of graphs is a central topic in machine learning. While the problem has been tackled empirically as well as theoretically, existing methods have several drawbacks. On the one hand, empirical tools are computationally heavy and lack theoretical foundation. On the other hand, theoretical approaches do not apply to graphs with heterogeneous degree distributions, which is often the case for complex real-world networks.
  To address these drawbacks, we consider geometric inhomogeneous random graphs (GIRGs) as a random graph model, which captures a variety of properties observed in practice. Our first result shows that the clustering coefficient of GIRGs scales inverse exponentially with respect to the number of dimensions, when the latter is at most logarithmic in $n$. This gives a first theoretical explanation for the low dimensionality of real-world networks as observed by Almagro et al. in 2022. We further use these insights to derive a linear-time algorithm for determining the dimensionality of a given GIRG and prove that our algorithm returns the correct number of dimensions with high probability GIRG. Our algorithm bridges the gap between theory and practice, as it not only comes with a rigorous proof of correctness but also yields results comparable to that of prior empirical approaches, as indicated by our experiments on real-world instances.</description>
