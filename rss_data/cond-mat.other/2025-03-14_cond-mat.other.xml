      <title>Multi-Timescale Quantum Averaging Theory for Driven Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-timescale Quantum Averaging Theory (QAT), a generalized unitarity-preserving analytic framework for modeling periodically and almost-periodically driven quantum systems across multiple timescales. By integrating the Magnus expansion with the method of averaging on multiple scales, QAT captures the effects of both far-detuned and near-resonant interactions on system dynamics. The framework yields an effective Hamiltonian description while retaining fast oscillatory effects within a separate dynamical phase operator, ensuring accuracy across a wide range of driving regimes. We demonstrate the rapid convergence of QAT results toward exact numerical solutions in both detuning regimes for touchstone problems in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>A first principles approach to electromechanics in liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromechanics in fluids describes the response of the number density to electric fields, and thus provides a powerful means by which to control the behavior of liquids. While continuum approaches have proven successful in describing electromechanical phenomena in macroscopic bodies, their use is questionable when relevant length scales become comparable to a system's natural correlation lengths, as commonly occurs in, e.g., biological systems, nanopores, and microfluidics. Here, we present a first principles theory for electromechanical phenomena in fluids. Our approach is based on the recently proposed hyperdensity functional theory [Samm\"uller et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 098201 (2024)] in which we treat the charge density as an observable of the system, with the intrinsic Helmholtz free energy functional dependent upon both density and electrostatic potential. Expressions for the coupling between number and charge densities emerge naturally in this formalism, avoiding the need to construct density-dependent and spatially-varying material parameters such as the dielectric constant. Furthermore, we make our theory practical by deriving a connection between hyperdensity functional theory and local molecular field theory, which facilitates machine learning explicit representations for the free energy functionals of systems with short-ranged electrostatic interactions, with long-ranged effects accounted for in a well-controlled mean field fashion.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing steady-state properties of open quantum systems with parameter engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realistic quantum systems are affected by environmental loss, which is often seen as detrimental for applications in quantum technologies. Alternatively, weak coupling to an environment can aid in stabilizing highly entangled and mixed states, but determining optimal system-environment parameters can be challenging. Here, we describe a technique to optimize parameters for generating desired non-equilibrium steady states (NESSs) in driven-dissipative quantum systems governed by the Lindblad equation. We apply this approach to predict highly-entangled and mixed NESSs in Ising, Kitaev, and Dicke models in several quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional antiferromagnets with non-relativistic spin splitting switchable by electric polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-split antiferromagnets have significance for antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics due to their momentum dependent spin polarization which can be exploited for the control and detection of the AFM order parameter. Here, we explore the polar-layer stacking of AFM-ordered bilayers driving the emergence of reversable electric polarization and non-relativistic spin splitting (NRSS) of their band structure. Based on the spin-space group approach, we identify several representative two-dimensional AFM materials which exhibit different types of NRSS when stacked into a polar bilayer. We demonstrate that NRSS can have both altermagnetic and non-altermagnetic origins and elucidate symmetry requirements for NRSS to be switchable by electric polarization. We argue that the electric polarization switching of NRSS in polar AFM bilayers may be more practical for device applications than the current-induced N\'eel vector switching.</description>

      <title>Quantum Averaging for High-Fidelity Quantum Logic Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a two-timescale quantum averaging theory (QAT) for analytically modeling unitary dynamics in driven quantum systems. Combining the unitarity-preserving Magnus expansion with the method of averaging on multiple scales, QAT addresses the simultaneous presence of distinct timescales by generating a rotating frame with a dynamical phase operator that toggles with the high-frequency dynamics and yields an effective Hamiltonian for the slow degree of freedom. By retaining the fast-varying effects, we demonstrate the high precision achievable by applying this analytic technique to model a high-fidelity two-qubit quantum gate beyond the validity of first-order approximations. The results rapidly converge with numerical calculations of a fast-entangling M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen trapped-ion-qubit gate in the strong-field regime, illustrating QAT's ability to simultaneously provide both an intuitive, effective-Hamiltonian model and high accuracy.</description>
