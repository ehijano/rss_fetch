      <title>Zero curvature is a necessary and sufficient condition for a spin-orbital decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been an extended debate regarding the existence of a spin-orbital decomposition of the angular momentum of photons and other massless particles. It was recently shown that there are both geometric and topological obstructions preventing any such decomposition. Here we show that any geometric connection on a particle's state space induces a splitting of the angular momentum into two operators. These operators are well-defined angular momentum operators if and only if the connection has zero curvature. Massive particles have two canonical curved connections corresponding to boosts and rotations, respectively. These can be uniquely combined to produce a flat connection, and this gives a novel derivation of the Newton-Wigner position operator and the corresponding spin and orbital angular momenta for relativistic massive particles. When the mass is taken to zero, transverse boosts and rotations degenerate, leaving only a single connection for massless particles. This connection produces a commonly proposed splitting of the massless angular momentum into two operators. However, the connection is not flat, explaining why these operators do not satisfy the angular momentum commutation relations and are thus not true spin and orbital angular momentum operators.</description>

      <title>Cwikel-Lieb-Rozenblum type estimates for the Pauli and magnetic Schr\"odinger operator in dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Cwikel-Lieb-Rozenblum type inequality for the number of negative eigenvalues of Pauli operators in dimension two. The resulting upper bound is sharp both in the weak as well as in the strong coupling limit. We also derive different upper bounds for magnetic Schr\"odinger operators. The nature of the two estimates depends on whether or not the spin-orbit coupling is taken into account.</description>

      <title>Axially symmetric collapses in the 2-D Benjamin-Ono equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear dynamics of localized perturbations within the framework of the essentially two-dimensional generalization of the Benjamin-Ono equation (2D-BO) derived asymptotically from the Navier-Stokes equation. By simulating the 2D-BO equation with the pseudospectral method, we confirm that the localized initial perturbations exceeding a certain threshold collapse, forming a point singularity. Although the 2D-BO equation does not possess axial symmetry, we show that in the vicinity of the collapse singularity, the solution becomes axially-symmetric, whatever its initial shape. We find that perturbations collapse in a self-similar manner, with the perturbation amplitude exploding as $ (\check \tau)^{-\lambda}$ and its transverse scale shrinking as $ (\check \tau)^{\lambda}$, where $\check \tau$ is the time to the moment of singularity. We derive a family of self-similar solutions describing axially symmetric collapses. The value of the free parameter $ {\lambda}$ in the self-similar solution is specified by fitting it to the numerical simulation of the initial problem of the evolution of an initially localized perturbation. Remarkably, for the examples we examined the value of the parameter proved to be almost universal: $ {\lambda} \approx 0.9$; its dependence on the initial conditions is indiscernible. In the vicinity of the singularity, the dynamics becomes one-dimensional, thus, the derived reduction of the 2D-BO equation provides an effectively one-dimensional model of collapse.</description>

      <title>On quasi-local spin-angular momentum and the construction of axial vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14251v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel procedure is presented which allows the construction of all axial vector fields on Riemannian two-spheres. Using these axial vector fields and the centre-of-mass unit sphere reference systems, a constructive definition of quasi-local spin-angular momentum is introduced. Balance relations are also derived, with respect to arbitrary Lie-propagated unit sphere reference systems, to characterize the angular momentum transports in spacetimes without symmetries.</description>

Abstract: We develop and prove new geometric and algebraic characterisations for locations of constituent skyrmions, as well as their signed multiplicity, using Sutcliffe's JNR ansatz. Some low charge examples, and their similarity to BPS monopoles, are discussed. In addition, we provide Julia code for the further numerical study and visualisation of JNR skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning Implies Quantum Glassiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show a surprising relation between quantum learning theory and algorithmic hardness. We demonstrate that finding near-ground states of certain sparse disordered quantum systems is average-case hard for "Lipschitz" quantum algorithms if there exists an efficient, local learning algorithm -- such as the classical shadows algorithm -- for estimating the energy of a state of the system. A corollary of our result is that many standard quantum algorithms fail to find near-ground states of these systems, including short-time Lindbladian dynamics, short-time quantum annealing, phase estimation, and shallow-depth variational quantum algorithms. To achieve this, we introduce a topological property of quantum systems that we call the quantum overlap gap property (QOGP). This property is only satisfied by systems with an efficient local learning algorithm for the energy. We prove that systems which exhibit this topological property in their low-energy space are intractable for quantum algorithms whose outputs are stable under perturbations to their inputs. We then prove that the QOGP is satisfied for a sparsified variant of the quantum $p$-spin model, giving the first known algorithmic hardness-of-approximation result for quantum algorithms in finding the ground state of a non-stoquastic, noncommuting quantum system. Our resulting lower bound for quantum algorithms optimizing this model using Lindbladian evolution matches the best-known time lower bound for classical Langevin dynamics optimizing classical $p$-spin models. For this reason we suspect that finding ground states of typical quantum $p$-spin models using quantum algorithms is, in practice, as intractable as the classical $p$-spin model is for classical algorithms. Inversely, we show that the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model does not exhibit the QOGP, consistent with previous evidence that the model is rapidly mixing at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Approximation theory for Green's functions via the Lanczos algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that Green's functions can be expressed as continued fractions; the content at the $n$-th level of the fraction is encoded in a coefficient $b_n$, which can be recursively obtained using the Lanczos algorithm. We present a theory concerning errors in approximating Green's functions using continued fractions when only the first $N$ coefficients are known exactly. Our focus lies on the stitching approximation (also known as the recursion method), wherein truncated continued fractions are completed with a sequence of coefficients for which exact solutions are available. We assume a now standard conjecture about the growth of the Lanczos coefficients in chaotic many-body systems, and that the stitching approximation converges to the correct answer. Given these assumptions, we show that the rate of convergence of the stitching approximation to a Green's function depends strongly on the decay of staggered subleading terms in the Lanczos cofficients. Typically, the decay of the error term ranges from $1/\mathrm{poly}(N)$ in the best case to $1/\mathrm{poly}(\log N)$ in the worst case, depending on the differentiability of the spectral function at the origin. We present different variants of this error estimate for different asymptotic behaviours of the $b_n$, and we also conjecture a relationship between the asymptotic behavior of the $b_n$'s and the smoothness of the Green's function. Lastly, with the above assumptions, we prove a formula linking the spectral function's value at the origin to a product of continued fraction coefficients, which we then apply to estimate the diffusion constant in the mixed field Ising model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the space of two dimensional random linear cocycles over a shift in finitely many symbols, with at least one singular and one invertible matrix. We provide an explicit formula for the unique stationary measure associated to such cocycles and establish a Furstenberg-type formula characterizing the Lyapunov exponent. Using the spectral properties of the corresponding Markov operator and a parameter elimination argument, we prove that Lebesgue almost every cocycle in this space satisfies large deviations estimates and a central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>On a time-resolved interpretation of the Husimi function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we interpret the Husimi function as the conditional probability density of continuously measuring a stream of constant position and momentum outcomes, indefinitely. This gives rise to an alternative definition that naturally extends to an arbitrary collection of self-adjoint operators without reference to coherent states. This definition recovers the Husimi distribution for a spin-half particle when monitoring the three Pauli matrices, as well as Born's rule for quantum measurement when monitoring commuting quantum observables. Ultimately, the proposed paradigm generates positive representations of quantum states as conditional densities, on both finite and infinite time classical experiments, as expectations of a fundamental operator, the Gaussian semigroup.</description>

      <title>On the structure of big bang singularities in spatially homogenous solutions to the Einstein non-linear scalar field equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The subject of this article is the structure of big bang singularities in spatially homogeneous solutions to the Einstein non-linear scalar field equations. In particular, we focus on Bianchi class A; i.e., developments arising from left invariant initial data on unimodular $3$-dimensional Lie groups. We prove that solutions are either vacuum or matter dominated, depending on whether the limit of an expansion normalised normal derivative of the scalar field is zero or not, respectively. The main result concerning the asymptotics in the direction of the singularity is, essentially, that solutions induce data on the singularity, with two exceptions: vacuum dominated Bianchi type VIII and IX without additional symmetries (they are neither isotropic nor locally rotationally symmetric) exhibit BKL-type oscillations. Disregarding the exceptions, there is in fact a bijection between initial data on the singularity and developments. Initial data on the singularity thus play a central role in the analysis; they both parameterise developments and give optimal asymptotic information. However, the main point of the article is to prove that the set of isometry classes of initial data on the singularity (of a fixed Bianchi type and symmetry (such as isotropy, local rotational symmetry etc.)) has a smooth structure; that the set of isometry classes of developments (similarly restricted) has a smooth structure which fits together with the natural smooth structure of isometry classes of regular initial data with fixed mean curvature; and that the Einstein flow generates a diffeomorphism between the two sets. However, the article contains substantial additional information, such as, e.g., the construction of a large class of spatially locally homogeneous solutions that can be demonstrated to be globally non-linearly stable (in the absence of symmetries) both to the future and to the past.</description>

      <title>A General Model for Linearly Polarized Optical Vector Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach for deriving a broad class of propagation models for inhomogeneously, linearly polarized ``vector'' beams. Our formulation leverages a complex scalar potential along with an appropriately constructed Lagrangian energy density. Importantly, we show that polarization inhomogeneities can be included by simple addition of a spatially dependent polarization angle to the complex potential phase. Thus, phase and polarization are seen to be equivalent from an energy perspective. As part of our development, we also show how the complex scalar potential arises naturally when considering polarization angle as a field symmetry during construction of the Lagrangian. We further show that the definition of linear momentum density in terms of the complex potential holds a distinct advantage over the conventional definition for inhomogeneously polarized beams.</description>

      <title>Minimal Factorization of Chern-Simons Theory - Gravitational Anyonic Edge Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One approach to analyzing entanglement in a gauge theory is embedding it into a factorized theory with edge modes on the entangling boundary. For topological quantum field theories (TQFT), this naturally leads to factorizing a TQFT by adding local edge modes associated with the corresponding CFT. In this work, we instead construct a minimal set of edge modes compatible with the topological invariance of Chern-Simons theory. This leads us to propose a minimal factorization map. These minimal edge modes can be interpreted as the degrees of freedom of a particle on a quantum group. Of particular interest is three-dimensional gravity as a Chern-Simons theory with gauge group SL$(2,\mathbb{R}) \times$ SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$. Our minimal factorization proposal uniquely gives rise to quantum group edge modes factorizing the bulk state space of 3d gravity. This agrees with earlier proposals that relate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in 3d gravity to topological entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>An explicit description of the K\"{a}hler-Einstein metrics of Guenancia-Hamenst\"{a}dt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine and Premoselli (FP) constructed the first examples of manifolds that do not admit a locally symmetric metric but do admit a negatively curved Einstein metric. The manifolds here are hyperbolic branched covers like those used by Gromov and Thurston, and the construction of their model Einstein metric is a variation of the hyperbolic metric written in polar coordinates. Very recently, Guenancia and Hamenst\"{a}dt (GH) proved the existence of the first examples of manifolds that are not locally symmetric but admit a negatively curved K\"{a}hler-Einstein metric. The GH metrics are realized on complex hyperbolic branched covers constructed by Stover and Toledo. In this article we generalize the construction of FP to the complex hyperbolic setting and show that this yields a negatively curved Einstein metric that asymptotically approaches the metric of GH.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of a weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process in the framework of regularity structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a parabolically rescaled and suitably renormalised height function of a weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process on a circle converges to the Cole-Hopf solution of the KPZ equation. This is an analogue of the celebrated result by Bertini and Giacomin from 1997 for the exclusion process on a circle with any particle density. The main goal of this article is to analyse the interacting particle system using the framework of regularity structures without applying the Gaertner transform, a discrete version of the Cole-Hopf transform which linearises the KPZ equation. Our analysis relies on discretisation framework for regularity structures developed by Erhard and Hairer as well as estimates for iterated integrals with respect to cadlag martingales derived by Grazieschi, Matetski and Weber. The main technical challenge addressed in this work is the renormalisation procedure which requires a subtle analysis of regularity preserving discrete convolution operators.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a measure for evaluating the efficiency of finite universal quantum gate sets $\mathcal{S}$, called the Quantum Circuit Overhead (QCO), and the related notion of $T$-Quantum Circuit Overhead ($T$-QCO). The overhead is based on the comparison between the efficiency of $\mathcal{S}$ versus the optimal efficiency among all gate sets with the same number of gates. We demonstrate the usefulness of the ($T$-)QCO by extensive numerical calculations of its upper bounds, providing insight into the efficiency of various choices of single-qubit $\mathcal{S}$, including Haar-random gate sets and the gate sets derived from finite subgroups, such as Clifford and Hurwitz groups. In particular, our results suggest that, in terms of the upper bounds on the $T$-QCO, the famous T gate is a highly non-optimal choice for the completion of the Clifford gate set, even among the gates of order 8. We identify the optimal choices of such completions for both finite subgroups.</description>

      <title>On Entropy for general quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:1804.05579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these notes we will give an overview and road map for a definition and characterization of (relative) entropy for both classical and quantum systems. In other words, we will provide a consistent treatment of entropy which can be applied within the recently developed Orlicz space based approach to large systems. This means that the proposed approach successfully provides a refined framework for the treatment of entropy in each of classical statistical physics, Dirac's formalism of Quantum Mechanics, large systems of quantum statistical physics, and finally also for Quantum Field Theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.05881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Schr\"odinger operators $H=-\Delta+V({\mathbf x})$ in ${\mathbb R}^d$, $d\geq2$, with quasi-periodic potentials $V({\mathbf x})$. We prove that the absolutely continuous spectrum of a generic $H$ contains a semi-axis $[\lambda_*,+\infty)$. We also construct a family of eigenfunctions of the absolutely continuous spectrum; these eigenfunctions are small perturbations of the exponentials. The proof is based on a version of the multi-scale analysis in the momentum space with several new ideas introduced along the way.</description>

      <title>Integrating curved Yang-Mills gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02924v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a gauge theory based on principal bundles $\mathcal{P}$ equipped with a right $\mathcal{G}$-action, where $\mathcal{G}$ is a Lie group bundle instead of a Lie group. Due to the fact that a $\mathcal{G}$-action acts fibre by fibre, pushforwards of tangent vectors via a right-translation act now only on the vertical structure of $\mathcal{P}$. Thus, we generalize pushforwards using a connection on $\mathcal{G}$ which will modify the pushforward. A horizontal distribution on $\mathcal{P}$ invariant under such a modified pushforward will provide a proper notion of Ehresmann connection. For achieving gauge invariance we impose conditions on the connection 1-form $\mu$ on $\mathcal{G}$: $\mu$ has to be a multiplicative form, \textit{i.e.}\ closed w.r.t.\ a certain simplicial differential $\delta$ on $\mathcal{G}$, and the curvature $R_\mu$ of $\mu$ has to be $\delta$-exact with primitive $\zeta$; $\mu$ will be the generalization of the Maurer-Cartan form of the classical gauge theory, while the $\delta$-exactness of $R_\mu$ will generalize the role of the Maurer-Cartan equation. This introduces the notion of multiplicative Yang-Mills connections, a connection which helped classifying singular foliations and symmetry breaking. For allowing curved connections on $\mathcal{G}$ in the dynamical theory we will need to generalize the typical definition of the curvature/field strength $F$ on $\mathcal{P}$ by adding $\zeta$ to $F$.
  Several examples for a gauge theory with a curved $\mu$ will be provided, including the inner group bundle of the Hopf fibration $\mathbb{S}^7 \to \mathbb{S}^4$, and a classification for gauge theories with structural semisimple group bundles will be provided, including a classification for whether these theories admit a classical description.</description>

      <title>Perturbative criteria for the ergodicity of interacting dissipative quantum lattice systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of quantum Markov semigroups describing the evolution of interacting quantum lattice systems, specified either as generic qudits or as fermions. The corresponding generators, which include both conservative and dissipative evolutions, are given by the superposition of local generators in the Lindblad form. Under general conditions, we show that the associated infinite volume dynamics is well defined and can be obtained as the strong limit of the finite volume dynamics. By regarding the interacting evolution as a perturbation of a non-interacting dissipative dynamics, we further obtain a quantitative criterion that yields the ergodicity of the quantum Markov semigroup together with the exponential convergence of local observables. The analysis is based on suitable a priori bounds on the resolvent equation which yield quantitive estimates on the evolution of local observables.</description>

      <title>Finding all solutions to the KZ equations in characteristic $p$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The KZ equations are differential equations satisfied by the correlation functions (on the Riemann sphere) of two-dimensional conformal field theories associated with an affine Lie algebra at a fixed level. They form a system of complex partial differential equations with regular singular points satisfied by the $n$-point functions of affine primary fields. In [SV1] the KZ equations were identified with equations for flat sections of suitable Gauss-Manin connections, and solutions of the KZ equations were constructed in the form of multidimensional hypergeometric integrals. In [SV2] the KZ equations were considered modulo a prime number $p$, and, for rational levels, polynomial solutions of the KZ equations modulo $p$ were constructed by an elementary procedure as suitable $p$-approximations of the hypergeometric integrals. In this paper we study in detail the first nontrivial example of the KZ equations in characteristic $p$. In particular, if the level is irrational, we prove a version of the steepest descent result that relates the KZ local system to the space of functions on the critical locus of the master function. We use this result to prove the generic irreducibility of the KZ local system at any irrational level. If the level is rational, we describe all solutions of the KZ equations in characteristic $p$ by demonstrating that they all stem from the $p$-hypergeometric solutions. Finally, we prove a Lagrangian property of the subbundle of the KZ bundle spanned by the $p$-hypergeometric sections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the quantization of Hall conductance in an infinite plane geometry. We consider a microscopic charge-conserving system with a pure, gapped infinite-volume ground state. While Hall conductance is well-defined in this scenario, existing proofs of its quantization have relied on assumptions of either weak interactions, or properties of finite volume ground state spaces, or invertibility. Here, we assume that the conditions necessary to construct the braided $C^*$-tensor category which describes anyonic excitations are satisfied, and we demonstrate that the Hall conductance is rational if the tensor category is finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(m_1, m_2)$ be a pair of positive integers. Denote by $\mathbb{P}^1$ the complex projective line, and by $\mathbb{P}^1_{m_1,m_2}$ the orbifold complex projective line obtained from $\mathbb{P}^1$ by adding $\mathbb{Z}_{m_1}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{m_2}$ orbifold points. In this paper we introduce a matrix linear difference equation, prove existence and uniqueness of its formal Puiseux-series solutions, and use them to give conjectural formulas for $k$-point ($k\ge2$) functions of Gromov--Witten invariants of $\mathbb{P}^1_{m_1,m_2}$. Explicit expressions of the unique solutions are also obtained. We carry out concrete computations of the first few invariants by using the conjectural formulas. For the case when one of $m_1, m_2$ equals 1, we prove validity of the conjectural formulas.</description>

      <title>The heat flow conjecture for polynomials and random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09660v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the roots of a polynomial of degree $N$, when the polynomial itself is evolving according to the heat flow. We propose a general conjecture for the large-$N$ limit of this evolution. Specifically, we propose (1) that the log potential of the limiting root distribution should evolve according to a certain first-order, nonlinear PDE, and (2) that the limiting root distribution at a general time should be the push-forward of the initial distribution under a certain explicit transport map. These results should hold for sufficiently small times, that is, until singularities begin to form.
  We offer three lines of reasoning in support of our conjecture. First, from a random matrix perspective, the conjecture is supported by a deformation theorem for the second moment of the characteristic polynomial of certain random matrix models. Second, from a dynamical systems perspective, the conjecture is supported by the computation of the second derivative of the roots with respect to time, which is formally small before singularities form. Third, from a PDE perspective, the conjecture is supported by the exact PDE\ satisfied by the log potential of the empirical root distribution of the polynomial, which formally converges to the desired PDE as $N\rightarrow \infty.$ We also present a "multiplicative" version of the the conjecture, supported by similar arguments.
  Finally, we verify rigorously that the conjectures hold at the level of the holomorphic moments.</description>

      <title>Self-restricting Noise and Exponential Relative Entropy Decay Under Unital Quantum Markov Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.03745v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: States of open quantum systems often decay continuously under environmental interactions. Quantum Markov semigroups model such processes in dissipative environments. It is known that finite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups with GNS detailed balance universally obey complete modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities (CMLSIs), yielding exponential decay of relative entropy to a subspace of fixed point states. We analyze continuous processes that combine dissipative with Hamiltonian time-evolution, precluding this notion of detailed balance. First, we find counterexamples to CMLSI-like decay for these processes and determine conditions under which it fails. In contrast, we prove that despite its absence at early times, exponential decay re-appears for unital, finite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups at finite timescales. Finally, we show that when dissipation is much stronger than Hamiltonian time-evolution, the rate of eventual, exponential decay toward the semigroup's decoherence-free subspace is bounded inversely in the decay rate of the dissipative part alone. Dubbed self-restricting noise, this inverse relationship arises when strong damping suppresses effects that would otherwise spread noise beyond its initial subspace.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on 11-dimensional Superspace</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16456v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flux quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity is arguably necessary for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.</description>

Abstract: We highlight the need for global completion of the field content in the M5-brane sigma-model analogous to Dirac's charge/flux quantization, and we point out that the superspace Bianchi identities on the worldvolume and on its ambient supergravity background constrain the M5's flux-quantization law to be in a non-abelian cohomology theory rationally equivalent to a twisted form of co-Homotopy. In order to clearly bring out this subtle point we give a streamlined re-derivation of the worldvolume 3-flux via M5 "super-embeddings". Finally, assuming the flux-quantization law to actually be in co-Homotopy ("Hypothesis H") we show how this implies Skyrmion-like solitons on general M5-worldvolumes and (abelian) anyonic solitons on the boundaries of "open M5-branes" in heterotic M-theory.</description>

We assume that the layers of $\Omega$ are fixed and known and that $\gamma$ is an unknown affine complex-valued function on each layer. We provide H\"{o}lder and Lipschitz stability estimates of $\sigma$ in terms of an ad hoc misfit functional as well as the more classical Dirichlet to Neumann map localised on some open portion $\Sigma$ of $\partial\Omega$, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding quantum noise is an essential step towards building practical quantum information processing systems. Pauli noise is a useful model that has been widely applied in quantum benchmarking, error mitigation, and error correction. Despite intensive study, most existing works focus on learning Pauli noise channels associated with some specific gates rather than treating the gate set as a whole. A learning algorithm that is self-consistent, complete, and efficient at the same time is yet to be established. In this work, we study the task of gate set Pauli noise learning, where a set of quantum gates, state preparation, and measurements all suffer from unknown Pauli noise channels with a customized noise ansatz. Using tools from algebraic graph theory, we analytically characterize the self-consistently learnable degrees of freedom for Pauli noise models with arbitrary linear ansatz, and design experiments to efficiently learn all the learnable information. Specifically, we show that all learnable information about the gate noise can be learned to relative precision, under mild assumptions on the noise ansatz. We then demonstrate the flexibility of our theory by applying it to concrete physically motivated ansatzs (such as spatially local or quasi-local noise) and experimentally relevant gate sets (such as parallel CZ gates). These results not only enhance the theoretical understanding of quantum noise learning, but also provide a feasible recipe for characterizing existing and near-future quantum information processing devices.</description>

Abstract: Synchronization is a fundamental dynamical state of interacting oscillators, observed in natural biological rhythms and in the brain. Global synchronization which occurs when non-linear or chaotic oscillators placed on the nodes of a network display the same dynamics as received great attention in network theory. Here we propose and investigate Global Topological Dirac Synchronization on higher-order networks such as cell and simplicial complexes. This is a state where oscillators associated to simplices and cells of arbitrary dimension, coupled by the Topological Dirac operator, operate at unison. By combining algebraic topology with non-linear dynamics and machine learning, we derive the topological conditions under which this state exists and the dynamical conditions under which it is stable. We provide evidence of 1-dimensional simplicial complexes (networks) and 2-dimensional simplicial and cell complexes where Global Topological Dirac Synchronization can be observed. Our results point out that Global Topological Dirac Synchronization is a possible dynamical state of simplicial and cell complexes that occur only in some specific network topologies and geometries, the latter ones being determined by the weights of the higher-order networks</description>

      <title>Integral quantization based on the Heisenberg-Weyl group</title>

Abstract: We develop a relativistic framework of integral quantization applied to the motion of spinless particles in the four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The proposed scheme is based on coherent states generated by the action of the Heisenberg-Weyl group and has been motivated by the Hamiltonian description of the geodesic motion in General Relativity. We believe that this formulation should also allow for a generalization to the motion of test particles in curved spacetimes. A key element in our construction is the use of suitably defined positive operator-valued measures. We show that this approach can be used to quantize the one-dimensional nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator, recovering the standard Hamiltonian as obtained by the canonical quantization. A direct application of our model, including a computation of transition amplitudes between states characterized by fixed positions and momenta, is postponed to a forthcoming article.</description>

      <title>Invariance of subbundles and nonholonomic trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the comparison of nonholonomic mechanics and constrained variational mechanics, invariant affine subbundles arise in the determination of the initial conditions where the two methods yield the same trajectories. Motivated by this, differential conditions are considered for invariant affine subbundles as they arise in the comparison of nonholonomic and constrained variational mechanics. First of all, the formal integrability of the resulting linear partial differential equation is determined using Spencer cohomology. Second, iterative formulae are provided that permit the determination of the largest invariant affine subbundle invariant under an affine vector field. Finally, the problem of a disc rolling on an inclined plane with no-slip is considered as an example to illustrate the theory.</description>
