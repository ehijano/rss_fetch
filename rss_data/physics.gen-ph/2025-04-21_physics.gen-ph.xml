      <title>A Model of Realistic Flavour Symmetry: Origin of Fermion Mass, Flavour Mixing and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I proposed a unified model of particle physic and cosmology in \cite {1}, which can successfully account for many things of the inflation, dark energy, dark matter, neutrino mass and baryogenesis. Based on the model, I here focus on the fermion flavour issues. I introduce a realistic flavour symmetry to generate the fermion mass and mixing. From the model Lagrangian I derive a neutrino mass matrix with a special structure form and fewer parameters, its numerical solutions are precisely fitting to all the data of the neutrino mass spectrum and lepton mixing, and clearly show a stronger predicting power. In addition, I put forward to a new scenario of the leptogenesis, which is implemented through the two CP-asymmetric decay modes of a superheavy neutral Dirac-fermion, and also I establish its relationship with the neutrino mass and mixing. This mechanism can simply and elegantly account for the baryon asymmetry. In short, the model can address many issues of the fermion flavours, and it is very realistic, believable and measurable instead of an illusory theory, therefore we expect the ongoing and future experiments to test the model.</description>
