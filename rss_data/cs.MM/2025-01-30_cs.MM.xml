      <title>Self-Guided Virtual Reality Therapy for Anxiety: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) technology can be used to treat anxiety symptoms and disorders. However, most VR interventions for anxiety have been therapist guided rather than self-guided. This systematic review aimed to examine the effectiveness and user experience (i.e., usability, acceptability, safety, and attrition rates) of self-guided VR therapy interventions in people with any anxiety condition as well as provide future research directions. Peer-reviewed journal articles reporting on self-guided VR interventions for anxiety were sought from the Cochrane Library, IEEE Explore Digital Library, PsycINFO, PubMED, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Study data from the eligible articles were extracted, tabulated, and addressed with a narrative synthesis. A total of 21 articles met the inclusion criteria. The findings revealed that self-guided VR interventions for anxiety can provide an effective treatment of social anxiety disorder, public speaking anxiety, and specific phobias. User experiences outcomes of safety, usability, and acceptability were generally positive and the average attrition rate was low. However, there was a lack of standardised assessments to measure user experiences. Self-guided VR for anxiety can provide an engaging approach for effectively and safely treating common anxiety conditions. Nevertheless, more experimental studies are required to examine their use in underrepresented anxiety populations, their long-term treatment effects beyond 12 months, and compare their effectiveness against other self-help interventions for anxiety (e.g., internet interventions and bibliotherapy).</description>

      <title>When Video Coding Meets Multimodal Large Language Models: A Unified Paradigm for Video Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing codecs are designed to eliminate intrinsic redundancies to create a compact representation for compression. However, strong external priors from Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have not been explicitly explored in video compression. Herein, we introduce a unified paradigm for Cross-Modality Video Coding (CMVC), which is a pioneering approach to explore multimodality representation and video generative models in video coding. Specifically, on the encoder side, we disentangle a video into spatial content and motion components, which are subsequently transformed into distinct modalities to achieve very compact representation by leveraging MLLMs. During decoding, previously encoded components and video generation models are leveraged to create multiple encoding-decoding modes that optimize video reconstruction quality for specific decoding requirements, including Text-Text-to-Video (TT2V) mode to ensure high-quality semantic information and Image-Text-to-Video (IT2V) mode to achieve superb perceptual consistency. In addition, we propose an efficient frame interpolation model for IT2V mode via Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) tuning to guarantee perceptual quality, which allows the generated motion cues to behave smoothly. Experiments on benchmarks indicate that TT2V achieves effective semantic reconstruction, while IT2V exhibits competitive perceptual consistency. These results highlight potential directions for future research in video coding.</description>
