      <title>Method of images for one-dimensional discrete symmetric random walk under a reflecting barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition probability for a one-dimensional discrete symmetric random walk under a reflecting barrier was once given by the method of images. [S. Chandrasekhar, Rev. Mod. Phys. 15, 1 (1943).] However, several inconsistencies have been reported when the method of images is applied in cases where a reflecting barrier is considered, even after the exact solution has been obtained. Here, we explicitly show that the method of images becomes applicable if the image position is shifted.</description>

      <title>Real Space Renormalization Group for One-Dimensional Ising Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the real space Renormalisation Group (RNG) technique to a variety of one-dimensional Ising chains. We begin by recapitulating the work of Nauenberg for an ordered Ising chain, namely the decimation approach. We extend this work to certain non-trivial situation namely, the Alternate Ising Chain and Fibonacci Ising chain. Our approach is pedagogical and accessible to undergraduate students who have had a first course in statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic quantum Fokker--Planck equations and their application to thermostatic Stirling engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a computer code for the thermodynamic quantum Fokker--Planck equations (T-QFPE), derived from a thermodynamic system-bath model. This model consists of an anharmonic subsystem coupled to multiple Ohmic baths at different temperatures, which are connected to or disconnected from the subsystem as a function of time. The code numerically integrates the T-QFPE and their classical expression to simulate isothermal, isentropic, thermostatic, and entropic processes in both quantum and classical cases. The accuracy of the results was verified by comparing the analytical solutions of the Brownian oscillator. Additionally, we illustrated a breakdown of the Markovian Lindblad-master equation in the pure quantum regime. As a demonstration, we simulated a thermostatic Stirling engine employed to develop non--equilibrium thermodynamics [S. Koyanagi and Y. Tanimura, https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.17791] under quasi-static conditions. The quasi-static thermodynamic potentials, described as intensive and extensive variables, were depicted as work diagrams. In the classical case, the work done by the external field is independent of the system-bath coupling strength. In contrast, in the quantum case, the work decreases as the coupling strength increases due to quantum entanglement between the subsystem and bath. The codes were developed for multicore processors using Open multiprocessing (OpenMP) and for graphics processing units (GPU) using the Compute United Device Architecture (CUDA). These codes are provided as supplementary materials.</description>

      <title>Availability versus carrying capacity: Phases of asymmetric exclusion processes competing for finite pools of resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address how the interplay between the finite availability and carrying capacity of particles at different parts of a spatially extended system can control the steady state currents and density profiles in the one-dimensional current-carrying lanes connecting the different parts of the system. To study this, we set up a minimal model consisting of two particle reservoirs of the same finite carrying capacity connected by two equally sized anti-parallel asymmetric exclusion processes (TASEP). We focus on the steady-state currents and particle density profiles in the two TASEP lanes. The ensuing phases and the phase diagrams, which can be remarkably complex, are parametrized by the model parameters defining particle exchange between the TASEP lanes and the reservoirs and the filling fraction of the particles that determine the total resources available. These parameters may be tuned to make the densities of the two TASEP lanes globally uniform or piece-wise continuous in the form of a combination of a single localized domain wall and a spatially constant density or a pair of delocalized domain walls. Our model reveals that the two reservoirs can be preferentially populated or depopulated in the steady states.</description>

      <title>The magnon mediated plasmon friction: a functional integral approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss quantum friction in a system formed by two metallic surfaces separated by a ferromagnetic intermedium of a certain thickness. The internal degrees of freedom in the two metallic surfaces are assumed to be plasmons, while the excitations in the intermediate material are magnons, modeling plasmons coupled to magnons. During relative sliding, one surface moves uniformly parallel to the other, causing friction in the system. By calculating the effective action of the magnons, we can determine the particle production probability, which shows a positive correlation between the probability and the sliding speed. Finally, we derive the frictional force of the system, with both theoretical and numerical results indicating that the friction, like the particle production probability, also has a positive correlation with the speed.</description>

      <title>Experimentally probing Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landauer's principle bridges information theory and thermodynamics by linking the entropy change of a system during a process to the average energy dissipated to its environment. Although typically discussed in the context of erasing a single bit of information, Landauer's principle can be generalised to characterise irreversibility in out-of-equilibrium processes, such as those involving complex quantum many-body systems. Specifically, the relationship between the entropy change of the system and the energy dissipated to its environment can be decomposed into changes in quantum mutual information and a difference in relative entropies of the environment. Here we experimentally probe Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime using a quantum field simulator of ultracold Bose gases. Employing a dynamical tomographic reconstruction scheme, we track the temporal evolution of the quantum field following a global mass quench from a Klein-Gordon to a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid model and analyse the information-theoretic contributions to Landauer's principle for various system-environment partitions of the composite system. Our results agree with theoretical predictions, interpreted using a semi-classical quasiparticle picture. Our work demonstrates the potential of ultracold atom-based quantum field simulators to experimentally investigate quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purification maps a mixed state to a pure state and a non-unitary evolution into a unitary one by enlarging the Hilbert space. We link the operator complexity of the density matrix to the state/operator complexity of purified states using three purification schemes: time-independent, time-dependent, and instantaneous purification. We propose inequalities among the operator and state complexities of mixed states and their purifications, demonstrated with a single qubit, two-qubit Werner states, and infinite-dimensional diagonal mixed states. We find that the complexity of a vacuum evolving into a thermal state equals the average number of Rindler particles created between left and right Rindler wedges. Finally, for the thermofield double state evolving from zero to finite temperature, we show that 1) the state complexity follows the Lloyd bound, and 2) the Krylov state/operator complexities are subadditive in contrast to the holographic volume complexity.</description>

      <title>Constructive Fermionic Matrix Product States for Projected Fermi Sea</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projected wave functions offer a means for incorporating local correlation effects in gapless electronic phases of matter like metals. Although such wave functions can be readily specified formally, it is challenging to compute their associated physical observables. Tensor network approaches offer a modern numerical method for this task. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a constructive tensor-network approach for obtaining physical quantities, like fermion two-point functions and density-density correlation functions, for one-dimensional projected Fermi sea states. We benchmark our method against exact analytical results for spin-1/2 electrons subjected to the Gutzwiller projection, and then present results on spinless fermions with nearest-neighbor repulsion. For a state with two pairs of Fermi points, we reveal a correlation-tuning of the characteristic wave vector of the charge density modulation in the system.</description>

      <title>Accurate Analytic Model for the Energy Spectrum of the Anharmonic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent work we have derived an analytic expression for the partition function of the quartic oscillator using a path integral formalism. Quite remarkably, the free energy was found to be accurate to a few percent over the entire range of temperatures and quartic coupling constant. In addition, the key features of the exact partition function were successfully reproduced. Accurate analytic expressions for the ground- and first-excited state energies as function of $g$ were derived. In this work, we extend our results to the calculation of the full energy spectrum. We also generalize our study of the quartic oscillator to the case of the anharmonic oscillator with sextic and octic couplings. The energy levels found are accurate for all couplings and principal quantum numbers considered here (up to $n=8$), confirming this model partition function as a good and faithful approximation of the exact one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum conductors attached to metallic reservoirs have been demonstrated to overcome the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR), a trade-off relation between the amount of dissipation and the absence of charge and heat current fluctuations. Here, we report large TUR violations when superconducting reservoirs replace metallic ones. The coexistence of different transport processes, namely (multiple) Andreev reflection, where electrons and their retro-reflected holes create Cooper pairs, in addition to the normal quasiparticle transport is identified as the source for such TUR breakdowns. The large TUR violation is a remarkable advantage for building low dissipative and highly stable quantum thermal machines.</description>

      <title>Exact Results for Scaling Dimensions of Composite Operators in the $\phi^4$ Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the scaling dimension $\Delta_n$ for the class of composite operators $\phi^n$ in the $\lambda \phi^4$ theory taking the double scaling limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $\lambda \rightarrow 0$ with fixed $\lambda n$ via a semiclassical approach. Our results resum the leading power of $n$ at any loop order. In the small $\lambda n$ regime we reproduce the known diagrammatic results and predict the infinite series of higher-order terms. For intermediate values of $\lambda n$ we find that $\Delta_n/n$ increases monotonically approaching a $(\lambda n)^{1/3}$ behavior in the $\lambda n \to \infty$ limit.</description>

      <title>Noise-Induced Phase Separation and Time Reversal Symmetry Breaking in Active Field Theories driven by persistent noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the Landau-Ginzburg picture of phase transitions, scalar field theories develop phase separation because of a spontaneous symmetry-breaking mechanism. This picture works in thermodynamics but also in the dynamics of phase separation. Here we show that scalar non-equilibrium field theories undergo phase separation just because of non-equilibrium fluctuations driven by a persistent noise. The mechanism is similar to what happens in Motility-Induced Phase Separation where persistent motion introduces an effective attractive force. We observe that Noise-Induced Phase Separation occurs in a region of the phase diagram where disordered field configurations would otherwise be stable at equilibrium. Measuring the local entropy production rate to quantify the time-reversal symmetry breaking, we find that such breaking is concentrated on the boundary between the two phases.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-Induced Spin Parity Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19311v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin parity effects refer to those special situations where a dichotomy in the physical behavior of a system arises, solely depending on whether the relevant spin quantum number is integral or half-odd integral. As is the case with the Haldane conjecture in antiferromagnetic spin chains, their pursuit often derives deep insights and invokes new developments in quantum condensed matter physics. Here we put forth a simple and general scheme for generating such effects in any spatial dimension through the use of anisotropic interactions, and a setup within reasonable reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom implementations. We demonstrate its utility through a detailed analysis of the magnetization behavior of a specific one-dimensional spin chain model -- an anisotropic antiferromagnet in a transverse magnetic field, unraveling along the way the quantum origin of finite-size effects observed in the magnetization curve that had previously been noted but not clearly understood.</description>

Abstract: The heat equation, based on Fourier's law, is commonly used for description of heat conduction. However, Fourier's law is valid under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, which is violated in very small dimensions and short timescales, and at low temperatures. In the paper R. Kovacs and P. Van, Generalized heat conduction in heat pulse experiments, Int. J. Heat Mass Transf., 83:613-620, 2015, a ballistic-conductive (BC) model of heat conduction was developed. In this paper, we study the behavior of solutions to an initial value problem (IVP) in 1D in the framework of the linearized ballistic-conductive (BC) model. As a result of the study, an unphysical effect has been found when part of the initial thermal energy does not spread anywhere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Taking accurate measurements of the temperature of quantum systems is a challenging task. The mathematical peculiarities of quantum information make it virtually impossible to measure with infinite precision. In the present paper, we introduce a generalize thermal state, which is conditioned on the pointer states of the available measurement apparatus. We show that this conditional thermal state outperforms the Gibbs state in quantum thermometry. The origin for the enhanced precision can be sought in its asymmetry quantified by the Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information. This additional resource is further clarified in a fully resource-theoretic analysis, and we show that there is a Gibbs-preserving map to convert a target state into the conditional thermal state. We relate the quantum J-divergence between the conditional thermal state and the same target state to quantum heat.</description>

      <title>Exponential speedups for quantum walks in random hierarchical graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are few known exponential speedups for quantum algorithms and these tend to fall into even fewer families. One speedup that has mostly resisted generalization is the use of quantum walks to traverse the welded-tree graph, due to Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi, Gutmann, and Spielman. We show how to generalize this to a large class of hierarchical graphs in which the vertices are grouped into "supervertices" which are arranged according to a $d$-dimensional lattice. Supervertices can have different sizes, and edges between supervertices correspond to random connections between their constituent vertices.
  The hitting times of quantum walks on these graphs are related to the localization properties of zero modes in certain disordered tight binding Hamiltonians. The speedups range from superpolynomial to exponential, depending on the underlying dimension and the random graph model. We also provide concrete realizations of these hierarchical graphs, and introduce a general method for constructing graphs with efficient quantum traversal times using graph sparsification.</description>

      <title>The escape transition of a lattice star polymer grafted in a pore</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polymers in confined spaces are compressed and have reduced conformational entropy, and will partially or fully escape from confinement if conditions are suitable. This is in particular the case for a polymer grafted in a pore. The escape of the polymer from the pore may be considered a partial translocation from the pore into bulk solution, and the resulting conformational readjustment of the polymer has characteristics of a thermodynamic phase transition. In this paper a lattice self-avoiding walk model of a star polymer grafted in a pore is examined numerically using the PERM algorithm. We show that the arms of the grafted lattice star escape one at a time as the length of the pore is reduced, consistent with earlier results in the literature. Critical points for the escape transitions are estimated for square and cubic lattice models and we also examine various properties of the model as it undergoes escape transitions.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a second law of thermodynamics in isolated quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time. This appears to conflict with the reversible evolution of isolated quantum systems under the Schr\"odinger equation, which preserves the von Neumann entropy. Nonetheless, one finds that with respect to many observables, expectation values approach a fixed value -- their equilibrium value. This ultimately raises the question: in what sense does the entropy of an isolated quantum system increase over time? For classical systems, one introduces the assumption of a low entropy initial state along with the concept of ignorance about the microscopic details of the physical system, leading to a statistical interpretation of the second law. By considering the observables through which we examine quantum systems, both these assumptions can be incorporated, building upon recent studies of the equilibration on average of observables. While the statistical behavior of observable expectation values is well-established, a quantitative connection to entropy increase has been lacking so far. In deriving novel bounds for the equilibration of observables, and considering the entropy of the system relative to observables, we recover a variant of the second law: the entropy with respect to a given observable tends towards its equilibrium value in the course of the system's unitary evolution. These results also support recent findings which question the necessity of non-integrability for equilibration in quantum systems. We further illustrate our bounds using numerical results from the paradigmatic example of a quantum Ising model on a chain of spins. There, we observe entropy increasing up to equilibrium values, as well as fluctuations which expose the underlying reversible evolution in accordance with the derived bounds.</description>

      <title>Bipartite reweight-annealing algorithm to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy and its derivative in high precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme able to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative with high precision and low technical barrier. We avoid directly computing the overlap of two partition functions within different spacetime manifolds and instead obtain them separately via reweight-annealing scheme. The incremental process can be designed along the path of real physical parameters in this frame, and all intermediates are EEs of corresponding parameters, so the algorithm efficiency is improved by more than $10^4$ of times. The calculation of EE becomes much cheaper and simpler. It opens a way to numerically detect the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in two and higher dimensional systems. We then show the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points and to probe novel phases.</description>

      <title>Magic transition in measurement-only circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magic, also known as nonstabilizerness, quantifies the distance of a quantum state to the set of stabilizer states, and it serves as a necessary resource for potential quantum advantage over classical computing. In this work, we study magic in a measurement-only quantum circuit with competing types of Clifford and non-Clifford measurements, where magic is injected through the non-Clifford measurements. This circuit can be mapped to a classical model that can be simulated efficiently, and the magic can be characterized using any magic measure that is additive for tensor product of single-qubit states. Leveraging this observation, we study the magic transition in this circuit in both one- and two-dimensional lattices using large-scale numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate the presence of a magic transition between two different phases with extensive magic scaling, separated by a critical point in which the mutual magic exhibits scaling behavior analogous to entanglement. We further show that these two distinct phases can be distinguished by the topological magic. In a different regime, with a vanishing rate of non-Clifford measurements, we find that the magic saturates in both phases. Our work sheds light on the behavior of magic and its linear combinations in quantum circuits, employing genuine magic measures.</description>
