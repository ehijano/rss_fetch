      <title>Topologically protected measurement of orbital angular momentum of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a weak measurement scheme for measuring orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light based on the global topology in wave function. We introduce the spin-orbit coupling to transform the measurement of OAM to the pre- and postselected measurement of polarization. The OAM number can be precisely and promptly recognized using single-shot detection without the need for spatial resolution. More significantly, the measurement results exhibit topological robustness under random phase perturbations. This scheme has the potential to be applied as a paradigm in the OAM-based optical computing, metrology and communication.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit Interaction-mediated Measurement of Surface Chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-orbit interaction in a focused-reflected beam of light results in spatially non-uniform polarization in the beam cross-section due to the superposition of orthogonal field components and polarization-dependent interface reflection coefficients. Polarization filtering the output beam leads to an interchangeable transformation of - or + 2 charge vortex into two - or + unit charge vortices, for + or - circular polarization of the input Gaussian beam. This transformation follows a trajectory, named optical vortex trajectory, that depend on the input beam spin and hence the vortex charge and reflecting surface characteristics. The OVT is used here to quantify both the sign and the magnitude of the chiral parameter of a quartz crystal. The Jones matrix-based simulation anticipates the chirality-dependent OVT that matches with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Continuous Phase Modulation Technology Based on Grating Period Interval for High Grating Coupling Efficiency and Precise Wavelength Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel grating modulation technique for laser arrays is proposed and demonstrated. This method modifies the initial phase within each grating period, applying a total phase shift that increments in an arithmetic progression, ensuring equal channel spacing across the array. Despite the varying phase shifts, the device maintains coupling efficiency comparable to traditional uniform grating structures. Furthermore, the continuous phase modulation enhances the stability of the lasing wavelength of the primary mode, reducing sensitivity to fabrication errors. This improved tolerance to manufacturing inaccuracies represents a significant technological advancement, making this approach highly promising for applications requiring precise and stable wavelength control.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low-crosstalk Silicon Switches Driven Thermally and Electrically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon photonic switches are widely considered as a cost-effective solution for addressing the ever-growing data traffic in datacenter networks, as they offer unique advantages such as low power consumption, low latency, small footprint and high bandwidth. Despite extensive research efforts, crosstalk in large-scale photonic circuits still poses a threat to the signal integrity. In this paper, we present two designs of silicon Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) switches achieving ultra-low-crosstalk, driven thermally and electrically. Each switch fabric is optimized at both the device and circuit level to suppress crosstalk and reduce system complexity. Notably, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, we harness the inherent self-heating effect in a carrier-injection-based MZI switch to create a pair of phase shifters that offer arbitrary phase differences. Such a pair of phase shifters induces matched insertion loss at each arm, thus minimizing crosstalk. Experimentally, an ultra-low crosstalk ratio below -40 dB is demonstrated for both thermo-optic (T-O) and electro-optic (E-O) switches. The T-O switch exhibits an on-chip loss of less than 5 dB with a switching time of 500 microseconds, whereas the E-O switch achieves an on-chip loss as low as 8.5 dB with a switching time of under 100 ns. In addition, data transmission of a 50 Gb/s on-off keying signal is demonstrated with high fidelity on the E-O switch, showing the great potential of the proposed switch designs.</description>

      <title>High-directivity multi-level beam switching with single-gate tunable metasurfaces based on graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for ultra-fast telecommunications, autonomous driving, and futuristic technologies highlights the crucial role of active beam steering at the nanoscale. This is essential for applications like LiDAR, beam-forming, and holographic displays, especially as devices reduce in form-factor. Although device with active beam switching capability is a potential candidate for realizing those applications, there have been only a few works to realize beam switching in reconfigurable metasurfaces with active tuning materials. In this paper, we theoretically present a multi-level beam-switching dielectric metasurface with a graphene layer for active tuning, addressing challenges associated with achieving high directivity and diffraction efficiency, and doing so while using a single-gate setup. For two-level switching, the directivities reached above 95%, and the diffraction efficiencies were near 50% at the operation wavelength ${\lambda}_0$ = 8 ${\mu}$m. Through quasi-normal mode expansion, we illustrate the physics of the beam switching metasurface inverse-designed by the adjoint method, highlighting the role of resonant modes and their response to charge carrier tuning. Under the same design scheme, we design and report characteristics of a three-level and four-level beam switching device, suggesting a possibility of generalizing to multi-level beam switching.</description>

      <title>Optically-Controlled Nano-Transducers Based on Cleaved Superlattices for Monitoring Gigahertz Surface Acoustic Vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) convey energy at subwavelength depths along surfaces. Using interdigital transducers (IDTs) and opto-acousto-optic transducers (OAOTs), researchers have harnessed coherent SAWs with nanosecond periods and micrometer localization depth for various applications. However, the utilization of cutting-edge OAOTs produced through surface nanopatterning techniques has set the upper limit for coherent SAW frequencies below 100 GHz, constrained by factors such as the quality and pitch of the surface nanopattern, not to mention the electronic bandwidth limitations of the IDTs. In this context, unconventional optically-controlled nano-transducers based on cleaved superlattices (SLs) are here presented as an alternative solution. To demonstrate their viability, we conducted proof-of-concept experiments using ultrafast lasers in a pump-probe configuration on SLs made of alternating AlxGa1-xAs and AlyGa1-yAs layers with approximately 70 nm periodicity and cleaved along their growth direction to produce a periodic nanostructured surface. The acoustic vibrations, generated and detected by laser beams incident on the cleaved surface, span a range from 40 GHz to 70 GHz, corresponding to the generalized surface Rayleigh mode and bulk modes within the dispersion relation. This exploration shows that, in addition to SAWs, cleaved SLs offer the potential to observe surface-skimming longitudinal and transverse acoustic waves at GHz frequencies. This proof-of-concept demonstration below 100 GHz in nanoacoustics using such an unconventional platform offers opportunities for realizing sub-THz to THz coherent surface acoustic vibrations in the future, as SLs can be epitaxially grown with atomic-scale layer width and quality.</description>

      <title>Efficient, broadly-tunable source of megawatt pulses for multiphoton microscopy based on self-phase modulation in argon-filled hollow-core fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exciting recent development for deep-tissue imaging with cellular resolution is three-photon fluorescence microscopy (3PM) with excitation at long wavelengths (1300 and 1700 nm). In the last few years, long-wavelength 3PM has driven rapid progress in deep-tissue imaging beyond the depth limit of two-photon microscopy, with impacts in neuroscience, immunology, and cancer biology. However, wide adoption of 3PM faces challenges. Three-photon excitation (3PE) is naturally weaker than two-photon excitation, which places a premium on ultrashort pulses with high peak power. The inefficiency, complexity, and cost of current sources of these pulses present major barriers to the use of 3PM in typical biomedical research labs. Here, we describe a fiber-based source of femtosecond pulses with multi-megawatt peak power, tunable from 850 nm to 1700 nm. Compressed pulses from a fiber amplifier at 1030~nm are launched into an antiresonant hollow-core fiber filled with argon. By varying only the gas pressure, pulses with hundreds of nanojoules of energy and sub-100 fs duration are obtained at wavelengths between 850 and 1700 nm. This approach is a new route to an efficient, robust, and potentially low-cost source for multiphoton deep-tissue imaging. In particular, 960-nJ and 50-fs pulses are generated at 1300 nm with a conversion efficiency of 10\%. The nearly 20-MW peak power is an order of magnitude higher than the previous best from femtosecond fiber source at 1300~nm. As an example of the capabilities of the source, these pulses are used to image structure and neuronal activity in mouse brain as deep as 1.1 mm below the dura.</description>

      <title>Using laser and ultrasound devices for breast cancer treatment: studying the effects of gold nanoparticles injection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. After surgery, chemotherapy, and other invasive treatments, hyperthermia is a suitable choice with the minimal side effects. In this paper, the treatment of breast cancer using a combination of laser and ultrasound irradiation, in the presence of gold nanoparticles, is investigated. In the simulations, the breast tissue is represented as a multilayer structure and the tumor is supposed to consist two parts: a superficial section and a deeper region. In the initial stage, the superficial parts of the tumor, which also contain gold nanoparticles, are exposed to a continuous laser for 50 seconds followed by a cooling period of 20 seconds. Then, for deeper sections, ultrasound irradiation is utilized. The results indicated that the tissue necrosis volume was enhanced by the application of nanoparticles. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the combinational application of both of laser and ultrasound irradiation could eradicate both the superficial parts of the tumor and the deep parts.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Spectral Quantum State Estimation of Photon Pairs from Optical Fiber Using Stimulated Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing a quantum light source that carries more than one bit per photon is pivotal for expanding quantum information applications. Characterizing a high-dimensional multiple-degree-of-freedom source at the single-photon level is challenging due to the large parameter space as well as limited emission rates and detection efficiencies. Here, we characterize photon pairs generated in optical fiber in the transverse-mode and frequency degrees of freedom by applying stimulated emission in both degrees of freedom while detecting in one of them at a time. This method may be useful in the quantum state estimation and optimization of various photon-pair source platforms in which complicated correlations across multiple degrees of freedom may be present.</description>

      <title>Beamsplitter-free, high bit-rate, quantum random number generator based on temporal and spatial correlations of heralded single-photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), an inherently random quantum process, produces a non-deterministic photon-pair with strong temporal and spatial correlations owing to both energy and momentum conservation. Therefore, the SPDC-based photon pairs are used for quantum random number generation (QRNG). Typically, temporal correlation in association with an ideal unbiased beam splitter is used for QRNG without fully exploring the spatial correction. As a result, SPDC-based QRNG has a low bit rate. On the other hand, due to the spatial correlation, the photon pairs in non-collinear phase-matched geometry are generated randomly in diametrically opposite points over an annular ring spatial distribution. Therefore, exploring the temporal correlation between photon pairs from different sections of the annual ring can lead to multi-bit QRNG at a high rate, avoiding the need for a beam splitter. As a proof-of-concept, we report on high-bit-rate QRNG by using spatial correlation of photon-pairs by sectioning the SPDC ring of a non-collinear, degenerate, high-brightness source and temporal correlation between the diametrically opposite sections. Dividing the annular ring of the high-brightness photon-pair source based on a 20 mm long, type-0 phase-matched, periodically-poled KTP crystal into four sections, recording the timestamp of the coincidences (widow of 1 ns) between photons from diametrically opposite sections and assigning bits (0 and 1), we extracted 90 million raw bits over 27.7 s at a pump power of 17 mW. We determined the extraction ratio using the minimum entropy evaluation of more than 95% in our case. Using Toeplitz matrix-based post-processing, we achieved a QRNG with a bit-rate of 3 Mbps, passing all NIST 800-22 and TestU01 test suites. The generic scheme shows the possibility of further enhancement of the bit rate through more sectioning of the SPDC ring.</description>

      <title>Sampling requirements in near-field ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ptychography is a robust lensless form of microscopy routinely used for applications spanning life and physical sciences. The most common ptychography setup consists in using a detector to record diffraction patterns in the far-field. A near-field version has been more recently introduced, and its potential is yet to be fully exploited. In this work, the sampling requirements for near-field ptychography are analysed. Starting from the characterisation available in literature, the formalism of the fractional Fourier transform is used to generalise analytically the sampling conditions. The results harmonise the far- and near-field regimes and widen the applications of the technique with respect to the current knowledge. This study is supported by simulations and provides clear guidelines on how to optimise the setup and acquisition strategies for near-field ptychography experiments. The results are key to drive the translation of the technique towards low brilliance sources.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlations, mixed states and bistability at the onset of lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a model for a single mode laser that includes all two particle quantum correlations between photons and electrons. In contrast to the predictions of semi-classical models, we find that lasing takes place in the presence of quantum bistability between a non-lasing and a non-classical coherent state. The coherent state is characterized by a central frequency and a finite linewidth and emerges with finite amplitude from a saddle-node bifurcation together with an unstable coherent state. Hence coherent emission in nanolasers originates through a mixing of lasing and non-lasing states. In the limit of a macrolaser with a large number of emitters and non-resonant modes, the laser threshold approaches the prediction of the semi-classical theory, but with the important difference that lasing can be achieved only in the presence of finite size perturbations.</description>

      <title>Metal-Mesh Linear Variable Filter for Far-Infrared Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future far-infrared (IR) observatories require compact and cost efficient optical linear variable bandpass filters (LVBFs) to define their instrument spectral bands. We have designed novel far-IR LVBFs that consist of metal-mesh bandpass filters comprised of a gold film with cross-slots of varying sizes along a silicon (Si) substrate with anti-reflection (AR) coatings. We present our work on the simulated and measured transmission of non-AR coated and AR coated LVBFs for bandpass peaks from wavelengths of 24 to 36 $\mu$m with a resolving power ($R=\lambda_0/\Delta\lambda$) of R$\approx$6 for non-AR coated LVBFs and R$\approx$4 for AR coated LVBFs. We also present a method to decrease the effects of out-of-band high frequency transmission exhibited by metal-mesh filters by depositing a thin layer of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) on the metal-mesh of the LVBF. We have fabricated and measured the LVBFs at room temperature and cryogenic temperatures (5 K). We measure a high peak transmission of $\sim$80-90 \% for the AR coated LVBF at 5 K and demonstrate that the a-Si:H LVBF is a promising method to address out-of-band high frequency transmission.</description>

      <title>Deployed quantum link characterization via Bayesian ancilla-assisted process tomography</title>

Abstract: The development of large-scale quantum networks requires reliable quantum channels, the quality of which can be quantified by the framework of quantum process tomography. In this work, we leverage ancilla-assisted process tomography and Bayesian inference to probe a 1.6 km deployed fiber-optic link. We send one of two polarization-entangled photons from Alice in one building to Bob in another, exploiting the local qubit as an ancilla system to characterize the corresponding quantum channel. Monitoring over a 24 h period returns a steady process fidelity of 95.1(1)%, while controllable spectral filtering with passbands from 0.025-4.38 THz finds fidelities that first increase, then level off with bandwidth, suggesting both stable operation with time and minimal polarization mode dispersion. To our knowledge, these results represent the first AAPT of a deployed quantum link, revealing a valuable tool for in situ analysis of entanglement-based quantum networks.</description>

      <title>A Rydberg atom based system for benchmarking mmWave automotive radar chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04021</link>

Abstract: Rydberg atomic sensors and receivers have enabled sensitive and traceable measurements of RF fields at a wide range of frequencies. Here we demonstrate the detection of electric field amplitude in the extremely high frequency (EHF) band, at $131\ \mathrm{GHz}$. In our approach we propagate the EHF field in a beam, with control over its direction and polarization at the detector using photonic waveplates. This way, we take advantage of the highest detection sensitivity, registered for collinear propagation and circular polarization. To exhibit the potential for applications in this kind of Rydberg-atom based detection, we perform test measurements on the EHF field emitted from an on-chip radar, planned to be used in automotive industry as a vital sign detector. Our work elucidates practical applications of Rydberg-atom media as well as photonic metamaterial elements.</description>

      <title>Emulating quantum computing with optical matrix multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14178</link>

Abstract: Optical computing harnesses the speed of light to perform vector-matrix operations efficiently. It leverages interference, a cornerstone of quantum computing algorithms, to enable parallel computations. In this work, we interweave quantum computing with classical structured light by formulating the process of photonic matrix multiplication using quantum mechanical principles such as state superposition and subsequently demonstrate a well known algorithm, namely the Deutsch-Jozsa's algorithm. This is accomplished by elucidating the inherent tensor product structure within the Cartesian transverse degrees of freedom of light, which is the main resource for optical vector-matrix multiplication. To this end, we establish a discrete basis using localized Gaussian modes arranged in a lattice formation and demonstrate the operation of a Hadamard Gate. Leveraging the reprogrammable and digital capabilities of spatial light modulators, coupled with Fourier transforms by lenses, our approach proves adaptable to various algorithms. Therefore our work advances the use of structured light for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of strong coupling of a subradiant atom array to a cavity vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By considering linear scattering of cold atoms inside an undriven high-finesse optical resonator, we experimentally demonstrate effects unique to a strongly coupled vacuum field. Arranging the atoms in an incommensurate lattice, with respect to the resonator mode, the scattering can be suppressed by destructive interference: resulting in a subradiant atomic array. We show however, that strong coupling leads to a drastic modification of the excitation spectrum, as evidenced by well-resolved vacuum Rabi splitting in the intensity of the fluctuations. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant polarization rotation in the linear scattering off the subradiant array via Raman scattering induced by the strongly coupled vacuum field.</description>
