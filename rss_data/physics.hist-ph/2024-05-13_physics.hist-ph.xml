      <title>Revolutionizing Quantum Mechanics: The Birth and Evolution of the Many-Worlds Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Many-worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics has captivated physicists and philosophers alike since its inception in the mid-20th century. This paper explores the historical roots, evolution, and implications of the MWI within the context of quantum theory. Beginning with an overview of early developments in quantum mechanics and the emergence of foundational interpretations, we delve into the origins of the MWI through the groundbreaking work of physicist Hugh Everett III. Everett's doctoral thesis proposed a radical solution to the measurement problem, positing the existence of multiple branching universes to account for quantum phenomenon. We trace the evolution of the MWI, examining its refinement and elaboration by subsequent physicists such as John Wheeler. Furthermore, we discuss the MWI's impact on contemporary physics, including its connections to quantum information theory and ongoing experimental tests. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the MWI's historical development and current relevance, this paper offers insights into one of the most provocative interpretations of quantum mechanics and its implications for our understanding of the universe.</description>

      <title>Finite frequentism explains quantum probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I show that frequentism, as an explanation of probability in classical statistical mechanics, can be extended in a natural way to a decoherent quantum history space, the analogue of a classical phase space. The result is a form of finite frequentism, in which the Gibbs concept of an infinite ensemble of gases is replaced by the quantum state expressed as a superposition of a finite number of decohering microstates. It is a form of finite and actual (as opposed to hypothetical) frequentism insofar as all the microstates exist, even though they may differ macroscopically, in keeping with the decoherence-based Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>W as the Edge of a Wedge: Bell Correlations via Constrained Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work with Ken Wharton, it was proposed that Bell correlations are a special sort of selection artefact, explained by a combination of (i) collider bias and (ii) a boundary constraint on the collider variable. This requires no direct causal influence outside lightcones, and may hence offer a new way to reconcile Bell nonlocality and relativity. This piece outlines a new argument for the proposal. It explains how it is valid for a special class of ('W-shaped') Bell experiments involving delayed-choice entanglement swapping, and argues that it can be extended to the general ('V-shaped') case.</description>
