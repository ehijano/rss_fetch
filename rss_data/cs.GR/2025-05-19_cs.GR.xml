      <title>Robust Photo-Realistic Hand Gesture Generation: from Single View to Multiple View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity hand gesture generation represents a significant challenge in human-centric generation tasks. Existing methods typically employ single-view 3D MANO mesh-rendered images prior to enhancing gesture generation quality. However, the complexity of hand movements and the inherent limitations of single-view rendering make it difficult to capture complete 3D hand information, particularly when fingers are occluded. The fundamental contradiction lies in the loss of 3D topological relationships through 2D projection and the incomplete spatial coverage inherent to single-view representations. Diverging from single-view prior approaches, we propose a multi-view prior framework, named Multi-Modal UNet-based Feature Encoder (MUFEN), to guide diffusion models in learning comprehensive 3D hand information. Specifically, we extend conventional front-view rendering to include rear, left, right, top, and bottom perspectives, selecting the most information-rich view combination as training priors to address occlusion completion. This multi-view prior with a dedicated dual stream encoder significantly improves the model's understanding of complete hand features. Furthermore, we design a bounding box feature fusion module, which can fuse the gesture localization features and gesture multi-modal features to enhance the location-awareness of the MUFEN features to the gesture-related features. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.</description>

      <title>Textured mesh Quality Assessment using Geometry and Color Field Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Textured mesh quality assessment (TMQA) is critical for various 3D mesh applications. However, existing TMQA methods often struggle to provide accurate and robust evaluations. Motivated by the effectiveness of fields in representing both 3D geometry and color information, we propose a novel point-based TMQA method called field mesh quality metric (FMQM). FMQM utilizes signed distance fields and a newly proposed color field named nearest surface point color field to realize effective mesh feature description. Four features related to visual perception are extracted from the geometry and color fields: geometry similarity, geometry gradient similarity, space color distribution similarity, and space color gradient similarity. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that FMQM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) TMQA metrics. Furthermore, FMQM exhibits low computational complexity, making it a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications in 3D graphics and visualization. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/yyyykf/FMQM.</description>

      <title>Infinigen-Sim: Procedural Generation of Articulated Simulation Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Infinigen-Sim, a toolkit which enables users to create diverse and realistic articulated object procedural generators. These tools are composed of high-level utilities for use creating articulated assets in Blender, as well as an export pipeline to integrate the resulting assets into common robotics simulators. We demonstrate our system by creating procedural generators for 5 common articulated object categories. Experiments show that assets sampled from these generators are useful for movable object segmentation, training generalizable reinforcement learning policies, and sim-to-real transfer of imitation learning policies.</description>

      <title>Constrained Preferential Bayesian Optimization and Its Application in Banner Ad Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preferential Bayesian optimization (PBO) is a variant of Bayesian optimization that observes relative preferences (e.g., pairwise comparisons) instead of direct objective values, making it especially suitable for human-in-the-loop scenarios. However, real-world optimization tasks often involve inequality constraints, which existing PBO methods have not yet addressed. To fill this gap, we propose constrained preferential Bayesian optimization (CPBO), an extension of PBO that incorporates inequality constraints for the first time. Specifically, we present a novel acquisition function for this purpose. Our technical evaluation shows that our CPBO method successfully identifies optimal solutions by focusing on exploring feasible regions. As a practical application, we also present a designer-in-the-loop system for banner ad design using CPBO, where the objective is the designer's subjective preference, and the constraint ensures a target predicted click-through rate. We conducted a user study with professional ad designers, demonstrating the potential benefits of our approach in guiding creative design under real-world constraints.</description>
