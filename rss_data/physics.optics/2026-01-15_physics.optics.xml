      <title>Observation of Unidirectional s-p Orbital Topological Edge States in Driven Photonic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-periodic modulation of a static system is a powerful method for realizing robust unidirectional topological states. So far, all such realizations have been based on interactions among $s$ orbitals, without incorporating inter-orbital couplings. Here, we demonstrate higher-orbital Floquet topological insulators by introducing periodically modulated couplings between the optical $s$ and $p$ orbitals in a square lattice. The staggered phase of the $s$-$p$ couplings gives rise to a synthetic uniform $\pi$ magnetic flux per plaquette of the lattice, and periodic driving of the couplings opens a topological bandgap, characterized by the Floquet winding number. We image topological edge modes of $s$-$p$ orbitals traveling unidirectionally around a corner. Here, the topological phases are realized by a combined effect of the periodic driving and synthetic magnetic flux. Consequently, when the synthetic flux is turned off, the system becomes trivial over a range of driving parameters. Our results open a promising pathway for exploring topological phenomena by introducing the orbital degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Fourier pixels for reciprocal light control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital cameras and displays utilise picture elements (pixels) that perform a single function: detecting or emitting light intensity. To exploit the full information content of electromagnetic waves, more advanced elements are required. This has driven the development of multifunctional components, which for example, simultaneously detect and emit intensity or extract intensity and spectral information. However, no pixel exists that both senses and generates optical wavefronts with full control over amplitude, phase, and polarisation, limiting reciprocal control and feedback of sophisticated light fields. Here we present a route to such pixels by demonstrating a versatile platform of miniaturised diffractive elements based on Fourier optics. We exploit plasmonic surface waves, which propagate coherently and efficiently across metallic surfaces. When these plasmons are launched towards wavy microstructures designed with simple Fourier analysis, arbitrary and background-free optical wavefronts are generated. Conversely, incoming light can be sensed and its amplitude, phase, and polarisation fully characterised. By combining or superposing several such components, we create multifunctional 'Fourier pixels' that provide compact and accurate control over the optical field. Our approach, which could also use photonic waveguide modes, establishes a scalable, universal architecture for vectorially programmable pixels with applications in adaptive optics, holographic displays, optical communication, and quantum-information processing.</description>

      <title>Multi parameter discrimination using multiple spectral troughs in a cascaded fiber sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate monitoring of temperature, axial strain, and refractive index is critical for structural health monitoring, industrial process control, and environmental sensing. However, conventional optical fiber sensors are often limited by strong parameter cross sensitivity, poor discrimination capability, and increased system complexity when multiple sensing units are required. In this work, a compact multi-parameter optical fiber sensing platform is proposed based on a cascaded single-mode fiber, multimode fiber, and long-period fiber grating structure, combined with a wavelength-based spectral demodulation strategy. Within the cascaded configuration, multiple characteristic spectral troughs arising from distinct physical mechanisms coexist in a single transmission spectrum. Interference-induced troughs are generated by the multimode fiber section, while a resonance-induced trough is introduced by the long-period fiber grating. Although none of these troughs responds exclusively to a single parameter, each exhibits simultaneous and linearly independent responses to temperature, axial strain, and refractive index with distinct sensitivity magnitudes and trends. Consequently, each trough can be described by a unique sensitivity vector, enabling robust multi-parameter discrimination through multi-wavelength spectral demodulation.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Topological Type-II Hyperbolic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, higher-order topological phases have been extended from Euclidean lattices to non-Euclidean hyperbolic lattices. Though higher-order topological type-I hyperbolic lattices have been extensively studied, their counterpart, higher-order topological type-II hyperbolic lattices, have never been reported yet. Here, by mapping the celebrated Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model onto a type-II hyperbolic lattice, we present a theoretical exploration of the first-order topological edge states and second-order topological corner states in a type-II hyperbolic lattice. Compared with the higher-order topological type-I hyperbolic lattices, we discover two unique topological phenomena that stem from the nontrivial geometrical topology of the type-II hyperbolic lattice. First, topological edge and corner states exist on both inner and outer boundaries of the type-II hyperbolic lattice and exhibit higher degeneracy than those in the type-I hyperbolic lattice with only an outer boundary. Second, the degeneracy of type-II hyperbolic corner states can be arbitrarily tuned by changing the characteristic (or inner) radius, in contrast to its type-I counterpart, which is determined by the number of sides of the tessellated polygons. Our work explores topological states in more complex hyperbolic lattices, significantly expanding the research scope of hyperbolic topological physics.</description>

      <title>Space and space-time topologies in a type-II hyperbolic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in hyperbolic lattices have expanded the study of topological phases of matter from Euclidean to non-Euclidean spaces. However, prior work has mostly focused on spatial topological states at the single outer edge of type-I hyperbolic lattices. The dynamic transfer of hyperbolic topological states across multiple edges, as well as the emergence of spatiotemporal topological phenomena, remains largely unexplored. Here, we establish both spatial and spatiotemporal topologies in a newly discovered type-II hyperbolic lattice possessing outer and inner edges. Using electric circuits, we experimentally realize a type-II hyperbolic Chern insulator and directly observe degenerate chiral edge states of opposite chirality at its outer and inner edges. Furthermore, by coupling these counter-propagating chiral edge states, we demonstrate an anti-time-parity phase transition, enabling dynamic transfer between them in arbitrary proportions. Finally, we propose a novel paradigm for constructing a (2+1)-dimensional hyperbolic space-time crystal, which hosts an intertwined topology of spatial Chern and temporal winding numbers, resulting in a unique space-time topological string state. Our work expands the frontier of hyperbolic topological physics, paving the way for the spatiotemporal dynamic manipulation of hyperbolic topological states.</description>

      <title>A Raman-Gas Spectral Compressor for High-Energy Femtosecond Laser Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate an efficient spectral compression technique for optical laser fields. By exploiting the Raman effect of molecular gas confined in a hollow-core capillary we achieve spectral compression of millijoule-level femtosecond laser pulses, attaining a compression ratio up to 14 times with near 50% efficiency. This method also features precise and continuous tunability of the central wavelength. Furthermore, we directly extend this scheme to an ambient air medium, realizing a simple high-energy femtosecond laser spectral tuning apparatus. The developed technique has promising applications in advanced manufacturing, bio-imaging, and material spectroscopic studies.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary fractional quantization in Dirac systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillations are ubiquitous wave phenomena in physical systems ranging from electromagnetic and acoustic to gravitational waves. The behavior of finite-size systems is traditionally understood to be governed by fundamental oscillatory modes arising from bulk physics and boundary conditions. A paradigmatic example is the particle-in-a-box model introduced with the advent of quantum mechanics, in which confinement leads to discrete resonances and quantized energy levels. Such quantization underpins phenomena including semiconductor quantum dots, where electronic waves are confined in all three spatial dimensions, producing standing-wave modes analogous to the vibrational states of a guitar string. These modes are characterized by integer quantum numbers corresponding to the number of envelope oscillations fitting within the cavity. Recently, counter-intuitive modes have been observed in finite systems with Dirac dispersion, including states that do not oscillate spatially, yet a general theoretical framework for modes in such cavities has been lacking. Here, we discover the phenomenon of arbitrary fractional quantization in wave physics and show that, in finite-size boxes with linear dispersion, the quantum number need not be an integer but can take any real value, including zero. Using Bloch theory in a Dirac-cone photonic crystal with a controllable fractional number of unit cells at its boundaries, we demonstrate continuous control of the cavity-mode envelope wavenumber. We introduce a unified nomenclature for these unconventional modes and derive their corresponding wavefunctions. These counter-intuitive states in open Dirac potentials challenge conventional notions of quantization and open new avenues across wave physics.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning enabled characterization of individual ring resonators in integrated photonic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately determining the underlying physical parameters of individual elements in integrated photonics is increasingly difficult as device architectures become more complex. Inferring these parameters directly from spectral measurements of the system as a whole provides a practical alternative to traditional calibration, allowing characterization of photonic systems without relying on detailed device-specific models. Here, we introduce a supervised machine-learning strategy to learn the onsite losses and resonant frequency shifts of each individual ring in an array of coupled ring resonators from measured spectral power distributions of the whole array. The neural network infers these parameters with high accuracy across multiple experimental configurations. Our methodology provides a scalable and non-invasive method for extracting intrinsic parameters in coupled photonic platforms, paving the way for future development of automated calibration and control methods.</description>

      <title>Multimode Single-Ring Photonic Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic molecules can mimic interactions of atomic energy levels, offering new ways to manipulate cavity eigenstates. Current methods using evanescent coupling of multiple cavities face challenges in scalability, flexibility, and coupling control, especially for complex systems. Here we introduce a new method that uses a single multimode optical ring resonator to create photonic molecules. Our design uses multiple waveguide transverse modes in one resonator, providing flexibility to engineer complex interactions without typical coupling constraints. We demonstrate arbitrary inter-mode coupling through transmissive mode converters, allowing precise tuning of resonance splitting and intrinsic losses. This approach enables selective bright-dark mode pair generation and the exploration of novel photonic phenomena such as exceptional points. This multimode photonic molecule overcomes traditional limitations and offers new possibilities for integrated photonic circuits, optical processing, and studies in non-Hermitian and nonlinear photonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation (HHG) has become a standard technique for producing attosecond XUV pulses in the laboratory, yet the high flux necessary for nonlinear XUV photoionization remains accessible to only a few research groups. Here, we introduce the SYLOS Compact high-harmonic beamline at ELI ALPS, specifically designed to provide the flux required for non-linear optics in the XUV. We present a detailed characterization of the beam line demonstrating its capability to generate and utilize both intense attosecond pulse trains and isolated attosecond pulses. We further showcase the two-XUV-photon double ionization of neon (Ne) and argon (Ar), achieved in a user campaign. The results underscore the beamline's capability to support cutting-edge attosecond experiments and investigations of ultrafast electron dynamics on the attosecond scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the existence and stability of exceptional points (EPs) in finite waveguide arrays subject to single-site dissipation. We show that the EP landscape is dictated by a geometry-dependent parity effect, leading to strictly distinct spectral behaviors for arrays with even versus odd numbers of waveguides. Through analytical derivation and numerical analysis, we define the conditions under which these singularities emerge and evolve. Our findings clarify the mechanisms of symmetry breaking in finite non-Hermitian lattices, offering new guidelines for the design of robust optical structures that exploit or avoid exceptional points.</description>

      <title>A 10 Megahertz Spatial Light Modulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid and programmable shaping of light fields is central to modern microscopy, display technologies, optical communications and sensing, quantum engineering, and quantum information processing. Current wavefront shaping technologies face a fundamental dichotomy: spatial light modulators (SLMs) offer high pixel count but suffer from low refresh rates, while acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) provide moderate speed with restricted optical beam geometries. Though recent advances in photonic integrated circuits achieve fast switching, there is currently no tool that provides MHz-rate, continuous motion, and arbitrarily reconfigurable control over a set of diffraction-limited spots. Here we introduce a new class of spatial light modulator that provides both 2D pixel geometry and high speed. The device operates by encoding spatial information in frequency bins via a broadband optical phase modulator, and decoding them via a first-of-its-kind, high-resolution 2D spectrometer. The spectrometer, based on the architecture which we call the Re-Imaging Phased Array (RIPA), achieves its sensitivity through long path-lengths, enabled by intra-spectrometer re-imaging lens-guides. We demonstrate site-resolved optical pulsing with a 44(1)~ns rise time, corresponding to frame rates exceeding 10 million frames per second, as well as arbitrary, reconfigurable 2D addressing and multi-site operations, including asynchronous, independent beam motion, splitting, and recombination. Leveraging these tools opens new horizons in rapid optical manipulation of matter across science, from fast, scalable control that approaches the inertial and radiation limits of atoms in quantum processors, to dynamically programmable, microsecond-resolved illumination in microscopy and neuro-biological imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Casimir interaction in salted water contains a universal contribution of electromagnetic fluctuations that makes it of a longer range than previously thought. The universal contribution dominates non universal ones at the distances relevant for actin fibers inside the cell. We discuss universal and non-universal contributions with a model mimicking biological matter. We also show that the universal Casimir effect should have important implications at the cell scale.</description>

      <title>Displacement-Squeeze receiver for BPSK displaced squeezed vacuum states surpassing the coherent-states Helstrom bound under imperfect conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a displacement-squeeze receiver (DSR) for discriminating BPSK displaced squeezed vacuum states (S-BPSK). The receiver applies a displacement followed by a squeezing operation with the squeezing axis rotated by $\frac{\pi}{2}$, and performs photon-number-resolving detection with a MAP threshold decision. This processing effectively increases the distinguishability of the input states by elongating their distance in phase space and reducing their population overlap in Fock basis. We show that for all signal energy N, $P_\text{err}^\text{DSR} \in \left[P_\text{HB}^\text{DSS}, 2P_\text{HB}^\text{DSS}\right]$, under equal priors and ideal condition. In the low-energy regime, DSR beats the S-BPSK SQL at $N \approx 0.3$ and drops below the coherent-state BPSK (C-BPSK) Helstrom bound at $N \approx 0.4$, reaching $P_\text{err}^\text{DSR} &lt; 1\%$ near $N \approx 0.6$. Finally, we quantify performance under non-unit efficiency and dark counts, phase diffusion, and receiver thermal noise, with MAP threshold adaptation providing robustness across these nonidealities.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the Shadow: Bending Airy Beams for Radiative Near-Field Multi-User Access in Half-Space Blockage Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The move to next-generation wireless communications with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) brings the communications into the radiative near-field (RNF) region, where distance-aware focusing is feasible. However, high-frequency RNF links are highly vulnerable to blockage in indoor environments dominated by half-space obstacles (walls, corners) that create knife-edge shadows. Conventional near-field focused beams offer high gain in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios but suffer from severe energy truncation and effective-rank collapse in shadowed regions, making hardware remedies such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) impractical. We propose a beamforming strategy that exploits the auto-bending property of Airy beams to mitigate half-space blockage without additional hardware. The Airy beam is designed to ``ride'' the diffraction edge, accelerating its main lobe into the shadow to restore connectivity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a Green's function-based RNF multi-user channel model that analytically reveals singular-value collapse behind knife-edge obstacles; (ii) an Airy analog beamforming scheme that optimizes the bending trajectory to recover the effective channel rank; and (iii) an Airy null-steering method that aligns oscillatory nulls with bright-region users to suppress interference in mixed shadow/bright scenarios. Simulations show that the proposed edge-riding Airy strategy achieves an SNR improvement of over 20 dB and restores full-rank connectivity in shadowed links compared to conventional RNF focusing, virtually eliminating outage in geometric shadows and increasing multi-user spectral efficiency by approximately 35\% under typical indoor ELAA configurations. These results demonstrate robust RNF multi-user access in half-space blockage scenarios without relying on RIS.</description>

      <title>A complete fs-laser-ablation route to miniaturized single-crystal PMN-PT piezoelectric actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a novel fabrication route for miniaturized piezoelectric actuators that relies exclusively on processes based on femtosecond (fs) laser ablation. Previous work has already demonstrated that fs-lasers are uniquely suited for the fabrication of piezoelectric actuators based on PMN-PT, which are required for multiaxial strain-tuning of quantum dots (QDs) to enable, e.g. the generation of highly entangled photon pairs. Building on these foundations, the present work advances actuator performance and capabilities by introducing a local thinning strategy. This approach allows the realization of smaller devices, which in turn enables lower operating voltages, while simultaneously offering the possibility of integrating multiple quantum light sources on a single chip. The article provides a detailed description of the full fabrication chain, entirely based on fs-laser processing steps, from substrate thinning to metal layer structuring and final device definition. A particular focus is placed on the final cutting process, where the implementation of a third-harmonic ultraviolet (UV) fs-laser wavelength significantly improves edge quality and shape definition compared to the second harmonic (SH) wavelength used in previous work. The device fabricated through the combination of local thinning and UV-based cutting promises not only to enhance the efficiency of strain transfer but also to ensure the mechanical stability required for practical applications. These results establish fs-laser-based fabrication as a versatile and scalable method for next-generation piezoelectric actuators, paving the way for advanced strain-engineering approaches in semiconductor quantum optics and integrated quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Light-induced Magnetization by Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for the inverse Faraday and the inverse Cotton--Mouton effects arising from quantum geometry, characterized by the quantum metric quadrupole and the weighted quantum metric. Within a semiclassical framework based on the Boltzmann transport theory, we establish a general formalism describing light-induced magnetization in electronic systems as a second-order response to the electric field of light. Using continuum and tight-binding models, we discuss the symmetry constraints on these effects and estimate the magnitudes of the resulting magnetizations. Our results highlight a direct manifestation of quantum-geometric quantities in nonlinear magneto-optical responses and suggest a viable pathway for experimental detection.</description>

      <title>Single photon zeptosecond interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the generation of a train of attosecond XUV pulses that are in a superposition of wavefront states. Such superposition yields a high precision, self-referencing, common path XUV interferometer setup to produce pairs of spatially separated and independently controllable XUV pulses that are locked in phase and time with a temporal jitter of 3.5 zs (zs = zeptoseconds = $10^{-21}$). In our approach, we can independently control the relative phase/delay of the two optical beams with a resolution of 52 zs. Since the jitter is on the order of the Compton time scale, we explore the level of correlation between the non-local photons by comparing different spatial mode superpositions. Further, thanks to the stability of the interferometer we can retrieve the interference pattern through photon counting. Through post-selection of different particle events we can analyze one, two or more photon events. We argue that this zeptosecond level of temporal precision will open the door for new dynamical QED tests at lower intensities while photon counting experiments can also have an impact on the emerging field of quantum light in strong fields. We also discuss the potential impact on other areas, such as time-dependent QED, imaging, measurements of non-locality, and molecular quantum tomography.</description>

      <title>A practical guide to Digital Micro-mirror Devices (DMDs) for wavefront shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17496v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital micromirror devices have gained popularity in wavefront shaping, offering a high frame rate alternative to liquid crystal spatial light modulators. They are relatively inexpensive, offer high resolution, are easy to operate, and a single device can be used in a broad optical bandwidth. However, some technical drawbacks must be considered to achieve optimal performance. These issues, often undocumented by manufacturers, mostly stem from the device's original design for video projection applications. Herein, we present a guide to characterize and mitigate these effects. Our focus is on providing simple and practical solutions that can be easily incorporated into a typical wavefront shaping setup.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Exceptional Points Induced by Non-Markovian Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00617v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are central to non-Hermitian physics because of their unique properties and broad application prospects. While extensively studied in parity-time ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$)-symmetric systems and under Markovian dynamics, their exploration in broader pseudo-Hermitian settings, particularly in those involving non-Markovian environments, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate a pseudo-Hermitian system consisting of three coupled optical cavities interacting with non-Markovian environments. Compared to the Markovian baseline, we demonstrate that the emergence of non-Markovian memory effects enlarges the dimensionality of the parameter space of the system, thereby giving rise to higher-order EPs. Moreover, we observe that the pseudo-Hermitian system with an effective gain induced by coherent perfect absorption enables the higher-order EPs to be directly read out from the output spectrum. We also find that breaking the symmetry of the parameter space of the system reduces the order of the EPs. Furthermore, we note that the non-Markovian mechanism for generating higher-order EPs extends beyond pseudo-Hermitian systems to generic non-Hermitian quantum systems. Additionally, possible experimental implementations based on a superconducting circuit are also discussed. Our findings reveal how non-Markovianity enhances the sensitivity of the system and provide a theoretical insight into the experimental observation of higher-order EPs.</description>

      <title>An effective microscopic model for plasmonic sensing of malaria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Malaria remains a major health threat in low-resource regions and rapid diagnostic tests often lack the sensitivity required for early detection. To address this and help establish more sensitive testing devices, we develop a predictive microscopic model for plasmonic biosensing using metasurfaces. Specifically, we consider the detection of plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), a well-known malaria biomarker. An example metasurface is studied to showcase the effective microscopic model - it consists of a gold nanohole array (150nm film; 150nm diameter; 400nm period) and the biochemistry above it is modelled as stacks of closely packed adlayers. Using Maxwell Garnett effective medium theory we link the refractive index of the pLDH biomarker adsorbed layer on top of the metasurface to the bulk concentration of pLDH in the buffer. This effective microscopic model accounts for the combined optical properties of the biochemistry matrix, bound pLDH and the buffer medium. By simulating the sensor using the finite element method and an approximate analytical method, we show that the effective model allows one to determine the sensor response, predict binding interactions, and quantify concentration changes on the sensor surface. We then calculate the sensor sensitivity for our example metasurface and its theoretical limit of detection (LOD). The lowest LOD calculated based on the model is 0.02nM of pLDH, equivalent to 0.7ng/mL, which is a 30 times improvement over current rapid diagnostic tests. While this improvement in performance is highly promising, further work on transferring the ideal theory developed here to field-tested empirical performance will be required. The effective microscopic model we introduce is quite general and the framework developed offers a broadly applicable tool for the design and optimization of other types of highly sensitive plasmonic biosensors.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realization of All-Optical Terahertz Attoclock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The attoclock is a powerful tool for probing ultrafast electron dynamics with attosecond precision.Here, we demonstrate an all-optical terahertz (THz) attoclock that reconstructs photoionization dynamics by detecting the THz radiation emitted from Ar atoms ionized by two-color (800 nm/400 nm) laser fields. In this approach, the polarization direction of the emitted THz field reflects the direction of the photoelectron drift velocity and thus serves as a direct observable that encodes the effective ionization delay, analogous to the angular deflection of photoelectrons in conventional attoclocks. By precisely tailoring the relative phase and ellipticity of the driving fields, we observe intensity-dependent rotations of the THz polarization. These rotations, which reveal changes of the effective delay, are consistent with both conventional attoclock measurements and time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation simulations. Our experiment establishes the feasibility of the THz attoclock as a vacuum-free and contactless probe of tunneling dynamics, offering a transformative alternative for investigating condensed-matter systems where photoelectron detection is challenging.</description>

      <title>General theory of slow non-Hermitian evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems are widespread in both classical and quantum physics. The dynamics of such systems has recently become a focal point of research, showcasing surprising behaviors that include apparent violation of the adiabatic theorem and chiral topological conversion related to encircling exceptional points (EPs). These have both fundamental interest and potential practical applications. Yet the current literature features a number of apparently irreconcilable results. Here we develop a general theory for slow evolution of non-Hermitian systems and resolve these contradictions. We prove an analog of the adiabatic theorem for non-Hermitian systems and generalize it in the presence of uncontrolled environmental fluctuations (noise). The effect of noise turns out to be crucial due to inherent exponential instabilities present in non-Hermitian systems. Disproving common wisdom, the end state of the system is determined by the final Hamiltonian only, and is insensitive to other details of the evolution trajectory in parameter space. Our quantitative theory, leading to transparent physical intuition, is amenable to experimental tests. It provides efficient tools to predict the outcome of the system's evolution, avoiding the need to follow costly time-evolution simulations. Our approach may be useful for designing devices based on non-Hermitian physics and may stimulate analyses of classical and quantum non-Hermitian-Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as that of quantum Lindbladian and hybrid-Liouvillian systems.</description>

      <title>Casimir interactions between two parallel graphene sheets carrying steady-state drift currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuation-induced Casimir interactions between two parallel graphene sheets carrying steady-state drift currents. The graphene properties are modeled based on the shifted Fermi disk model to capture the non-equilibrium optical response of the system. We find that the drift current introduces a repulsive correction to the perpendicular to the layers Casimir interaction, thereby reducing the overall attractive force. Although the correction is repulsive, it does not overcome the underlying attraction between the layers. It also generates a lateral force that opposes the carrier flow direction. Both contributions are studied in terms of distance and drift velocity functionalities showing pathways for Casimir force control.</description>
