      <title>Torus theta-curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A natural approach to construct a prime theta-curve is to an add an arc to a prime knot. We study that approach for knots and arcs on a standard torus in the 3-sphere. We prove that each nontrivial torus knot union an essential arc is a prime theta-curve. By comparing the constituent knots of those theta-curves, we obtain infinitely many prime theta-curves. We then classify all theta-curves that lie on a standard torus. In particular, Kinoshita's theta-curve does not lie on a standard torus.</description>

      <title>Extending Azumaya algebras associated to arithmetic 2-bridge links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let {\Gamma} be a finitely generated group and consider the set of all characters of representations
  of {\Gamma} into SL2(C). This set, denoted by X({\Gamma}), admits an algebraic structure and is called the character
  variety of {\Gamma}. When {\Gamma} is the fundamental group of a hyperbolic 3-manifold M, X({\Gamma}) turns out to
  be a powerful tool in the study of the geometry and topology of M. Chinburg-Reid-Stover have
  borrowed tools from algebraic and arithmetic geometry to understand algebraic and number-theoretic
  properties of the canonical curves of X({\Gamma}). In this paper, we will partly generalize their results to
  certain hyperbolic link complements, and prove that the associated canonical quaternion algebra will
  not extend to an Azumaya algebra over the canonical surfaces.</description>

      <title>Classification of locally standard $T$-pseudomanifolds over topological stratified pseudomanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a locally standard $T$-pseudomanifold, a class that generalizes both complete toric varieties and locally standard $T$-manifolds. The main goal of this paper is to show that locally standard $T$-pseudomanifolds over topological stratified pseudomanifolds satisfying certain conditions are completely classified, up to (weakly) equivariant homeomorphism, by their characteristic data. This result extends the classification of quasitoric manifolds by Davis-Januszkiewicz.</description>

      <title>A 4-dimensional pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We know from previous work with Italiano and Migliorini that there exists some hyperbolic 5-manifold that fibers over the circle. Here we build one example where the monodromy is a "pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism" of the 4-dimensional fiber, in a way that is surprisingly similar to the familiar and beautiful two-dimensional picture of Nielsen and Thurston for surfaces. This fact has various consequences:
  (1) There is a compact smooth 4-manifold $M$ such that no non-trivial class in $H_2(M)$ is represented by immersed tori, and infinitely many classes are represented by smoothly embedded genus two surfaces.
  (2) There is a compact locally CAT(0) space $Y$ such that $\pi_1(Y)$ is not hyperbolic and does not contain $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$.
  The latter answers a question of Gromov, known as the Closing Flat Problem.</description>

      <title>Bowditch representations in Gromov-hyperbolic spaces : characterizations, dynamics of $\mathrm{Out}(\mathbb{F}_2)$ and recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the $BQ$-conditions, introduced by Bowditch and further developed by Tan-Wong-Zhang, for representations of the free group of rank two into isometry groups of Gromov-hyperbolic spaces. We show the existence of an explicit constant $K_\delta$, depending only on the hyperbolicity constant $\delta$ of the space, such that the hyperbolicity of the images of primitive elements together with the finiteness of the set of (conjugacy classes of) primitive elements whose images have lengths bounded by $K_\delta$ imply a linear growth of the lengths with respect to the word length on primitive elements. We give several characterizations of Bowditch representations, and the framework developed allows us to prove that they form an open domain of discontinuity in the character variety. As a corollary, we also obtain a new characterization of primitive-stable representations, introduced by Minsky. Finally, we explain how our results can be used to obtain finite certificate for the recognition of Bowditch representations.</description>

Abstract: We prove that all $1$-vertex spatial graphs with adequate diagrams have minimal crossing number, and that spatial graph diagrams obtained by replacing vertices and edges of a planar embedded graph by minimal crossing link or spatial graph diagrams have minimal crossing number. Finally, we give an example in answer to a question of Adams et al. about minimal crossing diagrams of rigid vertex graphs.</description>

      <title>On the structure of locally conformally flat orbifolds and ALE manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove several structure theorems for locally conformally flat, positive Yamabe orbifolds and nonnegative scalar curvature, ALE manifolds. These two kinds of spaces can be related by conformal blow-up and conformal compactification. For the orbifolds, we prove that such orbifolds admit a manifold cover. For the ALE manifolds, the homomorphism of the fundamental group for the ALE space induced by the embedding of the ALE end is always injective. Using these properties, several classifications of such ALE manifolds and orbifolds are given in low dimensions. As an application to the moduli space, we prove that the football orbifold $\mathbb{S}^4/\Gamma$ cannot be realized as the Gromov-Hausdorff limit. In addition, we prove the positive mass theorem of these ALE ends and give a simple proof for the optimal decay rate. Using the positive mass theorem, we can solve the orbifold Yamabe problem in the locally conformally flat case.</description>

      <title>Domination between non-Fuchsian representations and anti-de Sitter geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by work of various authors on domination between surface group representations, harmonic maps, and $3$-dimensional anti-de Sitter geometry, we study a new domination problem between non-Fuchsian representations of closed surface groups. We solve the problem for representations that admit branched harmonic immersions, and we show that, outside of this case, the problem cannot always be solved. We then show that a dominating pair gives rise to an anti-de Sitter $3$-manifold with singularities, and we construct large families of branched anti-de Sitter $3$-manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.01118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an equivariant Cerf theory for Morse functions on finite-dimensional manifolds with group actions, and adapt the technique to the infinite-dimensional setting to study the moduli space of perturbed flat $SU(n)$-connections. As a consequence, we prove the existence of perturbative $SU(n)$ Casson invariants on integer homology spheres for all $n\ge 3$, and write down an explicit formula when $n=4$. This generalizes the previous works of Boden and Herald.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.01737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between the knotting of an embedded surface in $\R^3$ and the knotting of its fold curves, formed by the singular set of projection to a plane. The first result shows that every surface, no matter how knotted, can be isotoped so that its fold curves form an unlink. A second result defines a new invariant which gives a complete obstruction to turning a fixed curve on a surface into a fold curve.</description>

      <title>Spaces of Legendrian cables and Seifert fibered links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the homotopy type of the spaces of several Legendrian knots and links with the maximal Thurston--Bennequin invariant. In particular, we give a recursive formula of the homotopy type of the space of Legendrian embeddings of sufficiently positive cables, and determine the homotopy type of the space of Legendrian embeddings of Seifert fibered links, which include all torus knots and links, in the standard contact 3-sphere, except when one of the link components is a negative torus knot. In general, we prove that the space of contact structures on the complement of a sufficiently positive Legendrian cable with the maximal Thurston-Bennequin invariant is homotopy equivalent to the space of contact structures on the complement of the underlying Legendrian knot, and prove that the space of contact structures on a Legendrian Seifert fibered space over a compact oriented surface with boundary is contractible. From this result, we find infinitely many new components of the space of Legendrian embeddings in the standard contact 3-sphere that satisfy an injective h-principle. These include the spaces of Legendrian embeddings of an algebraic link with the maximal Thurston--Bennequin invariant. In particular, the inclusion of these Legendrian embedding spaces into the corresponding formal Legendrian embedding spaces is a homotopy injection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09223v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A periodic cell complex, $K$, has a finite representation as the quotient space, $q(K)$, consisting of equivalence classes of cells identified under the translation group acting on $K$. We study how the Betti numbers and cycles of $K$ are related to those of $q(K)$, first for the case that $K$ is a graph, and then higher-dimensional cell complexes. When $K$ is a $d$-periodic graph, it is possible to define $\mathbb{Z}^d$-weights on the edges of the quotient graph and this information permits full recovery of homology generators for $K$. The situation for higher-dimensional cell complexes is more subtle and studied in detail using the Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence.</description>

      <title>Almost Hermitian structures on virtual moduli spaces of non-Abelian monopoles and applications to the topology of symplectic four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13809v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to our previous monograph arXiv:2010.15789 (to appear in AMS Memoirs), where we initiated our program to prove that the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality holds for closed, symplectic four-manifolds and, more generally, for closed, smooth four-manifolds with a Seiberg-Witten basic class. This inequality was first proved for compact, complex surfaces of general type independently by Miyaoka and Yau in 1977. Our approach uses a version of Morse theory for a natural Hamiltonian, the square of the $L^2$ norm of the coupled spinors, for the circle action on the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles over a closed four-manifold. It has the aim of proving the existence of a projectively anti-self-dual connection on a rank-two Hermitian vector bundle over a blow-up of the four-manifold, where the first Pontrjagin number of the vector bundle is negative and greater than or equal to minus the Euler characteristic of the blown-up four-manifold. Our Morse theory argument relies on positivity of virtual Morse-Bott indices for critical points of Hamiltonians for circle actions on complex analytic spaces (or real analytic spaces that, locally, are sufficiently well-approximated by complex analytic model spaces), as developed by the first author in arXiv:2206.14710. In our application to the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles, the critical points are fixed points of the circle action and thus represented by Seiberg-Witten monopoles.</description>
