      <title>Marine Microplastics and Infant Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A century of plastic usage has led to an accumulation of plastic waste in waterways and oceans. Over time, these wastes break down into particles smaller than 5 microns -- or ''microplastics'' -- which can infiltrate human biological systems. Despite decades of research into this emerging source of environmental pollution, there is a paucity of direct evidence on the health impacts of microplastics exposure at a population scale. This paper reports the first empirical link between in-utero microplastic exposure and adverse birth outcomes. Our analysis is based on a compiled dataset of 3 million births that occurred in coastal areas of 15 countries spanning four continents, which we merge with a novel remote-sensing measurements of marine microplastic concentrations. We show that in-utero exposure to microplastics, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy, leads to a significant increase in the likelihood of low birth weight. A doubling of exposure increases low birth weight hazard by 0.37 per 1,000 births, which implies over 205,000 cases per year globally can be attributed to microplastic exposure. We further show that aerosolization -- whereby microplastic particles become airborne and inhalable due to seawater evaporation -- is an important pathway for health impact, a challenge that is likely to escalate as ocean temperatures continue to rise.</description>

      <title>Drivers of Electric Vehicle Adoption in Nigeria: An Extended UTAUT Framework Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) represent a significant advancement in automotive technology, utilizing electricity as a power source instead of traditional fossil fuels, while incorporating sophisticated navigation and autopilot systems. These vehicles align with multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by offering a more environmentally sustainable alternative to internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). Despite their potential, the adoption of EVs in developing nations such as Nigeria remains constrained. This study expands the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework by incorporating key enablers, including poor infrastructure, affordability issues, and government support, within the broader category of facilitating conditions. Additionally, it examines factors such as trust, performance expectations, social influences, and network externalities to identify the primary determinants influencing Nigerian consumers' propensity to adopt EVs. Results show that the percentage increase of H6 (facilitating conditions - behavioral intentions) compared to H5 (network externalities - behavioral intentions) is approximately 32.35%, indicating that traditional drivers significantly influence individuals' willingness to purchase EVs and are particularly strong factors in adoption decisions. The paper concludes with a discussion of these findings and proposes strategies for future research to further explore the barriers and drivers of EV adoption in Nigeria.</description>

      <title>Detecting fake review buyers using network structure: Direct evidence from Amazon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online reviews significantly impact consumers' decision-making process and firms' economic outcomes and are widely seen as crucial to the success of online markets. Firms, therefore, have a strong incentive to manipulate ratings using fake reviews. This presents a problem that academic researchers have tried to solve over two decades and on which platforms expend a large amount of resources. Nevertheless, the prevalence of fake reviews is arguably higher than ever. To combat this, we collect a dataset of reviews for thousands of Amazon products and develop a general and highly accurate method for detecting fake reviews. A unique difference between previous datasets and ours is that we directly observe which sellers buy fake reviews. Thus, while prior research has trained models using lab-generated reviews or proxies for fake reviews, we are able to train a model using actual fake reviews. We show that products that buy fake reviews are highly clustered in the product-reviewer network. Therefore, features constructed from this network are highly predictive of which products buy fake reviews. We show that our network-based approach is also successful at detecting fake reviews even without ground truth data, as unsupervised clustering methods can accurately identify fake review buyers by identifying clusters of products that are closely connected in the network. While text or metadata can be manipulated to evade detection, network-based features are more costly to manipulate because these features result directly from the inherent limitations of buying reviews from online review marketplaces, making our detection approach more robust to manipulation.</description>

      <title>Predicting Company Growth by Econophysics informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting company growth is crucial for strategic adjustment, operational decision-making, risk assessment, and loan eligibility reviews. Traditional models for company growth often focus too much on theory, overlooking practical forecasting, or they rely solely on time series forecasting techniques, ignoring interpretability and the inherent mechanisms of company growth. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based prediction framework that incorporates an econophysics model for company growth. Our model captures both the intrinsic growth mechanisms of companies led by scaling laws and the fluctuations influenced by random factors and individual decisions, demonstrating superior predictive performance compared with methods that use time series techniques alone. Its advantages are more pronounced in long-range prediction tasks. By explicitly modeling the baseline growth and volatility components, our model is more interpretable.</description>
