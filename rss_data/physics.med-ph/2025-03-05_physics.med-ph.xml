      <title>Calibration of the mechanical boundary conditions for a patient-specific thoracic aorta model including the heart motion effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: we propose a procedure for calibrating 4 parameters governing the mechanical boundary conditions (BCs) of a thoracic aorta (TA) model derived from one patient with ascending aortic aneurysm. The BCs reproduce the visco-elastic structural support provided by the soft tissue and the spine and allow for the inclusion of the heart motion effect.
  Methods: we first segment the TA from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) angiography and derive the heart motion by tracking the aortic annulus from cine-MRI. A rigid-wall fluid-dynamic simulation is performed to derive the time-varying wall pressure field. We build the finite element model considering patient-specific material properties and imposing the derived pressure field and the motion at the annulus boundary. The calibration, which involves the zero-pressure state computation, is based on purely structural simulations. After obtaining the vessel boundaries from the cine-MRI sequences, an iterative procedure is performed to minimize the distance between them and the corresponding boundaries derived from the deformed structural model. A strongly-coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis is finally performed with the tuned parameters and compared to the purely structural simulation.
  Results and Conclusion: the calibration with structural simulations allows to reduce maximum and mean distances between image-derived and simulation-derived boundaries from 8.64 mm to 6.37 mm and from 2.24 mm to 1.83 mm, respectively. The maximum root mean square error between the deformed structural and FSI surface meshes is 0.19 mm. This procedure may prove crucial for increasing the model fidelity in replicating the real aortic root kinematics.</description>

      <title>Metric-Guided Conformal Bounds for Probabilistic Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern deep learning reconstruction algorithms generate impressively realistic scans from sparse inputs, but can often produce significant inaccuracies. This makes it difficult to provide statistically guaranteed claims about the true state of a subject from scans reconstructed by these algorithms. In this study, we propose a framework for computing provably valid prediction bounds on claims derived from probabilistic black-box image reconstruction algorithms. The key insights behind our framework are to represent reconstructed scans with a derived clinical metric of interest, and to calibrate bounds on the ground truth metric with conformal prediction (CP) using a prior calibration dataset. These bounds convey interpretable feedback about the subject's state, and can also be used to retrieve nearest-neighbor reconstructed scans for visual inspection. We demonstrate the utility of this framework on sparse-view computed tomography (CT) for fat mass quantification and radiotherapy planning tasks. Results show that our framework produces bounds with better semantical interpretation than conventional pixel-based bounding approaches. Furthermore, we can flag dangerous outlier reconstructions that look plausible but have statistically unlikely metric values.</description>
