      <title>GreedySnake: Accelerating SSD-Offloaded LLM Training with Efficient Scheduling and Optimizer Step Overlapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SSD-offloaded training offers a practical and promising approach to making LLM training cost-effective. Building on gradient accumulation with micro-batches, this paper introduces GreedySnake, a new SSD-offloaded training system that employs vertical scheduling, which executes all microbatches of a layer before proceeding to the next. Compared to existing systems that use horizontal scheduling (i.e., executing micro-batches sequentially), GreedySnake achieves higher training throughput with smaller batch sizes, bringing the system much closer to the ideal scenario predicted by the roofline model. To further mitigate the I/O bottleneck, GreedySnake overlaps part of the optimization step with the forward pass of the next iteration. Experimental results on A100 GPUs show that GreedySnake achieves saturated training throughput improvements over ZeRO-Infinity: 1.96x on 1 GPU and 1.93x on 4 GPUs for GPT-65B, and 2.53x on 1 GPU for GPT-175B. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/npz7yyk/GreedySnake</description>

      <title>On General Linearly Implicit Quantized State System Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a methodology to develop new numerical integration algorithms for ordinary differential equations based on state quantization, generalizing the notions of Linearly Implicit Quantized State Systems (LIQSS) methods. Using this idea, two novel sub-families of algorithms are designed that improve the performance of current LIQSS methods while preserving their properties regarding stability, global error bound and efficient event handling capabilities. The features of the new algorithms are studied in two application examples where the advantages over classic numerical integration algorithms is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Predictive Modeling of I/O Performance for Machine Learning Training Pipelines: A Data-Driven Approach to Storage Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern machine learning training is increasingly bottlenecked by data I/O rather than compute. GPUs often sit idle at below 50% utilization waiting for data. This paper presents a machine learning approach to predict I/O performance and recommend optimal storage configurations for ML training pipelines. We collected 141 observations through systematic benchmarking across different storage backends (NVMe SSD, network-attached storage, in-memory filesystems), data formats, and access patterns, covering both low-level I/O operations and full training pipelines. After evaluating seven regression models and three classification approaches, XGBoost achieved the best performance with R-squared of 0.991, predicting I/O throughput within 11.8% error on average. Feature importance analysis revealed that throughput metrics and batch size are the primary performance drivers. This data-driven approach can reduce configuration time from days of trial-and-error to minutes of predictive recommendation. The methodology is reproducible and extensible to other resource management problems in ML systems. Code and data are available at https://github.com/knkarthik01/gpu_storage_ml_project</description>
