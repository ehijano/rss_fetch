      <title>Python-Based Quantum Chemistry Calculations with GPU Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the increasing demand of quantum chemistry calculations in data-driven chemical research, the collaboration between industrial stakeholders and the quantum chemistry community has led to the development of GPU4PySCF, a GPU-accelerated Python package. This open-source project is accessible via its public GitHub repository at \url{https://github.com/pyscf/gpu4pyscf}. This paper outlines the primary features, innovations, and advantages of this package. When performing Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on modern GPU platforms, GPU4PySCF delivers 30 times speedup over a 32-core CPU node, resulting in approximately 90% cost savings for most DFT tasks. The performance advantages and productivity improvements have been found in multiple industrial applications, such as generating potential energy surfaces, analyzing molecular properties, calculating solvation free energy, identifying chemical reactions in lithium-ion batteries, and accelerating neural-network methods. To make the package easy to extend and integrate with other Python packages, it is designed with PySCF-compatible interfaces and Pythonic implementations. This design choice enhances its coordination with the Python ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Photoionization-induced reflection for benchmarking of the photoionization models in solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The choice of the most suitable analytic photoionization model in solids is a challenging task with no default solution. Here we show how the best formalism can be determined based on the waveform of the pulse reflected by a sample due to photoionized almost-free electrons in the conduction band. For a typical case of diamond, we compare three simple models and benchmark them against highly accurate first-principle TDDFT simulation, by analysing the fit between the reflected pulses in time and frequency domain. For the aims of this paper, we have developed a software package, called PIGLET, for the FDTD simulation of photoionization-governed propagation, which is now freely available for the scientific community. Furthermore, we show that due to interband contributions for very short sub-10-fs pulses a semi-classical description based on any analytical photoionization model fail to provide an adequate description.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions of correlated systems from graph neural networks with quantum embedding techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated systems represent a class of materials that are difficult to describe through traditional electronic structure methods. The computational demand to simulate the structural dynamics of such systems, with correlation effects considered, is substantial. Here, we investigate the structural dynamics of $f$- and $d$-electron correlated systems by integrating quantum embedding techniques with interatomic potentials derived from graph neural networks. For Cerium, a prototypical correlated $f$-electron system, we use Density Functional Theory with the Gutzwiller approximation to generate training data due to efficiency with which correlations effects are included for large multi-orbital systems. For Nickel Oxide, a prototypical correlated $d$-electron system, advancements in computational capabilities now permit the use of full Dynamical Mean Field Theory to obtain energies and forces. We train neural networks on this data to create a model of the potential energy surface, enabling rapid and effective exploration of structural dynamics. Utilizing these potentials, we delineate transition pathways between the $\alpha$, $\alpha'$, and $\alpha''$ phases of Cerium and predict the melting curve of Nickel Oxide. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning potentials to accelerate the study of strongly correlated systems, offering a scalable approach to explore and understand the complex physics governing these materials.</description>

      <title>A Convolutional Method for Solving Non-quasi-neutral Hybrid-PIC Model of Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hybrid model of particle-ion-fluid-electron is widely utilized in astrophysical and laser-produced plasmas due to its kinetic characteristics and remarkable computational efficiency. However, the current numerical methods for the hybrid model have limitations when it comes to simulating non-quasi-neutral plasmas. To address this issue, I proposed a novel method called Convolutional Hybrid PIC (conv-HPIC). The conv-HPIC is based on a convolution equation derived from the Poisson's equation and the generalized Ohm's law. I performed numerical simulations on the collisionless electrostatic shock to validate the effectiveness of this method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately describe and predict the behavior of non-quasi-neutral plasmas. This method can be applied to both stationary and non-stationary electrostatic issues. It avoids the need for iterative calculations, effectively suppresses numerical noise, exhibits good computational efficiency, and can be easily parallelized.</description>

      <title>Image Scanning Microscopy Reconstruction by Autocorrelation Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) stands out as one of the most widely used microscopy techniques, thanks to its three-dimensional imaging capability and its sub-diffraction spatial resolution, achieved through the closure of a pinhole in front of a single-element detector. However, the pinhole also rejects useful photons and beating the diffraction limit comes at the price of irremediably compromising the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data. Image scanning microscopy (ISM) emerged as the natural evolution of CLSM, exploiting a small array detector in place of the pinhole and the single-element detector. Each sensitive element is small enough to achieve sub-diffraction resolution through the confocal effect, but the size of the whole detector is large enough to guarantee excellent collection efficiency and SNR. However, the raw data produced by an ISM setup consists of a 4D dataset which can be seen as a set of confocal-like images. Thus, fusing the dataset into a single super-resolved image requires a dedicated reconstruction algorithm. Conventional methods are multi-image deconvolution, which requires prior knowledge of the system point spread functions (PSF), or adaptive pixel reassignment (APR), which is effective only on a limited range of experimental conditions. In this work, we describe and validate a novel concept for ISM image reconstruction based on autocorrelation inversion. We leverage unique properties of the autocorrelation to discard low-frequency components and maximize the resolution of the reconstructed image, without any assumption on the image or any knowledge of the PSF. Our results push the quality of the ISM reconstruction beyond the level provided by APR and open new perspectives for multi-dimensional image processing.</description>

      <title>Ion Correlation Induced Non-monotonic Height Change and Microphase Separation of Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling ion correlations in inhomogeneous polymers and soft matters with spatially varying ionic strength or dielectric permittivity remains a great challenge. Here, we develop a new theory which systematically incorporates electrostatic fluctuations into the self-consistent field theory for polymers. Applied to polyelectrolyte brushes, the theory predicts that ion correlations induce non-monotonic change of the brush height: collapse followed by reexpansion. The scaling analysis elucidates the competition between the repulsive osmotic pressure due to translational entropy and the attraction induced by ion correlations. We also clarify the absence of causal relationship between the brush collapse-reexpansion and the inversion of the surface electrostatic potential. Furthermore, strong ion correlations can trigger microphase separation, either in the lateral direction as pinned micelles or in the normal direction as oscillatory layers. Our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Applying an electrostatic cross-correlation to the CFTR-ATP interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an important membrane protein in vertebrates. The function of CFTR is to transport chloride ions across the cell membrane, which is known to require adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Whereas most conventional wisdom suggests that ATP interacts with CFTR purely through random collisions via diffusion, we investigate electrostatic interactions between CFTR and ATP at the mesoscale (10s of Angstroms). We use molecular dynamics to simulate CFTR-ATP interactions in cases where CFTR is bound/unbound from ATP, and we demonstrate an electrostatic potential gradient towards CFTR when ATP is unbound. We additionally compute electrostatic interactions between ATP and the solvent and membrane, which are simulated explicitly.</description>

      <title>Use of multigrids to reduce the cost of performing interpolative separable density fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present an interpolative separable density fitting (ISDF) based algorithm to calculate exact exchange in periodic mean field calculations. In the past, decomposing the two-electron integrals into tensor hypercontraction (THC) form using ISDF was the most expensive step of the entire mean field calculation. Here we show that by using a multigrid-ISDF algorithm both the memory and the CPU cost of this step can be reduced. The CPU cost is brought down from cubic scaling to quadratic scaling with a low computational prefactor which reduces the cost by almost two orders of magnitude. Thus, in the new algorithm, the cost of performing ISDF is largely negligible compared to other steps. Along with the CPU cost, the memory cost of storing the factorized two-electron integrals is also reduced by a factor of up to 35. With the current algorithm, we can perform Hartree-Fock calculations on a Diamond supercell containing more than 17,000 basis functions and more than 1,500 electrons on a single node with no disk usage. For this calculation, the cost of constructing the exchange matrix is only a factor of four slower than the cost of diagonalizing the Fock matrix. Augmenting our approach with linear scaling algorithms can further speed up the calculations.</description>

      <title>Guidelines for accurate and efficient calculations of mobilities in two-dimensional materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging two-dimensional (2D) materials bring unprecedented opportunities for electronic applications. The design of high-performance devices requires an accurate prediction of carrier mobility in 2D materials, which can be obtained using state-of-the-art $ab~initio$ calculations. However, various factors impact the computational accuracy, leading to contradictory estimations for the mobility. In this work, targeting accurate and efficient $ab~initio$ calculations, transport properties in III-V monolayers are reported using the Boltzmann transport equation, and the influences of pseudopotential, quadrupole correction, Berry connection, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on mobilities are systematically investigated. Our findings are as follows: (1) The inclusion of semi-core states in pseudopotentials is important to obtain accurate calculations. (2) The variations induced by dynamical quadrupole and Berry connection when treating long range fields can be respectively 40% and 10%. (3) The impact of SOC can reach up to 100% for materials with multi-peak bands. Importantly, although SOC notably modifies the electronic wavefunctions, it negligibly impacts the dynamical matrices and scattering potential variations. As a result, the combination of fully-relativistic electron calculation and scalar-relativistic phonon calculation can strike a good balance between accuracy and cost. This work compares computational methodologies, providing guidelines for accurate and efficient calculations of mobilities in 2D semiconductors.</description>

Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics aims at extending standard thermodynamics and non-equilibrium statistical physics to systems with sizes well below the thermodynamic limit. A rapidly evolving research field, which promises to change our understanding of the foundations of physics, while enabling the discovery of novel thermodynamic techniques and applications at the nanoscale. Thermal management turned into a major obstacle in pushing the limits of conventional digital computers, and it will represent a crucial issue also for quantum computers. The practical realization of quantum computers with superconducting loops requires working at cryogenic temperatures to eliminate thermal noise; ion-trap qubits need as well low temperatures to minimize collisional noise; in both cases, the sub-nanometric sizes also bring about thermal broadening of the quantum states. A number of thermal and thermodynamic questions therefore take center stage, such as quantum re-definitions of work and heat, thermalization and randomization of quantum states, the overlap of quantum and thermal fluctuations, and many other, even including a proper definition of temperature for the small open systems constantly out of equilibrium that are the qubits. This overview provides an introductory perspective on a selection of current trends in quantum thermodynamics and their impact on quantum computers and quantum computing, with a language accessible also to postgraduate students and researchers from different fields.</description>

      <title>Minimal Autocorrelation in Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations using Exact Fourier Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is a ubiquitous method in computational physics with applications ranging from condensed matter to lattice QCD and beyond. However, HMC simulations often suffer from long autocorrelation times, severely reducing their efficiency. In this work two of the main sources of autocorrelations are identified and eliminated. The first source is the sampling of the canonical momenta from a sub-optimal normal distribution, the second is a badly chosen trajectory length. Analytic solutions to both problems are presented and implemented in the exact Fourier acceleration (EFA) method. It completely removes autocorrelations for near-harmonic potentials and consistently yields (close-to-) optimal results for numerical simulations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Ising models as well as in lattice gauge theory, in some cases reducing the autocorrelation by multiple orders of magnitude. EFA is advantageous for and easily applicable to any HMC simulation of an action that includes a quadratic part.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a powerful method to calculate accurate energies and forces for molecular systems. In this work, we demonstrate how we can obtain accurate QMC forces for the fluxional ethanol molecule at room temperature by using either multi-determinant Jastrow-Slater wave functions in variational Monte Carlo or just a single determinant in diffusion Monte Carlo. The excellent performance of our protocols is assessed against high-level coupled cluster calculations on a diverse set of representative configurations of the system. Finally, we train machine-learning force fields on the QMC forces and compare them to models trained on coupled cluster reference data, showing that a force field based on the diffusion Monte Carlo forces with a single determinant can faithfully reproduce coupled cluster power spectra in molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Taper-based scattering formulation of the Helmholtz equation to improve the training process of Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the scattering problem of an incident wave at a junction connecting two semi-infinite waveguides, which we intend to solve using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). As with other deep learning-based approaches, PINNs are known to suffer from a spectral bias and from the hyperbolic nature of the Helmholtz equation. This makes the training process challenging, especially for higher wave numbers. We show an example where these limitations are present. In order to improve the learning capability of our model, we suggest an equivalent formulation of the Helmholtz Boundary Value Problem (BVP) that is based on splitting the total wave into a tapered continuation of the incoming wave and a remaining scattered wave. This allows the introduction of an inhomogeneity in the BVP, leveraging the information transmitted during back-propagation, thus, enhancing and accelerating the training process of our PINN model. The presented numerical illustrations are in accordance with the expected behavior, paving the way to a possible alternative approach to predicting scattering problems using PINNs.</description>

      <title>Time-Heterogeneity of the F\"orster Radius from Dipole Orientational Dynamics Explains Observed Dynamic Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a quantum mechanical phenomenon involving the non-radiative transfer of energy between coupled electric dipoles. Due to the strong dependence of FRET on the distance between the dipoles, it is frequently used as a ``molecular ruler" in biology, chemistry, and physics. This is done by placing dipolar molecules called dyes on molecules of interest. In time-resolved confocal single-molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments, the joint distribution of the FRET efficiency and the donor fluorescence lifetime can reveal underlying molecular conformational dynamics via deviation from their theoretical F\"orster relationship. This deviation is referred to as a dynamic shift. Quantifying the dynamic shift caused by the motion of the fluorescent dyes is essential to decoupling the dynamics of the studied molecules and the dyes. We develop novel Langevin models for the dye linker dynamics, including rotational dynamics, based on first physics principles and proper dye linker chemistry to match accessible volumes predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. By simulating the dyes' stochastic translational and rotational dynamics, we show that the observed dynamic shift can largely be attributed to the mutual orientational dynamics of the electric dipole moments associated with the dyes, not their accessible volume.</description>

      <title>Normalizing flows as an enhanced sampling method for atomistic supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normalizing flows can transform a simple prior probability distribution into a more complex target distribution. Here, we evaluate the ability and efficiency of generative machine learning methods to sample the Boltzmann distribution of an atomistic model for glass-forming liquids. This is a notoriously difficult task, as it amounts to ergodically exploring the complex free energy landscape of a disordered and frustrated many-body system. We optimize a normalizing flow model to successfully transform high-temperature configurations of a dense liquid into low-temperature ones, near the glass transition. We perform a detailed comparative analysis with established enhanced sampling techniques developed in the physics literature to assess and rank the performance of normalizing flows against state-of-the-art algorithms. We demonstrate that machine learning methods are very promising, showing a large speedup over conventional molecular dynamics. Normalizing flows show performances comparable to parallel tempering and population annealing, while still falling far behind the swap Monte Carlo algorithm. Our study highlights the potential of generative machine learning models in scientific computing for complex systems, but also points to some of its current limitations and the need for further improvement.</description>

      <title>Graph Convolutional Networks for Simulating Multi-phase Flow and Transport in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of multi-phase fluid dynamics in porous media is critical for many energy and environmental applications in Earth's subsurface. Data-driven surrogate modeling provides computationally inexpensive alternatives to high-fidelity numerical simulators. While the commonly used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are powerful in approximating partial differential equation solutions, it remains challenging for CNNs to handle irregular and unstructured simulation meshes. However, simulation models for Earth's subsurface often involve unstructured meshes with complex mesh geometries, which limits the application of CNNs. To address this challenge, we construct surrogate models based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to approximate the spatial-temporal solutions of multi-phase flow and transport processes in porous media. We propose a new GCN architecture suited to the hyperbolic character of the coupled PDE system, to better capture transport dynamics. Results of 2D heterogeneous test cases show that our surrogates predict the evolutions of pressure and saturation states with high accuracy, and the predicted rollouts remain stable for multiple timesteps. Moreover, the GCN-based models generalize well to irregular domain geometries and unstructured meshes that are unseen in the training dataset.</description>

      <title>Constrained Pressure-Temperature Residual (CPTR) Preconditioner Performance for Large-Scale Thermal CO2 Injection Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the performance of a novel preconditioner, designed for thermal reservoir simulation cases and recently introduced in Roy et al. (2020) and Cremon et al. (2020), on large-scale thermal CO2 injection cases. For Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) projects, injecting CO2 under supercritical conditions is typically tens of degrees colder than the reservoir temperature. Thermal effects can have a significant impact on the simulation results, but they also add many challenges for the solvers. More specifically, the usual combination of an iterative linear solver (such as GMRES) and the Constrained Pressure Residual (CPR) physics-based block-preconditioner is known to perform rather poorly or fail to converge when thermal effects play a significant role. The Constrained Pressure-Temperature Residual (CPTR) preconditioner retains the 2x2 block structure (elliptic/hyperbolic) of CPR but includes the temperature in the elliptic subsystem. The elliptic subsystem is now formed by two equations, and is dealt with by the system-solver of BoomerAMG (from the HYPRE library). Then a global smoother, ILU(0), is applied to the full system to handle the local, hyperbolic temperature fronts. We implemented CPTR in the multi-physics solver GEOS and present results on various large-scale thermal CCS simulation cases, including both Cartesian and fully unstructured meshes, up to tens of millions of degrees of freedom. The CPTR preconditioner severely reduces the number of GMRES iterations and the runtime, with cases timing out in 24h with CPR now requiring a few hours with CPTR. We present strong scaling results using hundreds of CPU cores for multiple cases, and show close to linear scaling. CPTR is also virtually insensitive to the thermal Peclet number (which compares advection and diffusion effects) and is suitable to any thermal regime.</description>

      <title>A quantitative assessment of Geant4 for predicting the yield and distribution of positron-emitting fragments in ion beam therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To compare the accuracy with which different hadronic inelastic physics models across ten Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit versions can predict positron-emitting fragments produced along the beam path during carbon and oxygen ion therapy.
  Materials and Methods: Phantoms of polyethylene, gelatin or poly(methyl methacrylate) were irradiated with monoenergetic carbon and oxygen ion beams. Post-irradiation, 4D PET images were acquired and parent $^{11}$C, $^{10}$C and $^{15}$O radionuclides contributions in each voxel were determined from the extracted time activity curves. Experiments were simulated in Geant4 Monte Carlo versions 10-11.1, with three different fragmentation models: binary ion cascade (BIC), quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) and the Liege intranuclear cascade (INCL++) - 30 combinations. Total/parent isotope positron annihilation yields were compared between simulations and experiments using normalised mean squared error and Pearson cross-correlation coefficient. Depth of maximum/distal 50\% peak position yield were also compared.
  Results: Performance varied considerably across versions and models, with no one best predicting all positron-emitting fragments. BIC in Geant4 10.2 provided the best overall agreement with experimental results in the largest number of test cases. QMD consistently provided the best estimates of both the depth of peak positron yield (10.4 and 10.6) and the distal 50\%-of-peak point (10.2), while BIC also performed well and INCL generally performed the worst across most Geant4 versions. Conclusions: Best spatial prediction of annihilation yield and positron-emitting fragment production during carbon and oxygen ion therapy was found to be 10.2.p03 with BIC or QMD. These version/model combinations are recommended for future heavy ion therapy research.</description>

      <title>Universal Machine Learning Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian for Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While density functional theory (DFT) serves as a prevalent computational approach in electronic structure calculations, its computational demands and scalability limitations persist. Recently, leveraging neural networks to parameterize the Kohn-Sham DFT Hamiltonian has emerged as a promising avenue for accelerating electronic structure computations. Despite advancements, challenges such as the necessity for computing extensive DFT training data to explore each new system and the complexity of establishing accurate ML models for multi-elemental materials still exist. Addressing these hurdles, this study introduces a universal electronic Hamiltonian model trained on Hamiltonian matrices obtained from first-principles DFT calculations of nearly all crystal structures on the Materials Project. We demonstrate its generality in predicting electronic structures across the whole periodic table, including complex multi-elemental systems, solid-state electrolytes, Moir\'e twisted bilayer heterostructure, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Moreover, we utilize the universal model to conduct high-throughput calculations of electronic structures for crystals in GeNOME datasets, identifying 3,940 crystals with direct band gaps and 5,109 crystals with flat bands. By offering a reliable efficient framework for computing electronic properties, this universal Hamiltonian model lays the groundwork for advancements in diverse fields, such as easily providing a huge data set of electronic structures and also making the materials design across the whole periodic table possible.</description>

      <title>Plasma kinetics: Discrete Boltzmann modelling and Richtmyer-Meshkov instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12356v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A discrete Boltzmann model (DBM) for plasma kinetics is proposed. The constructing of DBM mainly considers two aspects. The first is to build a physical model with sufficient physical functions before simulation. The second is to present schemes for extracting more valuable information from massive data after simulation. For the first aspect, the model is equivalent to a magnetohydrodynamic model plus a coarse-grained model for the most relevant TNE behaviors including the entropy production rate. A number of typical benchmark problems including Orszag-Tang (OT) vortex problem are used to verify the physical functions of DBM. For the second aspect, the DBM use non-conserved kinetic moments of (f-feq) to describe non-equilibrium state and behaviours of complex system. The OT vortex problem and the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) are practical applications of the second aspect. For RMI with interface inverse and re-shock process, it is found that, in the case without magnetic field, the non-organized momentum flux shows the most pronounced effects near shock front, while the non-organized energy flux shows the most pronounced behaviors near perturbed interface. The influence of magnetic field on TNE effects shows stages: before the interface inverse, the TNE strength is enhanced by reducing the interface inverse speed; while after the interface inverse, the TNE strength is significantly reduced. Both the global average TNE strength and entropy production rate contributed by non-organized energy flux can be used as physical criteria to identify whether or not the magnetic field is sufficient to prevent the interface inverse.</description>

      <title>Efficient solver of relativistic hydrodynamics with implicit Runge-Kutta method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to solve the relativistic hydrodynamic equations based on implicit Runge-Kutta methods with a locally optimized fixed-point iterative solver. For numerical demonstration, we implement our idea for ideal hydrodynamics using the one-stage Gauss-Legendre method as an implicit method. The accuracy and computational cost of our new method are compared with those of explicit ones for the (1+1)-dimensional Riemann problem, as well as the (2+1)-dimensional Gubser flow and event-by-event initial conditions for heavy-ion collisions generated by TrENTo. We demonstrate that the solver converges with only one iteration in most cases, and as a result, the implicit method requires a smaller computational cost than the explicit one at the same accuracy in these cases, while it may not converge with an unrealistically large $\Delta t$. By showing a relationship between the one-stage Gauss-Legendre method with the iterative solver and the two-step Adams-Bashforth method, we argue that our method benefits from both the stability of the former and the efficiency of the latter.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic, data-driven closure model for RANS simulations with aleatoric, model uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven, closure model for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations that incorporates aleatoric, model uncertainty. The proposed closure consists of two parts. A parametric one, which utilizes previously proposed, neural-network-based tensor basis functions dependent on the rate of strain and rotation tensor invariants. This is complemented by latent, random variables which account for aleatoric model errors. A fully Bayesian formulation is proposed, combined with a sparsity-inducing prior in order to identify regions in the problem domain where the parametric closure is insufficient and where stochastic corrections to the Reynolds stress tensor are needed. Training is performed using sparse, indirect data, such as mean velocities and pressures, in contrast to the majority of alternatives that require direct Reynolds stress data. For inference and learning, a Stochastic Variational Inference scheme is employed, which is based on Monte Carlo estimates of the pertinent objective in conjunction with the reparametrization trick. This necessitates derivatives of the output of the RANS solver, for which we developed an adjoint-based formulation. In this manner, the parametric sensitivities from the differentiable solver can be combined with the built-in, automatic differentiation capability of the neural network library in order to enable an end-to-end differentiable framework. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed model to produce accurate, probabilistic, predictive estimates for all flow quantities, even in regions where model errors are present, on a separated flow in the backward-facing step benchmark problem.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Spin Hall Ratio in Two-Dimensional Semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conversion efficiency from charge current to spin current via spin Hall effect is evaluated by the spin Hall ratio (SHR). Through state-of-the-art $ab~initio$ calculations involving both charge conductivity and spin Hall conductivity, we report the SHRs of the III-V monolayer family, revealing an ultrahigh ratio of 0.58 in the hole-doped GaAs monolayer. In order to find more promising 2D materials, a descriptor for high SHR is proposed and applied to a high-throughput database, which provides the fully-relativistic band structures and Wannier Hamiltonians of 216 exfoliable monolayer semiconductors and has been released to the community. Among potential candidates for high SHR, the MXene monolayer Sc$_2$CCl$_2$ is identified with the proposed descriptor and confirmed by computation, demonstrating the descriptor validity for high SHR materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Electron beams traversing spherical nanoparticles: analytic and numerical treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analytic, Mie theory-based solution for the energy-loss and the photon-emission probabilities in the interaction of spherical nanoparticles with electrons passing nearby and through them, in both cathodoluminescence and electron energy-loss spectroscopies. In particular, we focus on the case of penetrating electron trajectories, for which the complete fully electrodynamic and relativistic formalism has not been reported as yet. We exhibit the efficiency of this method in describing collective excitations in matter through calculations for a dispersive and lossy system, namely a sphere described by a Drude permittivity. Subsequently, we use the analytic solution to corroborate the implementation of electron-beam sources in a state-of-the-art numerical method for problems in electrodynamics, the discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method. We show that the two approaches produce spectra in good mutual agreement, and demonstrate the versatility of DGTD via simulations of spherical nanoparticles characterized by surface roughness. The possibility of simultaneously employing both kinds of calculations (analytic and numerical) facilitates a better understanding of the rich optical response of nanophotonic architectures excited by fast electron beams.</description>

      <title>Geometry-enhanced Pre-training on Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enables molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with ab initio accuracy and has been applied to various fields of physical science. However, the performance and transferability of MLIPs are limited by insufficient labeled training data, which require expensive ab initio calculations to obtain the labels, especially for complex molecular systems. To address this challenge, we design a novel geometric structure learning paradigm that consists of two stages. We first generate a large quantity of 3D configurations of target molecular system with classical molecular dynamics simulations. Then, we propose geometry-enhanced self-supervised learning consisting of masking, denoising, and contrastive learning to better capture the topology and 3D geometric information from the unlabeled 3D configurations. We evaluate our method on various benchmarks ranging from small molecule datasets to complex periodic molecular systems with more types of elements. The experimental results show that the proposed pre-training method can greatly enhance the accuracy of MLIPs with few extra computational costs and works well with different invariant or equivariant graph neural network architectures. Our method improves the generalization capability of MLIPs and helps to realize accurate MD simulations for complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic density functional theory combined with Langevin dynamics for warm dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study overviews and extends a recently developed stochastic finite-temperature Kohn-Sham density functional theory to study warm dense matter using Langevin dynamics, specifically under periodic boundary conditions. The method's algorithmic complexity exhibits nearly linear scaling with system size and is inversely proportional to the temperature. Additionally, a novel linear-scaling stochastic approach is introduced to assess the Kubo-Greenwood conductivity, demonstrating exceptional stability for DC conductivity. Utilizing the developed tools, we investigate the equation of state, radial distribution, and electronic conductivity of Hydrogen at a temperature of 30,000K. As for the radial distribution functions, we reveal a transition of Hydrogen from gas-like to liquid-like behavior as its density exceeds $4 g/cm^3$. As for the electronic conductivity as a function of the density, we identified a remarkable isosbestic point at frequencies around 7eV, which may be an additional signature of a gas-liquid transition in Hydrogen at 30,000K.</description>
