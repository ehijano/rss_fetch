      <title>Anomalous lepton acceleration in the radiation reaction dominated reflection regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic electrons colliding with intense counterpropagating laser pulses are expected to lose energy through radiation reaction. However, we reveal a counterintuitive regime where reflected leptons (including incident electrons, generated electrons, and positrons) gain significant energies when a relatively loosely focused ultraintense laser interacts with counterpropagating electrons. Because of strong radiation reaction, these particles can be halted and reflected near the laser peak. The subsequent asymmetric laser field then accelerates the reflected leptons to energies far exceeding their initial values. Using three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate the generation and acceleration of quasimonoenergetic positrons to multi-GeV energies with a high number conversion efficiency employing 10~PW-class lasers. These findings not only provide a single-stage solution for positron creation and acceleration, but also offer a promising alternative explanation for the origin of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays as particularly those associated with intense fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Universal relations between parallel and perpendicular spectral power law exponents in non-axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following a general heuristic approach, algebraic constraints are established between the parallel and perpendicular power-law exponents of non-axisymmetric, highly aligned magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, both with and without strong imbalance between the Els\"asser variables. Such relations are universal both for the regimes of weak and strong turbulence and are useful to predict the corresponding turbulent power spectra. For scale-dependent alignment, a Boldyrev-type $k^{-3/2}$ perpendicular spectrum emerges transverse to the direction of alignment whereas a $k^{-5/3}$ spectrum is obtained for the same if the alignment becomes scale-independent. However, regardless of the nature of alignment, our analysis consistently yields a $k_{\parallel}^{-2}$ spectrum - commonly observed in both numerical simulations and in-situ data of solar wind. In appropriate limit, previously obtained algebraic relations and power spectra for axisymmetric MHD turbulence (Galtier, Pouquet and Mangeney, Physics of Plasmas, 2005) are successfully recovered. Finally, more realistic relations capturing weak Alfv\'enic turbulence (with constant $k_{\parallel}$) and the transition to strong turbulence are derived along with their corresponding power spectra.</description>

      <title>Energy partitioning between thermal and non-thermal electrons and ions in magnetotail reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is an explosive energy release event. It plays an important role in accelerating particles to high non-thermal energies. These particles often exhibit energy spectra characterized by a power-law distribution. However, the partitioning of energy between thermal and non-thermal components, and between ions and electrons, remains unclear. This study provides estimates of energy partition based on a statistical analysis of magnetic reconnection events in Earth's magnetotail using data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. Ions are up to ten times more energetic than electrons but have softer spectra. We found for both ions and electrons that, as the average energy of particles (temperature) increases, their energy spectra become \textit{softer} (steeper) and thus, the fraction of energy carried by the non-thermal components decreases. These results challenge existing theories of particle acceleration through magnetotail reconnection.</description>
