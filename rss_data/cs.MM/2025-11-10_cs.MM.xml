      <title>Automatizaci\'on de Informes Geot\'ecnicos para Macizos Rocosos con IA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geotechnical reports are crucial for assessing the stability of rock formations and ensuring safety in modern engineering. Traditionally, these reports are prepared manually based on field observations using compasses, magnifying glasses, and notebooks. This method is slow, prone to errors, and subjective in its interpretations. To overcome these limitations, the use of artificial intelligence techniques is proposed for the automatic generation of reports through the processing of images and field data. The methodology was based on the collection of photographs of rock outcrops and manual samples with their respective descriptions, as well as on the reports prepared during the Geotechnical Studies course. These resources were used to define the report outline, prompt engineering, and validate the responses of a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The iterative refinement of prompts until structured and specific instructions were obtained for each section of the report proved to be an effective alternative to the costly process of fine-tuning the MLLM. The system evaluation establishes values of 0.455 and 0.653 for the BLEU and ROUGE-L metrics, respectively, suggesting that automatic descriptions are comparable to those made by experts. This tool, accessible via the web, with an intuitive interface and the ability to export to standardized formats, represents an innovation and an important contribution for professionals and students of field geology.</description>

      <title>EMO100DB: An Open Dataset of Improvised Songs with Emotion Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce Emo100DB: a dataset consisting of improvised songs that were recorded and transcribed with emotion data based on Russell's circumplex model of emotion. The dataset was developed by collecting improvised songs that consist of melody, lyrics, and an instrumental accompaniment played, sung, and recorded by 20 young adults. Before recording each song, the participants were asked to report their emotional state, with the axes representing arousal and valence based on Russell's circumplex model of emotions. The dataset is organized into four emotion quadrants, and it includes the lyrics text and MIDI file of the melody extracted from the participant recordings, along with the original audio in WAV format. By providing an integrated composition of data and analysis, this study aims to offer a comprehensive dataset that allows for a diverse exploration of the relationship between music and emotion.</description>

      <title>GSE: Evaluating Sticker Visual Semantic Similarity via a General Sticker Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stickers have become a popular form of visual communication, yet understanding their semantic relationships remains challenging due to their highly diverse and symbolic content. In this work, we formally {define the Sticker Semantic Similarity task} and introduce {Triple-S}, the first benchmark for this task, consisting of 905 human-annotated positive and negative sticker pairs. Through extensive evaluation, we show that existing pretrained vision and multimodal models struggle to capture nuanced sticker semantics. To address this, we propose the {General Sticker Encoder (GSE)}, a lightweight and versatile model that learns robust sticker embeddings using both Triple-S and additional datasets. GSE achieves superior performance on unseen stickers, and demonstrates strong results on downstream tasks such as emotion classification and sticker-to-sticker retrieval. By releasing both Triple-S and GSE, we provide standardized evaluation tools and robust embeddings, enabling future research in sticker understanding, retrieval, and multimodal content generation. The Triple-S benchmark and GSE have been publicly released and are available here.</description>

      <title>Splatography: Sparse multi-view dynamic Gaussian Splatting for filmmaking challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deformable Gaussian Splatting (GS) accomplishes photorealistic dynamic 3-D reconstruction from dense multi-view video (MVV) by learning to deform a canonical GS representation. However, in filmmaking, tight budgets can result in sparse camera configurations, which limits state-of-the-art (SotA) methods when capturing complex dynamic features. To address this issue, we introduce an approach that splits the canonical Gaussians and deformation field into foreground and background components using a sparse set of masks for frames at t=0. Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions during canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different parameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking practices. The foreground stage contains diverse dynamic features so changes in color, position and rotation are learned. While, the background containing film-crew and equipment, is typically dimmer and less dynamic so only changes in point position are learned. Experiments on 3-D and 2.5-D entertainment datasets show that our method produces SotA qualitative and quantitative results; up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3-D scenes. Unlike the SotA and without the need for dense mask supervision, our method also produces segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures. Code and video comparisons are available online: https://interims-git.github.io/</description>

      <title>On the Brittleness of CLIP Text Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal co-embedding models, especially CLIP, have advanced the state of the art in zero-shot classification and multimedia information retrieval in recent years by aligning images and text in a shared representation space. However, such modals trained on a contrastive alignment can lack stability towards small input perturbations. Especially when dealing with manually expressed queries, minor variations in the query can cause large differences in the ranking of the best-matching results. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of the effect of multiple classes of non-semantic query perturbations in an multimedia information retrieval scenario. We evaluate a diverse set of lexical, syntactic, and semantic perturbations across multiple CLIP variants using the TRECVID Ad-Hoc Video Search queries and the V3C1 video collection. Across models, we find that syntactic and semantic perturbations drive the largest instabilities, while brittleness is concentrated in trivial surface edits such as punctuation and case. Our results highlight robustness as a critical dimension for evaluating vision-language models beyond benchmark accuracy.</description>

      <title>Preserving Speaker Information in Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation with Non-Autoregressive Generation and Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) refers to the conversion of speech in one language into semantically equivalent speech in another language, facilitating communication between speakers of different languages. Speech-to-Discrete Unit Translation (S2UT), a mainstream approach for end-to-end S2ST, addresses challenges such as error propagation across modules and slow inference speed often encountered in traditional cascade systems. However, as discrete units primarily capture content information, conventional S2UT methods fail to retain speaker-specific characteristics from the source. Our previous work, SC-S2UT, introduced a speaker adapter and a unit-to-mel structure, enabling the preservation of speaker information and non-autoregressive speech generation. Building on this foundation, this study proposes a self-supervised pretraining method to enrich the information extracted by both the speaker adapter and the unit-to-mel structure. Additionally, we investigate different feature fusion strategies to further improve the integration of speaker and content features. Experiments conducted on the CVSS-T dataset for ES-EN and FR-EN tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a BLEU score improvement of 1.14 compared to SC-S2UT, along with significant enhancements in MOS and speaker similarity. Furthermore, our approach achieves translation quality comparable to traditional S2UT, with only a minimal increase of 0.04s per utterance in inference time, while maintaining high speaker similarity. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Holistic Evaluation of Multimodal LLMs on Spatial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, the very capability that anchors artificial general intelligence in the physical world. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models (GPT, Gemini, Grok, Seed, Qwen, and Intern) stand on the path toward spatial intelligence. We thus propose EASI for holistic Evaluation of multimodAl LLMs on Spatial Intelligence. EASI conceptualizes a comprehensive taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and a standardized protocol for the fair evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models. In this report, we conduct the study across eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding ten billion total tokens. Our empirical study then reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in spatial intelligence (SI), yet (2) still falls short of human performance significantly across a broad spectrum of SI-tasks. Moreover, we (3) show that SI-tasks expose greater model capability deficiency than non-SI tasks, to the extent that (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult ones. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans, yet fail even the most advanced multimodal models.</description>

      <title>Med-Banana-50K: A Cross-modality Large-Scale Dataset for Text-guided Medical Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical image editing has emerged as a pivotal technology with broad applications in data augmentation, model interpretability, medical education, and treatment simulation. However, the lack of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets tailored for medical contexts with strict anatomical and clinical constraints has significantly hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce Med-Banana-50K, a comprehensive dataset of over 50k medically curated image edits spanning chest X-ray, brain MRI, and fundus photography across 23 diseases. Each sample supports bidirectional lesion editing (addition and removal) and is constructed using Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image based on real clinical images. A key differentiator of our dataset is the medically grounded quality control protocol: we employ an LLM-as-Judge evaluation framework with criteria such as instruction compliance, structural plausibility, image realism, and fidelity preservation, alongside iterative refinement over up to five rounds. Additionally, Med-Banana-50K includes around 37,000 failed editing attempts with full evaluation logs to support preference learning and alignment research. By offering a large-scale, medically rigorous, and fully documented resource, Med-Banana-50K establishes a critical foundation for developing and evaluating reliable medical image editing systems. Our dataset and code are publicly available. [https://github.com/richardChenzhihui/med-banana-50k].</description>
