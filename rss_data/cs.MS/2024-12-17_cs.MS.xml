      <title>Monte Carlo Analysis of Boid Simulations with Obstacles: A Physics-Based Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boids, developed by Craig W. Reynolds in 1986, is one of the earliest emergent models where the global pattern emerges from the interaction between many individuals within the local scale. In the original model, Boids follow three rules: separation, alignment, and cohesion; which allow them to move around and create a flock without intention in the empty environment. In the real world, however, the Boids' movement also faces obstacles preventing the flock's direction. In this project, I propose two new simple rules of the Boids model to represent the more realistic movement in nature and analyze the model from the physics perspective using the Monte Carlo method. From those results, the physics metrics related to the forming of the flocking phenomenon show that it is reasonable to explain why birds or fishes prefer to move in a flock, rather than sole movement.</description>

      <title>EDOLAB: An Open-Source Platform for Education and Experimentation with Evolutionary Dynamic Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world optimization problems exhibit dynamic characteristics, posing significant challenges for traditional optimization techniques. Evolutionary Dynamic Optimization Algorithms (EDOAs) are designed to address these challenges effectively. However, in existing literature, the reported results for a given EDOA can vary significantly. This inconsistency often arises because the source codes for many EDOAs, which are typically complex, have not been made publicly available, leading to error-prone re-implementations. To support researchers in conducting experiments and comparing their algorithms with various EDOAs, we have developed an open-source MATLAB platform called the Evolutionary Dynamic Optimization LABoratory (EDOLAB). This platform not only facilitates research but also includes an educational module designed for instructional purposes. The education module allows users to observe: a) a 2-dimensional problem space and its morphological changes following each environmental change, b) the behaviors of individuals over time, and c) how the EDOA responds to environmental changes and tracks the moving optimum. The current version of EDOLAB features 25 EDOAs and four fully parametric benchmark generators. The MATLAB source code for EDOLAB is publicly available and can be accessed from [https://github.com/Danial-Yazdani/EDOLAB-MATLAB].</description>
