      <title>Quantum droplets in two-dimensional Bose mixtures at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of quantum droplets at finite temperature in attractive Bose mixtures subject to a strong transverse harmonic confinement. By means of exact path-integral Monte Carlo methods we determine the equilibrium density of the gas and the liquid as well as the pressure vs. volume dependence along isothermal curves. Results for the equation of state and for the gas-liquid coexistence region in quasi-2D configurations are compared with calculations in strictly two dimensions, finding excellent agreement. Within the pure 2D model we explore the relevance of the quantum scale anomaly and we determine the critical interaction strength for the occurrence of the first-order gas to liquid transition. Furthermore, we find that the superfluid response develops suddenly, following the density jump from the gas to the liquid state.</description>

      <title>Supersolidity in ultra-cold dipolar gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can a gas behave like a crystal? Supersolidity is an intriguing and challenging state of matter which combines key features of superfluids and crystals. Predicted a long time ago, its experimental realization has been recently achieved in Bose-Einstein condensed (BEC) atomic gases inside optical resonators, spin-orbit coupled BEC's and atomic gases interacting with long range dipolar forces. The activity on dipolar gases has been particularly vibrant in the last few years. This perspective article summarizes the main experimental and theoretical achievements concerning supersolidity in the field of dipolar gases, like the observation of the density modulations caused by the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance, the effects of coherence and the occurrence of novel Goldstone modes. A series of important issues for the future experimental and theoretical research are outlined including, among others, the possible realization of quantized vortices inside these novel crystal structure, the role of dimensionality, the characterisation of the crystal properties and the nature of the phase transitions.
  At the end a brief overview on some other (mainly cold atomic) platforms, where supersolidity has been observed or where supersolidty is expected to emerge is provided.</description>

      <title>On the quantum origin of limit cycles, fixed points, and critical slowing down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the most iconic features of classical dissipative dynamics are persistent limit-cycle oscillations and critical slowing down at the onset of such oscillations, where the system relaxes purely algebraically in time. On the other hand, quantum systems subject to generic Markovian dissipation decohere exponentially in time, approaching a unique steady state. Here we show how coherent limit-cycle oscillations and algebraic decay can emerge in a quantum system governed by a Markovian master equation as one approaches the classical limit, illustrating general mechanisms using a single-spin model and a two-site lossy Bose-Hubbard model. In particular, we demonstrate that the fingerprint of a limit cycle is a slow-decaying branch with vanishing decoherence rates in the Liouville spectrum, while a power-law decay is realized by a spectral collapse at the bifurcation point. We also show how these are distinct from the case of a classical fixed point, for which the quantum spectrum is gapped and can be generated from the linearized classical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Laser cooling of barium monofluoride molecules using synthesized optical spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate laser cooling of barium monofluoride (138BaF) molecules. We use serrodynes to synthesize time-sequenced optical spectra that can be precisely tailored to the hyperfine structure of this heaviest non-radioactive alkaline earth monofluoride. By optimizing these optical spectra, we realize strong Sisyphus cooling forces that efficiently collimate a molecular beam. Our technique is an important step towards using intense beams of barium monofluoride for precision measurement applications, and will be useful for cooling other molecular species with complex level structure.</description>

      <title>Probing Goldstino excitation through the tunneling transport in a Bose-Fermi mixture with explicitly broken supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the tunneling transport in a repulsively interacting ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture. A two-terminal model is applied to such a mixture and the supersymmetric-like tunneling current through the junction can be induced by the bias of fermion chemical potential between two reservoirs. The Goldstino, which is the Nambu-Goldstone fermionic mode associated with the spontaneous sypersymmetry breaking and appears as a gapped mode in the presence of the explicit supersymmetry breaking in existing Bose-Fermi mixtures, is found to contribute to the tunneling transport as a supercharge exchanging process. Our study provides a potential way to detect the Goldstino transport in cold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Rotational-state dependence of interactions between polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05958v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-range electrostatic interactions between molecules depend strongly on their relative orientation, which manifests as a rotational state dependence. Interactions between molecules in the same rotational quantum state are well-known attractive rotational van der Waals interactions. Interactions in rotational states that differ by one quantum show resonant dipole-dipole interactions. We show that where molecules are in rotational states that differ by more than one quantum, they exhibit repulsive van der Waals interactions. At temperatures below a millikelvin, this effect can reduce collisional loss by multiple orders of magnitude. These repulsive interactions lead to applications in quantum simulation and impurity physics with ultracold polar molecules.</description>

      <title>Scheme for Deterministic Loading of Laser-Cooled Molecules into Optical Tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06028v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to repeatedly load laser-cooled molecules into optical tweezers, and transfer them to storage states that are rotationally excited by two additional quanta. Collisional loss of molecules in these storage states is suppressed, and a dipolar blockade prevents the accumulation of more than one molecule. Applying three cycles loads tweezers with single molecules at an 80% success rate, limited by residual collisional loss. This improved loading efficiency reduces the time needed for rearrangement of tweezer arrays, which would otherwise limit the scalability of neutral molecule quantum computers.</description>
