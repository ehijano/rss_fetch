      <title>Contact Forces in Microgel Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25583v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within a model where micrometer-size soft colloidal particles are viewed as liquid drops, we theoretically study the contact interaction between them. We compute the exact deformation energy across a broad range of indentations and for various model parameters, and we show that it can be reproduced using truncated superball and spheropolyhedral variational shapes in the attractive and the repulsive regime, respectively. At large surface tensions representative of microgels, this energy is pairwise additive well beyond small indentations and can be approximated by a power-law dependence on indentation with an exponent around 2.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic interactions destroy motility-induced phase separation in active suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motility-Induced Phase Separation (MIPS) is a distinctive phenomenon in active matter that arises from its inherent non-equilibrium nature. Despite recent progress in understanding MIPS in dry active systems, it has been debated whether MIPS can be observed in wet systems in which fluid-mediated hydrodynamic interactions (HI) are present. We use theory and large-scale {\it Active Fast Stokesian Dynamics} simulations of the so-called squirmer model to show that collision-induced pusher force dipoles, which are present even for the simplest neutral squirmers (stealth swimmers), destroy MIPS when HI are included. Both rotational and translational HI independently suppress phase separation: rotation by shortening a swimmer's persistence length (and thus reducing the swim pressure), translation by a confinement-scale advective fluid flow. We further clarify that collisional dipoles between swimmers and boundaries can generate attractive flows that promote particle aggregation observed in some previous simulations and experiments. Finally, we show how to recover MIPS in fluidic environments by tuning the magnitude of the HI through brush-like surface coatings on the active particles.</description>

      <title>Rotational migration in human pancreatic ductal organoids depends on actin and myosin activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotational migration is one specific form of collective cell migration when epithelial cells are confined in a spherical geometry, such as in the epithelial acini. This tissue-level rotation motion is crucial for the morphogenesis of multiple epithelial systems. Here, we introduce a new primary human model for the study of rotational migration, pancreatic ductal organoids. Live imaging revealed the persistent rotation of the organoids over time. By tracking the nuclei, the three-dimensional trajectory of the cellular movement was reconstructed and the velocity of the rotation was quantified. The presence of focal adhesion clusters and prominent actin stress fibers were observed at the basal side of the organoids, suggesting the interactions between the cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix. Finally, our inhibition study showed the dependence of pancreatic ductal organoid rotational migration on myosin activity, actin polymerization, and actin branching. We hope that this model will enable future studies with human primary cells, which are more faithful to normal epithelial cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model biomembrane systems play a crucial role in advancing biomedical research by providing simplified yet effective platforms for exploring complex biological mechanisms. These systems span a wide range of scales, from single-molecule-thick lipid monolayers to micron-sized giant unilamellar vesicles. Their efficacy and applicability largely depend on selecting an optimal model and an appropriate synthesis process. This chapter offers a comprehensive description of conventional synthesis techniques, highlighting their limitations across various model membrane systems. Additionally, it provides an overview of biophysical studies on biomimetic membranes and explores key biological applications, including drug delivery, membrane-protein interactions, and biosensing.</description>

      <title>Quaking in Soft Granular Particles with Speed-dependent Friction: Effect of Inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our previous numerical simulation [C.-E. Tsai et al., Physical Review Research 6, 023065 (2024)] has shown that, for soft granular particles under quasistatic shearing, incorporating a speed-dependent friction is a necessary condition for reproducing the rate-dependent stick-slip fluctuations that have been found in laboratory experiments [J.-C. Tsai et al., Physical Review Letters 126, 128001 (2021)]. As a continuation, here we employ the simulation at a wide range of driving speeds to examine how grain inertia could also play a role in the quaking dynamics. We identify the critical volume fraction $\phi_{\text{c}}$ below which the system exhibits inertial flow as opposed to quasistatic flow. The quaking is found to occur only within the intermediate range of the characteristic speed ($V_{\text{c}}$, beyond which the inter-particle friction declines) and at volume fractions above $\phi_{\text{c}}$. We conclude our findings by presenting state diagrams which show the progressive narrowing of the quaking regime as the driving speed increases and the disappearance of quaking at an extremely high shear rate.</description>

      <title>Self-organized adaptive branching in frangible matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft and frangible materials that remodel under flow can give rise to branched patterns shaped by material properties, boundary conditions, and the time scales of forcing. We present a general theoretical framework for emergent branching in these frangible (or threshold) materials that switch abruptly from resisting flow to permitting flow once local stresses exceed a threshold, relevant for examples as varied as dielectric breakdown of insulators and the erosion of soft materials. Simulations in 2D and 3D show that branching is adaptive and tunable via boundary conditions and domain geometry, offering a foundation for self-organized engineering of functional transport architectures.</description>

      <title>Tracer diffusion coefficients in a sheared granular gas. Exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26115v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusion of tracer particles immersed in a granular gas under uniform shear flow (USF) is analyzed within the framework of the inelastic Boltzmann equation. Two different but complementary approaches are followed to achieve exact results. First, we maintain the structure of the Boltzmann collision operator but consider inelastic Maxwell models (IMM). Using IMM allows us to compute the collisional moments of the Boltzmann operator without knowing the velocity distribution functions of the granular binary mixture explicitly. Second, we consider a kinetic model of the Boltzmann equation for inelastic hard spheres (IHS). This kinetic model is based on the equivalence between a gas of elastic hard spheres subjected to a drag force proportional to the particle velocity and a gas of IHS. We solve the Boltzmann--Lorentz kinetic equation for tracer particles using a generalized Chapman--Enskog--like expansion around the shear flow distribution. This reference distribution retains all hydrodynamic orders in the shear rate. The mass flux is obtained to first order in the deviations of the concentration, pressure, and temperature from their values in the reference state. Due to the velocity space anisotropy induced by the shear flow, the mass flux is expressed in terms of tensorial quantities rather than the conventional scalar diffusion coefficients. The exact results derived here are compared with those previously obtained for IHS by using different approximations [JSTAT P02012 (2007)]. The comparison generally shows reasonable quantitative agreement, especially for IMM results. Finally, we study segregation by thermal diffusion as an application of the theory. The phase diagrams illustrating segregation are shown and compared with IHS results, demonstrating qualitative agreement.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Path Integral for the Active Brownian Particle in a Harmonic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we develop and apply a path integral formulation for the microscopic degrees of freedom obeying stochastic differential equations to an active Brownian particle (ABP) trapped in a harmonic potential. The formalism allows to derive exact analytic expressions for the time-dependent moments, like the mean position and the mean square displacement, including full dependence on initial conditions. In addition, the probability distribution of the particle's position can be evaluated systematically as a series expansion in the propulsion speed. Compared to previous methods relying on eigenfunction expansions of the equivalent Fokker-Planck equation, our method is easier to generalize to more complex situations: it does not rely on eigenfunctions but on a reference state that can be solved analytically, which in our case is the passive Brownian particle in a harmonic potential. We exemplify this versatility by also briefly treating an ABP with an active torque (Brownian circle swimmer, BCS) in a harmonic potential.</description>

      <title>Windmilling clusters of active quadrupoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active matter has thrived in recent years, driven both by the insight that it underlies fundamental processes in nature, and by its vast potential for applications. This allows for innovation both inspired by experimental observations, and by construction of novel systems with desired properties. In this paper, we develop a novel system in the search for a new kind of pattern formation: microstructural motifs with orthogonal alignment. Taking a simple active Brownian particle (ABP) model applied to dumbbell-shaped particles, we add a quadrupolar interaction by positioning two antiparallel magnetic dipolar moments on each particle. We find that the phase behavior is determined by the competition between active motion and the orthogonal alignment favored by quadrupolar attraction. By varying these quantities, we are able to tune both the internal structure of the aggregates, and find a surprising stability of triangular aggregates, to the point of clusters of size $N=3$ being strongly overrepresented. Although none of the component particles are chiral, the resulting structures spin in a random, fixed direction due to combination of the polarity of the active motion. This results in an ensemble of windmilling (randomly spinning in a circular motion) aggregates with windmill-like shape (due to the three- or four core component dumbbells). Ultimately, this simple model shows an interesting range of microstructural motifs, with great potential for experimental implementations.</description>

      <title>Structural and Compositional Complexities of Hierarchical Self-Assembly: a Hypergraph Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable self-assembly enables the construction of complex molecular, supramolecular, and crystalline architectures from well-designed building blocks. Here we introduce a hypergraph-based framework, termed Blocks \&amp; Bonds (B\&amp;B), that extends classical chemical graph theory to encode directed multi-colored interactions, internal symmetries of building blocs, and hierarchical organization. Within this framework, we develop a universal script, Structure Code, for encoding complex hypergraph organization. In the spirit of Kolmogorov's approach, we define Structural Complexity as the minimal information required to encode a self-assembled structure. It is complemented by Compositional Complexity, capturing the diversity of building blocks. The two measures are related through Complexity Inequality, stating that structural complexity cannot exceed compositional complexity for programmable assembly, and identify cases where violations signal emergent complexity. Applications to molecular systems (ethylene glycol, glucose) and programmable DNA-origami lattices demonstrate how B\&amp;B hypergraphs and the structure code naturally capture modularity, stereochemistry, and crystallographic order while enabling significant compression of structural information. This approach provides a unified and scalable language for classifying complexity across scales, bridging information theory with the design of programmable matter.</description>

      <title>Closures of moment expansion of anisotropic active Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study analytically the dynamics of anisotropic active Brownian particles (ABPs), and more precisely their intermediate scattering function (ISF). To this end, we develop a systematic closure scheme for the moment expansion of their Fokker-Planck equation. Starting from the coupled evolution of translational and orientational degrees of freedom, we derive equations for the density, polarization, and nematic tensor fields, which naturally generate an infinite hierarchy of higher-order moments. To obtain explicit solutions, we investigate truncation strategies and analyze closures at different orders. While the closure at lowest order yields Gaussian dynamics with an effective translational diffusion, closures at higher orders incorporate orientational correlations and reproduce non-Gaussian features in the ISF. By confronting these approximations with exact solutions based on spheroidal wave functions and with Brownian dynamics simulations, we identify their range of validity in terms of P\'eclet number, wavenumber, and observation timescales. An advantage of this method is its ability to yield approximate yet explicit expressions not only for the ISF but also for polarization and nematic fields, which are often neglected but relevant in scattering experiments and theoretical modeling. Beyond providing a practical guide to select the appropriate closure according to the spatiotemporal regime, our framework highlights the efficiency of moment-based approaches compared to exact yet implicit formulations. This strategy can be systematically extended to more complex situations, such as propulsion switching, confinement, or external fields, where functional bases for exact solutions are generally unavailable.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics insights into the Debye process of 1-propanol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dielectric response of mono-alcohols exhibits a strong Debye peak generally attributed to the dynamics of hydrogen-bonds (HB) supramolecular structures through a mechanism that remains unclear in many aspects. In this letter, we use standard all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate this phenomenon in 1-propanol, a prototypic monoalcohol, over a wide temperature range covering a significant change in dielectric permittivity. We obtained dielectric spectra showing a Debye peak in good agreement with experimental data, which we decomposed into the self and cross parts of the dipolar correlations. The latter extends over a few molecular distances and contributes increasingly to the Debye peak upon cooling. To investigate its physical origin, we analyzed the HB structures by identifying clusters from simulation snapshots. Below 300~K, the dielectric permittivity was shown to arise almost entirely from intra-cluster cross-correlations. Furthermore, by tracking the dipole decorrelation of groups of molecules initially belonging to the same cluster, we found that supramolecular structures play a key role in stabilizing cross-correlation over time scales longer than the relaxation of individual molecules.</description>

      <title>Active-Passive Brownian Particle in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.14155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a two-dimensional model for active particles whose self-propulsion speed is not fixed, but varies in time, and whose motion is subject to both translational and rotational diffusion. In the conventional treatment of active Brownian motion, the self-propulsion speed is taken to be constant - an assumption convenient for analysis but poorly matched to many real systems. Here we relax that assumption, allowing the speed $v(t)$ to fluctuate stochastically between two values: $v=0$ (a passive state) and $v=s$ (an active state). Transitions between these states are taken to follow a random telegraph process. This ``active-passive Brownian particle'' inherits limiting behaviors from both the purely active and purely passive Brownian cases. Analytical expressions for the first two displacement moments, and for the resulting effective diffusion coefficient, make this dual character explicit. Moreover, by an appropriate identification of parameters, a run-and-tumble particle - such as a motile bacterium - can be mapped onto this model in such a way that their large-scale diffusivities coincide.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion near a soft surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brownian motion near soft surfaces is a situation widely encountered in nanoscale and biological physics. However, a complete theoretical description is lacking to date. Here, we theoretically investigate the dynamics of a two-dimensional colloid in an arbitrary external potential and near a soft surface. The latter is minimally modelled by a Winkler's foundation, and we restrict the study to the colloidal motion in the direction perpendicular to the surface. We start from deterministic hydrodynamic considerations, by invoking the already-established leading-order soft-lubrication forces acting on the particle. Importantly, a negative softness-induced and position-dependent added mass is identified. We then incorporate thermal fluctuations in the description. In particular, an effective Hamiltonian formulation is introduced and a temperature-dependent generalized potential is constructed in order to ensure equilibrium properties for the colloidal position. From these considerations and the Fokker-Planck equation, we then derive the relevant Langevin equation, which self-consistently allows to recover the deterministic equation of motion at zero temperature. Interestingly, besides an expected multiplicative-noise feature, the noise correlator appears to be modified by the surface softness. Moreover, a softness-induced temperature-dependent spurious drift term has to be incorporated within the Ito prescription. Finally, using numerical simulations with various initial conditions and parameter values, we statistically analyze the trajectories of the particle when placed within a harmonic trap and in presence of the soft surface. This allows us to: i) quantify further the influence of surface softness, through the added mass, which enhances the velocity fluctuations; and ii) show that intermediate-time diffusion is unaffected by softness, within the assumptions of the model.</description>

      <title>Reaction/Diffusion Competition Drives Anomalous Relaxation of Vitrimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vitrimers are an emerging class of crosslinked polymer networks in which dynamic covalent bonds can exchange and rearrange, without any significant change in population of bonded states.1 Because these bonds can rearrange at high temperatures without disintegration of the network, vitrimers could combine the mechanical stability of traditional permanently crosslinked networks with the recyclability of glasses and physical networks. However, unlike classical transient/physical networks, vitrimers can relax at a rate that is decoupled from the mobility of their polymer segments. This challenges our fundamental understanding of how dynamic covalent networks relax and deform. Here we combine simulations, theory, and experiments to show that vitrimer dynamics exhibit two very different regimes: (i) a high temperature regime controlled by the local bond-exchange reaction rate and (ii) a low temperature regime controlled by segmental diffusion. This fundamental difference from traditional physical networks explains why vitrimers can exhibit Arrhenius dynamics, providing a foundation for their rational design.</description>
