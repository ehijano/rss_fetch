      <title>Linear Contracts for Supermodular Functions Based on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study linear contracts for combinatorial problems in multi-agent settings. In this problem, a principal designs a linear contract with several agents, each of whom can decide to take a costly action or not. The principal observes only the outcome of the agents' collective actions, not the actions themselves, and obtains a reward from this outcome. Agents that take an action incur a cost, and so naturally agents require a fraction of the principal's reward as an incentive for taking their action. The principal needs to decide what fraction of their reward to give to each agent so that the principal's expected utility is maximized.
  Our focus is on the case when the agents are vertices in a graph and the principal's reward corresponds to the number of edges between agents who take their costly action. This case represents the natural scenario when an action of each agent complements actions of other agents though collaborations. Recently, Deo-Campo Vuong et.al. showed that for this problem it is impossible to provide any finite multiplicative approximation or additive FPTAS unless $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$. On a positive note, the authors provided an additive PTAS for the case when all agents have the same cost. They asked whether an additive PTAS can be obtained for the general case, i.e when agents potentially have different costs. We answer this open question in positive.</description>

      <title>Connected Equitable Cake Division via Sperner's Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of fair cake-cutting where each agent receives a connected piece of the cake. A division of the cake is deemed fair if it is equitable, which means that all agents derive the same value from their assigned piece. Prior work has established the existence of a connected equitable division for agents with nonnegative valuations using various techniques. We provide a simple proof of this result using Sperner's lemma. Our proof extends known existence results for connected equitable divisions to significantly more general classes of valuations, including nonnegative valuations with externalities, as well as several interesting subclasses of general (possibly negative) valuations.</description>

      <title>Voter Priming Campaigns: Strategies, Equilibria, and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Issue salience is a major determinant in voters' decisions. Candidates and political parties campaign to shift salience to their advantage - a process termed priming. We study the dynamics, strategies and equilibria of campaign spending for voter priming in multi-issue multi-party settings. We consider both parliamentary elections, where parties aim to maximize their share of votes, and various settings for presidential elections, where the winner takes all. For parliamentary elections, we show that pure equilibrium spending always exists and can be computed in time linear in the number of voters. For two parties and all settings, a spending equilibrium exists such that each party invests only in a single issue, and an equilibrium can be computed in time that is polynomial in the number of issues and linear in the number of voters. We also show that in most presidential settings no equilibrium exists. Additional properties of optimal campaign strategies are also studied.</description>

      <title>Achieving Balanced Representation in School Choice with Diversity Goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Student placements under diversity constraints are a common practice globally. This paper addresses the selection of students by a single school under a \emph{one-to-one convention}, where students can belong to multiple types but are counted only once based on one type. While existing algorithms in economics and computer science aim to help schools meet diversity goals and priorities, we demonstrate that these methods can result in significant imbalances among students with different type combinations.
  To address this issue, we introduce a new property called \emph{balanced representation}, which ensures fair representation across all types and type combinations. We propose a straightforward choice function that uniquely satisfies four fundamental properties: maximal diversity, non-wastefulness, justified envy-freeness, and balanced representation. While previous research has primarily focused on algorithms based on bipartite graphs, we take a different approach by utilizing flow networks. This method provides a more compact formalization of the problem and significantly improves computational efficiency. Additionally, we present efficient algorithms for implementing our choice function within both the bipartite graph and flow network frameworks.</description>

      <title>Strategyproof Matching of Roommates and Rooms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of matching roommates and rooms wherein the preferences of agents over other agents and rooms are complementary and represented by Leontief utilities. In this setting, 2n agents must be paired up and assigned to n rooms. Each agent has cardinal valuations over the rooms as well as compatibility values over all other agents. Under Leontief preferences, an agents utility for a matching is the minimum of the two values. We focus on the tradeoff between maximizing utilitarian social welfare and strategyproofness. Our main result shows that, in a stark contrast to the additive case, under binary Leontief utilities, there exist strategyproof mechanisms that maximize the social welfare. We further devise a strategyproof mechanism that implements such a welfare maximizing algorithm and is parameterized by the number of agents. Along the way, we highlight several possibility and impossibility results, and give upper bounds and lower bounds for welfare with or without strategyproofness.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Convergence to Equilibrium Prices in Trading Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a decentralized market model in which agents can negotiate bilateral contracts. This builds on a similar, but centralized, model of trading networks introduced by Hatfield et al. (2013). Prior work has established that fully-substitutable preferences guarantee the existence of competitive equilibria which can be centrally computed. Our motivation comes from the fact that prices in markets such as over-the-counter markets and used car markets arise from \textit{decentralized} negotiation among agents, which has left open an important question as to whether equilibrium prices can emerge from agent-to-agent bilateral negotiations. We design a best response dynamic intended to capture such negotiations between market participants. We assume fully substitutable preferences for market participants. In this setting, we provide proofs of convergence for sparse markets ({covering many real world markets of interest}), and experimental results for more general cases, demonstrating that prices indeed reach equilibrium, quickly, via bilateral negotiations. Our best response dynamic, and its convergence behavior, forms an important first step in understanding how decentralized markets reach, and retain, equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Decidability of One-Clock Weighted Timed Games with Arbitrary Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01608v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weighted Timed Games (WTG for short) are the most widely used model to describe controller synthesis problems involving real-time issues. Unfortunately, they are notoriously difficult, and undecidable in general. As a consequence, one-clock WTGs have attracted a lot of attention, especially because they are known to be decidable when only non-negative weights are allowed. However, when arbitrary weights are considered, despite several recent works, their decidability status was still unknown. In this paper, we solve this problem positively and show that the value function can be computed in exponential time (if weights are encoded in unary).</description>

      <title>Equilibria of the Colonel Blotto Games with Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a generalized variant of the Colonel Blotto game, referred to as the Colonel Blotto game with costs. Unlike the classic Colonel Blotto game, which imposes the use-it-or-lose-it budget assumption, the Colonel Blotto game with costs captures the strategic importance of costs related both to obtaining resources and assigning them across battlefields. We show that every instance of the Colonel Blotto game with costs is strategically equivalent to an instance of the zero-sum Colonel Blotto game with one additional battlefield. This enables the computation of Nash equilibria of the Colonel Blotto game with costs in polynomial time with respect to the game parameters: the number of battlefields and the number of resources available to the players.</description>

      <title>Learning Dynamic Mechanisms in Unknown Environments: A Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.12797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic mechanism design studies how mechanism designers should allocate resources among agents in a time-varying environment. We consider the problem where the agents interact with the mechanism designer according to an unknown Markov Decision Process (MDP), where agent rewards and the mechanism designer's state evolve according to an episodic MDP with unknown reward functions and transition kernels. We focus on the online setting with linear function approximation and propose novel learning algorithms to recover the dynamic Vickrey-Clarke-Grove (VCG) mechanism over multiple rounds of interaction. A key contribution of our approach is incorporating reward-free online Reinforcement Learning (RL) to aid exploration over a rich policy space to estimate prices in the dynamic VCG mechanism. We show that the regret of our proposed method is upper bounded by $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ and further devise a lower bound to show that our algorithm is efficient, incurring the same $\Omega(T^{2 / 3})$ regret as the lower bound, where $T$ is the total number of rounds. Our work establishes the regret guarantee for online RL in solving dynamic mechanism design problems without prior knowledge of the underlying model.</description>

      <title>Representative Social Choice: From Learning Theory to AI Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social choice theory is the study of preference aggregation across a population, used both in mechanism design for human agents and in the democratic alignment of language models. In this study, we propose the representative social choice framework for the modeling of democratic representation in collective decisions, where the number of issues and individuals are too large for mechanisms to consider all preferences directly. These scenarios are widespread in real-world decision-making processes, such as jury trials, indirect elections, legislation processes, corporate governance, and, more recently, language model alignment. In representative social choice, the population is represented by a finite sample of individual-issue pairs based on which social choice decisions are made. We show that many of the deepest questions in representative social choice can be naturally formulated as statistical learning problems, and prove the generalization properties of social choice mechanisms using the theory of machine learning. We further formulate axioms for representative social choice, and prove Arrow-like impossibility theorems with new combinatorial tools of analysis. Our framework introduces the representative approach to social choice, opening up research directions at the intersection of social choice, learning theory, and AI alignment.</description>
