      <title>Dynamic Task Adaptation for Multi-Robot Manufacturing Systems with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent manufacturing systems are increasingly adopting multi-robot collaboration to handle complex and dynamic environments. While multi-agent architectures support decentralized coordination among robot agents, they often face challenges in enabling real-time adaptability for unexpected disruptions without predefined rules. Recent advances in large language models offer new opportunities for context-aware decision-making to enable adaptive responses to unexpected changes. This paper presents an initial exploratory implementation of a large language model-enabled control framework for dynamic task reassignment in multi-robot manufacturing systems. A central controller agent leverages the large language model's ability to interpret structured robot configuration data and generate valid reassignments in response to robot failures. Experiments in a real-world setup demonstrate high task success rates in recovering from failures, highlighting the potential of this approach to improve adaptability in multi-robot manufacturing systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalies by Synthesis: Anomaly Detection using Generative Diffusion Models for Off-Road Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to navigate safely and reliably in off-road and unstructured environments, robots must detect anomalies that are out-of-distribution (OOD) with respect to the training data. We present an analysis-by-synthesis approach for pixel-wise anomaly detection without making any assumptions about the nature of OOD data. Given an input image, we use a generative diffusion model to synthesize an edited image that removes anomalies while keeping the remaining image unchanged. Then, we formulate anomaly detection as analyzing which image segments were modified by the diffusion model. We propose a novel inference approach for guided diffusion by analyzing the ideal guidance gradient and deriving a principled approximation that bootstraps the diffusion model to predict guidance gradients. Our editing technique is purely test-time that can be integrated into existing workflows without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. Finally, we use a combination of vision-language foundation models to compare pixels in a learned feature space and detect semantically meaningful edits, enabling accurate anomaly detection for off-road navigation.

      <title>Semantic Exploration and Dense Mapping of Complex Environments using Ground Robots Equipped with LiDAR and Panoramic Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a system for autonomous semantic exploration and dense semantic target mapping of a complex unknown environment using a ground robot equipped with a LiDAR-panoramic camera suite. Existing approaches often struggle to balance collecting high-quality observations from multiple view angles and avoiding unnecessary repetitive traversal. To fill this gap, we propose a complete system combining mapping and planning. We first redefine the task as completing both geometric coverage and semantic viewpoint observation. We then manage semantic and geometric viewpoints separately and propose a novel Priority-driven Decoupled Local Sampler to generate local viewpoint sets. This enables explicit multi-view semantic inspection and voxel coverage without unnecessary repetition. Building on this, we develop a hierarchical planner to ensure efficient global coverage. In addition, we propose a Safe Aggressive Exploration State Machine, which allows aggressive exploration behavior while ensuring the robot's safety. Our system includes a plug-and-play semantic target mapping module that integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms for pointcloud-level dense semantic target mapping. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both realistic simulations and complex real-world environments. Simulation results show that our planner achieves faster exploration and shorter travel distances while guaranteeing a specified number of multi-view inspections. Real-world experiments further confirm the system's effectiveness in achieving accurate dense semantic object mapping of unstructured environments.</description>

      <title>TwinTrack: Bridging Vision and Contact Physics for Real-Time Tracking of Unknown Dynamic Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time tracking of previously unseen, highly dynamic objects in contact-rich environments -- such as during dexterous in-hand manipulation -- remains a significant challenge. Purely vision-based tracking often suffers from heavy occlusions due to the frequent contact interactions and motion blur caused by abrupt motion during contact impacts. We propose TwinTrack, a physics-aware visual tracking framework that enables robust and real-time 6-DoF pose tracking of unknown dynamic objects in a contact-rich scene by leveraging the contact physics of the observed scene. At the core of TwinTrack is an integration of Real2Sim and Sim2Real. In Real2Sim, we combine the complementary strengths of vision and contact physics to estimate object's collision geometry and physical properties: object's geometry is first reconstructed from vision, then updated along with other physical parameters from contact dynamics for physical accuracy. In Sim2Real, robust pose estimation of the object is achieved by adaptive fusion between visual tracking and prediction of the learned contact physics. TwinTrack is built on a GPU-accelerated, deeply customized physics engine to ensure real-time performance. We evaluate our method on two contact-rich scenarios: object falling with rich contact impacts against the environment, and contact-rich in-hand manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to baseline methods, TwinTrack achieves significantly more robust, accurate, and real-time 6-DoF tracking in these challenging scenarios, with tracking speed exceeding 20 Hz.

      <title>Spring-Brake! Handed Shearing Auxetics Improve Efficiency of Hopping and Standing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy efficiency is critical to the success of legged robotics. Efficiency is lost through wasted energy during locomotion and standing. Including elastic elements has been shown to reduce movement costs, while including breaks can reduce standing costs. However, adding separate elements for each increases the mass and complexity of a leg, reducing overall system performance. Here we present a novel compliant mechanism using a Handed Shearing Auxetic (HSA) that acts as a spring and break in a monopod hopping robot. The HSA acts as a parallel elastic actuator, reducing electrical power for dynamic hopping and matching the efficiency of state-of-the-art compliant hoppers. The HSA\u2019s auxetic behavior enables dual functionality. During static tasks, it locks under large forces with minimal input power by blocking deformation, creating high friction similar to a capstan mechanism. This allows the leg to support heavy loads without motor torque, addressing thermal inefficiency. The multi-functional design enhances both dynamic and static performance, offering a versatile solution for robotic applications.</description>

      <title>Learning coordinated badminton skills for legged manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinating the motion between lower and upper limbs and aligning limb control with perception are substantial challenges in robotics, particularly in dynamic environments. To this end, we introduce an approach for enabling legged mobile manipulators to play badminton, a task that requires precise coordination of perception, locomotion, and arm swinging. We propose a unified reinforcement learning-based control policy for whole-body visuomotor skills involving all degrees of freedom to achieve effective shuttlecock tracking and striking. This policy is informed by a perception noise model that utilizes real-world camera data, allowing for consistent perception error levels between simulation and deployment and encouraging learned active perception behaviors. Our method includes a shuttlecock prediction model, constrained reinforcement learning for robust motion control, and integrated system identification techniques to enhance deployment readiness. Extensive experimental results in a variety of environments validate the robot's capability to predict shuttlecock trajectories, navigate the service area effectively, and execute precise strikes against human players, demonstrating the feasibility of using legged mobile manipulators in complex and dynamic sports scenarios.</description>

      <title>Structural Abstraction and Selective Refinement for Formal Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety verification of robot applications is extremely challenging due to the complexity of the environment that a robot typically operates in. Formal verification with model-checking provides guarantees but it may often take too long or even fail for complex models of the environment. A usual solution approach is abstraction, more precisely behavioral abstraction. Our new approach introduces structural abstraction instead, which we investigated in the context of voxel representation of the robot environment. This kind of abstraction leads to abstract voxels. We also propose a complete and automated verification workflow, which is based on an already existing methodology for robot applications, and inspired by the key ideas behind counterexample-guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) - performing an initial abstraction and successively introducing refinements based on counterexamples, intertwined with model-checker runs. Hence, our approach uses selective refinement of structural abstractions to improve the runtime efficiency of model-checking. A fully-automated implementation of our approach showed its feasibility, since counterexamples have been found for a realistic scenario with a fairly high (maximal) resolution in a few minutes, while direct model-checker runs led to a crash after a couple of days.</description>

      <title>Stairway to Success: Zero-Shot Floor-Aware Object-Goal Navigation via LLM-Driven Coarse-to-Fine Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object-Goal Navigation (OGN) remains challenging in real-world, multi-floor environments and under open-vocabulary object descriptions. We observe that most episodes in widely used benchmarks such as HM3D and MP3D involve multi-floor buildings, with many requiring explicit floor transitions. However, existing methods are often limited to single-floor settings or predefined object categories. To address these limitations, we tackle two key challenges: (1) efficient cross-level planning and (2) zero-shot object-goal navigation (ZS-OGN), where agents must interpret novel object descriptions without prior exposure. We propose ASCENT, a framework that combines a Multi-Floor Spatial Abstraction module for hierarchical semantic mapping and a Coarse-to-Fine Frontier Reasoning module leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for context-aware exploration, without requiring additional training on new object semantics or locomotion data. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art ZS-OGN approaches on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks while enabling efficient multi-floor navigation. We further validate its practicality through real-world deployment on a quadruped robot, achieving successful object exploration across unseen floors.</description>

      <title>A Constructed Response: Designing and Choreographing Robot Arm Movements in Collaborative Dance Improvisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dancers often prototype movements themselves or with each other during improvisation and choreography. How are these interactions altered when physically manipulable technologies are introduced into the creative process? To understand how dancers design and improvise movements while working with instruments capable of non-humanoid movements, we engaged dancers in workshops to co-create movements with a robot arm in one-human-to-one-robot and three-human-to-one-robot settings. We found that dancers produced more fluid movements in one-to-one scenarios, experiencing a stronger sense of connection and presence with the robot as a co-dancer. In three-to-one scenarios, the dancers divided their attention between the human dancers and the robot, resulting in increased perceived use of space and more stop-and-go movements, perceiving the robot as part of the stage background. This work highlights how technologies can drive creativity in movement artists adapting to new ways of working with physical instruments, contributing design insights supporting artistic collaborations with non-humanoid agents.</description>

      <title>Redundancy Parameterization of the ABB YuMi Robot Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ABB YuMi is a 7-DOF collaborative robot arm with a complex, redundant kinematic structure. Path planning for the YuMi is challenging, especially with joint limits considered. The redundant degree of freedom is parameterized by the Shoulder-Elbow-Wrist (SEW) angle, called the arm angle by ABB, but the exact definition must be known for path planning outside the RobotStudio simulator. We provide the first complete and validated definition of the SEW angle used for the YuMi. It follows the conventional SEW angle formulation with the shoulder-elbow direction chosen to be the direction of the fourth joint axis. Our definition also specifies the shoulder location, making it compatible with any choice of reference vector. A previous attempt to define the SEW angle exists in the literature, but it is incomplete and deviates from the behavior observed in RobotStudio. Because our formulation fits within the general SEW angle framework, we also obtain the expression for the SEW angle Jacobian and complete numerical conditions for all algorithmic singularities. Finally, we demonstrate using IK-Geo, our inverse kinematics (IK) solver based on subproblem decomposition, to find all IK solutions using 2D search. Code examples are available in a publicly accessible repository.</description>

      <title>LocoTouch: Learning Dexterous Quadrupedal Transport with Tactile Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots have demonstrated remarkable agility and robustness in traversing complex terrains. However, they remain limited in performing object interactions that require sustained contact. In this work, we present LocoTouch, a system that equips quadrupedal robots with tactile sensing to address a challenging task in this category: long-distance transport of unsecured cylindrical objects, which typically requires custom mounting mechanisms to maintain stability. For efficient large-area tactile sensing, we design a high-density distributed tactile sensor array that covers the entire back of the robot. To effectively leverage tactile feedback for locomotion control, we develop a simulation environment with high-fidelity tactile signals, and train tactile-aware transport policies using a two-stage learning pipeline. Furthermore, we design a novel reward function to promote stable, symmetric, and frequency-adaptive locomotion gaits. After training in simulation, LocoTouch transfers zero-shot to the real world, reliably balancing and transporting a wide range of unsecured, cylindrical everyday objects with broadly varying sizes and weights. Thanks to the responsiveness of the tactile sensor and the adaptive gait reward, LocoTouch can robustly balance objects with slippery surfaces over long distances, or even under severe external perturbations.</description>

      <title>TrackVLA: Embodied Visual Tracking in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied visual tracking is a fundamental skill in Embodied AI, enabling an agent to follow a specific target in dynamic environments using only egocentric vision. This task is inherently challenging as it requires both accurate target recognition and effective trajectory planning under conditions of severe occlusion and high scene dynamics. Existing approaches typically address this challenge through a modular separation of recognition and planning. In this work, we propose TrackVLA, a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that learns the synergy between object recognition and trajectory planning. Leveraging a shared LLM backbone, we employ a language modeling head for recognition and an anchor-based diffusion model for trajectory planning. To train TrackVLA, we construct an Embodied Visual Tracking Benchmark (EVT-Bench) and collect diverse difficulty levels of recognition samples, resulting in a dataset of 1.7 million samples. Through extensive experiments in both synthetic and real-world environments, TrackVLA demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalizability. It significantly outperforms existing methods on public benchmarks in a zero-shot manner while remaining robust to high dynamics and occlusion in real-world scenarios at 10 FPS inference speed.

      <title>UPP: Unified Path Planner with Adaptive Safety and Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are surrounded by robots helping us perform complex tasks. Robots have a wide range of applications, from industrial automation to personalized assistance. However, with great technological innovation come significant challenges. One of the major challenges in robotics is path planning. Despite advancements such as graph search, sampling, and potential field methods, most path planning algorithms focus either on optimality or on safety. Very little research addresses both simultaneously. We propose a Unified Path Planner (UPP) that uses modified heuristics and a dynamic safety cost function to balance safety and optimality. The level of safety can be adjusted via tunable parameters, trading off against computational complexity. We demonstrate the planner's performance in simulations, showing how parameter variation affects results. UPP is compared with various traditional and safe-optimal planning algorithms across different scenarios. We also validate it on a TurtleBot, where the robot successfully finds safe and sub-optimal paths.</description>

      <title>VLM-RRT: Vision Language Model Guided RRT Search for Autonomous UAV Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path planning is a fundamental capability of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), enabling them to efficiently navigate toward a target region or explore complex environments while avoiding obstacles. Traditional pathplanning methods, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have proven effective but often encounter significant challenges. These include high search space complexity, suboptimal path quality, and slow convergence, issues that are particularly problematic in high-stakes applications like disaster response, where rapid and efficient planning is critical. To address these limitations and enhance path-planning efficiency, we propose Vision Language Model RRT (VLM-RRT), a hybrid approach that integrates the pattern recognition capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the path-planning strengths of RRT. By leveraging VLMs to provide initial directional guidance based on environmental snapshots, our method biases sampling toward regions more likely to contain feasible paths, significantly improving sampling efficiency and path quality. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments with various state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed approach.</description>

      <title>MEF-Explore: Communication-Constrained Multi-Robot Entropy-Field-Based Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative multiple robots for unknown environment exploration have become mainstream due to their remarkable performance and efficiency. However, most existing methods assume perfect robots' communication during exploration, which is unattainable in real-world settings. Though there have been recent works aiming to tackle communication-constrained situations, substantial room for advancement remains for both information-sharing and exploration strategy aspects. In this paper, we propose a Communication-Constrained Multi-Robot Entropy-Field-Based Exploration (MEF-Explore). The first module of the proposed method is the two-layer inter-robot communication-aware information-sharing strategy. A dynamic graph is used to represent a multi-robot network and to determine communication based on whether it is low-speed or high-speed. Specifically, low-speed communication, which is always accessible between every robot, can only be used to share their current positions. If robots are within a certain range, high-speed communication will be available for inter-robot map merging. The second module is the entropy-field-based exploration strategy. Particularly, robots explore the unknown area distributedly according to the novel forms constructed to evaluate the entropies of frontiers and robots. These entropies can also trigger implicit robot rendezvous to enhance inter-robot map merging if feasible. In addition, we include the duration-adaptive goal-assigning module to manage robots' goal assignment. The simulation results demonstrate that our MEF-Explore surpasses the existing ones regarding exploration time and success rate in all scenarios. For real-world experiments, our method leads to a 21.32% faster exploration time and a 16.67% higher success rate compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>Agentic Robot: A Brain-Inspired Framework for Vision-Language-Action Models in Embodied Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation poses significant challenges for autonomous systems, requiring extended reasoning, precise execution, and robust error recovery across complex sequential tasks. Current approaches, whether based on static planning or end-to-end visuomotor policies, suffer from error accumulation and lack effective verification mechanisms during execution, limiting their reliability in real-world scenarios. We present Agentic Robot, a brain-inspired framework that addresses these limitations through Standardized Action Procedures (SAP)--a novel coordination protocol governing component interactions throughout manipulation tasks. Drawing inspiration from Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) in human organizations, SAP establishes structured workflows for planning, execution, and verification phases. Our architecture comprises three specialized components: (1) a large reasoning model that decomposes high-level instructions into semantically coherent subgoals, (2) a vision-language-action executor that generates continuous control commands from real-time visual inputs, and (3) a temporal verifier that enables autonomous progression and error recovery through introspective assessment. This SAP-driven closed-loop design supports dynamic self-verification without external supervision. On the LIBERO benchmark, Agentic Robot achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average success rate of 79.6\%, outperforming SpatialVLA by 6.1\% and OpenVLA by 7.4\% on long-horizon tasks. These results demonstrate that SAP-driven coordination between specialized components enhances both performance and interpretability in sequential manipulation, suggesting significant potential for reliable autonomous systems.

      <title>Long Duration Inspection of GNSS-Denied Environments with a Tethered UAV-UGV Marsupial System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become essential tools in inspection and emergency response operations due to their high maneuverability and ability to access hard-to-reach areas. However, their limited battery life significantly restricts their use in long-duration missions. This paper presents a novel tethered marsupial robotic system composed of a UAV and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), specifically designed for autonomous, long-duration inspection tasks in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments. The system extends the UAV's operational time by supplying power through a tether connected to high-capacity battery packs carried by the UGV. We detail the hardware architecture based on off-the-shelf components to ensure replicability and describe our full-stack software framework, which is composed of open-source components and built upon the Robot Operating System (ROS). The proposed software architecture enables precise localization using a Direct LiDAR Localization (DLL) method and ensures safe path planning and coordinated trajectory tracking for the integrated UGV-tether-UAV system. We validate the system through three field experiments: (1) a manual flight endurance test to estimate the operational duration, (2) an autonomous navigation test, and (3) an inspection mission to demonstrate autonomous inspection capabilities. Experimental results confirm the robustness and autonomy of the system, its capacity to operate in GNSS-denied environments, and its potential for long-endurance, autonomous inspection and monitoring tasks.</description>

      <title>Centroidal Trajectory Generation and Stabilization based on Preview Control for Humanoid Multi-contact Motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-contact motion is important for humanoid robots to work in various environments. We propose a centroidal online trajectory generation and stabilization control for humanoid dynamic multi-contact motion. The proposed method features the drastic reduction of the computational cost by using preview control instead of the conventional model predictive control that considers the constraints of all sample times. By combining preview control with centroidal state feedback for robustness to disturbances and wrench distribution for satisfying contact constraints, we show that the robot can stably perform a variety of multi-contact motions through simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimization-based Posture Generation for Whole-body Contact Motion by Contact Point Search on the Body Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole-body contact is an effective strategy for improving the stability and efficiency of the motion of robots. For robots to automatically perform such motions, we propose a posture generation method that employs all available surfaces of the robot links. By representing the contact point on the body surface by two-dimensional configuration variables, the joint positions and contact points are simultaneously determined through a gradient-based optimization. By generating motions with the proposed method, we present experiments in which robots manipulate objects effectively utilizing whole-body contact.</description>

      <title>Humanoid Loco-manipulation Planning based on Graph Search and Reachability Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose an efficient and highly versatile loco-manipulation planning for humanoid robots. Loco-manipulation planning is a key technological brick enabling humanoid robots to autonomously perform object transportation by manipulating them. We formulate planning of the alternation and sequencing of footsteps and grasps as a graph search problem with a new transition model that allows for a flexible representation of loco-manipulation. Our transition model is quickly evaluated by relocating and switching the reachability maps depending on the motion of both the robot and object. We evaluate our approach by applying it to loco-manipulation use-cases, such as a bobbin rolling operation with regrasping, where the motion is automatically planned by our framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From dating to job interviews, making new friends or simply chatting with the cashier at checkout, engaging in small talk is a vital, everyday social skill. For adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), small talk can be particularly challenging, yet it is essential for social integration, building relationships, and accessing professional opportunities. In this study, we present our development and evaluation of an in-home autonomous robot system that allows users to practice small talk. Results from the week-long study show that adults with ASD enjoyed the training, made notable progress in initiating conversations and improving eye contact, and viewed the system as a valuable tool for enhancing their conversational skills.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Guardrails for Open-World Decision Making in Autonomous Drone Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small Uncrewed Aerial Systems (sUAS) are increasingly deployed as autonomous swarms in search-and-rescue and other disaster-response scenarios. In these settings, they use computer vision (CV) to detect objects of interest and autonomously adapt their missions. However, traditional CV systems often struggle to recognize unfamiliar objects in open-world environments or to infer their relevance for mission planning. To address this, we incorporate large language models (LLMs) to reason about detected objects and their implications. While LLMs can offer valuable insights, they are also prone to hallucinations and may produce incorrect, misleading, or unsafe recommendations. To ensure safe and sensible decision-making under uncertainty, high-level decisions must be governed by cognitive guardrails. This article presents the design, simulation, and real-world integration of these guardrails for sUAS swarms in search-and-rescue missions.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Meta-Actions for Unified Controllable Trajectory Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllable trajectory generation guided by high-level semantic decisions, termed meta-actions, is crucial for autonomous driving systems. A significant limitation of existing frameworks is their reliance on invariant meta-actions assigned over fixed future time intervals, causing temporal misalignment with the actual behavior trajectories. This misalignment leads to irrelevant associations between the prescribed meta-actions and the resulting trajectories, disrupting task coherence and limiting model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Autoregressive Meta-Actions, an approach integrated into autoregressive trajectory generation frameworks that provides a unified and precise definition for meta-action-conditioned trajectory prediction. Specifically, We decompose traditional long-interval meta-actions into frame-level meta-actions, enabling a sequential interplay between autoregressive meta-action prediction and meta-action-conditioned trajectory generation. This decomposition ensures strict alignment between each trajectory segment and its corresponding meta-action, achieving a consistent and unified task formulation across the entire trajectory span and significantly reducing complexity. Moreover, we propose a staged pre-training process to decouple the learning of basic motion dynamics from the integration of high-level decision control, which offers flexibility, stability, and modularity. Experimental results validate our framework's effectiveness, demonstrating improved trajectory adaptivity and responsiveness to dynamic decision-making scenarios. We provide the video document and dataset, which are available at https://arma-traj.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Mobi-$\pi$: Mobilizing Your Robot Learning Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learned visuomotor policies are capable of performing increasingly complex manipulation tasks. However, most of these policies are trained on data collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional demonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing efforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and remains compatible with them. To study policy mobilization, we introduce the Mobi-$\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, (3) visualization tools for analysis, and (4) several baseline methods. We also propose a novel approach that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score function to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to identify optimal robot poses. We show that our approach outperforms baselines in both simulation and real-world environments, demonstrating its effectiveness for policy mobilization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced the control of physics-based and robotic characters that track kinematic reference motion. However, methods typically rely on a weighted sum of conflicting reward functions, requiring extensive tuning to achieve a desired behavior. Due to the computational cost of RL, this iterative process is a tedious, time-intensive task. Furthermore, for robotics applications, the weights need to be chosen such that the policy performs well in the real world, despite inevitable sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that trains a single policy conditioned on a set of weights, spanning the Pareto front of reward trade-offs. Within this framework, weights can be selected and tuned after training, significantly speeding up iteration time. We demonstrate how this improved workflow can be used to perform highly dynamic motions with a robot character. Moreover, we explore how weight-conditioned policies can be leveraged in hierarchical settings, using a high-level policy to dynamically select weights according to the current task. We show that the multi-objective policy encodes a diverse spectrum of behaviors, facilitating efficient adaptation to novel tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards Real-Time Interpolation for Enhanced AUV Deep Sea Mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximately seventy-one percent of the Earth is covered in water. Of that area, ninety-five percent of the ocean has never been explored or mapped. There are several engineering challenges that have prevented the exploration of the deep ocean through human or autonomous means. These challenges include but are not limited to high pressure, cold temperatures, little natural light, corrosion of materials, and communication. Ongoing research has been focused on trying to find optimal and low-cost solutions to effective communication between autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and the surface or air. In this paper, an architecture is introduced that utilizes an edge computing approach to establish computation nearer to the source of data, allowing further exploration of the deep ocean. Taking the most common interpolation techniques used today in the field of bathymetry, the data are tested and analyzed to find the feasibility of switching from CPU to GPU computation. Specifically, the focus is on writing efficient interpolation algorithms that can be run on low-level GPUs, which can be carried onboard AUVs as payload.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Lifelong Multi-Agent Path-finding by Using Artificial Potential Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the use of Artificial Potential Fields (APFs) to solve Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) and Lifelong MAPF (LMAPF) problems. In MAPF, a team of agents must move to their goal locations without collisions, whereas in LMAPF, new goals are generated upon arrival. We propose methods for incorporating APFs in a range of MAPF algorithms, including Prioritized Planning, MAPF-LNS2, and Priority Inheritance with Backtracking (PIBT). Experimental results show that using APF is not beneficial for MAPF but yields up to a 7-fold increase in overall system throughput for LMAPF.</description>

      <title>System Identification for Virtual Sensor-Based Model Predictive Control: Application to a 2-DoF Direct-Drive Robotic Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) offers a powerful approach for controlling complex nonlinear systems, yet faces two key challenges. First, accurately modeling nonlinear dynamics remains difficult. Second, variables directly related to control objectives often cannot be directly measured during operation. Although high-cost sensors can acquire these variables during model development, their use in practical deployment is typically infeasible. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Predictive Virtual Sensor Identification (PVSID) framework that leverages temporary high-cost sensors during the modeling phase to create virtual sensors for NMPC implementation. We validate PVSID on a Two-Degree-of-Freedom (2-DoF) direct-drive robotic arm with complex joint interactions, capturing tip position via motion capture during modeling and utilize an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in NMPC. Experimental results show our NMPC with identified virtual sensors achieves precise tip trajectory tracking without requiring the motion capture system during operation. PVSID offers a practical solution for implementing optimal control in nonlinear systems where the measurement of key variables is constrained by cost or operational limitations.</description>

Abstract: Advances in eye-tracking control for assistive robotic arms provide intuitive interaction opportunities for people with physical disabilities. Shared control has gained interest in recent years by improving user satisfaction through partial automation of robot control. We present an eye-tracking-guided shared control design based on insights from state-of-the-art literature. A Wizard of Oz setup was used in which automation was simulated by an experimenter to evaluate the concept without requiring full implementation. This approach allowed for rapid exploration of user needs and expectations to inform future iterations. Two studies were conducted to assess user experience, identify design challenges, and find improvements to ensure usability and accessibility. The first study involved people with disabilities by providing a survey, and the second study used the Wizard of Oz design in person to gain technical insights, leading to a comprehensive picture of findings.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Last-Mile Delivery: A Multi-Platform Vehicle Routing Problem With En-route Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of e-commerce and the increasing demand for timely, cost-effective last-mile delivery have increased interest in collaborative logistics. This research introduces a novel collaborative synchronized multi-platform vehicle routing problem with drones and robots (VRP-DR), where a fleet of $\mathcal{M}$ trucks, $\mathcal{N}$ drones and $\mathcal{K}$ robots, cooperatively delivers parcels. Trucks serve as mobile platforms, enabling the launching, retrieving, and en-route charging of drones and robots, thereby addressing critical limitations such as restricted payload capacities, limited range, and battery constraints. The VRP-DR incorporates five realistic features: (1) multi-visit service per trip, (2) multi-trip operations, (3) flexible docking, allowing returns to the same or different trucks (4) cyclic and acyclic operations, enabling return to the same or different nodes; and (5) en-route charging, enabling drones and robots to recharge while being transported on the truck, maximizing operational efficiency by utilizing idle transit time. The VRP-DR is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to minimize both operational costs and makespan. To overcome the computational challenges of solving large-scale instances, a scalable heuristic algorithm, FINDER (Flexible INtegrated Delivery with Energy Recharge), is developed, to provide efficient, near-optimal solutions. Numerical experiments across various instance sizes evaluate the performance of the MILP and heuristic approaches in terms of solution quality and computation time. The results demonstrate significant time savings of the combined delivery mode over the truck-only mode and substantial cost reductions from enabling multi-visits. The study also provides insights into the effects of en-route charging, docking flexibility, drone count, speed, and payload capacity on system performance.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Insulating Vision-Language-Action Models: Train Fast, Run Fast, Generalize Better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models provide a powerful approach to training control policies for physical systems, such as robots, by combining end-to-end learning with transfer of semantic knowledge from web-scale vision-language model (VLM) training. However, the constraints of real-time control are often at odds with the design of VLMs: the most powerful VLMs have tens or hundreds of billions of parameters, presenting an obstacle to real-time inference, and operate on discrete tokens rather than the continuous-valued outputs that are required for controlling robots. To address this challenge, recent VLA models have used specialized modules for efficient continuous control, such as action experts or continuous output heads, which typically require adding new untrained parameters to the pretrained VLM backbone. While these modules improve real-time and control capabilities, it remains an open question whether they preserve or degrade the semantic knowledge contained in the pretrained VLM, and what effect they have on the VLA training dynamics. In this paper, we study this question in the context of VLAs that include a continuous diffusion or flow matching action expert, showing that naively including such experts significantly harms both training speed and knowledge transfer. We provide an extensive analysis of various design choices, their impact on performance and knowledge transfer, and propose a technique for insulating the VLM backbone during VLA training that mitigates this issue.

      <title>Stochastic Adaptive Estimation in Polynomial Curvature Shape State Space for Continuum Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In continuum robotics, real-time robust shape estimation is crucial for planning and control tasks that involve physical manipulation in complex environments. In this paper, we present a novel stochastic observer-based shape estimation framework designed specifically for continuum robots. The shape state space is uniquely represented by the modal coefficients of a polynomial, enabled by leveraging polynomial curvature kinematics (PCK) to describe the curvature distribution along the arclength. Our framework processes noisy measurements from limited discrete position, orientation, or pose sensors to estimate the shape state robustly. We derive a novel noise-weighted observability matrix, providing a detailed assessment of observability variations under diverse sensor configurations. To overcome the limitations of a single model, our observer employs the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) method, coupled with Extended Kalman Filters (EKFs), to mix polynomial curvature models of different orders. The IMM approach, rooted in Markov processes, effectively manages multiple model scenarios by dynamically adapting to different polynomial orders based on real-time model probabilities. This adaptability is key to ensuring robust shape estimation of the robot's behaviors under various conditions. Our comprehensive analysis, supported by both simulation studies and experimental validations, confirms the robustness and accuracy of our methods.</description>

      <title>Safety Implications of Explainable Artificial Intelligence in End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12176v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The end-to-end learning pipeline is gradually creating a paradigm shift in the ongoing development of highly autonomous vehicles (AVs), largely due to advances in deep learning, the availability of large-scale training datasets, and improvements in integrated sensor devices. However, a lack of explainability in real-time decisions with contemporary learning methods impedes user trust and attenuates the widespread deployment and commercialization of such vehicles. Moreover, the issue is exacerbated when these vehicles are involved in or cause traffic accidents. Consequently, explainability in end-to-end autonomous driving is essential to build trust in vehicular automation. With that said, automotive researchers have not yet rigorously explored safety benefits and consequences of explanations in end-to-end autonomous driving. This paper aims to bridge the gaps between these topics and seeks to answer the following research question: What are safety implications of explanations in end-to-end autonomous driving? In this regard, we first revisit established safety and explainability concepts in end-to-end driving. Furthermore, we present critical case studies and show the pivotal role of explanations in enhancing driving safety. Finally, we describe insights from empirical studies and reveal potential value, limitations, and caveats of practical explainable AI methods with respect to their potential impacts on safety of end-to-end driving.</description>

      <title>Reevaluation of Large Neighborhood Search for MAPF: Findings and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) aims to arrange collision-free goal-reaching paths for a group of agents. Anytime MAPF solvers based on large neighborhood search (LNS) have gained prominence recently due to their flexibility and scalability, leading to a surge of methods, especially those leveraging machine learning, to enhance neighborhood selection. However, several pitfalls exist and hinder a comprehensive evaluation of these new methods, which mainly include: 1) Lower than actual or incorrect baseline performance; 2) Lack of a unified evaluation setting and criterion; 3) Lack of a codebase or executable model for supervised learning methods. To address these challenges, we introduce a unified evaluation framework, implement prior methods, and conduct an extensive comparison of prominent methods. Our evaluation reveals that rule-based heuristics serve as strong baselines, while current learning-based methods show no clear advantage on time efficiency or improvement capacity. Our extensive analysis also opens up new research opportunities for improving MAPF-LNS, such as targeting high-delayed agents, applying contextual algorithms, optimizing replan order and neighborhood size, where machine learning can potentially be integrated.

      <title>Universal Trajectory Optimization Framework for Differential Drive Robot Class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential drive robots are widely used in various scenarios thanks to their straightforward principle, from household service robots to disaster response field robots. There are several types of driving mechanisms for real-world applications, including two-wheeled, four-wheeled skid-steering, tracked robots, and so on. The differences in the driving mechanisms usually require specific kinematic modeling when precise control is desired. Furthermore, the nonholonomic dynamics and possible lateral slip lead to different degrees of difficulty in getting feasible and high-quality trajectories. Therefore, a comprehensive trajectory optimization framework to compute trajectories efficiently for various kinds of differential drive robots is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a universal trajectory optimization framework that can be applied to differential drive robots, enabling the generation of high-quality trajectories within a restricted computational timeframe. We introduce a novel trajectory representation based on polynomial parameterization of motion states or their integrals, such as angular and linear velocities, which inherently matches the robots' motion to the control principle. The trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize complexity while prioritizing safety and operational efficiency. We then build a full-stack autonomous planning and control system to demonstrate its feasibility and robustness. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world testing in crowded environments with three kinds of differential drive robots to validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>M3Bench: Benchmarking Whole-body Motion Generation for Mobile Manipulation in 3D Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose M3Bench, a new benchmark for whole-body motion generation in mobile manipulation tasks. Given a 3D scene context, M3Bench requires an embodied agent to reason about its configuration, environmental constraints, and task objectives to generate coordinated whole-body motion trajectories for object rearrangement. M3Bench features 30,000 object rearrangement tasks across 119 diverse scenes, providing expert demonstrations generated by our newly developed M3BenchMaker, an automatic data generation tool that produces whole-body motion trajectories from high-level task instructions using only basic scene and robot information. Our benchmark includes various task splits to evaluate generalization across different dimensions and leverages realistic physics simulation for trajectory assessment. Extensive evaluation analysis reveals that state-of-the-art models struggle with coordinating base-arm motion while adhering to environmental and task-specific constraints, underscoring the need for new models to bridge this gap. By releasing M3Bench and M3BenchMaker we aim to advance robotics research toward more adaptive and capable mobile manipulation in diverse, real-world environments.</description>

      <title>DynaMem: Online Dynamic Spatio-Semantic Memory for Open World Mobile Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in open-vocabulary mobile manipulation, where the goal is for a robot to perform tasks in any environment given a natural language description. However, most current systems assume a static environment, which limits the system's applicability in real-world scenarios where environments frequently change due to human intervention or the robot's own actions. In this work, we present DynaMem, a new approach to open-world mobile manipulation that uses a dynamic spatio-semantic memory to represent a robot's environment. DynaMem constructs a 3D data structure to maintain a dynamic memory of point clouds, and answers open-vocabulary object localization queries using multimodal LLMs or open-vocabulary features generated by state-of-the-art vision-language models. Powered by DynaMem, our robots can explore novel environments, search for objects not found in memory, and continuously update the memory as objects move, appear, or disappear in the scene. We run extensive experiments on the Stretch SE3 robots in three real and nine offline scenes, and achieve an average pick-and-drop success rate of 70% on non-stationary objects, which is more than a 2x improvement over state-of-the-art static systems. Our code as well as our experiment and deployment videos are open sourced and can be found on our project website: https://dynamem.github.io/</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Batch planning is increasingly necessary to quickly produce diverse and quality motion plans for downstream learning applications, such as distillation and imitation learning. This paper presents Global Tensor Motion Planning (GTMP) -- a sampling-based motion planning algorithm comprising only tensor operations. We introduce a novel discretization structure represented as a random multipartite graph, enabling efficient vectorized sampling, collision checking, and search. We provide a theoretical investigation showing that GTMP exhibits probabilistic completeness while supporting modern GPU/TPU. Additionally, by incorporating smooth structures into the multipartite graph, GTMP directly plans smooth splines without requiring gradient-based optimization. Experiments on lidar-scanned occupancy maps and the MotionBenchMarker dataset demonstrate GTMP's computation efficiency in batch planning compared to baselines, underscoring GTMP's potential as a robust, scalable planner for diverse applications and large-scale robot learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Integrated Shape and Force Sensing for Continuum Instruments via Polynomial Curvature Modeling and Torque-Cell-Based Actuation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuum instruments are integral to robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (MIS), with cable-driven mechanisms being the most common. Real-time tension feedback is crucial for precise articulation but remains a challenge in compact actuation unit designs. Additionally, accurate shape and external force sensing of continuum instruments are essential for advanced control and manipulation. This paper presents a compact actuation unit that integrates a torque cell directly into the pulley module to provide real-time tension feedback. Building on this unit, we propose a novel shape-force sensing framework incorporating polynomial curvature kinematics and virtual-work-based force sensing model. The framework combines pose sensor measurements at the instrument tip and actuation tension feedback at the developed actuation unit. Experimental results demonstrate the improved performance of the framework in terms of shape reconstruction accuracy and force estimation reliability compared to conventional constant curvature methods.</description>

      <title>Wake-Informed 3D Path Planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Using A* and Neural Network Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) encounter significant energy, control and navigation challenges in complex underwater environments, particularly during close-proximity operations, such as launch and recovery (LAR), where fluid interactions and wake effects present additional navigational and energy challenges. Traditional path planning methods fail to incorporate these detailed wake structures, resulting in increased energy consumption, reduced control stability, and heightened safety risks. This paper presents a novel wake-informed, 3D path planning approach that fully integrates localized wake effects and global currents into the planning algorithm. Two variants of the A* algorithm - a current-informed planner and a wake-informed planner - are created to assess its validity and two neural network models are then trained to approximate these planners for real-time applications. Both the A* planners and NN models are evaluated using important metrics such as energy expenditure, path length, and encounters with high-velocity and turbulent regions. The results demonstrate a wake-informed A* planner consistently achieves the lowest energy expenditure and minimizes encounters with high-velocity regions, reducing energy consumption by up to 11.3%. The neural network models are observed to offer computational speedup of 6 orders of magnitude, but exhibit 4.51 - 19.79% higher energy expenditures and 9.81 - 24.38% less optimal paths. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating detailed wake structures into traditional path planning algorithms and the benefits of neural network approximations to enhance energy efficiency and operational safety for AUVs in complex 3D domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), embodied artificial intelligence presents transformative opportunities for robotic manipulation tasks. Ultrasound imaging, a widely used and cost-effective medical diagnostic procedure, faces challenges due to the global shortage of professional sonographers. To address this issue, we propose USPilot, an embodied robotic assistant ultrasound system powered by an LLM-based framework to enable autonomous ultrasound acquisition. USPilot is designed to function as a virtual sonographer, capable of responding to patients' ultrasound-related queries and performing ultrasound scans based on user intent. By fine-tuning the LLM, USPilot demonstrates a deep understanding of ultrasound-specific questions and tasks. Furthermore, USPilot incorporates an LLM-enhanced Graph Neural Network (GNN) to manage ultrasound robotic APIs and serve as a task planner. Experimental results show that the LLM-enhanced GNN achieves unprecedented accuracy in task planning on public datasets. Additionally, the system demonstrates significant potential in autonomously understanding and executing ultrasound procedures. These advancements bring us closer to achieving autonomous and potentially unmanned robotic ultrasound systems, addressing critical resource gaps in medical imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00204v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Depending on multiple parameters, soft robots can exhibit different modes of locomotion that are difficult to model numerically. As a result, improving their performance is complex, especially in small-scale systems characterized by low Reynolds numbers, when multiple aero- and hydrodynamical processes influence their movement. In this work, we optimize light-powered millimetre-scale underwater swimmer locomotion by applying experimental results - measured swimming speed - as the fitness function in two evolutionary algorithms: particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm. As these soft, light-powered robots with different characteristics (phenotypes) can be fabricated quickly, they provide a great platform for optimisation experiments, using many competing robots to improve swimming speed over consecutive generations. Interestingly, just like in natural evolution, unexpected gene combinations led to surprisingly good results, including eight-fold increase in speed or the discovery of a self-oscillating underwater locomotion mode.</description>

Abstract: With the increasing demand for heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms to perform complex tasks in urban environments, system design now faces major challenges, including efficient semantic understanding, flexible task planning, and the ability to dynamically adjust coordination strategies in response to evolving environmental conditions and continuously changing task requirements. To address the limitations of existing approaches, this paper proposes coordination field agentic system for coordinating heterogeneous UAV swarms in complex urban scenarios. In this system, large language models (LLMs) is responsible for interpreting high-level human instructions and converting them into executable commands for the UAV swarms, such as patrol and target tracking. Subsequently, a Coordination field mechanism is proposed to guide UAV motion and task selection, enabling decentralized and adaptive allocation of emergent tasks. A total of 50 rounds of comparative testing were conducted across different models in a 2D simulation space to evaluate their performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior performance in terms of task coverage, response time, and adaptability to dynamic changes.</description>

      <title>GrowSplat: Constructing Temporal Digital Twins of Plants with Gaussian Splats</title>

Abstract: Accurate temporal reconstructions of plant growth are essential for plant phenotyping and breeding, yet remain challenging due to complex geometries, occlusions, and non-rigid deformations of plants. We present a novel framework for building temporal digital twins of plants by combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with a robust sample alignment pipeline. Our method begins by reconstructing Gaussian Splats from multi-view camera data, then leverages a two-stage registration approach: coarse alignment through feature-based matching and Fast Global Registration, followed by fine alignment with Iterative Closest Point. This pipeline yields a consistent 4D model of plant development in discrete time steps. We evaluate the approach on data from the Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Center, demonstrating detailed temporal reconstructions of Sequoia and Quinoa species.

      <description>arXiv:2505.14030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise as generalist robotic policies by jointly leveraging visual, linguistic, and proprioceptive modalities to generate action trajectories. While recent benchmarks have advanced VLA research in domestic tasks, professional science-oriented domains remain underexplored. We introduce AutoBio, a simulation framework and benchmark designed to evaluate robotic automation in biology laboratory environments--an application domain that combines structured protocols with demanding precision and multimodal interaction. AutoBio extends existing simulation capabilities through a pipeline for digitizing real-world laboratory instruments, specialized physics plugins for mechanisms ubiquitous in laboratory workflows, and a rendering stack that support dynamic instrument interfaces and transparent materials through physically based rendering. Our benchmark comprises biologically grounded tasks spanning three difficulty levels, enabling standardized evaluation of language-guided robotic manipulation in experimental protocols. We provide infrastructure for demonstration generation and seamless integration with VLA models. Baseline evaluations with two SOTA VLA models reveal significant gaps in precision manipulation, visual reasoning, and instruction following in scientific workflows. By releasing AutoBio, we aim to catalyze research on generalist robotic systems for complex, high-precision, and multimodal professional environments. The simulator and benchmark are publicly available to facilitate reproducible research.</description>

      <title>Hume: Introducing System-2 Thinking in Visual-Language-Action Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans practice slow thinking before performing actual actions when handling complex tasks in the physical world. This thinking paradigm, recently, has achieved remarkable advancement in boosting Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks in digital domains. However, the potential of slow thinking remains largely unexplored for robotic foundation models interacting with the physical world. In this work, we propose Hume: a dual-system Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with value-guided System-2 thinking and cascaded action denoising, exploring human-like thinking capabilities of Vision-Language-Action models for dexterous robot control. System 2 of Hume implements value-Guided thinking by extending a Vision-Language-Action Model backbone with a novel value-query head to estimate the state-action value of predicted actions. The value-guided thinking is conducted by repeat sampling multiple action candidates and selecting one according to state-action value. System 1 of Hume is a lightweight reactive visuomotor policy that takes System 2 selected action and performs cascaded action denoising for dexterous robot control. At deployment time, System 2 performs value-guided thinking at a low frequency while System 1 asynchronously receives the System 2 selected action candidate and predicts fluid actions in real time. We show that Hume outperforms the existing state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models across multiple simulation benchmark and real-robot deployments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present DexUMI - a data collection and policy learning framework that uses the human hand as the natural interface to transfer dexterous manipulation skills to various robot hands. DexUMI includes hardware and software adaptations to minimize the embodiment gap between the human hand and various robot hands. The hardware adaptation bridges the kinematics gap using a wearable hand exoskeleton. It allows direct haptic feedback in manipulation data collection and adapts human motion to feasible robot hand motion. The software adaptation bridges the visual gap by replacing the human hand in video data with high-fidelity robot hand inpainting. We demonstrate DexUMI's capabilities through comprehensive real-world experiments on two different dexterous robot hand hardware platforms, achieving an average task success rate of 86%.</description>

      <title>DORAEMON: Decentralized Ontology-aware Reliable Agent with Enhanced Memory Oriented Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive navigation in unfamiliar environments is crucial for household service robots but remains challenging due to the need for both low-level path planning and high-level scene understanding. While recent vision-language model (VLM) based zero-shot approaches reduce dependence on prior maps and scene-specific training data, they face significant limitations: spatiotemporal discontinuity from discrete observations, unstructured memory representations, and insufficient task understanding leading to navigation failures. We propose DORAEMON (Decentralized Ontology-aware Reliable Agent with Enhanced Memory Oriented Navigation), a novel cognitive-inspired framework consisting of Ventral and Dorsal Streams that mimics human navigation capabilities. The Dorsal Stream implements the Hierarchical Semantic-Spatial Fusion and Topology Map to handle spatiotemporal discontinuities, while the Ventral Stream combines RAG-VLM and Policy-VLM to improve decision-making. Our approach also develops Nav-Ensurance to ensure navigation safety and efficiency. We evaluate DORAEMON on the HM3D, MP3D, and GOAT datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance on both success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL) metrics, significantly outperforming existing methods. We also introduce a new evaluation metric (AORI) to assess navigation intelligence better. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DORAEMON's effectiveness in zero-shot autonomous navigation without requiring prior map building or pre-training.</description>

      <title>ReinFlow: Fine-tuning Flow Matching Policy with Online Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose ReinFlow, a simple yet effective online reinforcement learning (RL) framework that fine-tunes a family of flow matching policies for continuous robotic control. Derived from rigorous RL theory, ReinFlow injects learnable noise into a flow policy's deterministic path, converting the flow into a discrete-time Markov Process for exact and straightforward likelihood computation. This conversion facilitates exploration and ensures training stability, enabling ReinFlow to fine-tune diverse flow model variants, including Rectified Flow [35] and Shortcut Models [19], particularly at very few or even one denoising step. We benchmark ReinFlow in representative locomotion and manipulation tasks, including long-horizon planning with visual input and sparse reward. The episode reward of Rectified Flow policies obtained an average net growth of 135.36% after fine-tuning in challenging legged locomotion tasks while saving denoising steps and 82.63% of wall time compared to state-of-the-art diffusion RL fine-tuning method DPPO [43]. The success rate of the Shortcut Model policies in state and visual manipulation tasks achieved an average net increase of 40.34% after fine-tuning with ReinFlow at four or even one denoising step, whose performance is comparable to fine-tuned DDIM policies while saving computation time for an average of 23.20%.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has driven significant progress in robotics, but its complexity and long training times remain major bottlenecks. In this report, we introduce FastTD3, a simple, fast, and capable RL algorithm that significantly speeds up training for humanoid robots in popular suites such as HumanoidBench, IsaacLab, and MuJoCo Playground. Our recipe is remarkably simple: we train an off-policy TD3 agent with several modifications -- parallel simulation, large-batch updates, a distributional critic, and carefully tuned hyperparameters. FastTD3 solves a range of HumanoidBench tasks in under 3 hours on a single A100 GPU, while remaining stable during training. We also provide a lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of FastTD3 to accelerate RL research in robotics.</description>

      <title>Information Entropy Guided Height-aware Histogram for Quantization-friendly Pillar Feature Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18734v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time and high-performance 3D object detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving and robotics. Recent pillar-based 3D object detectors have gained significant attention due to their compact representation and low computational overhead, making them suitable for onboard deployment and quantization. However, existing pillar-based detectors still suffer from information loss along height dimension and large numerical distribution difference during pillar feature encoding (PFE), which severely limits their performance and quantization potential. To address above issue, we first unveil the importance of different input information during PFE and identify the height dimension as a key factor in enhancing 3D detection performance. Motivated by this observation, we propose a height-aware pillar feature encoder, called PillarHist. Specifically, PillarHist statistics the discrete distribution of points at different heights within one pillar with the information entropy guidance. This simple yet effective design greatly preserves the information along the height dimension while significantly reducing the computation overhead of the PFE. Meanwhile, PillarHist also constrains the arithmetic distribution of PFE input to a stable range, making it quantization-friendly. Notably, PillarHist operates exclusively within the PFE stage to enhance performance, enabling seamless integration into existing pillar-based methods without introducing complex operations. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PillarHist in terms of both efficiency and performance.</description>

      <title>SCoTT: Strategic Chain-of-Thought Tasking for Wireless-Aware Robot Navigation in Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Path planning under wireless performance constraints is a complex challenge in robot navigation. However, naively incorporating such constraints into classical planning algorithms often incurs prohibitive search costs. In this paper, we propose SCoTT, a wireless-aware path planning framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to co-optimize average path gains and trajectory length using wireless heatmap images and ray-tracing data from a digital twin (DT). At the core of our framework is Strategic Chain-of-Thought Tasking (SCoTT), a novel prompting paradigm that decomposes the exhaustive search problem into structured subtasks, each solved via chain-of-thought prompting. To establish strong baselines, we compare classical A* and wireless-aware extensions of it, and derive DP-WA*, an optimal, iterative dynamic programming algorithm that incorporates all path gains and distance metrics from the DT, but at significant computational cost. In extensive experiments, we show that SCoTT achieves path gains within 2% of DP-WA* while consistently generating shorter trajectories. Moreover, SCoTT's intermediate outputs can be used to accelerate DP-WA* by reducing its search space, saving up to 62% in execution time. We validate our framework using four VLMs, demonstrating effectiveness across both large and small models, thus making it applicable to a wide range of compact models at low inference cost. We also show the practical viability of our approach by deploying SCoTT as a ROS node within Gazebo simulations. Finally, we discuss data acquisition pipelines, compute requirements, and deployment considerations for VLMs in 6G-enabled DTs, underscoring the potential of natural language interfaces for wireless-aware navigation in real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in 3D scenes based on textual descriptions, essential for applications like augmented reality and robotics. Traditional 3DVG approaches rely on annotated 3D datasets and predefined object categories, limiting scalability and adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SeeGround, a zero-shot 3DVG framework leveraging 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on large-scale 2D data. SeeGround represents 3D scenes as a hybrid of query-aligned rendered images and spatially enriched text descriptions, bridging the gap between 3D data and 2D-VLMs input formats. We propose two modules: the Perspective Adaptation Module, which dynamically selects viewpoints for query-relevant image rendering, and the Fusion Alignment Module, which integrates 2D images with 3D spatial descriptions to enhance object localization. Extensive experiments on ScanRefer and Nr3D demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing zero-shot methods by large margins. Notably, we exceed weakly supervised methods and rival some fully supervised ones, outperforming previous SOTA by 7.7% on ScanRefer and 7.1% on Nr3D, showcasing its effectiveness in complex 3DVG tasks.</description>

      <title>FlexEvent: Towards Flexible Event-Frame Object Detection at Varying Operational Frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages for real-time perception in dynamic environments, thanks to the microsecond-level temporal resolution and asynchronous operation. Existing event detectors, however, are limited by fixed-frequency paradigms and fail to fully exploit the high-temporal resolution and adaptability of event data. To address these limitations, we propose FlexEvent, a novel framework that enables detection at varying frequencies. Our approach consists of two key components: FlexFuse, an adaptive event-frame fusion module that integrates high-frequency event data with rich semantic information from RGB frames, and FlexTune, a frequency-adaptive fine-tuning mechanism that generates frequency-adjusted labels to enhance model generalization across varying operational frequencies. This combination allows our method to detect objects with high accuracy in both fast-moving and static scenarios, while adapting to dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on large-scale event camera datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in both standard and high-frequency settings. Notably, our method maintains robust performance when scaling from 20 Hz to 90 Hz and delivers accurate detection up to 180 Hz, proving its effectiveness in extreme conditions. Our framework sets a new benchmark for event-based object detection and paves the way for more adaptable, real-time vision systems. Code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Learning from Suboptimal Data in Continuous Control via Auto-Regressive Soft Q-Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous control often requires large amounts of online interaction data. Value-based RL methods can mitigate this burden by offering relatively high sample efficiency. Some studies further enhance sample efficiency by incorporating offline demonstration data to "kick-start" training, achieving promising results in continuous control. However, they typically compute the Q-function independently for each action dimension, neglecting interdependencies and making it harder to identify optimal actions when learning from suboptimal data, such as non-expert demonstration and online-collected data during the training process. To address these issues, we propose Auto-Regressive Soft Q-learning (ARSQ), a value-based RL algorithm that models Q-values in a coarse-to-fine, auto-regressive manner. First, ARSQ decomposes the continuous action space into discrete spaces in a coarse-to-fine hierarchy, enhancing sample efficiency for fine-grained continuous control tasks. Next, it auto-regressively predicts dimensional action advantages within each decision step, enabling more effective decision-making in continuous control tasks. We evaluate ARSQ on two continuous control benchmarks, RLBench and D4RL, integrating demonstration data into online training. On D4RL, which includes non-expert demonstrations, ARSQ achieves an average $1.62\times$ performance improvement over SOTA value-based baseline. On RLBench, which incorporates expert demonstrations, ARSQ surpasses various baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning from suboptimal online-collected data.

      <title>GeoDrive: 3D Geometry-Informed Driving World Model with Precise Action Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in world models have revolutionized dynamic environment simulation, allowing systems to foresee future states and assess potential actions. In autonomous driving, these capabilities help vehicles anticipate the behavior of other road users, perform risk-aware planning, accelerate training in simulation, and adapt to novel scenarios, thereby enhancing safety and reliability. Current approaches exhibit deficiencies in maintaining robust 3D geometric consistency or accumulating artifacts during occlusion handling, both critical for reliable safety assessment in autonomous navigation tasks. To address this, we introduce GeoDrive, which explicitly integrates robust 3D geometry conditions into driving world models to enhance spatial understanding and action controllability. Specifically, we first extract a 3D representation from the input frame and then obtain its 2D rendering based on the user-specified ego-car trajectory. To enable dynamic modeling, we propose a dynamic editing module during training to enhance the renderings by editing the positions of the vehicles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing models in both action accuracy and 3D spatial awareness, leading to more realistic, adaptable, and reliable scene modeling for safer autonomous driving. Additionally, our model can generalize to novel trajectories and offers interactive scene editing capabilities, such as object editing and object trajectory control.</description>
