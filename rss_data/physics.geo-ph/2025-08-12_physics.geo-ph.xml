      <title>Tidal Triggering of Magnitude 7+ Earthquakes by Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work uses a chi-squared test of independence to determine if days that include earthquakes greater than or equal to magnitude 7 (M7+) from 1960 to 2024 are truly independent of the position of Earth in its orbit around the sun. To this end, this study breaks up Earth's orbit into days offset on either side of two reference Earth-Sun-Planet orientations, or zero-points: opposition and inferior conjunction. A computer program is used to sample U.S.G.S. earthquake and N.A.S.A. Horizons ephemeris data for the last 64 years with the purpose of conducting 28,782 chi-squared tests-of-independence for all intervals (5 to 45 days) spanning the entirety of Earth's synodic period relative to these zero points for Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, and Mars. For Jupiter, 1,071 statistically significant intervals of M7+ activity are associated with two particular points: the inferior conjunction and what is here termed the "preceding neap" position. At both of these points, M7+ activity first increases (&gt;125% average) and then sharply decreases in a pulse-like fashion, with those lulls in M7+ activity (&lt;75% of average) lasting about a month. Both of these pulses of M7+ activity begin at Sun-Observer-Target (SOT) Angles near 45 degrees and 135 degrees, and this also observed for Venus and Saturn; Mars synodic period prevented any comparison of chi-squared intervals to SOT Angle. Although this study did not observe any obvious correlation of M7+ activity with the lunar cycle, the medians, means, and modes of the significant intervals returned by the chi-squared analysis for Jupiter range from 27 to 34 days, suggesting that intervals are more likely to be found significant by the chi-squared analysis if they average out the lunar cycle.</description>

      <title>Forward and adjoint calculations of gravitational potential in heterogeneous, aspherical planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a computational package for the calculation of numerically exact internal and external gravitational potential, its functional derivatives and sensitivity kernels, in an aspherical, heterogeneous planet. We detail our implementation, utilizing a transformation of the Poisson equation into a reference domain, as well as a pseudospectral/spectral element discretisation. The use of the forward solver within the package is demonstrated by calculating the gravitational potential of Phobos with homogeneous and heterogeneous density models. Equations for the first-order perturbation expansion of potential in the referential formulation are found, and the magnitude of the error is quantified based on the exact method. The adjoint Poisson equation is derived, and from it the sensitivity kernels for objective functionals of the potential, which are calculated for Phobos. The expression for perturbations to an objective functional is reduced to a single body and surface integral. Finally, a relation is obtained between the sensitivity kernels which must be satisfied when using a computational domain different to the physical domain.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Analytical Turbulence Closures for Quasi-Geostrophic Ocean Flows with Coastal Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical turbulence simulations typically involve parameterizations such as Large Eddy Simulations (LES). Applications to geophysical flows, especially ocean flows, are further complicated by the presence of complex topography and interior landforms such as coastlines, islands, and capes. In this work, we extend pseudo-spectral quasi-geostrophic (QG) numerical schemes and GPU-based solvers to simulate flows with coastal boundaries using the Brinkman volume penalization approach. We incorporate sponging and a splitting scheme to handle inflow and aperiodic boundary conditions. We evaluate four analytical sub-grid-scale (SGS) closures based on the eddy viscosity hypothesis: the standard Smagorinsky and Leith closures, and their dynamic variants. We show applications to QG flows past circular islands and capes with the beta-plane approximation. We perform both a priori analysis of the SGS closure terms as well as a posteriori assessment of the SGS terms and simulated vorticity fields. Our results showcase differences between the various closures, especially their approach to phase and feature reconstruction errors in the presence of coastal boundaries.</description>
