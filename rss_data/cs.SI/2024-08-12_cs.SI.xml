      <title>Higher-Order Temporal Network Prediction and Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A social interaction (so-called higher-order event/interaction) can be regarded as the activation of the hyperlink among the corresponding individuals. Social interactions can be, thus, represented as higher-order temporal networks, that record the higher-order events occurring at each time step over time. The prediction of higher-order interactions is usually overlooked in traditional temporal network prediction methods, where a higher-order interaction is regarded as a set of pairwise interactions. The prediction of future higher-order interactions is crucial to forecast and mitigate the spread the information, epidemics and opinion on higher-order social contact networks. In this paper, we propose novel memory-based models for higher-order temporal network prediction. By using these models, we aim to predict the higher-order temporal network one time step ahead, based on the network observed in the past. Importantly, we also intent to understand what network properties and which types of previous interactions enable the prediction. The design and performance analysis of these models are supported by our analysis of the memory property of networks, e.g., similarity of the network and activity of a hyperlink over time respectively. Our models assume that a target hyperlink's future activity (active or not) depends the past activity of the target link and of all or selected types of hyperlinks that overlap with the target. We then compare the performance of both models with a baseline utilizing a pairwise temporal network prediction method. In eight real-world networks, we find that both models consistently outperform the baseline and the refined model tends to perform the best. Our models also reveal how past interactions of the target hyperlink and different types of hyperlinks that overlap with the target contribute to the prediction of the target's future activity.</description>

      <title>A model for efficient dynamical ranking in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a physics-inspired method for inferring dynamic rankings in directed temporal networks - networks in which each directed and timestamped edge reflects the outcome and timing of a pairwise interaction. The inferred ranking of each node is real-valued and varies in time as each new edge, encoding an outcome like a win or loss, raises or lowers the node's estimated strength or prestige, as is often observed in real scenarios including sequences of games, tournaments, or interactions in animal hierarchies. Our method works by solving a linear system of equations and requires only one parameter to be tuned. As a result, the corresponding algorithm is scalable and efficient. We test our method by evaluating its ability to predict interactions (edges' existence) and their outcomes (edges' directions) in a variety of applications, including both synthetic and real data. Our analysis shows that in many cases our method's performance is better than existing methods for predicting dynamic rankings and interaction outcomes.</description>

      <title>DisenSemi: Semi-supervised Graph Classification via Disentangled Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph classification is a critical task in numerous multimedia applications, where graphs are employed to represent diverse types of multimedia data, including images, videos, and social networks. Nevertheless, in real-world scenarios, labeled graph data can be limited or scarce. To address this issue, we focus on the problem of semi-supervised graph classification, which involves both supervised and unsupervised models learning from labeled and unlabeled data. In contrast to recent approaches that transfer the entire knowledge from the unsupervised model to the supervised one, we argue that an effective transfer should only retain the relevant semantics that align well with the supervised task. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named DisenSemi, which learns disentangled representation for semi-supervised graph classification. Specifically, a disentangled graph encoder is proposed to generate factor-wise graph representations for both supervised and unsupervised models. Then we train two models via supervised objective and mutual information (MI)-based constraints respectively. To ensure the meaningful transfer of knowledge from the unsupervised encoder to the supervised one, we further define an MI-based disentangled consistency regularization between two models and identify the corresponding rationale that aligns well with the current graph classification task. Experimental results on a range of publicly accessible datasets reveal the effectiveness of our DisenSemi.</description>
