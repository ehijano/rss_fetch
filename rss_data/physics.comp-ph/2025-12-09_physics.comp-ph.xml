      <title>Physics Enhanced Deep Surrogates for the Phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing materials with controlled heat flow at the nano-scale is central to advances in microelectronics, thermoelectrics, and energy-conversion technologies. At these scales, phonon transport follows the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE), which captures non-diffusive (ballistic) effects but is too costly to solve repeatedly in inverse-design loops. Existing surrogate approaches trade speed for accuracy: fast macroscopic solvers can overestimate conductivities by hundreds of percent, while recent data-driven operator learners often require thousands of high-fidelity simulations. This creates a need for a fast, data-efficient surrogate that remains reliable across ballistic and diffusive regimes. We introduce a Physics-Enhanced Deep Surrogate (PEDS) that combines a differentiable Fourier solver with a neural generator and couples it with uncertainty-driven active learning. The Fourier solver acts as a physical inductive bias, while the network learns geometry-dependent corrections and a mixing coefficient that interpolates between macroscopic and nano-scale behavior. PEDS reduces training-data requirements by up to 70% compared with purely data-driven baselines, achieves roughly 5% fractional error with only 300 high-fidelity BTE simulations, and enables efficient design of porous geometries spanning 12-85 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ with average design errors of 4%. The learned mixing parameter recovers the ballistic-diffusive transition and improves out of distribution robustness. These results show that embedding simple, differentiable low-fidelity physics can dramatically increase surrogate data-efficiency and interpretability, making repeated PDE-constrained optimization practical for nano-scale thermal-materials design.</description>

      <title>MaxwellLink: A unified framework for self-consistent light-matter simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in light-matter simulations is bridging the disparate time and length scales of electrodynamics and molecular dynamics. Current computational approaches often rely on heuristic approximations of either the electromagnetic (EM) or material component, hindering the exploration of complex light-matter systems. Herein, MaxwellLink -- a modular, open-source Python framework -- is developed for the massively parallel, self-consistent propagation of classical EM fields interacting with a large heterogeneous molecular ensemble. The package utilizes a robust TCP/UNIX socket interface to couple EM solvers with a wide range of external molecular drivers. This decoupled architecture allows users to seamlessly switch between levels of theory of either the EM solver or molecules without modifying the counterpart. Crucially, MaxwellLink supports EM solvers spanning from single-mode cavities to full-feature three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) engines, and molecules described by multilevel open quantum systems, force-field and first-principles molecular dynamics, and nonadiabatic real-time Ehrenfest dynamics. Benefiting from the socket-based design, the EM engine and molecular drivers scale independently across multiple high-performance computing (HPC) nodes, facilitating large-scale simulations previously inaccessible to existing numerical schemes. The versatility and accuracy of this code are demonstrated through applications including superradiance, radiative energy transfer, vibrational strong coupling in Bragg resonators, and plasmonic heating of molecular gases. By providing a unified, extensible engine, MaxwellLink potentially offers a powerful platform for exploring emerging phenomena across the research fronts of spectroscopy, quantum optics, plasmonics, and polaritonics.</description>

      <title>Optimized Machine Learning Methods for Studying the Thermodynamic Behavior of Complex Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as an efficient and versatile tool for the analysis of critical and low-temperature phase states in spin system models. The problem of calculating the dependence of the average energy on the spatial distribution of exchange integrals for the Edwards-Anderson model on a square lattice with frustrated interactions is considered. We further construct a single convolutional classifier of phase states of the ferromagnetic Ising model on square, triangular, honeycomb, and kagome lattices, trained on configurations generated by the Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithm. Computed temperature profiles of the averaged posterior probability of the high-temperature phase form clear S-shaped curves that intersect in the vicinity of the theoretical critical temperatures and allow one to determine the critical temperature for the kagome lattice without additional retraining. It is shown that convolutional models substantially reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) compared with fully connected architectures and efficiently capture complex correlations between thermodynamic characteristics and the structure of magnetic correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Conservative adaptive-precision interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive precision molecular dynamics simulations have developed along energy- and force-coupling approaches, which allow for a continuous transition between different particle descriptions or interaction potentials. Most approaches consider different (fixed) spatial regions, which control the transition between the descriptions and consequently avoid a consistent momentum-conserving Hamiltonian description. We present here a new approach to fully integrate the coupling into a Hamiltonian, therefore allowing for a conservative description, which, by design, guarantees both energy and momentum conservation. By coupling a fast EAM potential to a highly accurate ACE potential, we verify numerically the conservation properties and show that one can achieve - dependent on both the potential and the atomistic system - a speedup of one or two orders of magnitude compared to a pure ACE simulation.</description>

      <title>Multi-resolution Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network for Complex Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MRPARCv2, Multi-resolution Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network, designed to model complex flows by embedding the structure of advection-diffusion-reaction equations and leveraging a multi-resolution architecture. MRPARCv2 introduces hierarchical discretization and cross-resolution feature communication to improve the accuracy and efficiency of flow simulations. We evaluate the model on a challenging 2D turbulent radiative layer dataset from The Well multi-physics benchmark repository and demonstrate significant improvements when compared to the single resolution baseline model, in both Variance Scaled Root Mean Squared Error and physics-driven metrics, including turbulent kinetic energy spectra and mass-temperature distributions. Despite having 30% fewer trainable parameters, MRPARCv2 outperforms its predecessor by up to 50% in roll-out prediction error and 86% in spectral error. A preliminary study on uncertainty quantification was performed, and we also analyzed the model's performance under different levels of abstractions of the flow, specifically on sampling subsets of field variables. We find that the absence of physical constraints on the equation of state (EOS) in the network architecture leads to degraded accuracy. A variable substitution experiment confirms that this issue persists regardless of which physical quantity is predicted directly. Our findings highlight the advantages of multi-resolution inductive bias for capturing multi-scale flow dynamics and suggest the need for future PIML models to embed EOS knowledge to enhance physical fidelity.</description>

      <title>Polarons from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article reviews recent theoretical developments in the ab initio study of polarons in materials. The polaron is an emergent quasiparticle that arises from the interaction between electrons and phonons in solids, and consists of an electron or a hole accompanied by a distortion of the crystal lattice. Recent advances in experiments, theory, and computation have made it possible to investigate these quasiparticles with unprecedented detail, reigniting the interest in this classic problem of condensed matter physics. Recent theoretical and computational advances include ab initio calculations of polaron spectral functions, wavefunctions, lattice distortions, and transport and optical properties. These developments provide new insight into polaron physics, but they have evolved somewhat independently from the earlier effective Hamiltonian approaches that laid the foundation of the field. This article aims to bridge these complementary perspectives by placing them within a single unified conceptual framework. To this end, we start by reviewing effective Hamiltonians of historical significance in polaron theory, ab initio techniques based on density functional theory, and many-body first-principles approaches to polarons. After this survey, we outline a general field-theoretic framework that bridges between these diverse approaches to polaron physics. For completeness, we also review recent progress in the study of exciton polarons and self-trapped excitons and their relations to polarons. Beyond the methodology, we discuss recent applications to several classes of materials that attracted attention in the context of polaron physics.</description>

      <title>Protocol to evaluate the viscoelastic response of a polymer suspension to an active agent via oscillatory shear rheometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microorganisms inhabit viscoelastic environments, where their locomotion can deform polymers and trigger local complex viscoelastic responses. However, a systematic approach to quantify such responses remains lacking. Here, we propose a protocol that maps the shear effect induced by an active agent to oscillatory shear rheometry. The central idea is to establish a correspondence between the mean shear rate generated by swimming and that produced by an oscillating plate. In this mapping, the swimming velocity and active stress are translated into an effective oscillation frequency and strain amplitude. The resulting viscoelastic response can then be evaluated by standard oscillatory rheometry. The protocol is validated using lattice Boltzmann simulations of a squirmer embedded in polymer solutions. Our framework is generic and can be naturally extended to active microrheology, providing a pathway to quantify swimmer-induced viscoelasticity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for pioneering contributions at the intersection of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and spin-glass physics, underscoring the profound connections between these fields. The topological similarities between ANNs and Ising-type models, such as the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, reveal shared structures that bridge statistical physics and machine learning. In this perspective, we explore how concepts and methods from statistical physics, particularly those related to glassy and disordered systems like spin glasses, are applied to the study and development of ANNs. We discuss the key differences, common features, and deep interconnections between spin glasses and neural networks while highlighting future directions for this interdisciplinary research. Special attention is given to the synergy between spin-glass studies and neural network advancements and the challenges that remain in statistical physics for ANNs. Finally, we examine the transformative role that quantum computing could play in addressing these challenges and propelling this research frontier forward.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical geometric deep learning enables scalable analysis of molecular dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations can generate atomically detailed trajectories of complex systems, but analyzing these dynamics can be challenging when systems lack well-established quantitative descriptors (features). Graph neural networks (GNNs) in which messages are passed between nodes that represent atoms that are spatial neighbors promise to obviate manual feature engineering, but the use of GNNs with biomolecular systems of more than a few hundred residues has been limited in the context of analyzing dynamics by both difficulties in capturing the details of long-range interactions with message passing and the memory and runtime requirements associated with large graphs. Here, we show how local information can be aggregated to reduce memory and runtime requirements without sacrificing atomic detail. We demonstrate that this approach opens the door to analyzing simulations of protein-nucleic acid complexes with thousands of residues on single GPUs within minutes. For systems with hundreds of residues, for which there are sufficient data to make quantitative comparisons, we show that the approach improves performance and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Half-explicit Runge-Kutta integrators for variational multiscale turbulence modeling: Toward higher-order accuracy in space and time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The residual-based variational multiscale (VMS) formulation has achieved remarkable success in large-eddy simulation of turbulent flows. However, its temporal discretization has largely remained limited to second-order implicit schemes. The present work aims at advancing this direction through the introduction of Runge-Kutta (RK) schemes within the VMS framework in a mathematically consistent manner. Guided by the Rothe method, the half-explicit RK scheme is employed as its accuracy is theoretically guaranteed for index-2 differential-algebraic equations. Owing to the explicit treatment of the nonlinear term, the resulting spatial problem exhibits a structure analogous to that of the Darcy equation. Following the philosophy of the VMS analysis, a subgrid-scale model is derived without invoking linearization based on perturbation series and related assumptions. The analysis further reveals that the parameter in the subgrid model is independent of the spatial mesh size. Fourier analysis demonstrates that the Rothe method, compared with the conventional vertical method of lines, provides improved dissipation and dispersion properties and exhibits a larger stability region for convection-dominated regimes. In the Taylor-Green vortex benchmark, the proposed schemes demonstrate superior performance as a large-eddy simulation model, achieving higher fidelity in predicting the kinetic energy evolution, energy spectra, and vortex structures than the conventional VMS formulation. Simulations of the open cavity flow further show that the proposed schemes can accurately capture the periodic limit cycle caused by the supercritical Hopf bifurcation, confirming its effectiveness and fidelity for highly sensitive flow instability problems.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Link Prediction Methods Integrating Network Topological Features and Embedding Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Link prediction, as a frontier task in complex network topology analysis, aims to infer the existence of latent links between node pairs based on observed nodes and structural information. We propose an ensemble link prediction model that integrates network topology features and embedding representations (TELP), designed to overcome the limitations of conventional heuristic methods in capturing node attributes and deep structural patterns, as well as the weak interpretability and limited generalization of learning-based approaches. TELP leverages a multi-stage architecture. Local connectivity patterns are captured through network-type-aware selection of homogeneous and heterogeneous topology features, which also promotes interpretability. To incorporate global structure, Node2Vec embeddings are generated and fused with these topology features, resulting in comprehensive multi-dimensional representations. Building on this enriched feature space, an ensemble of logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models is deployed to maximize predictive performance and robustness. Experiments on nine classical benchmark networks demonstrate that TELP achieves superior AUC and AP performance compared with traditional heuristic approaches and mainstream graph neural network models, while ablation studies further confirm that feature fusion and ensemble strategies are essential for optimal performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare experiments and fully-resolved particle simulations designed to match the experimental conditions of a weakly inertial, neutrally buoyant, moderately oblate spheroid in shear flow under confinement. Experimental and numerical results are benchmarked against theory valid for asymptotically small particle Reynolds numbers and for unconfined systems. By considering the combined effects of confinement and inertia, sensitivity to initial conditions, and the time span of observation, we reconcile the findings of theory, experiments, and numerical simulations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that confinement significantly influences the orientational stability of log-rolling spheroids compared to weak inertia, with the primary consequence being a reduced drift rate towards the stable log-rolling orbit.</description>

      <title>BO-PBK: A comprehensive solver for dispersion relations of obliquely propagating waves in magnetized multi-species plasma with anisotropic loss-cone drift product-bi-kappa distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present BO-PBK (BO-Product-Bi-Kappa), a new solver for kinetic dispersion relations of obliquely propagating waves in magnetized plasmas with complex velocity distributions. It reformulates the linearized Vlasov-Maxwell system into a compact eigenvalue problem, enabling direct computation of multiple wave branches and unstable modes without iterative initial-value searches. Key innovations include a unified framework supporting product-bi-kappa, kappa-Maxwellian, bi-Maxwellian, and hybrid distributions with multi-component and loss-cone features; a concise rational-form eigenvalue formulation; and a 2--3 times reduction in matrix dimensions compared to the BO-KM solver, with improved efficiency at larger kappa indices. Benchmark tests confirm accurate reproduction of standard kinetic results and efficient resolution of waves and instabilities. BO-PBK thus provides a computationally efficient tool for wave and stability analysis in space and laboratory plasmas.</description>

      <title>Probing Anharmonic Lattice Dynamics and Thermal Transport in Layered Perovskite LiYTiO4 Anode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered perovskite lithium yttrium titanate ($\rm LiYTiO_4$) has recently emerged as a promising low-potential, ultrahigh-rate intercalation-type anode material for lithium-ion batteries; however, its lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties remain poorly understood, limiting a complete evaluation of its practical potential. Here, we combine experimental measurements with theoretical modeling to systematically investigate the anharmonic lattice dynamics and heat transport in $\rm LiYTiO_4$. We employ a neural evolution potential (NEP)-based framework that integrates the temperature-dependent effective potential method with the Wigner thermal transport (WTT) formalism, explicitly including both diagonal and off-diagonal terms of the heat-flux operator. Zero-temperature phonon calculations reveal dynamical instabilities associated with $\rm TiO_6$ octahedral rotation, which are stabilized at finite temperatures through anharmonic renormalization. Using the WTT approach with contributions from phonon propagation and coherence contributions, we predict a room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$) of 3.8 $\rm Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$ averaged over all crystal orientations, in close agreement with the measured value of 3.2 \pm 0.08 $\rm Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$ for polycrystalline samples. To further examine the possible influence of ionic motion on high-temperature thermal transport, we compute $\kappa_{\rm L}$ using a Green-Kubo equilibrium molecular dynamics approach based on the same NEP, which yields consistent results with both experiment and WTT predictions, confirming the negligible role of Li-ion mobility in heat conduction. Our study not only identifies the ultralow thermal conductivity of $\rm LiYTiO_4$ as a key limitation for its practical application but also establishes a reliable computational framework for studying thermal properties in battery materials.</description>

      <title>Surrogate-assisted airfoil optimization in rarefied gas flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With growing interest in space exploration, optimized airfoil design has become increasingly important. However, airfoil design in rarefied gas flows remains underexplored because solving the Boltzmann equation formulated in a six dimensional phase space is time consuming. To address this problem, a solver-in-the-loop Bayesian optimization framework for symmetric, thickness-only airfoils is developed. First, airfoils are parameterized using a class shape transformation that enforce geometric admissibility. Second, a Gaussian process expected improvement surrogate is coupled in batches to a fast converging, asymptotic preserving Boltzmann solver for sample efficient exploration. Drag minimizing airfoils are identified in a wide range of gas rarefaction. It is found that, at Mach numbers Ma=2 and 4, the streamwise force increases with the gas rarefaction and shifts from pressure dominated to shear dominated drag, while optimization reduces drag at all conditions. The benefit of optimization peaks in the weakly rarefied regime, about 30% at Ma=2 and 40 to 50% at Ma=4, and falls to a few percent in transition and free-molecular flow regimes. Drag decomposition shows that these gains come mainly from reduced pressure drag, with viscous drag almost unchanged. The optimal airfoils form a coherent rarefaction-aware family: they retain a smooth, single-peaked thickness profile, are aft-loaded at low gas rarefaction, and exhibit a forward shift of maximum thickness and thickness area toward mid-chord as gas rarefaction increases. These trends provide a physically interpretable map that narrows the design space.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Characterization of Brain Tissue Alterations in Brain Cancer Using Fractal, Multifractal, and IPR Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the structural alterations between healthy and diseased brain tissues using a multiparametric framework combining fractal analysis, fractal functional transformation, multifractal analysis, and the Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR) analysis. Accurate characterization of brain tissue microstructure is crucial for early detection and diagnosis of cancer. By applying box-counting methods on brightfield microscopy images, we estimated the fractal dimension (Df) and its logarithmic (ln(Df)) and functional (ln(Dtf)) forms to highlight spatial irregularities in the tissue architecture. While Df and ln(Df) exhibited long-tailed distributions distinguishing healthy from cancer tissues, ln(Dtf) provided significantly improved differentiation by emphasizing local structural variations. Additionally, multifractal analysis revealed broader f({\alpha}) vs {\alpha} curves in cancerous samples, reflecting higher heterogeneity. IPR analysis based on light localization further demonstrated increased nanoscale variations in mass density, reflecting higher structural disorder in cancer tissues. Combining these complementary approaches creates a robust framework for measuring tissue complexity and holds great potential to improve microscopic diagnostic methods for brain cancer detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition state or minimum energy path finding methods constitute a routine component of the computational chemistry toolkit. Standard analysis involves trajectories conventionally plotted in terms of the relative energy to the initial state against a cumulative displacement variable, or the image number. These dimensional reductions obscure structural rearrangements in high dimensions and may often be trajectory dependent. This precludes the ability to compare optimization trajectories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimension surface defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using radial basis functions. This representation highlights optimization trajectories, identifies endpoint basins, and diagnoses convergence concerns invisible in one-dimensional profiles. We validate the framework on a cycloaddition reaction, showing that a machine-learned potential saddle and density functional theory reference lie on comparable energy contours despite geometric displacements.</description>

      <title>Non-Intrusive Data-Free Parametric Reduced Order Model for Geometrically Nonlinear Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully non-intrusive parametric reduced-order modeling (PROM) framework for geometrically nonlinear structures subject to geometric variations. The method builds upon equation-driven Galerkin ROMs constructed from vibration modes and modal-derivative companion vectors, while nonlinear reduced tensors are identified from standard finite element outputs. A database of such ROMs is generated over a set of training samples, and all reduced operators-including the linear stiffness matrix, the quadratic and cubic nonlinear tensors, the Rayleigh damping parameters, and the reduction basis-are interpolated using Radial Basis Functions (RBFs). A global reduced basis is obtained through a two-level POD compression, combined with a MAC-guided reordering strategy to ensure parametric smoothness. The resulting PROM preserves the symmetry and polynomial structure of the reduced equations, enabling robust and efficient adaptation to new parameter values. Analytical parameter sensitivities follow directly from the interpolation model. The approach is demonstrated on a parametrically curved panel and a wing-box with geometric variations, showing excellent agreement with high-fidelity simulations and enabling substantial reductions in computational cost for parametric analyses.</description>

      <title>An effective bath state approach to model infrared spectroscopy and intramolecular dynamics in complex molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a molecule contains more than a few atoms, its full-dimensional dynamics becomes untractable, especially when introducing temperature effects. In such a case, it can be interesting to focus only on a few degrees of freedom and to model the rest of the molecule as a finite-dimensional bath. In this prospect, we extend the effective bath state (EBS) method that we had first developed and benchmarked in [J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{160}, 044107 (2024)] to describe the spectroscopy and intramolecular dynamics of complex isolated molecules. The EBS method is a system-bath approach based on the coarse-graining of the bath into a reduced set of effective energy states. It allows for a significant reduction of the bath dimension and makes finite-temperature calculations more accessible. In order to treat a realistic molecule, the method is extended to include polynomial couplings in the bath coordinates. The ability of the method to model temperature-resolved infrared spectra and to follow population transfers between the vibrational modes of the molecule is first tested on a 10-mode model system. The extended method is then applied to the realistic case of phenylacetylene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the reuse of terms in the Jastrow factor between systems for use in the transcorrelated method, to reduce the number of optimisable parameters for a given system. In particular, we propose a workflow in which atom-specific parts of Jastrow factors, optimised in atoms, may be reused in the molecule, with only a few parameters in the electron-electron part of the Jastrow left to optimise, while maintaining performance. We find that the modified workflow not only reduces the number of terms needing to be optimised, but also improves the accuracy of xTC-CCSD(T) energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a variational Monte Carlo framework for trapped one-dimensional mixture of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fermions using Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) to construct universal neural-network wavefunction ans\"atze. The method can, in principle, achieve arbitrary accuracy, limited only by the Monte Carlo sampling and was checked against exact results at sub-percent precision. For attractive interactions, it captures pairing effects, and in the impurity case it agrees with known results. We present a method of systematic transfer learning in the number of network parameters, allowing for efficient training for a target precision. We vastly increase the efficiency of the method by incorporating the short-distance behavior of the wavefunction into the ans\"atz without biasing the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Ising model on a spherical surface, utilizing a Fibonacci lattice to approximate uniform coverage. This setup poses challenges in achieving consistent lattice distribution across the sphere for comparison with planar models. We employ Monte Carlo simulations, principal component analysis (PCA), graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to study spin configurations across a range of temperatures and to determine phase transition temperatures. The Fibonacci lattice, despite its uniformity, contains irregular sites that influence spin behavior. In the ferromagnetic case, sites with fewer neighbors exhibit a higher tendency for spin flips at low temperatures, though this effect weakens as temperature increases, leading to a higher phase transition temperature than in the planar Ising model. In the antiferromagnetic case, lattice irregularities induce geometric frustration, resulting in highly degenerate ground states and the phase transition temperature lower than the planar square lattice. Phase transition temperatures are derived through specific heat, magnetic susceptibility analysis and GCNs predictions, yielding $T_c$ values for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic scenarios. This work emphasizes the impact of the Fibonacci lattice's geometric properties-namely curvature and connectivity-on spin interactions in non-planar systems, with relevance to microgravity environments.</description>

Abstract: Numerical time integration is fundamental to the simulation of initial and boundary value problems. Traditionally, time integration schemes require adaptive time-stepping to ensure computational speed and sufficient accuracy. Although these methods are based on mathematical derivations related to the order of accuracy for the chosen integrator, they also rely on heuristic development to determine optimal time steps. In this work, we use an alternative approach based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to select the optimal time step for any time integrator method, balancing computational speed and accuracy. To explore the potential of our RL-based adaptive time-stepping approach, we choose a challenging model problem involving set-valued frictional instabilities at various spatiotemporal scales. This problem demonstrates the robustness of our strategy in handling nonsmooth problems, which present a demanding scenario for numerical integration. Specifically, we apply RL to the simulation of a seismic fault with Coulomb friction. Our findings indicate that RL can learn an optimal strategy for time integration, achieving up to a fourfold speed-up. Our RL-based adaptive integrator offers a new approach for time integration in various other problems in mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Parametric data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) that embed dependencies in a large number of input parameters are crucial for enabling many-query tasks in large-scale problems. These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard grid-based data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron-temperature-gradient-driven micro-instability simulation with six input parameters, we demonstrate that a predictive parametric optDMD ROM that is up to three orders of magnitude cheaper to evaluate can be constructed using only 28 high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations, enabled by the use of sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.</description>

Abstract: We propose an effective explicit numerical scheme for simulating solutions of stochastic differential equations with confining superlinear drift terms, driven by multiplicative heavy-tailed L\'evy noise. The scheme is designed to prevent explosion and accurately capture all finite moments of the solutions.
  In the purely Gaussian case, it correctly reproduces moments of sub-Gaussian tails of the solutions.
  This method is particularly well-suited for approximating statistical moments and other probabilistic characteristics of L\'evy flights in steep potential landscapes.</description>

Abstract: Tensor networks are a compressed format for multi-dimensional data. One-dimensional tensor networks -- often referred to as tensor trains (TT) or matrix product states (MPS) -- are increasingly being used as a numerical ansatz for continuum functions by ``quantizing'' the inputs into discrete binary digits. Here we demonstrate the power of more general tree tensor networks for this purpose. We provide direct constructions of a number of elementary functions as generic tree tensor networks and interpolative constructions for more complicated functions via a generalization of the tensor cross interpolation algorithm. For a range of multi-dimensional functions we show how more structured tree tensor networks offer a significantly more efficient ansatz than the commonly used tensor train. We demonstrate an application of our methods to solving multi-dimensional, non-linear Fredholm equations, providing a rigorous bound on the rank of the solution which, in turn, guarantees exponentially scaling accuracy with the size of the tree tensor network for certain problems.</description>

      <title>Learning Enhanced Ensemble Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The filtering distribution in hidden Markov models evolves according to the law of a mean-field model in state-observation space. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approximates this mean-field model with an ensemble of interacting particles, employing a Gaussian ansatz for the joint distribution of the state and observation at each observation time. These methods are robust, but the Gaussian ansatz limits accuracy. Here this shortcoming is addressed by using machine learning to map the joint predicted state and observation to the updated state estimate. The derivation of methods from a mean field formulation of the true filtering distribution suggests a single parametrization of the algorithm that can be deployed at different ensemble sizes. And we use a mean field formulation of the ensemble Kalman filter as an inductive bias for our architecture.
  To develop this perspective, in which the mean-field limit of the algorithm and finite interacting ensemble particle approximations share a common set of parameters, a novel form of neural operator is introduced, taking probability distributions as input: a measure neural mapping (MNM). A MNM is used to design a novel approach to filtering, the MNM-enhanced ensemble filter (MNMEF), which is defined in both the mean-field limit and for interacting ensemble particle approximations. The ensemble approach uses empirical measures as input to the MNM and is implemented using the set transformer, which is invariant to ensemble permutation and allows for different ensemble sizes. In practice fine-tuning of a small number of parameters, for specific ensemble sizes, further enhances the accuracy of the scheme. The promise of the approach is demonstrated by its superior root-mean-square-error performance relative to leading methods in filtering the Lorenz '96 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky models.</description>

Abstract: Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schr\"odinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state (\textit{s}-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. We show that the parameterization enables accurate simulations with fewer variational parameters, independent of time-step resolution. Furthermore, the smooth neural quantum state also allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.</description>

      <title>Numerical and Experimental Evaluation of Chip Evacuation and Lubricant Flow using Optimized Drill Heads for Ejector Deep Hole Drilling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ejector deep hole drilling offers great potential to utilize the typical advantages of deep hole drilling processes on conventional machining centers in a cost-effective and resource-efficient manner. However, maintaining reliable chip evacuation and stable process conditions often relies on high flow volumes of metalworking fluid, resulting in considerable energy consumption in industrial settings. Therefore, to analyze the highly sophisticated chip evacuation dynamics of the process, two flow-optimized drill heads and a reference drill head were evaluated with smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation using experimentally obtained chip shapes. In addition, modified drill heads were additively manufactured and experimentally investigated to validate the numerical results and to determine the positive effect on the necessary fluid flow for a stable ejector drilling process. The modifications aim to improve chip evacuation by reducing vortex formation and optimizing flow conditions near the cutting zone. Therefore, the minimum volume flow required for a stable drilling process without chip clogging is reduced, leading to an energy-efficient sustainable ejector drilling process.</description>

      <title>Conditionally adaptive augmented Lagrangian method for physics-informed learning of forward and inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present several key advances to the Physics and Equality Constrained Artificial Neural Networks (PECANN) framework, substantially improving its capacity to solve challenging partial differential equations (PDEs). Our enhancements broaden the framework's applicability and improve efficiency. First, we generalize the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) to support multiple, independent penalty parameters for enforcing heterogeneous constraints. Second, we introduce a constraint aggregation technique to address inefficiencies associated with point-wise enforcement. Third, we incorporate a single Fourier feature mapping to capture highly oscillatory solutions with multi-scale features, where alternative methods often require multiple mappings or costlier architectures. Fourth, a novel time-windowing strategy enables seamless long-time evolution without relying on discrete time models. Fifth, and critically, we propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM that accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for constraints with larger violations, while enabling coordinated updates of multiple penalty parameters. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU across diverse problems, including the transonic rarefaction problem, reversible scalar advection by a vortex, high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson's equations, and inverse heat source identification. The framework achieves competitive accuracy across all cases when compared with established methods and recent approaches based on Kolmogorov-Arnold networks. Collectively, these advances improve the robustness, computational efficiency, and applicability of PECANN to demanding problems in scientific computing.</description>

      <title>An exact multiple-time-step variational formulation for the committor and the transition rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a transition between two stable states, the committor is the probability that the dynamics leads to one stable state before the other. It can be estimated from trajectory data by minimizing an expression for the transition rate that depends on a lag time. We show that an existing such expression is minimized by the exact committor only when the lag time is a single time step, resulting in a biased estimate in practical applications. We introduce an alternative expression that is minimized by the exact committor at any lag time. The key idea is that, when trajectories enter the stable states, the times that they enter (stopping times) must be used for estimating the committor and transition rate instead of the lag time. Numerical tests on benchmark systems demonstrate that our committor and transition rate estimates are much less sensitive to the choice of lag time. We show how further accuracy for the transition rate can be achieved by combining results from two lag times. We also relate the transition rate expression to a variational approach for kinetic statistics based on the mean-squared residual and discuss further numerical considerations with the aid of a decomposition of the error into dynamic modes.</description>

      <title>Evidential Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14568v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the fundamental theory and implementation guidelines underlying Evidential Physics-Informed Neural Network (E-PINN) -- a novel class of uncertainty-aware PINN. It leverages the marginal distribution loss function of evidential deep learning for estimating uncertainty of outputs, and infers unknown parameters of the PDE via a learned posterior distribution. Validating our model on two illustrative case studies -- the 1D Poisson equation with a Gaussian source and the 2D Fisher-KPP equation, we found that E-PINN generated empirical coverage probabilities that were calibrated significantly better than Bayesian PINN and Deep Ensemble methods. To demonstrate real-world applicability, we also present a brief case study on applying E-PINN to analyze clinical glucose-insulin datasets that have featured in medical research on diabetes pathophysiology.</description>

      <title>A flux bounce-back scheme for the filtered Spectral Element Lattice Boltzmann Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a spectral element lattice Boltzmann method (SELBM) with the flux bounce-back (FBB) scheme, to enable accurate simulations of single-phase fluid dynamics in unstructured mesh. We adopt an Eulerian description of the streaming process in place of the perfect shift in the regular LBM. The spectral element method is used to spatially discretize the convective term, while the strong stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (SSPRK) method is used for time integration. To increase stability, we investigate the use of an explicit filter, particularly in the context of the sensitive double shear layer problem. The results indicate that by using the high-order polynomial, we can effectively eliminate the small vortices around the neck region. We introduce the flux bounce-back scheme to enable the current scheme to handle complex boundaries. The proposed scheme and flux boundary method are validated through benchmark simulations, including the unsteady Couette flow and the planar Poiseuille flow. Further validation is provided through the Taylor-Green vortex problem, demonstrating the accuracy and convergence of the scheme for isotropic turbulence. Finally, we consider a fully developed turbulent flow within a cylindrical pipe and correctly predict the turbulent boundary layer profile.</description>

      <title>HPC-Driven Modeling with ML-Based Surrogates for Magnon-Photon Dynamics in Hybrid Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating hybrid magnonic quantum systems remains a challenge due to the large disparity between the timescales of the two systems. We present a massively parallel GPU-based simulation framework that enables fully coupled, large-scale modeling of on-chip magnon-photon circuits. Our approach resolves the dynamic interaction between ferromagnetic and electromagnetic fields with high spatiotemporal fidelity. To accelerate design workflows, we develop a physics-informed machine learning surrogate trained on the simulation data, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy. This combined approach reveals real-time energy exchange dynamics and reproduces key phenomena such as anti-crossing behavior and the suppression of ferromagnetic resonance under strong electromagnetic fields. By addressing the multiscale and multiphysics challenges in magnon-photon modeling, our framework enables scalable simulation and rapid prototyping of next-generation quantum and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Mixed-State Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions in Imaginary-Time Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed-state phase transitions have recently attracted growing attention as a new frontier in nonequilibrium quantum matter and quantum information. In this work, we introduce the measurement-dressed imaginary-time evolution (MDITE) as a novel framework to explore mixed-state quantum phases and decoherence-driven criticality. In this setup, alternating imaginary-time evolution and projective measurements generate a competition between coherence-restoring dynamics and decoherence-inducing events. While reminiscent of monitored unitary circuits, MDITE fundamentally differs in that the physics is encoded in decoherent mixed states rather than in quantum trajectories. We demonstrate that this interplay gives rise to a novel class of mixed-state phase transitions, using numerical simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional columnar dimerized Heisenberg model. Notably, the observed transitions do not fall into any previously established universality classes. Furthermore, we provide a diagrammatic representation of the evolving state, which naturally enables efficient studies of MDITE with quantum Monte Carlo and other many-body numerical methods, thereby extending investigations of mixed-state phase transitions to large-scale and higher-dimensional systems. In addition, the representation provides a natural interpretation of the phase transitions in terms of cluster formation within the simulations. Our results highlight MDITE as a powerful paradigm for investigating non-unitary dynamics and the fundamental role of decoherence in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Double Perovskites K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6 from First-Principles: Towards Efficient Materials for Green Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structural flexibility and multifunctional nature of double perovskite oxides make them attractive for applications requiring coupled optical, mechanical, and thermal performance. Using first-principles computations, this study examines the structural, electronic, elastic, optical, and thermoelectric stability of K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6. The two compounds combine to form a cubic double perovskite structure with ordered Nb$^{5+}$ and Ta$^{5+}$ cations. The calculated elastic constants satisfy the Born stability criteria, confirming mechanical stability; however, both K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6 exhibit brittle behavior according to Pugh's ratio, reflecting limited ductility. Semiconducting behavior is revealed by band structure analysis with energy gaps of 2.79 eV for K2NbTaO6 and 2.63 eV for Rb2NbTaO6. Optical spectra show noticeable absorption in the high-energy region near the UV, indicating relevance for theoretical studies of optoelectronic and photocatalytic processes, without implying practical device efficiency.

      <title>Structured Light at the Extreme: Harnessing Spatiotemporal Control for High-Field Laser-Matter Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review charts the emerging paradigm of intelligent structured light for high-field laser-matter interactions, where the precise spatiotemporal and vectorial control of light is a critical degree of freedom. We outline a transformative framework built upon three synergistic pillars. First, we survey the advanced electromagnetic toolkit, moving beyond conventional spatial light modulators to include robust static optics and the promising frontier of plasma light modulators. Second, we detail the optimization engine for this high-dimensional design space, focusing on physics-informed digital twins and AI-driven inverse design to automate the discovery of optimal light structures. Finally, we explore the groundbreaking applications enabled by this integrated approach, including programmable electron beams, orbital-angular-momentum-carrying {\gamma}-rays, compact THz accelerators, and robust communications. The path forward necessitates overcoming grand challenges in material science, real-time adaptive control at MHz rates, and the extension of these principles to the quantum realm. This review serves as a call to action for a coordinated, interdisciplinary effort to command, rather than merely observe, light-matter interactions at the extreme.</description>
