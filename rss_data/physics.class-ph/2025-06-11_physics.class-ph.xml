      <title>Quasinormal spectra of a wormhole family: overtone features and a parameter-controlled redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though investigated extensively in the past, we take a detailed relook at the study of quasinormal modes (QNM) in a known family of wormholes (ultrastatic ($g_{00}=-1$), as well as spacetimes with different, non-constant $g_{00}$), which includes the familiar Bronnikov-Ellis spacetime as a special case. Our focus here is to go beyond the fundamental mode and obtain some of the QNM overtones using a suitable numerical scheme. Scalar and axial gravitational QNMs including two or three overtones are obtained for the family of ultrastatic geometries and their parameter dependencies are shown explicitly. Further, we comment on how (a) the overtones may influence the time-domain profile in a perturbation and (b) in what sense, the use of overtones may help in distinguishing between different geometries within the family.
  Finally, we show how an effect somewhat similar to the so-called `environment induced redshift' of QNMs, introduced recently (arXiv:2412.18651), may be obtained for spacetimes with non-constant $g_{00}$, via an appropriate tuning of available metric parameters which systematically modify the shapes of the effective potentials arising in the perturbation equations.</description>

      <title>The Duality of Whittaker Potential Theory: Fundamental Representations of Electromagnetism and Gravity, and Their Orthogonality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08309</link>

Abstract: E. T. Whittaker produced two papers in 1903 and 1904 that, although sometimes considered mere mathematical statements (Barrett, 1993), held important implications for physical theory. The Whittaker 1903 paper united electrostatic and gravitational attraction as resulting from longitudinal waves - waves whose wavefronts propagate parallel to their direction. The Whittaker 1904 paper showed that electromagnetic waves resulted from the interference of two such longitudinal waves or scalar potential functions. Although unexplored, the implications of these papers are profound: gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, the Aharonov-Bohm effect, the existence of a hyperspace above or behind normal space, the elimination of gravitational and point charge singularities, MOND, and the expansion of the universe. This last implication can be related to the recent finding that black holes with posited vacuum energy interior solutions alongside cosmological boundaries have a cosmological coupling constant of k=3, meaning that black holes gain mass-proportional to a3 in a parameterization equation within a Robertson-Walker cosmology and are a cosmological accelerated expansion species (Farrah et al., 2023). This expansion and many features of General Relativity can be explained by the mass-proportionality and preferred direction of the longitudinal waves within the two underlying non-local Whittaker potentials (Titleman, 2022). Whittaker potential theory also offers a simple explanation for expansion of the universe - it is produced as longitudinal motion within the Whittaker potentials only when dynamic electromagnetism is separate from time-static gravity in intergalactic space.</description>

      <title>Design and Reprogrammability of Zero Modes in 2D Materials from a Single Element</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanical extremal materials, a class of metamaterials that exist at the bounds of elastic theory, possess the extraordinary capability to engineer any desired elastic behavior by harnessing mechanical zero modes -- deformation modes that demand minimal or, ideally, no elastic energy. However, the potential for arbitrary construction and reprogramming of metamaterials remains largely unrealized, primarily due to significant challenges in qualitatively transforming zero modes within the confines of existing metamaterial design frameworks. This work presents a method for explicitly defining and in situ reprogramming zero modes of two-dimensional extremal materials by employing straight-line mechanisms (SLMs) and planar symmetry, which prescribe and coordinate the zero modes, respectively. We validate the concept experimentally on square-symmetric lattices and corroborate its generality for hexagonal lattices through finite-element analysis, together spanning the full theoretical gamut of extremal behaviors. The method is used to design, test, and reprogram centimeter-scale isotropic, orthotropic, and chiral extremal materials by reorienting the SLMs in place, enabling these materials to smoothly and reversibly interpolate between extremal modalities (e.g., unimode to bimode), material properties (e.g., negative to positive Poisson's ratios), and selectively enable chirality without changing the metamaterial's global structure. This methodology provides a straightforward and explicit strategy for the design and tuning of all varieties of two-dimensional extremal materials, enabling dynamic mechanical metamaterial construction to completely cover the gamut of elastic properties.</description>
