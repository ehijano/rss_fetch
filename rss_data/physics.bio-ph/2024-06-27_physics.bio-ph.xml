      <title>On the mechanics of inhaled bronchial transmission of pathogenic microdroplets generated from the upper respiratory tract, with implications for infection onset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Could the microdroplets formed by viscoelastic stretching and break-up of mucosal liquids in the upper respiratory tract (URT), when inhaled further downwind, explain the brisk pace at which deep lung infections emerge following onset of initial infection at the URT? While it is well-established that particulates inhaled from outside can possibly penetrate to the lower airway only if they are &lt; 5 microns, the fate of particulates (many &gt; 5-microns in diameter) sheared away from the intra-URT mucosa during inhalation remains an open question. These particulates predominantly originate at the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngeal chamber with the vocal folds. To resolve the posed question, this study considers a CT-based 3D anatomical airway reconstruction and isolates the tract from the laryngeal vocal fold region, mapping the entire tracheal cavity and concluding at generation 2 of the tracheobronchial tree. Through the delineated geometry, airflow simulation is conducted using the LES scheme to replicate relaxed inhalation at 15 L/min. Against the ambient air flux, numerical experiments have been performed to monitor the transport of liquid particulates with diameters 1-30 microns, bearing physical properties akin to aerosolized mucus with embedded virions. The full-scale numerical transmission trends to the lower airway were found consistent with the findings from a reduced-order mathematical model that conceptualized the impact of intra-airway vortex instabilities on local particle transport through point vortex idealization in an anatomy-guided 2D potential flow domain. The results collectively demonstrate markedly elevated trends of deep lung penetration by the URT-derived particulates, even if they are as large as 10- and 15 microns. The high viral load carried by such droplets to the bronchial spaces could mechanistically explain the accelerated seeding of infection in the lungs.</description>

      <title>Charge and Spin Dynamics and Destabilization of Shallow Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers under UV and Blue Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond offer unique opportunities for studying photochemical reactions at the single-molecule level, such as the photogeneration of radical pairs in proximal molecules. A prerequesite for such experimental schemes is the detailed understanding of the charge and spin dynamics of NV centers exposed to the short-wavelength light required for photoexciting chemical species. Here, we measure and analyze the charge and spin dynamics of shallow NV centers under 445 nm (blue) and 375 nm (UV) illumination. With blue excitation, we observe a power-dependent charge-state preparation accompanied by modest preservation of spin initialization fidelity. Under UV excitation, we find a power-independent charge-state preparation and no spin polarization. We further observe an irreversible aging of NV centers under prolonged exposure to UV, and to a lesser extent, blue laser excitation, which we attribute to formation of new electronic trap states. This aging manifests itself in a reduced charge stability and spin contrast, and is detrimental to the NV sensing performance. We evaluate the prospects and limitations of NV centers for probing photogenerated radical pairs based on experimentally measured sensitivities following blue and UV excitation, and outline the design rules for possible sensing schemes.</description>

      <title>Estimate of entropy generation rate can spatiotemporally resolve the active nature of cell flickering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.12849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the short-time inference scheme (Manikandan, Gupta and Krishnamurthy, Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 120603, 2020), obtained within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, to infer a lower-bound to entropy generation rate from flickering data generated by Interference Reflection Microscopy of HeLA cells. We can clearly distinguish active cell membranes from their ATP depleted selves and even spatio-temporally resolve activity down to the scale of about one $\mu$m. Our estimate of activity is model--independent.</description>

      <title>Marangoni droplets of dextran in PEG solution and its motile change due to coil-globule transition of coexisting DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motile droplets using Marangoni convection are attracting attention for their potential as cell-mimicking small robots. However, the motion of droplets relative to the internal and external environments that generate Marangoni convection has not been quantitatively described. This study used an aqueous two-phase system (polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran) in an elongated chamber to generate motile dextran droplets in a constant PEG concentration gradient. We demonstrated that dextran droplets move by Marangoni convection, resulting from the PEG concentration gradient and the active transport of PEG and dextran into and out of the droplet. Furthermore, by spontaneously incorporating long DNA into the dextran droplets, we achieved cell-like motility changes controlled by coexisting environment-sensing molecules. The DNA changes its position within the droplet and motile speed in response to external conditions. In the presence of Mg2+, the coil-globule transition of DNA inside the droplet accelerates the motile speed due to the decrease in the droplet's dynamic viscosity. Globule DNA condenses at the rear part of the droplet along the convection, while coil DNA moves away from the droplet's central axis, separating the dipole convections. These results provide a blueprint for designing autonomous small robots using phase-separated droplets, which change the mobility and molecular distribution within the droplet in reaction to the environment. It will also open unexplored areas of self-assembly mechanisms through phase separation under convections, such as intracellular phase separation.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bounds on generalized transport: From single-molecule to bulk observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the transport of any differentiable scalar observable in $d$-dimensional non-equilibrium systems is bounded from above by the total entropy production scaled by the amount the observation "stretches" microscopic coordinates. The result--a time-integrated generalized speed limit--reflects the thermodynamic cost of transport of observables, and places underdamped and overdamped stochastic dynamics on equal footing with deterministic motion. Our work allows for stochastic thermodynamics to make contact with bulk experiments, and fills an important gap in thermodynamic inference, since microscopic dynamics is, at least for short times, underdamped. Requiring only averages but not sample-to-sample fluctuations, the proven transport bound is practical and applicable not only to single-molecule but also bulk experiments where only averages are observed, which we demonstrate by examples. Our results may facilitate thermodynamic inference on molecular machines without an obvious directionality from bulk observations of transients probed, e.g.\ in time-resolved X-ray scattering.</description>

      <title>Catalytic Coagulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17026v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an autocatalytic aggregation model in which the rate at which two clusters merge to form a cluster is controlled by the presence of a third "catalytic" cluster whose mass must equal to the mass of one of the reaction partners. The catalyst is unaffected by the joining event and is available to either participate in or catalyze subsequent reactions. This model is meant to mimic the self-replicating reactions that occur in models for the origin of life. We solve the kinetics of this catalytic coagulation model for the case of mass-independent rates and show that the total cluster density decays as $t^{-1/3}$, while the density of clusters of any fixed mass decays as $t^{-2/3}$. These behaviors contrast with the corresponding $t^{-1}$ and $t^{-2}$ scalings for classic aggregation. We extend our model to mass-dependent reaction rates, to situations where only "magic" mass clusters can catalyze reactions, and to include steady monomer input.</description>
