      <title>Uncertainty Relations and Entanglement for PQ-deformed Supersymmetric Coherent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose supersymmetric extension of deformed quantum oscillator with two parameters quantum group structure. As particular cases, specified by values of $p$ and $q$ parameters it includes symmetric and non-symmetric $q$-oscillators, Fibonacci and Fibonacci divisors hierarchy of Golden oscillators, Tamm-Dankov oscillator etc. By $pq$-deformed supersymmetric annihilation operator, the set of corresponding supersymmetric coherent states is introduced. The states are characterized by the pair of $pq$-quantum states from the Fock space or equivalently, by the set of infinite number of qubit states. Entanglement of fermions with $pq$-deformed bosons is characterized by the concurrence as the linear entropy, taking form of the Gram determinant of inner products. As shown, for two types of the reference states, the concurrence depends on values of $p$ and $q$ parameters, and it reaches the value one for the maximally entangled states. Entanglement of the super-coherent states and the uncertainty relations for the coordinate and momentum in these states are calculated. Non-classical nature of the entangled states is reflected in non-minimal character of the uncertainty relations.</description>

      <title>Overcoming a challenge for Bohmian mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Bohmian mechanics has been challenged [Nature 643, 67 (2025)] by studying a system in which the motion of particles cannot be associated only with the gradient of phase of the wave function. We point out that, in general, Bohmian velocity is defined by the continuity equation, which does not always lead to velocity depending only on the phase gradient. By constructing the appropriate velocity explicitly, we overcome the challenge.</description>

      <title>Enhanced entanglement from quantum ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum chaos conjecture associates the spectral statistics of a quantum system with abstract notions of quantum ergodicity. Such associations are taken to be of fundamental and sometimes defining importance for quantum chaos, but their practical relevance has been challenged by theoretical and experimental developments. Here, in counterpoint, we show that ergodic dynamics can be directly utilized for the preparation of quantum states with parametrically higher entanglement than generated by maximally scrambling circuits such as random unitaries. Our setting involves quantum systems coupled via a "non-demolition" interaction of conserved charges. We derive an exact relation between the evolving entanglement of an initial product state and a measure of spectral statistics of the interacting charges in this state. This connection is explained via a notion of Krylov vector ergodicity, tied to the ability of quantum dynamics to generate orthonormal states over time. We consider exploiting this phenomenon for the preparation of approximate Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states between complex systems, a crucial resource for tasks such as quantum teleportation. We quantitatively show that the transfer of operators between entangled systems, which underlies the utility of the EPR state, can be performed with parametrically larger capacity for entanglement generated via ergodic dynamics than with maximal scrambling. Our analysis suggests a direct application of "ergodic" spectral statistics as a potential resource for quantum information tasks.</description>

      <title>A dynamic circuit for the honeycomb Floquet code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the typical implementation of a quantum error-correcting code, each stabilizer is measured by entangling one or more ancilla qubits with the data qubits and measuring the ancilla qubits to deduce the value of the stabilizer. Recently, the dynamic circuit approach has been introduced, in which stabilizers are measured without ancilla qubits. Here, we demonstrate that dynamic circuits are particularly useful for the Floquet code. Our dynamic circuit increases the timelike distance of the code, automatically removes leakage, and both significantly increases the threshold and lowers the logical error rate compared to the standard ancilla-based circuit. At a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, we estimate a nearly $3\times$ reduction in the number of qubits required to reach a $10^{-12}$ logical error rate.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Dynamics in a (2+1)-D Gauge Theory: The Stringy Nature on a Superconducting Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the confinement mechanism in gauge theories and the universality of effective string-like descriptions of gauge flux tubes remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. We probe string modes of motion with dynamical matter in a digital quantum simulation of a (2+1) dimensional gauge theory using a superconducting quantum processor with up to 144 qubits, stretching the hardware capabilities with quantum-circuit depths comprising up to 192 two-qubit layers. We realize the $Z_2$-Higgs model ($Z_2$HM) through an optimized embedding into a heavy-hex superconducting qubit architecture, directly mapping matter and gauge fields to vertex and link superconducting qubits, respectively. Using the structure of local gauge symmetries, we implement a comprehensive suite of error suppression, mitigation, and correction strategies to enable real-time observation and manipulation of electric strings connecting dynamical charges. Our results resolve a dynamical hierarchy of longitudinal oscillations and transverse bending at the end points of the string, which are precursors to hadronization and rotational spectra of mesons. We further explore multi-string processes, observing the fragmentation and recombination of strings. The experimental design supports 300,000 measurement shots per circuit, totaling 600,000 shots per time step, enabling high-fidelity statistics. We employ extensive tensor network simulations using the basis update and Galerkin method to predict large-scale real-time dynamics and validate our error-aware protocols. This work establishes a milestone for probing non-perturbative gauge dynamics via superconducting quantum simulation and elucidates the real-time behavior of confining strings.</description>

      <title>Improving Transmon Qubit Performance with Fluorine-based Surface Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing materials and processing-induced decoherence is critical to the development of utility-scale quantum processors based on superconducting qubits. Here we report on the impact of two fluorine-based wet etches, which we use to treat the silicon surface underneath the Josephson junctions (JJs) of fixed-frequency transmon qubits made with aluminum base metallization. Using several materials analysis techniques, we demonstrate that these surface treatments can remove germanium residue introduced by our JJ fabrication with no other changes to the overall process flow. These surface treatments result in significantly improved energy relaxation times for the highest performing process, with median $T_1=334~\mu$s, corresponding to quality factor $Q=6.6\times10^6$. This result suggests that the metal-substrate interface directly underneath the JJs was a major contributor to microwave loss in these transmon qubit circuits prior to integration of these surface treatments. Furthermore, this work illustrates how materials analysis can be used in conjunction with quantum device performance metrics to improve performance in superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Photonic quantum information with time-bins: Principles and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range quantum communication, distributed quantum computing, and sensing applications require robust and reliable ways to encode transmitted quantum information. In this context, time-bin encoding has emerged as a promising candidate due to its resilience to mechanical and thermal perturbations, depolarization from refractive index changes, and birefringence in fiber optic media. Time-bin quantum bits (qubits) can be produced in various ways, and each implementation calls for different considerations regarding design parameters, component compatibility (optical, electrical, electro-optical), and measurement procedures. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of experimental methods for preparing and characterizing time-bin qubits (TBQs) for quantum communication protocols, with an assessment of their advantages and limitations. We discuss challenges in transmitting TBQs over optical fibers and free-space channels, and methods to overcome them. We also analyze the selection of key time-bin parameters and component requirements across experiments. This leads us to explore the preparation and characterization of time-bin entanglement and examine requirements for interference of time-bins from separate sources. Further, we cover preparation and characterization techniques for high-dimensional time-bin states, namely qudits, and the generation of time-bin entangled qudit pairs. We review time-energy entanglement and key experimental realizations. Finally, we present notable applications of time-bin encoded quantum states, from quantum communication protocols to photonic quantum computation. This work serves as an accessible introduction and a comprehensive review of recent developments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Two-Level $PT$-Symmetric Systems Using Hermitian Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parity-time ($PT$)-symmetric Hamiltonians exhibit non-unitary dynamical evolution while maintaining real spectra, and offer unique approaches to quantum sensing and entanglement generation. Here we present a method for simulating the quantum dynamics of $PT$-symmetric systems on unitary-gate-based quantum computers by leveraging Hermitian equivalents through similarity transformations. We introduce two algorithms for simulating $PT$-symmetric systems near exceptional points where eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce. The first is a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm and the second reduces the classical component by using an ancilla qubit. We then use perturbation theory to extend this method to consider the dynamics of two weakly interacting $PT$-symmetric systems. Demonstrations on a quantum device and noisy simulators validate the algorithm on current quantum devices, offering potential for scalable simulations of $PT$-symmetric systems and pseudo-Hermitian operators in quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Quantum and Hybrid Machine-Learning Models for Materials-Science Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has become increasingly practical in solving real-world problems due to advances in hardware and algorithms. In this paper, we aim to design and estimate quantum machine learning and hybrid quantum-classical models in a few practical materials science tasks, i.e., predicting stacking fault energies and solutes that can ductilize magnesium. To this end, we adopt two different representative quantum algorithms, i.e., quantum support vector machines (QSVM) and quantum neural networks (QNN), and adjust them to our application scenarios. We systematically test the performance with respect to the hyperparameters of selected ansatzes. We identify a few combinations of hyperparameters that yield validation scores of approximately 90\% for QSVM and hybrid QNN in both tasks. Eventually, we construct quantum models with optimized parameters for regression and classification that predict targeted solutes based on the elemental volumes, electronegativities, and bulk moduli of chemical elements.</description>

      <title>Topological network analysis using a programmable photonic quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08157v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding topological features in networks is crucial for unravelling complex phenomena across fields such as neuroscience, condensed matter, and high-energy physics. However, identifying higher-order topological structures -- such as $k$-cliques, fundamental building blocks of complex networks -- remains a significant challenge. Here we develop a universal programmable photonic quantum processor that enables the encoding of arbitrary complex-weight networks, providing a direct pathway to uncovering their topological structures. We demonstrate how this quantum approach can identify weighted $k$-cliques and estimate Betti numbers by leveraging the Gaussian boson sampling algorithm's ability to preferentially select high-weight, dense subgraphs. The unique capabilities of our programmable quantum processor allow us to observe topological phase transitions and identify clique percolation phenomena directly from the entropy of the sampling results. These findings showcase how photonic quantum computing can be applied to analyse the topological characteristics of real-world complex networks, opening new possibilities for quantum-enhanced data analysis.</description>

      <title>Emergent Harmonics in Josephson Tunnel Junctions Due to Series Inductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson tunnel junctions are essential elements of superconducting quantum circuits. The operability of these circuits presumes a $2\pi$-periodic sinusoidal potential of a tunnel junction, but higher-order corrections to this Josephson potential, often referred to as "harmonics," cause deviations from the expected circuit behavior. Two potential sources for these harmonics are the intrinsic current-phase relationship of the Josephson junction and the inductance of the metallic traces connecting the junction to other circuit elements. Here, we introduce a method to distinguish the origin of the observed harmonics using nearly-symmetric superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). Spectroscopic measurements of level transitions in multiple devices reveal features that cannot be explained by a standard cosine potential, but are accurately reproduced when accounting for a second-harmonic contribution to the model. The observed scaling of the second harmonic with Josephson-junction size indicates that it is due almost entirely to the trace inductance. These results inform the design of next-generation superconducting circuits for quantum information processing and the investigation of the supercurrent diode effect.</description>

      <title>Parametrized Quantum Circuit Learning for Quantum Chemical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of quantum machine learning (QML), parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) -- constructed using a combination of fixed and tunable quantum gates -- provide a promising hybrid framework for tackling complex machine learning problems. Despite numerous proposed applications, there remains limited exploration of datasets relevant to quantum chemistry. In this study, we investigate the potential benefits and limitations of PQCs on two chemically meaningful datasets: (1) the BSE49 dataset, containing bond separation energies for 49 different classes of chemical bonds, and (2) a dataset of water conformations, where coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) wavefunctions are predicted from lower-level electronic structure methods using the data-driven coupled-cluster (DDCC) approach. We construct a comprehensive set of 168 PQCs by combining 14 data encoding strategies with 12 variational ans{\"a}tze, and evaluate their performance on circuits with 5 and 16 qubits. Our initial analysis examines the impact of circuit structure on model performance using state-vector simulations. We then explore how circuit depth and training set size influence model performance. Finally, we assess the performance of the best-performing PQCs on current quantum hardware, using both noisy simulations ("fake" backends) and real quantum devices. Our findings underscore the challenges of applying PQCs to chemically relevant problems that are straightforward for classical machine learning methods but remain non-trivial for quantum approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantum Properties Trojans (QuPTs) for Attacking Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNN) hold immense potential for the future of quantum machine learning (QML). However, QNN security and robustness remain largely unexplored. In this work, we proposed novel Trojan attacks based on the quantum computing properties in a QNN-based binary classifier. Our proposed Quantum Properties Trojans (QuPTs) are based on the unitary property of quantum gates to insert noise and Hadamard gates to enable superposition to develop Trojans and attack QNNs. We showed that the proposed QuPTs are significantly stealthier and heavily impact the quantum circuits' performance, specifically QNNs. The most impactful QuPT caused a deterioration of 23% accuracy of the compromised QNN under the experimental setup. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on the Trojan attack on a fully quantum neural network independent of any hybrid classical-quantum architecture.</description>

      <title>Exponential onset of scalable entanglement via twist-and-turn dynamics in XY models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient preparation of scalable multipartite entanglement is a central goal in the development of next-generation quantum devices. In this work, we show that the so-called ``twist-and-turn" (TaT) dynamics for interacting spin ensembles, generated by Hamiltonians with U(1)-symmetric interactions and with a transverse field, can offer an important resource to reach this goal. For models with sufficiently high connectivity, TaT dynamics exhibits two key features: 1) it features both scalable squeezing at short times, as well as quantum Fisher information with Heisenberg scaling at later times; and 2) scalable multipartite entanglement (up to Heisenberg scaling) is reached in a time growing only logarithmically with system size, associated with an exponential buildup of quantum correlations. These results can be shown exactly in the XY model with a Rabi field and infinite range interactions, and numerically in the case of spatially decaying XY interactions, such as dipolar interactions in two dimensions, provided that unstable spin-wave modes do not develop for large system sizes and/or strong fields. For dipolar interactions, the entanglement dynamics at intermediate times is completely at odds with thermalization; and it appears to saturate the maximum speed of entanglement buildup allowed by Lieb-Robinson bounds generalized to power-law interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Witnessing nonlocality in quantum network of continuous-variable systems by generalized quasiprobability functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian measurements can not be used to witness nonlocality in Gaussian states as well as the network nonlocality in networks of continuous-variable (CV) systems. Thus special non-Gaussian measurements have to be utilized.
  In the present paper, we first propose a kind of nonlinear Bell-type inequality that is applicable to quantum networks of both finite or infinite dimensional systems. Violation of the inequality will witness the network nonlocality. This inequality allows us to propose a method of the supremum strategy for detecting network nonlocality in CV systems with source states being any multipartite multi-mode Gaussian states according to the configurations of the networks by utilizing non-Gaussian measurements based on generalized quasiprobability functions. The nonlinear Bell-type inequalities for CV networks, which depend solely on the generalized quasiprobability functions of Gaussian states, are straightforward to construct and implement. As illustrations, we propose the corresponding nonlinear Bell-type inequalities for any chain, star, tree-shaped and cyclic networks in CV systems with source states being $(1+1)$-mode Gaussian states. The examples show that this approach works well for witnessing the nonlocality in networks of CV systems. Particularly, a thorough discussion is given for the entanglement swapping network. Our study provide a strong signature for the network nonlocality nature of CV systems and lead to precise recipes for its experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Quantum and Semiclassical Rabi models near multiphoton resonances in the presence of parametric modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the semiclassical and quantum predictions for the unitary dynamics of a two-level atom interacting with a single-mode electromagnetic field in the presence of parametric modulation of the atomic parameters, in the regime of multiphoton atom-field resonances. We derive approximate analytic solutions for the semiclassical Rabi model when the atomic transition frequency and the atom-field coupling strength undergo harmonic external modulations. These solutions are compared to the predictions of the quantum Rabi model, which is solved numerically for the initial coherent state with a large average photon number, of the order of $10^4$, in the regime of three-photon resonance. We show that for initial times and sufficiently intense coherent state the semiclassical dynamics agrees quite well with the quantum one, although for large times it inevitably fails due to the lack of the collapse-revival behavior. Furthermore, we describe how the field state is modified throughout the evolution, presenting numeric results for the average photon number, entropies (related to the atom-field entanglement) and other quantities that characterize the photon number statistics of the electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Computational Study of the Spectral Properties of Isospectrally Patterned Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a computational spectral analysis of different isospectrally patterned lattices (IPL). Having been introduced very recently, the lattice Hamiltonian of IPL consist of coupled cells which possess all the same set of eigenvalues. The latter is achieved in a controllable manner by parametrizing the cells via the phases of the involved orthogonal (or unitary) transformations. This opens the doorway of systematically designing lattice Hamiltonians with unique properties by choosing correspondingly varying phases across the lattice. Here we focus on two-dimensional cells and explore symmetric as well as asymmetric IPL w.r.t. a given center. A tunable fraction of localized vs. delocalized eigenstates belonging to the three subdomains of the corresponding energy bands is demonstrated and analyzed with different measures of localization. In the asymmetric case the center of localization can be shifted arbitrarily by shifting the underlying phase grid. Introducing a complete phase revolution leads for low and high energies to two well-separated branches of localized states which finally merge with increasing energy into the branch of delocalized states. Remarkably, the localized states appear in near-degenerate pairs and this near-degeneracy is lifted upon entering the delocalization regime. A corresponding generalization to several phase revolutions is provided showing a characteristic nodal pattern among the near-degenerate eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Complexity of mixed Schatten norms of quantum maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the complexity of computing the mixed Schatten $\|\Phi\|_{q\to p}$ norms of linear maps $\Phi$ between matrix spaces. When $\Phi$ is completely positive, we show that $\| \Phi \|_{q \to p}$ can be computed efficiently when $q \geq p$. The regime $q \geq p$ is known as the non-hypercontractive regime and is also known to be easy for the mixed vector norms $\ell_{q} \to \ell_{p}$ [Boyd, 1974]. However, even for entanglement-breaking completely-positive trace-preserving maps $\Phi$, we show that computing $\| \Phi \|_{1 \to p}$ is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete when $p&gt;1$. Moving beyond the completely-positive case and considering $\Phi$ to be difference of entanglement breaking completely-positive trace-preserving maps, we prove that computing $\| \Phi \|^+_{1 \to 1}$ is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete. In contrast, for the completely-bounded (cb) case, we describe a polynomial-time algorithm to compute $\|\Phi\|_{cb,1\to p}$ and $\|\Phi\|^+_{cb,1\to p}$ for any linear map $\Phi$ and $p\geq1$.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Classical and Quantum Communication Networks Upon Modular Quantum Computing Architecture System Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular architectures are a promising approach to scaling quantum computers beyond the limits of monolithic designs. However, non-local communications between different quantum processors might significantly impact overall system performance. In this work, we investigate the role of the network infrastructure in modular quantum computing architectures, focusing on coherence loss due to communication constraints. We analyze the impact of classical network latency on quantum teleportation and identify conditions under which it becomes a bottleneck. Additionally, we study different network topologies and assess how communication resources affect the number and parallelization of inter-core communications. Finally, we conduct a full-stack evaluation of the architecture under varying communication parameters, demonstrating how these factors influence the overall system performance. The results show that classical communication does not become a bottleneck for systems exceeding one million qubits, given current technology assumptions, even with modest clock frequencies and parallel wired interconnects. Additionally, increasing quantum communication resources generally shortens execution time, although it may introduce additional communication overhead. The optimal number of quantum links between QCores depends on both the algorithm being executed and the chosen inter-core topology. Our findings offer valuable guidance for designing modular architectures, enabling scalable quantum computing.</description>

      <title>New scattering zones in quantum speckle propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum speckles exhibit significantly richer behavior than their classical counterparts due to their higher dimensionality. A simple example is the far-field speckle pattern in 1D light scattering: classical light forms 1D speckles defined by the numerical aperture, whereas biphoton scattering depends in addition on the photon correlation length, forming 2D elliptical speckles. To date, the behavior of quantum speckles for shorter propagation distances has not been considered. We remedy this here by considering the paraxial evolution of two-photon entanglement at arbitrary propagation distances from an isotropic scatterer. We show, theoretically, numerically, and experimentally, that the two length scales of the biphoton introduce a new Fresnel regime between the conventional near and far fields. Further, we show that the quantum near field is characterized by speckles with a square shape that remain constant during propagation. In contrast, the intermediate regime can be engineered to have a constant speckle size along the sum coordinate but a linearly expanding speckle size along the difference coordinate, with a speckle shape that transitions from square to elliptical. The results merge quantum coherence with scattering statistics and suggest new regimes of operation for correlation-based quantum sensing and imaging.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time parametrization of neural quantum states for quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08418v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schr\"odinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state ($s$-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using simply a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the parameterization is efficient in the number of parameters and the smooth neural quantum state allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of an adiabatic state preparation in an effective three-level quantum system. States can be prepared with high speed and fidelity by adding a counterdiabatic quantum control protocol. As a second step, we invert the preparation protocol to get back to the initial state. This describes an overall cyclic evolution in state space. Using counterdiabatic terms, the resulting composed fast evolution can be repeated many times. We then analyze the control of Berry's phase along the adiabatic cyclic path, and show that Berry's phase can act as a sensitive detector of non-perfect state transfer.</description>

      <title>Bi-Contextuality: A Novel Non-Classical Phenomenon in Bipartite Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and experimentally demonstrate a novel non-classical phenomenon, bi-contextuality, observed in quantum systems prepared by two independent sources. This discovery plays a key role in the developing framework of network nonlocality, offering a new method for confirming the quantum nature of measurements within a single network node. Bi-contextuality acts as a reversed Bell scenario: while Bell scenarios involve splitting a system for independent measurements, our approach combines systems from separate independent sources for joint measurements. The outcomes defy classical models that assume independence and non-contextuality. The simplest Bell scenario can be seen as a subset of the Peres-Mermin (PM) square, and our phenomenon represents another important subset of this framework. Moreover, bi-contextuality has notable consequences related to the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph (PBR) theorem, suggesting that classical psi-ontic models must account for contextuality or the dependence of preparations, challenging established assumptions.</description>

      <title>Towards solving large QUBO problems using quantum algorithms: improving the LogQ scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LogQ algorithm encodes Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems with exponentially fewer qubits than the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). The advantages of conventional LogQ are accompanied by a challenge related to the optimization of its free parameters, which requires the usage of resource intensive evolutionary or even global optimization algorithms. We propose a new LogQ parameterization that can be optimized with a gradient-inspired method, which is less resource-intensive and thus strengthens the advantage of LogQ over QAOA for large/industrial problems. We illustrate the features of our method on an analytical model and present larger scale numerical results on MaxCut problems.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Structure and Helicity Anomaly in Relativistic Electron Vortex Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relativistic electron vortex beam (REVB) has attracted increasing attention due to its nontrivial spin-orbit structure recently. As relativistic electrons are governed by the Dirac equation, exact solutions to this equation provide the most reliable starting point for understanding angular momentum characteristics of REVBs. In this work, a set of exact eigensolutions of the Dirac equation are derived in a complex cylindrical coordinate system using a generalized series expansion method. We demonstrate that the eigenstate carries net angular momentum with the vortex charge being the quantum number of the total angular momentum along the propagation direction and deduce the explicit expression for the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling strength. Furthermore, we show that helicity, which exhibits anomaly in the vortex state, can serve as a practical characterizing quantity for the REVB. This work lays a theoretical foundation for further exploration of REVBs in both theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Decoding Performance using Efficient Error Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lowering the resource overhead needed to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation is crucial to building scalable quantum computers. We show that adapting conventional maximum likelihood (ML) decoders to a small subset of efficiently learnable physical error characteristics can significantly improve the logical performance of a quantum error-correcting code. Specifically, we leverage error information obtained from efficient characterization methods based on Cycle Error Reconstruction (CER), which yields Pauli error rates on the $n$ qubits of an error-correcting code. Although the total number of Pauli error rates needed to describe a general noise process is exponentially large in $n$, we show that only a few of the largest few Pauli error rates are needed and that a heuristic technique can complete the Pauli error distribution for ML decoding from this restricted dataset. Using these techniques, we demonstrate significant performance improvements for decoding quantum codes under a variety of physically relevant error models. For instance, with CER data that constitute merely $1\%$ of the Pauli error rates in the system, we achieve a $10X$ gain in performance compared to the case where decoding is based solely on the fidelity of the underlying noise process. Our conclusions underscore the promise of recent error characterization methods for improving quantum error correction and lowering overheads.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Projection-Free Sparse Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the projection-free sparse convex optimization problem for the vector domain and the matrix domain, which covers a large number of important applications in machine learning and data science. For the vector domain $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, we propose two quantum algorithms for sparse constraints that finds a $\varepsilon$-optimal solution with the query complexity of $O(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ and $O(1/\varepsilon)$ by using the function value oracle, reducing a factor of $O(\sqrt{d})$ and $O(d)$ over the best classical algorithm, respectively, where $d$ is the dimension. For the matrix domain $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$, we propose two quantum algorithms for nuclear norm constraints that improve the time complexity to $\tilde{O}(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{r}d/\varepsilon^3)$ for computing the update step, reducing at least a factor of $O(\sqrt{d})$ over the best classical algorithm, where $r$ is the rank of the gradient matrix. Our algorithms show quantum advantages in projection-free sparse convex optimization problems as they outperform the optimal classical methods in dependence on the dimension $d$.</description>

      <title>Photonic processor benchmarking for variational quantum process tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum-analogous experimental demonstration of variational quantum process tomography using an optical processor. This approach leverages classical one-hot encoding and unitary decomposition to perform the variational quantum algorithm on a photonic platform. We create the first benchmark for variational quantum process tomography evaluating the performance of the quantum-analogous experiment on the optical processor against several publicly accessible quantum computing platforms, including IBM's 127-qubit Sherbrooke processor, QuTech's 5-qubit Tuna-5 processor, and Quandela's 12-mode Ascella quantum optical processor. We evaluate each method using process fidelity, cost function convergence, and processing time per iteration for variational quantum circuit depths of $d=3$ and $d=6$. Our results indicate that the optical processors outperform their superconducting counterparts in terms of fidelity and convergence behavior reaching fidelities of $0.8$ after $9$ iterations, particularly at higher depths, where the noise of decoherence and dephasing affect the superconducting processors significantly.
  We further investigate the influence of any additional quantum optical effects in our platform relative to the classical one-hot encoding. From the process fidelity results it shows that the (classical) thermal noise in the phase-shifters dominates over other optical imperfections, such as mode mismatch and dark counts from single-photon sources.
  The benchmarking framework and experimental results demonstrate that photonic processors are strong contenders for near-term quantum algorithm deployment, particularly in hybrid variational contexts. This analysis is valuable not only for state and process tomography but also for a wide range of applications involving variational quantum circuit based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary high-fidelity binomial codes from multiphoton spin-boson interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoding a qubit in the continuous degrees of freedom of a quantum system, such as bosonic modes, is a powerful alternative to modern quantum error correction (QEC). Among the most prominent bosonic QEC codes, binomial codes provide protection against loss and dephasing errors by encoding logical states in superpositions of Fock states with binomially weighted coefficients. While much attention has been given to their error-correcting capabilities and integration into fault-tolerant architectures, efficient methods for generating arbitrary binomial codewords remain scarce. In this work, we propose a novel scheme for generating these codewords by exploiting nonlinear multiphoton interactions between a continuous-variable bosonic mode (oscillator) and a two-level system (spin/qubit). Our proposed scheme assumes the ability to prepare the oscillator in an arbitrary Fock state and the qubit in an arbitrary superposition of its basis states and access to arbitrarily high multiphoton interactions. To enhance the experimental feasibility of our scheme, we further demonstrate how to reduce the required order parameter of multiphoton interactions by a factor of two for a special class of code states.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Interpretation of Husimi Function and Wehrl Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Husimi function (Q-function) of a quantum state is the distribution function of the density operator in the coherent state representation. It is widely used in theoretical research, such as in quantum optics. The Wehrl entropy is the Shannon entropy of the Husimi function, and is non-zero even for pure states. This entropy has been extensively studied in mathematical physics. Recent research also suggests a significant connection between the Wehrl entropy and many-body quantum entanglement in spin systems. We investigate the statistical interpretation of the Husimi function and the Wehrl entropy, taking the system of $N$ spin-1/2 particles as an example. Due to the completeness of coherent states, the Husimi function and Wehrl entropy can be explained via the positive operator-valued measurement (POVM) theory, although the coherent states are not a set of orthonormal basis. Here, with the help of the Bayes' theorem, we provide an alternative probabilistic interpretation for the Husimi function and the Wehrl entropy. This interpretation is based on direct measurements of the system, and thus does not require the introduction of an ancillary system as in POVM theory. Moreover, under this interpretation the classical correspondences of the Husimi function and Wehrl entropy are just phase-space probability distribution function of $N$ classical tops, and its associated entropy, respectively. Therefore, this explanation contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between the Husimi function, Wehrl entropy, and classical-quantum correspondence. The generalization of this statistical interpretation to continuous-variable systems is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Entangled Threats: A Unified Kill Chain Model for Quantum Machine Learning Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) systems inherit vulnerabilities from classical machine learning while introducing new attack surfaces rooted in the physical and algorithmic layers of quantum computing. Despite a growing body of research on individual attack vectors - ranging from adversarial poisoning and evasion to circuit-level backdoors, side-channel leakage, and model extraction - these threats are often analyzed in isolation, with unrealistic assumptions about attacker capabilities and system environments. This fragmentation hampers the development of effective, holistic defense strategies. In this work, we argue that QML security requires more structured modeling of the attack surface, capturing not only individual techniques but also their relationships, prerequisites, and potential impact across the QML pipeline. We propose adapting kill chain models, widely used in classical IT and cybersecurity, to the quantum machine learning context. Such models allow for structured reasoning about attacker objectives, capabilities, and possible multi-stage attack paths - spanning reconnaissance, initial access, manipulation, persistence, and exfiltration. Based on extensive literature analysis, we present a detailed taxonomy of QML attack vectors mapped to corresponding stages in a quantum-aware kill chain framework that is inspired by the MITRE ATLAS for classical machine learning. We highlight interdependencies between physical-level threats (like side-channel leakage and crosstalk faults), data and algorithm manipulation (such as poisoning or circuit backdoors), and privacy attacks (including model extraction and training data inference). This work provides a foundation for more realistic threat modeling and proactive security-in-depth design in the emerging field of quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Time correlations from steady-state expectation values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering properties of correlation functions is typically challenging. On one hand, experimentally, it requires measurements with a temporal resolution finer than the system's dynamics. On the other hand, analytical or numerical analysis requires solving the system evolution. Here, we use recent results of quantum metrology with continuous measurements to derive general lower bounds on the relaxation and second-order correlation times that are both easy to calculate and measure. These bounds are based solely on steady-state expectation values and their derivatives with respect to a control parameter, and can be readily extended to the autocorrelation of arbitrary observables. We validate our method on two examples of critical quantum systems: a critical driven-dissipative resonator, where the bound matches analytical results for the dynamics, and the infinite-range Ising model, where only the steady state is solvable and thus the bound provides information beyond the reach of existing analytical approaches. Our results can be applied to experimentally characterize ultrafast systems, and to theoretically analyze many-body models with dynamics that are analytically or numerically hard.</description>

      <title>Magic Steady State Production: Non-Hermitian and Stochastic pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal quantum computers require states with both entanglement and non-stabilizerness, the latter property being commonly known as \textit{quantum magic}. Here, we introduce a protocol that prepares magic steady states by leveraging non-Hermitian dynamics, which, contrary to unitary dynamics, can host pure-state attractors. We investigate the dissipative qubit, in which we find the optimal parameters to prepare $|H\rangle$ and $|T\rangle$ states. Interestingly, this approach does not require knowledge or preparation of an initial state, since all the states of the Bloch sphere converge to these steady states. We also consider the addition of classical noise in the anti-hermitian part, and show that it does not necessarily hinder magic, rather the single trajectories show concentration around the magic steady state value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is a fundamental component of many quantum computing algorithms. In this paper, we present an alternative method for factoring this transformation. Inspired by this approach, we introduce a new quantum circuit for implementing the QFT. We show that this circuit is more efficient than the conventional design. Furthermore, using this circuit, we develop an alternative version of the HHL algorithm, which also demonstrates improved performance compared to the standard implementation.</description>

      <title>Simulated non-Markovian Noise Resilience of Silicon-Based Spin Qubits with Surface Code Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the resilience of silicon-based spin qubits against non-Markovian noise within the framework of quantum error correction. We consider a realistic non-Markovian noise model that affects both the Larmor frequency and exchange energy of qubits, allowing accurate simulations of noisy quantum circuits. We employ numerical emulation to assess the performance of the distance-3 rotated surface code and its XZZX variant, using a logical qubit coherence time metric based on Ramsey-like experiments. Our numerical results suggest that quantum error correction converts non-Markovian physical noise into Markovian logical noise, resulting in a quartic dependence of coherence time between physical and logical qubits. Additionally, we analyze the effects of spatial noise correlations and sparse architectures, substantiating the robustness of quantum error correction in silicon-based spin qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Routing Quantum Control of Causal Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, various frameworks have been proposed for the study of quantum processes with indefinite causal order. In particular, quantum circuits with quantum control of causal order (QC-QCs) form a broad class of physical supermaps obtained from a bottom-up construction and are believed to represent all quantum processes physically realisable in a fixed spacetime. Complementarily, the formalism of routed quantum circuits introduces quantum operations constrained by "routes" to represent processes in terms of a more fine-grained routed circuit decomposition. This decomposition, formalised using a so-called routed graph, represents the information flow within the respective process. However, the existence of routed circuit decompositions has only been established for a small set of processes so far, including both certain specific QC-QCs and more exotic processes as examples.
  In this work, we remedy this fact by connecting these two frameworks. We prove that for any given $N$, one can use a single routed graph to systematically obtain a routed circuit decomposition for any QC-QC with $N$ parties. We detail this construction explicitly and contrast it with other routed circuit decompositions of QC-QCs, which we obtain from alternative routed graphs. We conclude by pointing out how this connection can be useful to tackle various open problems in the field of indefinite causal order, particularly establishing circuit representations of subclasses of QC-QCs.</description>

      <title>Roadmap for Molecular Benchmarks in Nonadiabatic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14569v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the coupled electronic and nuclear response of a molecule to light excitation requires the application of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. However, when faced with a specific photophysical or photochemical problem, selecting the most suitable theoretical approach from the wide array of available techniques is not a trivial task. The challenge is further complicated by the lack of systematic method comparisons and rigorous testing on realistic molecular systems. This absence of comprehensive molecular benchmarks remains a major obstacle to advances within the field of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. A CECAM workshop, Standardizing Nonadiabatic Dynamics: Towards Common Benchmarks, was held in May 2024 to address this issue. This Perspective highlights the key challenges identified during the workshop in defining molecular benchmarks for nonadiabatic dynamics. Specifically, this work outlines some preliminary observations on essential components needed for simulations and proposes a roadmap aiming to establish, as an ultimate goal, a community-driven, standardized molecular benchmark set.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the investigation of nonlinear electromagnetic responses has received significant attention due to its potential for elucidating the quantum properties of matter. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in developing quantum theories of nonlinear responses to electric field, a comprehensive quantum theory framework that systematically addresses nonlinear responses to both electric and magnetic fields has yet to be thoroughly discussed. Here, we present a systematic quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response using the Matsubara Green's function approach, which explicitly incorporates the wave vector dependence of external electromagnetic fields. We provide diagrammatic representation and reveal the general properties of transport coefficients. We apply our theory to second-order responses, deriving the nonlinear Hall effects and magneto-nonlinear Hall effects in both time-reversal symmetric and time-reversal breaking systems. These effects stem from diverse quantum geometric sources. Additionally, we analyze the contributions arising from the Zeeman interaction. Our work presents a unified quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response, paving the way for further exploration of novel phenomena in this field.</description>

      <title>Diagonal Isometric Form for Tensor Product States in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isometric tensor product states (isoTPS) generalize the isometric form of the one-dimensional matrix product states (MPS) to tensor networks in two and higher dimensions. Here, we introduce an alternative isometric form for isoTPS by incorporating auxiliary tensors to represent the orthogonality hypersurface. We implement the time evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm on this new isometric form and benchmark the method by computing ground states and the real time evolution of the transverse field Ising model in two dimensions on large square lattices of up to 1250 sites. Our results demonstrate that isoTPS can efficiently capture the entanglement structure of two-dimensional area law states. The short-time dynamics is also accurately reproduced even at the critical point. Our isoTPS formulation further allows for a natural extension to different lattice geometries, such as the honeycomb or kagome latice.</description>

      <title>Emotion Recognition in Older Adults with Quantum Machine Learning and Wearable Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of inferring emotional states exclusively from physiological signals, thereby presenting a privacy-preserving alternative to conventional facial recognition techniques. We conduct a performance comparison of classical machine learning algorithms and hybrid quantum machine learning (QML) methods with a quantum kernel-based model. Our results indicate that the quantum-enhanced SVM surpasses classical counterparts in classification performance across all emotion categories, even when trained on limited datasets. The F1 scores over all classes are over 80% with around a maximum of 36% improvement in the recall values. The integration of wearable sensor data with quantum machine learning not only enhances accuracy and robustness but also facilitates unobtrusive emotion recognition. This methodology holds promise for populations with impaired communication abilities, such as individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The findings establish an early foundation for passive emotional monitoring in clinical and assisted living conditions.</description>

      <title>Enantioselective radical reactions can be induced by electron spin polarization: A quantum mechanism for Nature's emergent homochirality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecules that constitute life on Earth are chiral, but the precise mechanism by which homochirality emerged remains a mystery. In this work it is demonstrated that reactions of radical pairs, where one of the radical electron spins is polarised, can be enantioselective. This phenomenon arises from transient coherent quantum dynamics of the radical pair electron spins, which is known to occur even in warm and noisy condensed phase environments, where energetic perturbations much smaller than thermal energy can have large effects on reactivity. A quantitative theory is presented based on the molecular theory of chirality induced spin selectivity (CISS), where electron exchange interactions and chirality-dependent spin-orbit coupling effects control enantioselectivity. This theory provides useful bounds on the maximum enantiomeric excess for these reactions, which are found to be consistent with previous experiments. The enantioseletive radical pair mechanism presented here provides an alternative mechanistic basis to a recent proposal that spin-polarised photoelectrons from magnetite provided the initial chiral symmetry breaking necessary for the inception of homochirality in Nature, as well as suggests a new strategy for asymmetric synthesis using spin-polarised electrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents a promising frontier at the intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, aiming to leverage quantum computational advantages to enhance data-driven tasks. This review explores the potential of QML to address the computational bottlenecks of classical machine learning, particularly in processing complex datasets. We introduce the theoretical foundations of QML, including quantum data encoding, quantum learning theory and optimization techniques, while categorizing QML approaches based on data type and computational architecture. It is well-established that quantum computational advantages are problem-dependent, and so potentially useful directions for QML need to be systematically identified. Key developments, such as Quantum Principal Component Analysis, quantum-enhanced sensing and applications in material science, are critically evaluated for their theoretical speed-ups and practical limitations. The challenges posed by Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, including hardware noise, scalability constraints and data encoding overheads, are discussed in detail. We also outline future directions, emphasizing the need for quantum-native algorithms, improved error correction, and realistic benchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical promise and practical deployment. This comprehensive analysis underscores that while QML has significant potential for specific applications such as quantum chemistry and sensing, its broader utility in real-world scenarios remains contingent on overcoming technological and methodological hurdles.</description>

      <title>Tensor train representations of Greeks for Fourier-based pricing of multi-asset options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient computation of Greeks for multi-asset options remains a key challenge in quantitative finance. While Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is widely used, it suffers from the large sample complexity for high accuracy. We propose a framework to compute Greeks in a single evaluation of a tensor train (TT), which is obtained by compressing the Fourier transform (FT)-based pricing function via TT learning using tensor cross interpolation. Based on this TT representation, we introduce two approaches to compute Greeks: a numerical differentiation (ND) approach that applies a numerical differential operator to one tensor core and an analytical (AN) approach that constructs the TT of closed-form differentiation expressions of FT-based pricing. Numerical experiments on a five-asset min-call option in the Black-Sholes model show significant speed-ups of up to about $10^{5} \times$ over MC while maintaining comparable accuracy. The ND approach matches or exceeds the accuracy of the AN approach and requires lower computational complexity for constructing the TT representation, making it the preferred choice.</description>

      <title>Quantum register based on double quantum dots in semiconductor nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An implementation of a universal solid-state quantum register based on electron space states in field-defined double quantum dots (DQD possesses one electron in two adjacent tunnel bound dots) in an ultrathin semiconductor nanowire is discussed. To some extent, the structure resembles that of a field-effect transistor with multiple controlling electrodes (gates). Scalability is audible and it opens up a possibility of large-scale quantum computer fabricated by advanced silicon technology. Moreover, the structure could be developed into an ensemble quantum register where instead of single nanowire an array of them with common controlling electrodes and contacts is fabricated. This ensemble register is much more resistant against environment noise caused by phonons and stray charges due to averaging and compensation. It is crucial that an individual qubit consists of two DQDs. The basic states of that qubit correspond to symmetric state of one DQD and antisymmetric state of another, and vice versa. Then the quantum information can be encoded and processed without charge transfer between dots. The probability to find an electron in a dot constantly equals 1/2 thus the Coulomb interaction between DQDs is also constant. Although the Coulomb interaction is incessant, the strength of its action depends on mutual states of interacting DQDs (in-resonance or off-resonance). Therefore, a quantum algorithm could be effectuated via manipulation solely with steady and pulse gate potentials that reminds an operation of a digital integrated circuit. The final read-out of the register is performed after decoding into charge states of DQDs and a transmission of current through the wire.</description>

      <title>Electric field measurements of Rydberg atomic frequency comb based on pulsed laser excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an innovative frequency comb methodology utilizing pulsed lasers for Rydberg atoms and implement it for electric field measurement. It achieves the Rydberg state population of multi-velocity group atoms through the two-photon resonant excitation of a 509 nm pulsed laser and an 852 nm continuous laser. The frequency comb approach markedly elevates the population of Rydberg atoms and augments the atomic density for sensing, thereby enhancing measurement sensitivity. Our investigations generated high-sensitivity measurements of electric fields across a broad spectrum from 20 kHz to 96 MHz, with a minimum measured electric field sensitivity of 2.9uV/cm/Hz(1/2). Additionally, we have exhibited a high degree of measurement sensitivity in the 66 MHz and 88 MHz broadcast communication frequencies. This research enhances the effective detection of microwave signals over a broad spectrum of frequency bands utilizing Rydberg atoms and introduces an innovative technical methodology for microwave metrology grounded in Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the isentropic absorption of a classical charged test particle is classically forbidden for all 3+1 dimensional stationary, non-extremal, axisymmetric black holes in any diffeomorphism invariant theory of gravity. This result is derived purely from the near-horizon geometry and thermodynamic properties of the black hole spacetime, independent of the specific gravitational theory. We further consider the Kerr-Newman black hole in general relativity and analyze within the semiclassical WKB approximation, the conditions under which isentropic absorption may become allowed. Broader implications for the second law and extremality bounds are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments and their interpretation on polarization dynamics and polarization switching in vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers operated in the fundamental transverse mode regime are reviewed. Important observations are switching events to a mode with the lower unsaturated gain and the existence of elliptically polarized dynamical transition states after the destabilization of the low-frequency polarization mode. The observations demonstrate the need to consider explicitly the phase properties of the optical field as well as nonlinear effects affecting polarization selection above threshold. Good qualitative agreement is found with a model which takes into account the spin degrees of freedom of the light field as well as of the carriers (`spin-flip model'), if the spin-flip rate is taken to be some tens of $10^9$~s$^{-1}$. This constitutes a strong -- though indirect -- indication that spin dependent processes are important in polarization selection in the devices investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly coupling two systems allows them to exchange coherent information before the systems decohere. This important regime in light-matter interactions has predominantly been reached in optical resonator configurations. In this work, we present the experimental realization of strong coupling between optical and acoustic fields within a continuum of modes in a cavity-less configuration after a single-pass through an optical waveguide. The underlying physical effect of anti-Stokes Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering in a highly nonlinear fiber at T = 4 K allows us to experimentally demonstrate strong coupling in a waveguide scenario. We show the splitting of the optoacoustic spectral response and introduce a novel technique to measure the avoided crossing of hybrid optoacoustic modes via forced detuning. This demonstration opens a path towards in-line acoustic-waves-based quantum signal processing in waveguide systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study helicity correlations of electron-positron pairs created by a homogeneous time-dependent electric field in the Sauter-Schwinger scenario. Our analysis is based on solving the Dirac equation with the Feynman or anti-Feynman boundary conditions, which is equivalent to the scattering matrix approach widely used in high energy physics. Most importantly, both these methods allow to fully account for the helicity (or, more generally, spin) correlations of created particles. The influence of helicity correlations and the carrier-envelope phase of the electric pulse on the properties of topological structures (such as spirals and vortices) in momentum distributions of created particles is investigated. The generation of maximally entangled helicity states is discussed and the possibility of using a short electric pulse as a fast switch between them is indicated.</description>

      <title>Partitioned Hybrid Quantum Fourier Neural Operators for Scientific Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Partitioned Hybrid Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (PHQFNO), a generalization of the Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (QFNO) for scientific machine learning. PHQFNO partitions the Fourier operator computation across classical and quantum resources, enabling tunable quantum-classical hybridization and distributed execution across quantum and classical devices. The method extends QFNOs to higher dimensions and incorporates a message-passing framework to distribute data across different partitions. Input data are encoded into quantum states using unary encoding, and quantum circuit parameters are optimized using a variational scheme. We implement PHQFNO using PennyLane with PyTorch integration and evaluate it on Burgers' equation, incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We show that PHQFNO recovers classical FNO accuracy. On incompressible Navier-Stokes, PHQFNO achieves higher accuracy than its classical counterparts. Finally, we perform a sensitivity analysis under input noise, confirming improved stability of PHQFNO over classical baselines.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum dynamics of vortex particles in accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments with spin-polarized beams of leptons and hadrons typically employ plane-wave states with definite momenta and energies. In contrast, vortex states represent cylindrical waves carrying a well-defined orbital angular momentum projection along the propagation direction. This projection can be arbitrarily large, endowing such particles with magnetic moments orders of magnitude greater than those of plane-wave states. Consequently, vortex particles could complement - or even replace - spin-polarized beams in high-energy collisions, enabling access to observables beyond the reach of the conventional states. Although relativistic vortex beams have yet to be realized, we investigate the radiative and non-radiative dynamics of angular momentum for vortex particles in accelerators. We compute the timescale for angular momentum loss via photon emission, finding it significantly longer than typical acceleration times. The non-radiative dynamics is governed by precession, with the orbital angular momentum precessing at a frequency markedly different from that of spin. Similar to spin tunes in circular accelerators, this can induce resonances that disrupt the beam's orbital momentum - occurring far more frequently for vortex beams than for spin-polarized ones. Thus, vortex particle acceleration can be more feasible in linacs, while Siberian snakes could serve as a tool for angular momentum manipulations.</description>

      <title>Probing electron spin dynamics in single telecom InAs(P)/InP quantum dots using the Hanle effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spins of carriers confined in quantum dots (QDs) are promising candidates for qubits due to their relatively long spin relaxation times. However, the electron spin dephasing, primarily driven by hyperfine interactions with nuclear spins, can limit their coherence. Here, we report the first Hanle effect demonstration in single InAs(P)/InP QDs emitting in the telecom C-band leading to experimental determination of electron spin dephasing time. Using polarization-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we identified excitonic complexes and confirmed the presence of a negatively charged trion, exhibiting a degree of circular polarization (DOCP) of $-36\%$ under quasi--resonant excitation. From the analysis of Hanle linewidth and employing a previously reported value of the electron $g$-factor, we extracted an electron spin dephasing time of $T_2^{\ast} = 1.59 \pm 0.49~\mathrm{ns}$. Despite the large indium nuclear spin, the obtained $T_2^{\ast}$ is comparable to values reported for GaAs-based QDs, which we attribute to the larger volume of the InAs(P)/InP QDs. These findings confirm the potential of InP-based telecom QDs for use in spin-photon interfaces.</description>

      <title>Distinct Lifetimes for $X$ and $Z$ Loop Measurements in a Majorana Tetron Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hardware realization and measurements of a tetron qubit device in a superconductor-semiconductor heterostructure. The device architecture contains two parallel superconducting nanowires, which support four Majorana zero modes (MZMs) when tuned into the topological phase, and a trivial superconducting backbone. Two distinct readout interferometers are formed by connecting the superconducting structure to a series of quantum dots. We perform single-shot interferometric measurements of the fermion parity for the two loops, designed to implement Pauli-$X$ and $Z$ measurements of the tetron. Performing repeated single-shot measurements yields two widely separated time scales $\tau_X = 14.5\pm 0.3 \, \mathrm{\mu s}$ and $\tau_Z = 12.4\pm 0.4\, \mathrm{ms}$ for parity switches observed in the $X$ and $Z$ measurement loops, which we attribute to intra-wire parity switches and external quasiparticle poisoning, respectively. We estimate assignment errors of $\mathrm{err}^X_a=16\%$ and $\mathrm{err}^Z_a=0.5\%$ for $X$ and $Z$ measurement-based operations, respectively.</description>

      <title>Gaussian pseudo-Orthogonal Ensemble of Real Random Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:1802.04588v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct Gaussian pseudo-orthogonal ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$ even and large) real pseudo-symmetric matrices under the metric $\eta$ using $ \altmathcal {N}=n(n+1)/2$ elements independently drawn from a Gaussian random population and investigate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues. When $\lambda \mu &gt;0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently, all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu &lt;0$ the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues exhibit intermediate statistics. We show that the diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \altmathcal{D}^t \zeta \altmathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to a pseudo-orthogonal group. These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.</description>

      <title>Averaging gate approximation error and performance of Unitary Coupled Cluster ansatz in Pre-FTQC Era</title>

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) is essential to implement quantum algorithms in a noise-resilient way, and thus to enjoy advantages of quantum computers even with presence of noise. In FTQC, a quantum circuit is decomposed into universal gates that can be fault-tolerantly implemented, for example, Clifford+T gates. Here, T gate is usually regarded as an essential resource for quantum computation because its action cannot be simulated efficiently on classical computers and it is experimentally difficult to implement fault-tolerantly. Practically, it is highly likely that only a limited number of T gates are available in the near future. Pre-FTQC era, due to the constraint on available resources, it is vital to precisely estimate the decomposition error of a whole circuit. In this paper, we propose that the Clifford+T decomposition error for a given quantum circuit containing a large number of quantum gates can be modeled as the depolarizing noise by averaging the decomposition error for each quantum gate in the circuit, and our model provides more accurate error estimation than the naive estimation. We exemplify this by taking unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) ansatz used in the applications of quantum computers to quantum chemistry as an example. We theoretically evaluate the approximation error of UCC ansatz when decomposed into Clifford+T gates, and the numerical simulation for a wide variety of molecules verified that our model well explains the total decomposition error of the ansatz. Our results enable the precise and efficient usage of quantum resources in the early-stage applications of quantum computers and fuel further research towards what quantum computation can achieve in the upcoming future.</description>

      <title>Crosstalk-mitigated microelectronic control for optically-active spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To exploit the sub-nanometre dimensions of qubits for large-scale quantum information processing, corresponding control architectures require both energy and space efficiency, with the on-chip footprint of unit-cell electronics ideally micron-scale. However, the spin coherence of qubits in close packing is severely deteriorated by microwave crosstalk from neighbouring control sites. Here, we present a crosstalk-mitigation scheme using foundry microelectronics, to address solid-state spins at sub-100 $\mu$m spacing without the need for qubit-detuning. Using nitrogen-vacancy centres in nanodiamonds as qubit prototypes, we first demonstrate 10 MHz Rabi oscillation at milliwatts of microwave power. Implementing the active cancellation, we then prove that the crosstalk field from neighbouring lattice sites can be reduced to undetectable levels. We finally extend the scheme to show increased qubit control, or effectively, the spin coherence under crosstalk mitigation. Compatible with integrated optics, our results present a step towards scalable control across quantum platforms using silicon microelectronics.</description>

      <title>Chiral-Extended Photon-Emitter Dressed States in Non-Hermitian Topological Baths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of quantum emitters and non-Hermitian structured baths has received increasing attention in recent years. Here, we predict unconventional quantum optical behaviors of quantum emitters coupled to a non-Hermitian topological bath, which is realized in a 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic chain subjected to nonlocal dissipation. In addition to the Hermitian-like chiral bound states in the middle line gap and skin-mode-like hidden bound states inside the point gap, we identify peculiar in-gap chiral and extended photon-emitter dressed states. This is due to the competition of topological-edge localization and non-Hermitian skin-mode localization in combination with the non-Bloch bulk-boundary correspondence. Strikingly, dissipation can shape the wavefunction profile of the dressed state. Furthermore, when two emitters are coupled to the same bath, such in-gap dressed states can mediate the nonreciprocal long-range emitter-emitter interactions, with the interaction range limited only by the dissipation of the bath. Our work opens the door to further study rich quantum optical phenomena and exotic many-body physics utilizing quantum emitters coupled to non-Hermitian baths.</description>

      <title>A quantum GAN for entanglement detection and image classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning can be used as a systematic method to non-algorithmically program quantum computers. Quantum machine learning enables us to perform computations without breaking down an algorithm into its gate building blocks, eliminating that difficult step and potentially reducing unnecessary complexity. In addition, the machine learning approach is robust to both noise and to decoherence, which is ideal for running on inherently noisy NISQ devices which are limited in the number of qubits available for error correction. Here we apply our prior work in quantum machine learning technique, to create a QGAN, a quantum analog to the classical Stylenet GANs developed by Kerras for image generation and classification. A quantum system is used as a generator and a separate quantum system is used as a discriminator. The generator Hamiltonian quantum parameters are augmented by quantum style parameters which play the role of the style parameters used by Kerras. Both generator parameters are trained in a GAN MinMax problem along with quantum parameters of the discriminator Hamiltonian. We choose a problem to demonstrate the QGAN that has purely quantum information. The task is to generate and discriminate quantum product states. Real product states are generated to be detected and separated from fake quantum product states generated by the quantum generator. The problem of detecting quantum product states is chosen to demonstrate the QGAN because is well known as purely quantum mechanical, has no classical analog and is an open problem for quantum product states of more than 2 qubits. With proper encoding of image pixels into quantum states as density matrices, the method demonstrated here is applicable to GAN image generation and detection that can be hosted on and take advantage of the nature of quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study employs Krylov-based information measures to understand task performance in quantum reservoir computing, a sub-field of quantum machine learning. In our study we show that fidelity and spread complexity can only explain the task performance for short time evolutions of the quantum systems. We then discuss two measures, Krylov expressivity and Krylov observability, and compare them to task performance and the information processing capacity. Our results show that Krylov observability exhibits almost identical behavior to information processing capacity, while being three orders of times faster to compute. In the case when the system is undersampled Krylov observability best captures the behavior of the task performance.</description>

      <title>Unique entanglement time evolution of two-qubit product separable and extended Werner-like states in a discrete qubit environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the parameters affecting the entanglement time evolution of product separable (PS) and extended Werner-like (EWL) states in homogeneous, white noise, and mixed environments. In a pure homogeneous environment, both states demonstrate complete entanglement revivals, where an increase in the number of environments leads to an attenuation of concurrence. The PS state exhibits gaps and never reaches a maximum entanglement, whereas maximum purity EWL states (Bell states) maintain or periodically reach maximum entanglement. Hence, the PS and EWL states have a disjoint entanglement time evolution subspaces. Interestingly, the environment interaction and subsystem coupling interaction that influence entanglement have an inverse time relationship under a constant value of concurrence. Placing the system of interest in a white noise environment induces entanglement dissipation, with the dissipation time dependent on the width of random distribution of interaction strengths rather than the magnitude of interaction strength. In a distinct qubit environment, the entanglement time evolution of the PS state depends on the distribution of the number of environments. Moreover, combining homogeneous and white noise environments results in entanglement dynamics that exhibit characteristics of both homogeneous and white noise.</description>

      <title>Interference of photons from independent hot atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coherence of light from independent ensembles of elementary atomic emitters plays a paramount role in diverse areas of modern optics. We demonstrate the interference of photons scattered from independent ensembles of warm atoms in atomic vapor. It relies on the feasibility of the preservation of coherence of light scattered elastically in the forward and backward directions from Doppler-broadened atomic ensembles, such that photons with chaotic photon statistics from two opposite atomic velocity groups contribute to the same detection mode. While the random phase fluctuations of the scattered light caused by a large thermal motion prevent direct observability of the interference in the detected photon rate, the stable frequency difference between photons collected from scattering off counter-propagating laser beams provides strong periodic modulation of the photon coincidence rate with the period given by the detuning of the excitation laser from the atomic resonance. The presented interferometry represents a sensitive and robust methodology for Doppler-free optical atomic and molecular spectroscopy based on photon correlation measurements on scattered light.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the quantum approximate optimization algorithm: ans\"atze, symmetries, and Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) has been proposed as a method to obtain approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization tasks. In this work, we study the underlying algebraic properties of three QAOA ans\"atze for the maximum-cut (maxcut) problem on connected graphs, while focusing on the generated Lie algebras as well as their invariant subspaces. Specifically, we analyze the standard QAOA ansatz as well as the orbit and the multi-angle ans\"atze. We are able to fully characterize the Lie algebras of the multi-angle ansatz across arbitrary connected graphs, finding that they only fall into one of just six families. Besides the cycle and the path graphs, the Lie dimensions for every graph are exponentially large in the system size, meaning that multi-angle ans\"atze are extremely prone to exhibiting barren plateaus. Then, a similar quasi-graph-independent Lie-algebraic characterization beyond the multi-angle ansatz is impeded as the circuit exhibits additional "hidden" symmetries besides those naturally arising from a certain parity-superselection operator and all automorphisms of the considered graph. Disregarding the "hidden" symmetries, we can upper bound the dimensions of the orbit and the standard Lie algebras, and the dimensions of the associated invariant subspaces are determined via explicit character formulas. To finish, we conjecture that (for most graphs) the standard Lie algebras have only components that are either exponential or that grow, at most, polynomially with the system size. This would imply that the QAOA is either prone to barren plateaus, or classically simulable. More generally, our work provides a symmetry framework and tools to analyze any desired variational quantum algorithm.</description>

      <title>Spoofing of Quantum Channels Enables Low-Rank Projective Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to characterise and discern quantum channels is a crucial aspect of noisy quantum technologies. In this work, we explore the problem of distinguishing quantum channels when limited to sub-exponential resources, framed as von Neumann (projective) measurements. We completely characterise equivalence classes of quantum channels with different Kraus ranks that have the same marginal distributions under compatible projective measurements. In doing so, we explicitly identify gauge freedoms which can be varied without changing those compatible marginal outcome distributions, opening new avenues for quantum channel simulation, variational quantum channels, as well as novel adversarial strategies in noisy quantum device certification. Specifically, we show how a Sinkhorn-like algorithm enables us to find the minimum admissible Kraus rank that generates the correct outcome marginals. For a generic $d$-dimensional quantum system, this lowers the Kraus rank from $d^2$ to the theoretical minimum of $d$. For up to $d = 20$, we numerically demonstrate our findings, for which the code is available and open source. Finally, we provide an analytic algorithm for the special case of spoofing Pauli channels.</description>

Abstract: We present an innovative optical imaging system for measuring parameters of a small particle such as a macromolecule or nanoparticle at the quantum limit of sensitivity. In comparison to the conventional confocal interferometric scattering (iSCAT) approach, our setup adds a second arm to form a Michelson interferometer that allows us to tune a relative phase. We evaluate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) for different quantum states, including single-mode coherent states, multi-frequency coherent states, and phase-averaged coherent states. Our results show that the proposed setup can achieve the QCRB of sensitivity and outperform iSCAT for all considered quantum states for mass and phase estimation of a particle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is an increasing interest in scaling tensor network methods through belief propagation (BP), as well as increasing the accuracy of BP through tensor network methods. We develop a unification framework that takes an arbitrary graphical model with loops and provides message passing update rules and inference equations. We show that recent state-of-the-art methods regarding tensors and BP, like block belief propagation and tensor network message passing, are special instances of our framework. From a practical perspective, we discuss how our framework can be useful in order to understand the benefits of scheduling in BP, and show how it can be used for decoding purposes in quantum error correction. Lastly, to numerically support our claims, we show that our framework can achieve an accuracy improvement of more than ten orders of magnitude over tensor network BP when computing the trace of a tensor network consisting of a chain of connected triangles with periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Versatile Control of Nonlinear Topological States in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and nonlinearity can both delocalize topological modes (TMs) from the interface. However, the NHSE requires precise parameter tuning, while nonlinearity in Hermitian systems results in partial delocalization with limited mode capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-Hermitian nonlinear topological interface model that integrates Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices with nonreciprocal hopping and nonlinearity. This system enables the complete delocalization of TMs across the entire lattice without fine-tuning, while allowing precise control over the wavefunction profile and spatial distribution through the intrinsic configuration and intensity of the nonlinearity. Using the spectral localizer, we demonstrate the topological protection and robustness of these extended non-Hermitian TMs against disorder. Furthermore, we show that under external pumping, localized excitations evolve into predefined profiles and generate long-range patterns, an effect unattainable in Hermitian systems. These findings reveal how the interplay of nonlinearity and NHSE shapes topological states, paving the way for compact topological devices.</description>

Abstract: Photon-subtracted two-mode squeezed vacuum states, a significant quantum resource, exhibit intricate correlations and unique quantum properties. In this work, we propose a theoretical yet experimentally feasible model to engineer these states using a waveguide trimer. Our study uncovers distinct characteristics of the photon-subtracted state depending on whether an even or odd number of photons is extracted, shedding light on the subtle relationship between quantum state manipulation and the parity of the number of subtracted photons. Furthermore, our integrated device facilitates the generation of multiphoton states with tunable correlations, offering significant potential for applications in quantum-enhanced technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a dephasing many-body open quantum system that hosts, together with the infinite-temperature state, another additional stationary state. The latter is exceptional in many respects, as it is pure and retains memory of the initial condition, whereas any orthogonal state evolves towards the infinite-temperature state erasing any information on the initial state. We discuss the approach to stationarity of the model focusing in particular on the fate of interfaces between the two states; a simple classical model based on a membrane picture helps developing an effective hydrodynamic theory even if the dynamics does not feature any conserved quantity. The fact that the model reaches stationary properties on timescales that depend on the system size while the asymptotic decay rate is finite is duly highlighted. We point out the reasons for considering these exceptional stationary states as quantum many-body scars in the open system framework.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that time-evolved operators can construct a Krylov space to compute Operator complexity and introduce Krylov observability as a measure of effective phase space dimension in quantum systems. We test Krylov observability in the framework of quantum reservoir computing and show that it closely mirrors information processing capacity, a data-driven expressivity metric, while achieving computation times that are orders of magnitude faster. Our results validate Operator complexity and give the interpretation that data in a quantum reservoir is mapped onto the Krylov space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) plays a crucial role in quantum optimization algorithms such as Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution and Quantum Natural Gradient Descent. However, computing the full QFIM incurs a quadratic computational cost of O(d^2) with respect to the number of parameters d, limiting its scalability for high-dimensional quantum systems. To address this limitation, stochastic methods such as the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) have been employed to reduce computational complexity to a constant (Quantum 5, 567 (2021)). In this work, we propose an alternative estimation framework based on Stein's identity that also achieves constant computational complexity. Furthermore, our method reduces the quantum resources required for QFIM estimation compared to the SPSA approach. We provide numerical examples using the transverse-field Ising model and the lattice Schwinger model to demonstrate the feasibility of applying our method to realistic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Hong-Ou-Mandel effect with two frequency-entangled photons of vastly different color</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the original Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) experiment -- when two identical photons are incident upon the input ports of a balanced beam-splitter -- they coalesce, always leaving via the same output port. It is often interpreted that this interference arises due to the indistinguishability of the single photons; the situation, however, is often more nuanced. Here, we demonstrate an analog of HOM interference between two photons of completely different color. To do so, we utilize a quantum frequency converter based on sum- and difference-frequency generation as an `active' beam-splitter -- coupling frequency-entangled red and telecom single photons with an octave-spanning energy difference of 282 THz. Uncorrected two-photon interference visibilities well above 90% were achieved. This work presents the first demonstration of HOM interference between two single photons of distinctly different color, deepening our understanding of what underlies quantum interference. It also suggests a novel approach to interfacing photonic qubits in heterogeneous quantum systems where frequency conversion and quantum interference are unified.</description>

Abstract: The interplay of coherence and decoherence is played out in a three-level quantum system, in which the third level is incoherently coupled to the second one which itself is in coherent interaction with the first level. The study is based on a stochastic scenario in which the coherent, unitary evolution of the system is randomly interrupted by a Poisson-driven pulse sequence. In the absence of an external pulse, the system undergoes coherent, unitary evolution restricted to the subspace spanned by the first level (level $1$) and the second level (level $2$). The application of a pulse induces transitions between the second and the third level (level $3$), thereby introducing non-unitary effects that perturb the otherwise isolated two-level dynamics. The pulses are assumed to have infinitesimal duration, with strengths modeled as random variables that are uncorrelated across different pulses. A representative model for the stochastically-averaged transition (super)operator mimicking the dynamics induced by the application of pulses allows for an analytical derivation of the matrix elements of the averaged density operator. When the system is initially in level $1$, we obtain in particular the temporal behavior of the stay-put probability, that is, the probability $P_1(t)$ that the system is still in level $1$ at time $t$. As a function of time, the quantity $P_1(t)$ exhibits a coherence-to-decoherence crossover behavior. At short times $t \ll 1/\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the average frequency at which pulses are applied to the system, coherent dynamics dominate. Consequently, $P_1(t)$ displays pronounced Rabi-like oscillations. At long times $t \gg 1/\lambda$, decoherence effects prevail, leading to an exponential decay of the form $P_1(t) \sim \exp(-\lambda t)$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Rabi oscillations in the semiclassical limit: backreaction on the cavity field and entanglement</title>

Abstract: The goal of this chapter is to compare the predictions of the semiclassical Rabi model (SRM), which describes the interaction between a two-level system (qubit) and a classical monochromatic wave, and the quantum Rabi model (QRM), under the assumption that the cavity field is initiated in a coherent state with a large average number of photons, ranging from 5K to 40K. First, we show that for a strong atom-field coupling, when the duration of the $\pi $-pulse (the time interval required to completely excite or deexcite the qubit in the resonant regime) is below $100\omega ^{-1}$, the behaviour of the atomic excitation probability deviates significantly from the textbook sinusoidal formula derived for the SRM under the rotating-wave approximation, and we present simple analytical and semi-analytical methods to describe more accurately the dynamics. Then we show that the QRM reproduces the qubit's dynamics predicted by the SRM only for initial times, since in the QRM the qubit excitation probability exhibits a collapse behaviour even in the lossless scenario; we also notice that the qualitative behaviour of such collapses is different from the ones occurring in the dissipative SRM. In the rest of this work we study numerically the backreaction of the qubit on the cavity field and the resulting atom--field entanglement, which are disregarded in the SRM. It is shown that the atom-field entanglement increases over time and a maximally entangled state is attained for large times. Moreover, we illustrate how the Rabi oscillations continuously modify the quantum state of the cavity field, which becomes increasingly different from the original coherent state as the time increases.</description>

      <title>QubitLens: An Interactive Learning Tool for Quantum State Tomography</title>

Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a fundamental task in quantum computing, involving the reconstruction of an unknown quantum state from measurement outcomes. Although essential, it is typically introduced at the graduate level due to its reliance on advanced concepts such as the density matrix formalism, tensor product structures, and partial trace operations. This complexity often creates a barrier for students and early learners. In this work, we introduce QubitLens, an interactive visualization tool designed to make quantum state tomography more accessible and intuitive. QubitLens leverages maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), a classical statistical method, to estimate pure quantum states from projective measurement outcomes in the X, Y, and Z bases. The tool emphasizes conceptual clarity through visual representations, including Bloch sphere plots of true and reconstructed qubit states, bar charts comparing parameter estimates, and fidelity gauges that quantify reconstruction accuracy. QubitLens offers a hands-on approach to learning quantum tomography without requiring deep prior knowledge of density matrices or optimization theory. The tool supports both single- and multi-qubit systems and is intended to bridge the gap between theory and practice in quantum computing education.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics of Multi-Level Atoms embedded in Photonic Crystals: Leveraging Resonant Dipole Interactions and Quantum Interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of entanglement dynamics in multi-level V-type atomic systems embedded within PC cavities. We mainly focus on the synergistic roles of resonant dipole-dipole interactions and quantum interference through analytical modeling and numerical simulations using the Schrodinger equation. Key findings reveal that resonant interaction dominates when interatomic distances align with the localization length of photon-atom bound states lying in the bandgap region. The entanglement is preserved for extended times due to stronger RDDI, when dipoles of each atom are aligned parallel or anti-parallel for both quantum-correlated and separable initial states. For orthogonally oriented atomic dipoles, initially entangled states display a distinctive oscillatory entanglement behavior characterized by non-Markovian effects such as delayed feedback and entanglement revival. In contrast, initially separable states experience a more rapid decay of entanglement under these conditions. It is mainly driven by destructive interference between vacuum-mediated pathways and bandgap-engineered photonic density of states. We further demonstrate that positioning the atomic excited states deeper within the photonic bandgap accelerates the decay of entanglement oscillations due to the exponential suppression of resonant energy exchange mediated by evanescent modes. Our analysis establishes RDDI and quantum interference as potential tools for controlling entanglement lifetimes in photonic crystal environments, offering new strategies for engineered quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>Cavity Optomechanical Probe of Gravity Between Massive Mechanical Oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring gravitational interactions between objects with small masses has become increasingly timely. Concurrently, oscillators with masses ranging between milligrams and grams in cavity optomechanical systems sparked interest for probing gravity, and even investigating gravity within macroscopic quantum systems. Here we present a measurement scheme for probing gravity in a microwave optomechanical setup that incorporates periodic gravitational modulation between the test mass and the driven source mass at the milligram scale. Optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) can be utilized to sense the gravitational interactions between test masses and source masses. Specifically, the relative variation in the height of the OMIT peak, expressed as $|1 + re^{i\phi}|^2 - 1$, where $r$ represents the ratio of the amplitude of the gravitational driving force to the radiation pressure force of the probe tone, and $\phi$ denotes their phase difference, can reach up to 2.3\% under plausible experimental conditions. This work may facilitate cavity-optomechanical probing of gravitational coupling between milligram-scale mechanical oscillators, a mass regime where quantum and gravitational effects converge.</description>

      <title>Certification of high stellar ranks of quantum states of light with a pair of click detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar rank of quantum states of light quantifies the amount of non-Gaussian resources required for their generation. One popular and practical approach to certification of stellar rank is based on measurement of click statistics with an array of binary detectors that can only distinguish the presence and absence of photons. Specifically, it was shown that measurements with an array of m+1 detectors allows one to certify stellar rank of approximate Fock state |m&gt;, even when the state is subjected to losses or certain noise. Here we address the question how many click detectors are in principle required to certify high stellar ranks. We show that two click detectors arranged in a Hanbury Brown-Twiss setup suffice. Interestingly, detection of higher stellar rank is greatly facilitated by making the total detection efficiency of the detectors sufficiently low but well calibrated. Losses affect the response of the detection scheme in a way that can be exploited to certify stellar rank of high Fock states. We explicitly construct the corresponding stellar rank witnesses and discuss dependence of the stellar rank thresholds on parameters of the considered setup. Our results reveal that it is possible to certify high stellar ranks even with a minimalistic scheme that provides only very coarse grained information about the photon number statistics of the characterized state.</description>

      <title>A Fundamental Bound for Robust Quantum Gate Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a universal performance limit for coherent quantum control in the presence of modeled and unmodeled uncertainties. For any target unitary $W$ that is implementable in the absence of error, we prove that the worst-case (and hence the average) gate fidelity obeys the lower bound $F \ge \Flb\bigl(\tf \Omeff\bigr)$, where $\tf$ is the gate duration and $\Omeff$ is a single frequency-like measure that aggregates \emph{all} bounded uncertainty sources, e.g., coherent control imperfections, unknown couplings, and residual environment interactions, without assuming an initially factorizable system-bath state or a completely positive map. The bound is obtained by combining an interaction-picture averaging method with a Bellman-Gronwall inequality and holds for any finite-norm Hamiltonian decomposition. Hence it applies equally to qubits, multi-level qudits, and ancilla-assisted operations. Because $\Flb$ depends only on the dimensionless product $\tf\Omeff$, it yields a device-independent metric that certifies whether a given hardware platform can, in principle, reach a specified fault-tolerance threshold, and also sets a quantitative target for robust-control synthesis and system identification.</description>

      <title>Learnable quantum spectral filters for hybrid graph neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a parameterized quantum circuit that can be considered as convolutional and pooling layers for graph neural networks. The circuit incorporates the parameterized quantum Fourier circuit where the qubit connections for the controlled gates derived from the Laplacian operator. Specifically, we show that the eigenspace of the Laplacian operator of a graph can be approximated by using QFT based circuit whose connections are determined from the adjacency matrix. For an $N\times N$ Laplacian, this approach yields an approximate polynomial-depth circuit requiring only $n=log(N)$ qubits. These types of circuits can eliminate the expensive classical computations for approximating the learnable functions of the Laplacian through Chebyshev polynomial or Taylor expansions.
  Using this circuit as a convolutional layer provides an $n-$ dimensional probability vector that can be considered as the filtered and compressed graph signal. Therefore, the circuit along with the measurement can be considered a very efficient convolution plus pooling layer that transforms an $N$-dimensional signal input into $n-$dimensional signal with an exponential compression. We then apply a classical neural network prediction head to the output of the circuit to construct a complete graph neural network. Since the circuit incorporates geometric structure through its graph connection-based approach, we present graph classification results for the benchmark datasets listed in TUDataset library. Using only [1-100] learnable parameters for the quantum circuit and minimal classical layers (1000-5000 parameters) in a generic setting, the obtained results are comparable to and in some cases better than many of the baseline results, particularly for the cases when geometric structure plays a significant role.</description>

      <title>Experimental Ground-State Energy of a 125-Site Flat Kagome Antiferromagnet via Hamiltonian Engineering on Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an instance of utility-grade quantum computation by calculating the ground-state energy of a 125-site flat Kagome lattice under the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (KAFH), with IBM's Heron r1 and Heron r2 quantum processors. For spin-1/2 KAFH, our best per-site ground-state energy estimate arrives at -0.417J, and after applying open-boundary corrections, it closely approaches the established thermodynamic value of -0.438J. To achieve this, we propose a hybrid approach that splits the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) into local (classical) and global (quantum) components for efficient hardware utilization. We further introduce a Hamiltonian engineering strategy that increases coupling on defect triangles to mimic loop-flip dynamics, allowing us to simplify the ansatz while retaining physical accuracy. Using a single-repetition, hardware-efficient ansatz, we entangle up to 103 qubits with high fidelity to determine the Hamiltonian's lowest eigenvalue. This work demonstrates the scalability of VQE for frustrated 2D systems and lays the foundation for future studies using deeper ansatz circuits and larger lattices.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid solvers for combinatorial optimization problems combine the advantages of classical and quantum computing to overcome difficult computational challenges. Although their theoretical performance seems promising, their practical applicability is challenging due to the lack of a technological stack that can seamlessly integrate quantum solutions with existing classical optimization frameworks. We tackle this challenge by introducing the ProvideQ toolbox, a software tool that enables users to easily adapt and configure hybrid solvers via Meta-Solver strategies. A Meta-Solver strategy implements decomposition techniques, which splits problems into classical and quantum subroutines. The ProvideQ toolbox enables the interactive creation of such decompositions via a Meta-Solver configuration tool. It combines well-established classical optimization techniques with quantum circuits that are seamlessly executable on multiple backends. This paper introduces the technical details of the ProvideQ toolbox, explains its architecture, and demonstrates possible applications for several real-world use cases. Our proof of concept shows that Meta-Solver strategies already enable the application of quantum subroutines today, however, more sophisticated hardware is required to make their performance competitive.</description>

Abstract: In this educational paper, we will discuss calculations on the hydrogen molecule both on classical and quantum computers. In the former case, we will discuss the calculation of molecular integrals that can then be used to calculate potential energy curves at the Hartree--Fock level and to correct them by obtaining the exact results for all states in the minimal basis. Some aspects of spin-symmetry will also be discussed. In the case of quantum computing, we will start out from the second-quantized Hamiltonian and qubit mappings. Using quantum phase estimation, we then provide the circuits for two different algorithms: Trotteization and qubitization. Finally, the significance of quantum error correction will be briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Wehrl Entropy and Entanglement Complexity of Quantum Spin Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wehrl entropy of a quantum state is the Shannon entropy of its coherent-state distribution function, and remains non-zero even for pure states. We investigate the relationship between this entropy and the many-particle quantum entanglement, for $N$ spin-1/2 particles. Explicitly, we numerically calculate the Wehrl entropy of various $N$-particle ($2\leq N\leq 20$) entangled pure states, with respect to the SU(2)$^{\otimes N}$ coherent states. Our results show that for the large-$N$ ($N\gtrsim 10$) systems the Wehrl entropy of the highly chaotic entangled states (e.g., $2^{-N/2}\sum_{s_1,s_2,...,s_N=\uparrow,\downarrow}|s_1,s_2,...,s_N\rangle e^{-i\phi_{s_1,s_2,...,s_N}}$, with $\phi_{s_1,s_2,...,s_N}$ being random angles) are substantially larger than that of the very regular entangled states (e.g., the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state). Therefore, the Wehrl entropy can reflect the complexity of the quantum entanglement of many-body pure states, as proposed by A. Sugita (Jour. Phys. A 36, 9081 (2003)). In particular, the Wehrl entropy per particle (WEPP) can be used as a quantitative description of this entanglement complexity. Unlike other quantities used to evaluate this complexity (e.g., the degree of entanglement between a subsystem and the other particles), the WEPP does not necessitate the division of the total system into two subsystems. We further demonstrate that many-body pure entangled states can be classified into three types, based on the behavior of the WEPP in the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$: states approaching that of a maximally mixed state, those approaching completely separable pure states, and a third category lying between these two extremes. Each type exhibits fundamentally different entanglement complexity.</description>

Abstract: Rydberg atoms exhibit remarkable sensitivity to electromagnetic fields, making them promising candidates for revolutionizing field sensors. Unlike conventional antennas, they neither disturb the measured field nor necessitate intricate calibration procedures. In this study, we propose a protocol for signal reception near the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi frequency band, harnessing the capabilities of warm Rydberg atoms. Our focus lies on exploring various quadrature amplitude modulations and transmission frequencies through heterodyne detection. We offer a comprehensive characterization of our setup, encompassing the atomic response frequency range and attainable electric field amplitudes. Additionally, we delve into analyzing communication errors using Voronoi diagrams, along with evaluating the communication channel capacity across different modulation schemes. Our findings not only lay the groundwork for future wireless communication applications, but also present opportunities to refine protocols in classical communication and field sensing domains.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Momentum Spectra of pair created in a pulsed field at finite times: Are Oscillations "Real"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02947v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the mechanism of production of electron-positron pairs from the vacuum in a time-varying, spatially uniform pulsed electric field. We analytically compute the probability of $(e^+ e^-) $pair production in momentum space using the exact solution of the one-particle time-dependent Dirac equation and compare the result with quantum kinetic theory (QKT). Both approaches allow us to study the particle momentum spectrum at any instant in time and can potentially unveil valuable information regarding quantum non-equilibrium physics. We analyze both approaches' momentum spectra of the created particles at any instant. We observe a multi-profile structure in the LMS. This multi-profile structure clearly illustrates the quantum interference effects associated with pair production. It is worth noting that both approaches exhibit quantum interference patterns at finite times, manifested as oscillations observed in the LMS. We highlight that this quantum signature is a universal behavior seen in the momentum spectra at finite times, where the electric field is nearly zero.</description>

      <title>Probing the dichotomy between Yu-Shiba-Rusinov and Majorana bound states via conductance, quantum noise and $\Delta_T$ noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16717v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate charge and spin conductance, charge and spin quantum noise, along with charge and spin $\Delta_T$ noise, as diagnostic tools to distinguish Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states from Majorana-bound states (MBS) in a one-dimensional metal/spin-flipper/metal/insulator/superconductor junction. YSR states arise from magnetic impurities acting as spin-flippers within a trivial s-wave superconducting gap, while MBS emerge in topological superconductors, often leading to ambiguity in experiments where magnetic impurities mimic zero-energy MBS signatures. By replacing the trivial superconductor with a topological one exhibiting triplet pairing (e.g., chiral p or spinless p-wave nanowires), we identify robust and distinguishing features of YSR and MBS states. Our analysis demonstrates that combined measurements of both charge and spin conductance, charge and spin quantum noise, and their $\Delta_T$ noise counterparts offer unique and reliable signatures to differentiate YSR states from genuine MBS, thereby reducing false-positive interpretations in topological superconductivity experiments.</description>

      <title>Exponentially fast selection of sectors for quantum trajectories beyond non demolition measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, in long time, quantum trajectories select an invariant subspace of the Hilbert space of the system being indirectly measured. This selection is shown to be exponentially fast in an almost sure sense and in average. This result generalizes a known result for non demolition measurements to arbitrary repeated indirect measurements. Our proofs are based on the introduction of a deformation of the original instrument to an equivalent one with a unique invariant state.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and Interaction-Controlled Non-Hermitian Skin Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effects (NHSEs) have recently been extensively studied at the single-particle level. When many-body interactions become dominant, novel non-Hermitian phenomena can emerge. In this work, we propose an experimentally accessible mechanism to induce and control NHSEs in interacting and reciprocal dissipative systems. We consider both 1D and 2D Bose-Hubbard lattices subject to staggered two-particle loss combined with synthetic magnetic flux and long-range hopping. When the two-particle loss is small, the bound eigenstates (e.g., doublons and triplons) are all localized at the same boundary due to the interplay between the magnetic flux and staggered two-particle loss. In contrast, for strong two-particle loss, the skin-mode localization direction of the bound particles is unexpectedly reversed. This reversal stems from the combined effect of the staggered two-particle loss, synthetic magnetic flux, and long-range hopping, through which virtual second-order and third-order hopping processes induce effectively strong nonreciprocal hopping of doublons. Our results open up a new avenue for exploring novel non-Hermitian phenomena in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Kinetic uncertainty relations for quantum transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the precision of currents in a generic multi-terminal quantum-transport setting. Employing scattering theory, we show that the precision of the currents is limited by a function of the particle-current noise that can be interpreted as the activity in the classical limit. We thereby establish a kinetic uncertainty relation for quantum transport. In the full quantum limit, we find precision bounds in which we modify the activity constraints depending on whether the system is fermionic or bosonic. We expect these bounds to be guidelines for any transport process aiming at high precision.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian effects in long-range polariton-mediated energy transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intramolecular energy transfer driven by near-field effects plays an important role in applications ranging from biophysics and chemistry to nano-optics and quantum communications. Advances in strong light-matter coupling in molecular systems have opened new possibilities to control energy transfer. In particular, long-distance energy transfer between molecules has been reported as the result of their mutual coupling to cavity photon modes, and the formation of hybrid polariton states. In addition to strong coupling to light, molecular systems also show strong interactions between electronic and vibrational modes. The latter can act as a reservoir for energy to facilitate off-resonant transitions, and thus energy relaxation between polaritonic states at different energies. However, the non-Markovian nature of those modes makes it challenging to accurately simulate these effects. Here we capture them via process tensor matrix product operator (PT-MPO) methods, to describe exactly the vibrational environment of the molecules combined with a mean-field treatment of the light-matter interaction. In particular, we study the emission dynamics of a system consisting of two spatially separated layers of different species of molecules coupled to a common photon mode, and show that the strength of coupling to the vibrational bath plays a crucial role in governing the dynamics of the energy of the emitted light; at strong vibrational coupling this dynamics shows strongly non-Markovian effects, eventually leading to polaron formation. Our results shed light on polaritonic long-range energy transfer, and provide further understanding of the role of vibrational modes of relevance to the growing field of molecular polaritonics.</description>

      <title>Superheterodyne Rydberg S-band receiver with a multi-tone local oscillator based on an atomic transition loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic-vapor sensors based on Rydberg atoms now face a transition towards practical applications, with several outstanding challenges. To achieve the best sensitivities, a superheterodyne mode of operation is desired, which requires the presence of a local oscillator in the vapor cell. This local oscillator hinders several advantages of the sensor, such as stealthy and all-optical operation. We propose and realize a detection scheme, which avoids some of those problems by using multi-tone mixing, where direct usage of the local oscillator at the same frequency is not required. Our scheme is further elaborated on using efficient theoretical methods to predict the performance of the sensor. Our sensor operates at the S-band frequency, known for its usage in IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) networks, without interfering with the signal itself.</description>

      <title>Constraints from Entanglement Wedge Nesting for Holography at a Finite Cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore constraints that arise from associating an entanglement wedge (EW) to subregions of a cutoff boundary at a finite distance in AdS/CFT, using a subcritical end-of-the-world (ETW) brane acting as a cutoff. In particular, we consider the case of two intervals in the holographic dual to a BCFT, with one interval $A$ located at the asymptotic boundary and the second interval $B$ located on the ETW brane. We discuss in detail subtleties that arise near the RT end-points when defining the EW for this configuration, particularly in the connected phase. Entanglement wedge nesting (EWN) requires that $\mathcal{W}_E(A) \cup \mathcal{W}_E(B) \subseteq \mathcal{W}_E(A\cup B)$. We demonstrate that already in the simplest example of an AdS$_3$ bulk geometry, EWN can be violated even if $A$ and $B$ are spacelike separated through the bulk and instead we must require the stronger condition that $\mathcal{W}_E(A)$ be spacelike separated from $\mathcal{W}_E(B)$, which highlights the non-local nature of the cutoff theory. Our prescription to associate EWs to subregions on the ETW brane is different from the restricted maximin procedure in arXiv:2008.07022 but will agree within the subset of parameter space where EWN is respected. Additionally, we study EWN in a two sided BTZ black hole geometry with an ETW brane in one of the exteriors. In the BTZ black hole example we find that our condition for EWN disallows configurations where the RT surface goes from the brane to the black hole singularity.</description>

      <title>Probing the self-coherence of primordial quantum fluctuations with complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A smoking gun for our current paradigm of the early universe would be direct evidence for the quantum mechanical origin of density perturbations which are conjectured to seed the large scale structure of our universe. A recently-proposed novel phenomenon is that of recoherence, wherein a specific interaction between the adiabatic and the entropic sector leads to the adiabatic mode retaining a coherent state after a transient increase in linear entropy. In this paper, we choose the most general Gaussian action and analyze the evolution of linear entropy, complexity of purification (COP), and complexity of formation (COF) to capture the interplay between decoherence and recoherence in this model. In the presence of two types of couplings that drive these two opposing characteristics, we highlight how COF is an efficient tool for diagnosing dynamics for such an open quantum system.</description>

      <title>Many-body localization in a slowly varying potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study many-body localization (MBL) in a nearest-neighbor hopping 1D lattice with a slowly varying (SV) on-site potential $U_j = \lambda\cos(\pi\alpha j^s)$ with $0&lt;s&lt;1$. The corresponding non-interacting 1D lattice model is known to have single-particle localization with mobility edges. Using exact diagonalization, we find that the MBL of this model has similar features to the conventional MBL of extensively studied random or quasiperiodic (QP) models, including the transitions of eigenstate entanglement entropy (EE) and level statistics, and the logarithmic growth of EE. To further investigate the universal properties of this MBL transition in the asymptotic regime, we implement a real-space renormalization group (RG) method. RG analysis shows a subvolume scaling $\sim L^{d_{\rm MBL}}$ with $d_{\rm MBL} \approx 1-s$ of the localization length (length of the largest thermal clusters) in this MBL phase. In addition, we explore the critical properties and find universal scalings of the EE and localization length. From these quantities, we compute the critical exponent $\nu$ using different parameters $s$ (characterizing different degrees of spatial variation of the imposed potential), finding the critical exponent staying around $\nu\approx2$. This exponent $\nu \approx 2$ is close to that of the QP model within the error bars but differs from the random model. This observation suggests that the SV and QP models may belong to the same universality class, which is, however, likely distinct from the random universality class.</description>

      <title>Superradiance Enhanced Light-Matter Interaction in Spatially Ordered Shape and Volume Controlled Single Quantum Dots: Enabling On-Chip Photonic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-chip photonic networks require adequately spatially ordered matter-photon interconversion qubit sources with emission figures-of-merit exceeding the requirements that would enable the desired functional response of the network. The mesa-top single quantum dots (MTSQDs) have recently been demonstrated to meet these requirements. The substrate-encoded size-reducing epitaxy (SESRE) approach underpinning the realization of these unique quantum emitters allows control on the shape, size, and strain (lattice-matched or mismatched) of these epitaxial single quantum dots. We have exploited this unique feature of the MTSQDs to reproducibly create arrays of quantum dots that exhibit single photon superradiance, a characteristic of the SESRE-enabled delicate balance between the confinement pontential volume, depth, the resulting exciton binding energy, and the degree of confinement of the center of mass (CM) motion of the exciton. Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) studies reveal the structural (atomic scale) and chemical (nm scale) nature of the material region defining the notion of the shape and volume (here large) of the electron confinement region (i.e. the QD). In the exciton's weake CM confinement regime, owing to its coherent sampling of the large volume, enhancement of the MTSQD oscillator strength to ~30 is demonstrated. Theoretical modelling with input from the STEM finding provide corroboration for single photon superradiance causing enhancement of the oscillator strength by ~2.5 to 3. Our findings allow fabricating and studying interconnected networks enabled by the unique matter qubit-light qubit interconversion units that can be realized for lattice matched and mismatched material combinations covering UV to midinfrared wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Hollow-grams: Generalized Entanglement Wedges from the Gravitational Path Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Bousso and Penington (BP) made a proposal for the entanglement wedge associated to a gravitating bulk region. In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the "hollowed" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the R\'enyi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.</description>

      <title>Mid-IR hyperspectral imaging with undetected photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sensing with undetected photons has become a vibrant, application-driven research domain with a special focus on the mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelength region. Since the mid-IR contains spectral bands with highly specific and strong molecular absorbance signatures, often referred to as fingerprints, a multitude of different samples and their compositions can be detected and quantified spectroscopically. Enhancing this inherently sample alteration-free spectroscopic method with imaging capabilities leads to a powerful technique for environmental monitoring and biomedical applications that enables automated diagnostics while omitting time-consuming and non-reversible labeling steps. To evade the shortcomings of state-of-the-art instruments for mid-IR hyperspectral microscopy related to cost, complexity, power-consumption, and performance, which are associated with technological challenges for mid-IR cameras and low-noise and broadband mid-IR sources, here, we construct a proof-of-concept nonlinear interferometer in a wide-field imaging arrangement combined with high-resolution spectral acquisition by pixelwise quantum Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. For the broadband range of 2300-3100 cm$^{-1}$, covering the important CH-stretch band, we perform hyperspectral imaging that simultaneously resolves 3500 spatial modes, each with a spectral resolution of 10 cm$^{-1}$ leveraging in total around 10$^5$ spatio-spectrally entangled photon modes. Our image acquisition uses a commercial, megapixel sCMOS camera, while a medium-power and compact c.w. pump laser is the only necessary light source.</description>
