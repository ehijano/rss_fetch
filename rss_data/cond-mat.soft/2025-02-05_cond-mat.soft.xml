      <title>Role of Molecular Structure in Defining the Dynamical Landscape of Deep Eutectic Solvents at Nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The molecular dynamics of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are complex, characterized by nanoscale spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for tailoring transport properties like diffusion, viscosity and ionic conductivity. Molecular diffusion in DESs stems from transient caging and translation jumps, necessitating an understanding of how molecular structure regulates these processes. This study explores the influence of alkyl chain length on the nanoscopic dynamics of alkylamide-lithium perchlorate based DESs using quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. QENS results show that, despite its shorter chain length and lighter mass, acetamide (ACM) exhibited the lowest mobility among the alkylamides, including propanamide (PRM) and butyramide (BUT). Detailed analysis of QENS data reveals that long-range jump diffusion is fastest in ACM and slowest in BUT, essentially due to their differences in molecular size, mass and also enhanced complexation in longer alkyl chain molecules. However, the localized dynamics follows an unusual trend, where PRM is the fastest and ACM is the slowest. Despite greater flexibility in BUT, the slower caged dynamics impedes its localized motion. These findings highlight the interplay between alkyl chain length and DES dynamics, emphasizing role of molecular structure in governing transport properties.</description>

      <title>Strengthening by softening: Rigidity increase of a curved sheet from nonlinear regime of deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that a thin sheet held in a rigid circular clamp has a larger flexural strength than when it is flat. Here, we report that the flexural strength of curved sheets is further increased with a softening of the clamping condition. This unexpected compliance effect relates to the geometrical properties of curvature-induced rigidity that we observe in controlled experiments and further analyze with numerical simulations. In addition, we identify another compliance effect in which opened curved sheets can be more resistant to bending than closed cylinders of same dimensions.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Creep as a Precursor to Failure in Granular Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular materials, composed of discrete solid grains, can be modeled as simple mechanical systems. However, these materials can undergo spontaneous slow deformation, or creep, even under small forces and while in apparent mechanical equilibrium; a phenomenon central to understanding soil mechanics and the behavior of earthquake faults. We show that creep in granular materials originates from frictional dynamics at the contact points between grains. We reveal that the stability of these materials is governed by the interplay between creep and aging at these frictional contacts. Near the yield threshold, the frictional interactions result in anomalously accelerating creep, eventually leading to the delayed failure of the fragile packing. This behavior may serve as an early warning signal for catastrophic events like earthquakes and landslides.</description>

      <title>Flow rate from a vertical silo with a tilted orifice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow of dry granular materials from silos is of great practical interest in industry and of theoretical import for understanding multiphase dynamics. Recent studies have demonstrated that one way to control the rate of flow from a silo is to tilt it. However, this may not be practical in many industrial applications. Here, we demonstrate in experiments of quasi-2D silo discharge of monodisperse grains that the flow rate can be modulated by rotating the orifice - through elevating and shifting one side of the base - instead of tilting the entire silo. We use high-speed image analysis to track the average motion of grains in the silo. We first show that the flow rate decreases with orifice angle, but that this decrease is not as strong as when a silo is tilted or when a lateral orifice is used. However, with the addition of a grain-sized ridge on each side of the orifice, the flow rate collapses with prior tilted-silo results. We then characterize the flow velocity of grains exiting the orifice and highlight key features of the stagnant zones and slip zones on each orifice side. Finally, we model our results based on these measurements, demonstrating the importance of horizontal creep along slip zones next to the orifice and the narrowest opening cross-section through which the material flows. These findings reveal a simple method for controlling both flow rate and direction, and highlight the importance of both dynamics within and geometry of the stagnant zones near the orifice.</description>

      <title>Hydroelastic scattering and trapping of microswimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformable boundaries are omnipresent in the habitats of swimming microorganisms, leading to intricate hydroelastic couplings. Employing a perturbation theory, valid for small deformations, we study the swimming dynamics of pushers and pullers near instantaneously deforming boundaries, endowed with a bending rigidity and surface tension. Our results reveal that pushers can both reorient away from the boundary, leading to overall hydroelastic scattering, or become trapped by the boundary, akin to the enhanced trapping found for pullers. These findings demonstrate that the complex hydroelastic interactions can generate behaviors that are in striking contrast to swimming near planar walls.</description>

      <title>Emergent clogging of continuum particle suspensions in constricted channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle suspensions in confined geometries can become clogged, which can have a catastrophic effect on function in biological and industrial systems. Here, we investigate the macroscopic dynamics of suspensions in constricted geometries. We develop a minimal continuum two-phase model that allows for variation in particle volume fraction. The model comprises a ``wet solid'' phase with material properties dependent on the particle volume fraction, and a seepage Darcy flow of fluid through the particles. We find that spatially varying geometry (or material properties) can induce emergent heterogeneity in the particle fraction and trigger the abrupt transition to a high-particle-fraction ``clogged'' state.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Dissipation Relations for the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results demonstrate how deviations from equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be quantified for active field theories by deriving exact fluctuations dissipation relations that involve the entropy production [M. K. Johnsrud and R. Golestanian, arXiv:2409.14977]. Here we develop and employ diagrammatic tools to perform perturbative calculations for a paradigmatic active field theory, the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. We obtain analytical results, which serve as an illustration of how to implement the recently developed framework to active field theories, and help to illuminate the specific non-equilibrium characteristics of the NRCH field theory.</description>

      <title>Data-driven discovery of self-similarity using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding self-similarity is a key step for understanding the governing law behind complex physical phenomena. Traditional methods for identifying self-similarity often rely on specific models, which can introduce significant bias. In this paper, we present a novel neural network-based approach that discovers self-similarity directly from observed data, without presupposing any models. The presence of self-similar solutions in a physical problem signals that the governing law contains a function whose arguments are given by power-law monomials of physical parameters, which are characterized by power-law exponents. The basic idea is to enforce such particular forms structurally in a neural network in a parametrized way. We train the neural network model using the observed data, and when the training is successful, we can extract the power exponents that characterize scale-transformation symmetries of the physical problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both synthetic and experimental data, validating its potential as a robust, model-independent tool for exploring self-similarity in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of electrostatic interactions between two charged dielectric spheres inside a polarizable medium: An effective-dipole analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mechanisms of electrostatic interactions between two charged dielectric spheres inside a polarizable medium have been investigated, in terms of hypothetical effective dipoles that depict how the positive and negative charge in each particle are separated. Our findings, which revealed that it is possible for polarization-induced opposite-charge repulsion to occur at short interparticle separations if the dielectric constant of the medium is greater than the dielectric constants of both spheres, provide insights into the physics of charge separation in each sphere and of polarization in the medium behind such counterintuitive behaviour.</description>

      <title>Emergent cell migration from cell shape deformations and T1 transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: T1 transitions, which are localised cell rearrangements, play an important role in the fluidization of epithelial monolayers. Using a multi-phase field model and an active elastic solid model, we show that although each cell undergoes T1 transitions in time as uncorrelated, random events, the spatial distribution of these events is highly correlated and is dependent on cell shape. T1 transitions have a dual effect. Cells losing neighbours tend to relax their shape, while those gaining neighbours tend to elongate. By analysing the statistics of successive T1 transitions undergone by a deformable cell, we find asymmetric spatial distributions related to how cells lose or gain neighbours. These asymmetric spatial patterns of T1 transitions promote directed cell migration, and form the backbone for coherent flow patterns at tissue scales.</description>
