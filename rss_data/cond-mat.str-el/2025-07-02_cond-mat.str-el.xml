      <title>Detection of 2D SPT phases under decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a bulk order parameter for extracting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) invariants of quantum many-body mixed states on a two dimensional lattice using partial symmetries. The procedure builds on the partial symmetry order parameter recently developed by some of the authors to study SPT phases of pure states and adapts them to the decohered setting. For a symmetry $G = E \times A$ where $E$ is a strong symmetry and $A$ is a weak symmetry, we show that the partial symmetry order parameter detects SPT invariants jointly protected by $E$ and $A$. We demonstrate this explicitly using a class of mixed states obtained from CZX-type models with $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and subjecting them to noise that weakens one of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries. We also comment on the practical detection of SPT invariants in quantum simulators through randomized measurements.</description>

      <title>Identifying Anyonic Topological Order in Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently observed fractional quantum anomalous Hall materials (FQAH) are candidates for topological quantum hardware, but their required anyon states are elusive. We point out dependence on monodromy in the fragile band topology in 2-cohomotopy. An algebro-topological theorem of Larmore &amp; Thomas (1980) then identifies FQAH anyons over momentum space. Admissible braiding phases are 2C-th roots of unity, for C the Chern number. This lays the foundation for understanding symmetry-protected topological order in FQAH systems, reducing the problem to computations in equivariant cohomotopy.</description>

      <title>Mixed valence Mott insulator and composite excitation in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interplay of strong correlation and flat topological band has been a central problem in moir\'e systems such as the magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). Recent studies show that Mott-like states may still be possible in TBG despite the Wannier obstruction. However, the nature of such unconventional states is still not well understood. In this work we construct the ground state wavefunction and exotic excitations of a symmetric correlated semimetal or insulator at even integer filling using a parton mean field theory of the topological heavy fermion model. We label the valence of the $f$ orbital based on its occupation $n_f$. At $\nu=-2$, we show that the $f$ orbital is not in the simple $f^{2+}$ valence expected from a trivial Mott localization. Instead, around $1/3$ of AA sites are self doped, with holes entering the $c$ orbitals away from AA sites. As a result, the $f$ orbital is in a superposition of $f^{2+}$ and $f^{3+}$ valences and should not be viewed as local moment. We dub the phase as \textit{mixed valence Mott insulator}. This unconventional insulator has a large hybridization $\langle c^\dagger f \rangle\neq 0$ and is sharply distinct from the usual `kondo breakdown' picture. In most of the momentum space away from the $\Gamma$ point, there is a Mott gap equal to the Hubbard $U$. At the $\Gamma$ point, we have a `charge transfer gap' much smaller than $U$. In particular, the top of the lower band is dominated by a composite excitation, which is a linear combination of $|f^{1+}\rangle\langle f^{2+}|$ and $|f^{2+}\rangle\langle f^{3+}|$ with a sign structure such that it is orthogonal to the microscopic $f$ operator. At $\nu=0$, similar approach leads to a Mott semimetal. We hope this work will inspire more explorations of the Anderson models with a large hybridization, a regime which may host new physics beyond the familiar Kondo or heavy fermion systems.</description>

      <title>Triplet nodal lines and Chern bands in XCuCl$_{3}$ (X= K, Tl)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the symmetry-enforced line nodes of the triplet excitations of XCuCl$_{3}$ (X= K, Tl), showing that they are protected by the nonsymmorphic symmetries and are unaffected by the microscopic details, such as interaction and anisotropy strength, as long as the ground state and the symmetry group remain unaltered. Extending the conventionally used isotropic spin model for XCuCl$_{3}$, our analysis includes all the symmetry-allowed anisotropies and gives a detailed account of the role they play in the band topology of triplets. We show that the triplet line nodes carry nontrivial Berry phases and compute their $Z_2$ topological indices. To investigate the effect of breaking the nonsymmorphic symmetry protecting the triplet nodes, we apply a magnetic field tilted away from the high symmetry $(010)$ axis. We find that while the g-tensor anisotropy behaves as a trivial mass gapping out the triplets, exchange anisotropies supply a nontrivial momentum-dependent mass term. Analogous to Haldane's original model, the competition of these mass terms determines the nature of the band topology in XCuCl$_{3}$. To enable an analytic study of the band topology we derive an effective Dirac Hamiltonian and validate it by computing the band structure and topological indices in the nodal line and gapped phases from the linear bond-wave formalism.</description>

      <title>Homotopy continuation method for solving Dyson equation fully self-consistently: theory and application to NdNiO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solution of the Dyson equation for the small-gap systems can be plagued by large non-converging iterations. In addition to the convergence issues, due to a high non-linearity, the Dyson equation may have multiple solutions. We apply the homotopy continuation approach to control the behavior of iterations. We used the homotopy continuation to locate multiple fully self-consistent GW solutions for NdNiO2 solid and to establish the corresponding Hartree-Fock limits. Some of the solutions found are qualitatively new and help to understand the nature of electron correlation in this material. We show that there are multiple low-energy charge-transfer solutions leading to a formation of charge-density waves. Our results qualitatively agree with the experimental conductivity measurements. To rationalize the structure of solutions, we compare the k-point occupations and generalize the concept of natural difference orbitals for correlated periodic solids.</description>

      <title>Complete Boundary Phase Diagram of the Spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ Chain with Boundary Fields in the Anti-Ferromagnetic Gapped Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the spin $\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain with diagonal boundary fields and solve it exactly using Bethe ansatz in the gapped anti-ferromagnetic regime and obtain the complete phase boundary diagram. Depending on the values of the boundary fields, the system exhibits several phases which can be categorized based on the ground state exhibited by the system and also based on the number of bound states localized at the boundaries. We show that the Hilbert space is comprised of a certain number of towers whose number depends on the number of boundary bound states exhibited by the system. The system undergoes boundary phase transitions when boundary fields are varied across certain critical values. There exist two types of phase transitions. In the first type the ground state of the system undergoes a change. In the second type, named the `Eigenstate phase transition', the number of towers of the Hilbert space changes, which is again associated with the change in the number of boundary bound states exhibited by the system. We use the DMRG and exact diagonalization techniques to probe the signature of the Eigenstate phase transition and the ground state phase transition by analyzing the spin profiles in each eigenstate.</description>

      <title>Effects of Antisite Defects on Seebeck Coefficient in Fe_2VAl -- Analyses based on Bipolar Random Anderson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A microscopic mechanism is proposed for a dramatic sign change of the Seebeck coefficient from positive to negative sign by the introduction of antisite defects in Fe$_2$VAl based on bipolar random Anderson model (BPRAM), which incorporates hybridization effects between randomly distributed antisites and host bands, where the valence and conduction bands are treated separately due to their separation in momentum space. Applying a self-consistent T-matrix approximation, we find that antisite defects in Fe$_2$VAl induce new states in the band overlap region, resulting in a scattering rate that is higher for hole carriers in the valence band than that for electron carriers in the conduction band, leading to negative Seebeck coefficient. This mechanism of sign change presents a potential new approach for controlling thermoelectric properties in semimetallic systems without changing carrier concentration.</description>

      <title>Versatile multi-q antiferromagnetic charge order in correlated vdW metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the discovery of graphene, interest in van der Waals (vdW) materials has surged; yet, advancing "beyond graphene" physics requires the development of quantum material platforms that host versatile many-body states. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at 300 mK, we uncover two competing states in vdW metal CeTe3: charge-ordered in-plane antiferromagnetic phases forming stripe and checkerboard patterns. Remarkably, the competition between them is tuned through a modest in-plane magnetic field (approximately 1.5 T), revealing significant cooperative phenomena between frustrated antiferromagnetism, charge order, and competing Fermi surface nesting. Underlying strongly intertwined many-body states are consistently signaled by density of states deformations exceeding plus/minus 30 meV scale across the Fermi level. Our findings provide a promising correlated vdW platform hosting versatile two-dimensional many-body physics, offering a fertile ground to explore topologically nontrivial multi-q charge-ordered antiferromagnetism, quantum criticality, unconventional superconductivity, and their potential interconnections.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emergence of altermagnetism in the single-orbital extended Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM), the recently discovered third class of collinear magnetic order, is characterized by non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin-split electronic structure with compensated zero net magnetization. It can arise from the conventional antiferromagnetism by introducing local anisotropy on the two opposite-spin sublattices, either through structural changes in local crystallographic symmetry or spontaneous emergence of local staggered orbital order from electron correlations in multi-orbital systems. Here, we demonstrate on the two-dimensional square lattice that a $d$-wave AM can emerge spontaneously in the single-orbital extended Hubbard model, without invoking the spin-orbital coupling and multi-orbital physics. We carry out mean-field studies on the concrete single-orbital $t$-$U$-$V$ model with $U$ and $V$ the onsite and nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, obtaining the ground states, analyzing their properties, and determining the phase diagram in the $U$-$V$ plane. The $d$-wave AM with novel spin-transport behavior is found to be stabilized in a wide region of the phase diagram when the system is doped away from half-filling, actualized by the coexistence of onsite antiferromagnetic order and complex $d$-wave nearest-neighbor spin bond orders. Our findings provide an alternative route to achieve AM and substantially expand the range of candidate AM materials.</description>

      <title>Suppression of shot noise at a Kondo destruction quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strange metal behavior has been observed in an expanding list of quantum materials, with heavy fermion metals serving as a prototype setting. Among the intriguing questions is the nature of charge carriers; there is an increasing recognition that the quasiparticles are lost, as captured by Kondo destruction quantum criticality. Among the recent experimental advances is the measurement of shot noise in a heavy-fermion strange metal. We are thus motivated to study current fluctuations by advancing a minimal Bose-Fermi Kondo lattice model, which admits a well-defined large-$N$ limit. Showing that the model in equilibrium captures the essential physics of Kondo destruction, we proceed to derive quantum kinetic equations and compute shot noise to the leading nontrivial order in $1/N$. Our results reveal a strong suppression of the shot noise at the Kondo destruction quantum critical point, thereby providing the understanding of the striking experiment. Broader implications of our results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Charge pumps, pivot Hamiltonians and symmetry-protected topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalised charge pumps are topological obstructions to trivialising loops in the space of symmetric gapped Hamiltonians. We show that given mild conditions on such pumps, the associated loop has high-symmetry points which must be in distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. To further elucidate the connection between pumps and SPTs, we focus on closed paths, `pivot loops', defined by two Hamiltonians, where the first is unitarily evolved by the second `pivot' Hamiltonian. While such pivot loops have been studied as entanglers for SPTs, here we explore their connection to pumps. We construct families of pivot loops which pump charge for various symmetry groups, often leading to SPT phases -- including dipole SPTs. Intriguingly, we find examples where non-trivial pumps do not lead to genuine SPTs but still entangle representation-SPTs (RSPTs). We use the anomaly associated to the non-trivial pump to explain the a priori `unnecessary' criticality between these RSPTs. We also find that particularly nice pivot families form circles in Hamiltonian space, which we show is equivalent to the Hamiltonians satisfying the Dolan-Grady relation -- known from the study of integrable models. This additional structure allows us to derive more powerful constraints on the phase diagram. Natural examples of such circular loops arise from pivoting with the Onsager-integrable chiral clock models, containing the aforementioned RSPT example. In fact, we show that these Onsager pivots underlie general group cohomology-based pumps in one spatial dimension. Finally, we recast the above in the language of equivariant families of Hamiltonians and relate the invariants of the pump to the candidate SPTs. We also highlight how certain SPTs arise in cases where the equivariant family is labelled by spaces that are not manifolds.</description>

      <title>Robustness of real-space topology in moir\'e systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The appearance of fractional Chern insulators in moir\'e systems can be rationalized by the presence of a fictitious magnetic field associated with the spatial texture of layer-resolved electronic wavefunctions. Here, we present a systematic study of real-space topology and the associated fictitious magnetic fields in moir\'e systems. We first show that at the level of individual Bloch wavefunctions, the real-space Chern number, akin to a Pontryagin index, is a fragile marker. It generically vanishes except for specific limits where the Bloch functions exhibit fine-tuned zeroes within the unit cell, such as the chiral limit of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) or the adiabatic regime of twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD). We then show that these limitations do not apply to textures associated with ensembles of Bloch wavefunctions, such as entire bands or the ensemble of states at a given energy. The Chern number of these textures defines a robust topological index protected by a spectral gap. We find that symmetries constrain it to be nonzero for both twisted TMDs and TBG across all twist angles and levels of corrugation, implying experimental signatures in scanning tunneling microscopy measurements. We also study real-space topology within the topological heavy fermion model of TBG, finding that the real-space topological features are supported only by the light c-electrons.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependent Resonant X-ray Inelastic Scattering at Ni L3-edge for NaNiO2 and LiNiO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiNiO2 is a promising cathode material for Li-ion battery but its atomic and electronic structure is under debate. Indeed, two sets of Ni-O distances are identified from local structural probes that are related with either Jahn-Teller distortion or bond disproportionation of NiO6 octahedra. Moreover, LiNiO2 undergoes a monoclinic to rhombohedral transition at 200 K which origin is still unclear. On the other hand, isostructural NaNiO2 shows differences from LiNiO2, as it is a well-known Jahn-Teller distorted system, and it undergoes monoclinic to rhombohedral transition at 500 K associated to the loss of the Jahn-Teller distortion. To understand better these differences, we report here Ni L3-edge Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering experiments on LiNiO2 and NaNiO2 at different temperatures (25 to 520 K) and follow the spectral changes below and above the phase transition temperatures. The observed RIXS spectra and the mapping indicate strong spectral changes for NaNiO2 confirming the disappearance of Jahn-Teller distortion during phase transition while the changes are minor for LiNiO2 suggesting very few modifications in the local structure. Theoretical simulations of RIXS spectra are required for further understanding, however, we believe that the reported dataset can be a crucial resource for developing advanced simulations that are essential to deepening our understanding of the atomic and electronic structure of these nickelates.</description>

      <title>Microscopic evidence for Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state and multiband effects in KFe$_2$As$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state is a superconducting phase characterized by broken translational-symmetry, where Cooper pairs form with non-zero momentum between Zeeman-split Fermi surfaces. This state is highly sensitive to band structure and pairing symmetry. In multiband superconductors, the FFLO state can significantly deviate from its standard form, but experimental verification has remained challenging. Here, we present $^{75}$As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on the multiband superconductor KFe$_2$As$_2$. In the low-temperature, high-magnetic-field region above the upper critical field $B_{c2}$, we observe a clear increase in the second moment of the NMR spectrum, along with a strong enhancement in the spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature 1/$T_1$$T$. These results indicate an emergence of superconducting spin smecticity and Andreev bound states from the spatially modulation of the superconducting gap, providing microscopic evidence for the FFLO state. The obtained phase diagram reveals a distinct boundary line between the FFLO and homogenous superconducting (HSC) states with a low critical temperature of the FFLO state $T^\ast \approx 0.2 T_c$, which can be attributed to the multiband effects in KFe$_2$As$_2$. Our results show that the iron-based superconductors are a good material platform for studying the FFLO state and highlight the importance of the multiband effects on this exotic phase.</description>

      <title>Running Quantum Computers in Discovery Mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose using quantum computers in conjunction with classical machine learning to discover instances of interesting quantum many-body dynamics. Concretely, an ``interest function'' is defined for a given circuit (family) instance that can be evaluated on a quantum computer. The circuit is then adapted by a classical learning agent to maximize interest. We illustrate this approach using two examples and show numerically that, within a sufficiently general circuit family, two simple interest functions based on (i) classifiability of evolved states and (ii) spectral properties of the unitary circuit, are maximized by discrete time crystals (DTCs) and dual-unitary circuits, respectively. For (i), we also simulate the adaptive optimization and show that it indeed finds DTCs with high probability. Our study suggests that learning agents with access to quantum-computing resources can discover new phenomena in many-body quantum dynamics, and establishes the design of good interest functions as a future research paradigm for quantum many-body physics.</description>

Abstract: Chirality is an inherent characteristics of some objects in nature. In magnetism chiral magnetic textures can be formed in systems with broken inversion symmetry and due to an antisymmetric magnetic interaction, known as Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (DMI). Here, aiming on a fundamental understanding of this chiral interaction on the atomic scale, we design several synthetic layered structures composed of alternating atomic layers of 3d ferromagnetic metals epitaxially grown on Ir(001). We demonstrate both experimentally and theoretically that the atomistic DMI depends critically not only on the orbital occupancy of the interface magnetic layer but also on the sequence of the atomic layers. The effect is attributed to the complexity of the electronic structure and the contribution of different orbitals to the hybridization and DMI. We anticipate that our results provide guidelines for controlling both the chirality and the magnitude of the atomistic DMI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To assess prior mean-field claims that the interacting Kane-Mele model hosts a novel $z-$antiferromagnetic (AFM) Chern insulating phase for a wide range of sub-lattice potentials, we analyze the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model in the presence of a sub-lattice potential using non-perturbative determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find instead that the true low-temperature state is a quantum spin Hall insulator for intermediate values of the sub-lattice potential $\lambda_v$ and large on-site repulsion. Two kinds of magnetic fluctuations are found to compete: $z$- and $xy$-AFM. The latter dominates at low temperature leading to a stabilization of the quantum spin Hall state as opposed to $z-$AFM Chern insulator. Our work is consistent with the robust quantum spin Hall effects which are consistently observed at even-integer fillings over a wide range of parameters in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ as well as AB stacked MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a fluctuation analysis of the pairing interaction in the hole-doped Hubbard model within the dynamical cluster approximation. Our analysis reveals that spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing differs qualitatively in the over- and underdoped regimes. In the underdoped regime, spin fluctuations open a pseudogap. We show that in this regime the spin-fermion coupling mediates a giant attraction between antinodal fermions. This explains why superconductivity survives at underdoping in the Hubbard model and cuprates, despite the lack of coherent fermionic quasiparticles in the pseudogap regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum Supercritical Regime with Universal Magnetocaloric Scaling in Ising Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum critical points (QCPs) ubiquitously emerge in strongly correlated systems, with their influence extending beyond zero temperature. There exist extended quantum critical regimes (QCRs) at finite temperatures and external fields. A paradigmatic example exhibiting QCP is quantum Ising magnets like \cno, where critical quantum fluctuations and robust universal scaling behavior provide crucial insights into the quantum material. In this work, we discover a fundamentally distinct quantum supercritical regime (QSR) emerging also from the QCP but controlled by symmetry-breaking fields ($h$) coupled to the order parameter. The QSR is enclosed by the crossover boundaries $T \propto h^{{z\nu}/\Delta}$, where $z$, $\nu$ and $\Delta\equiv\beta+\gamma$ are critical exponents. Amongst other intriguing phenomena, there exists an enhanced magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in QSR, characterized by a universally diverging magnetic Gr\"uneisen ratio $\Gamma_h \equiv \frac{1}{T} (\frac{\partial T}{\partial h})_{S} \propto T^{-\Delta/{z\nu}}$. Even small symmetry-breaking fields generate dramatic temperature variations. The supercritical scaling can be comprehended via thermal data collapse based on the derived scaling form. We propose to observe the QSR and related supercritical MCE in \cno~and other quantum Ising magnets, which may enable cryogenic technologies capable of reaching the millikelvin regime without relying on helium-3.</description>

      <title>Relaxation dynamics of a quantum spin coupled to a topological edge state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical impurity spin coupled to the spinful Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain is known to exhibit complex switching dynamics with incomplete spin relaxation. Here, we study the corrections that result from a full quantum treatment of the impurity spin. We find that in the topologically trivial case, the quantum spin behaves similarly to the classical one due to the absence of the Kondo effect for the trivial insulator. In the topological case, the quantum spin is significantly less likely to relax: It can be stuck at a pre-relaxation plateau with a sizable deviation from the expected relaxed value, and there is a large parameter regime where it does not relax at all but features an anomalously large Larmor frequency. Furthermore, we find an additional quantum effect where the pre-relaxation plateau can be hyperpolarized, i.e., the spin is stuck at a polarization value larger than the ground-state expectation value. This is possible due to the (incomplete) Kondo screening of the quantum spin, which is absent in the classical case. Our results are obtained via the ground state density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm and the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), where the charge-SU(2) symmetry of the problem was exploited. Furthermore, we introduce and benchmark a method to predict the dynamics from the given numerical data based on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). This allows us to prolong the simulation timescale by a factor of 2.5, up to a maximal time of $10^3$ inverse hoppings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement the recently developed influence functional matrix product states approach as impurity solver in equilibrium and nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) calculations of the single-band Hubbard model. The method yields numerically exact descriptions of metallic states without sharp spectral features, at a moderate numerical cost. Systems with narrow quasiparticle or spin-polaron peaks, as well as low-temperature Mott insulators provide more challenges, since these simulations require long time contours or high bond dimensions. A promising field of application is the DMFT simulation of nonequilibrium steady states, which we demonstrate with results for photo-doped Mott systems with long-lived doublon and holon populations.</description>

Abstract: The inelastic neutron scattering results and their analysis unequivocally point to a dominant Kitaev interaction in the honeycomb-lattice cobaltate BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. Our anisotropic-exchange model closely describes $all$ available neutron scattering data in the material's field-polarized phase. The density-matrix renormalization group results for our model are in close accord with the unusual double-zigzag magnetic order and the low in-plane saturation field of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$.</description>

      <title>Multiple Mechanisms for Emerging Conductance Plateaus in Fractional Quantum Hall States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05173v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-terminal conductance quantization in the context of quantum Hall (QH) physics is intimately related to the current carried by a discrete number of chiral edge modes. Upon pinching off a QH bar, one may engineer setups where some modes are fully transmitted (while the others are fully reflected), giving rise to the orthodox theory of quantized conductance plateaus. Here, we note that the observation of quantized plateaus \emph{does not} uniquely indicate the underlying mechanism. Our study demonstrates explicitly that (i) such plateaus may be the manifestations of entirely different mechanisms; (ii) conductance measurements alone will not suffice to distinguish one from the other. We further show that measurements of shot noise (auto- and cross-correlation) at the plateau may discriminate among different mechanisms. While our observations apply to a broad class of QH states, we demonstrate their applicability employing a prototypical example: the bulk state of filling factor $\nu=2/3$. We present distinctly different scenarios that lead to a conductance plateau $G_{2-\text{terminal}} = e^2/3h$ (observed previously), and likewise qualitatively different mechanisms leading to $e^2/2h$ (recently observed). We also predict the possibility of a new conductance plateau at $5e^2/9h$, following a non-orthodox scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) can be employed to understand a wide range of phenomena, from elementary particle scattering in high-energy physics to effective descriptions of many-body interactions in materials. Studying dynamical properties of emergent phases can be challenging as it requires solving many-body problems that are generally beyond perturbative limits. Here, we investigate the dynamics of local excitations in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT using a two-dimensional lattice of superconducting qubits. We first construct a simple variational circuit which prepares low-energy states that have a large overlap with the ground state; then we create charge excitations with local gates and simulate their quantum dynamics via a discretized time evolution. As the electric field coupling constant is increased, our measurements show signatures of transitioning from deconfined to confined dynamics. For confined excitations, the electric field induces a tension in the string connecting them. Our method allows us to experimentally image string dynamics in a (2+1)D LGT from which we uncover two distinct regimes inside the confining phase: for weak confinement the string fluctuates strongly in the transverse direction, while for strong confinement transverse fluctuations are effectively frozen. In addition, we demonstrate a resonance condition at which dynamical string breaking is facilitated. Our LGT implementation on a quantum processor presents a novel set of techniques for investigating emergent excitations and string dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generating logical magic states with the aid of non-Abelian topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computing with the surface code, non-Clifford gates are crucial for universal computation. However, implementing these gates using methods like magic state distillation and code switching requires significant resources. In this work, we propose a new protocol that combines magic state preparation and code transformation to realize logical non-Clifford operations with the potential for fault tolerance. Our approach begins with a special logical state in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ surface code. By applying a sequence of transformations, the system goes through different topological codes, including the non-Abelian $D_4$ quantum double model. This process ultimately produces a magic state encoded in the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ surface code. A logical $T$ gate can be implemented in the standard $\mathbb{Z}_2$ surface code by gate teleportation. In our analysis, we employ a framework where the topological codes are represented by their topological orders and all the transformations are considered as topological manipulations such as gauging symmetries and condensing anyons. This perspective is particularly useful for understanding transformations between topological codes.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a framework called spacetime concatenation for fault-tolerant compilation of syndrome extraction circuits of stabilizer codes. Spacetime concatenation enables efficient compilation of syndrome extraction circuits into dynamical codes through structured gadget layouts and encoding matrices, facilitating low-weight measurements while preserving logical information. Our framework uses conditions that are sufficient for fault-tolerance of the dynamical code, including not measuring logical operators and preserving the spacetime distance. We construct explicit examples of dynamical codes using this framework, including the dynamical bivariate bicycle code and a dynamical Haah code, while illustrating their fault-tolerant properties. Furthermore, we analyze the classification and resource trade-offs of dynamical codes, demonstrating their adaptability to hardware constraints, including fabrication defects and qubit dropout scenarios.</description>
