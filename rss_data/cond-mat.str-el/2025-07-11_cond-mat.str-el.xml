      <title>Triplet Exciton-driven Topological Mott insulator at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by experiments in which the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) charge gap greatly exceeds the Curie temperature, we apply determinantal quantum Monte Carlo to two complementary lattice models with different geometries: the checkerboard quantum-spin-Hall-Hubbard model and the generalized Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. In both cases an incompressible QAH phase with total Chern number $C=\pm 1$ emerges at quarter filling well above the Curie temperature. Each spin channel carries its own nonquantized Chern number while remaining only partly filled, revealing a topological Mott insulator where Mottness opens the charge gap before magnetic order appears. Charge excitations bind triplet excitons that suppress net magnetization, a many-body dynamical effect absent in mean-field theory. The concurrence of these results on two very different models shows that coupling Mottness with band topology generically yields a high-temperature QAH insulator whose charge excitations are dressed by triplet excitons.</description>

      <title>Antisymmetric Raman response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of antisymmetric Raman response, defined as the difference between the Raman signals of two scattering geometries related by an exchange of mutually perpendicular incoming and the outgoing photon polarizations. Such responses, finite in orthorhombic or lower symmetry systems, are related to cross-susceptibilities of two Raman operators and are characterized by the absence of intraband terms. This is in contrast to standard Raman responses which measure auto-susceptibilities where both intra- and interband processes contribute. We illustrate the theory with examples from the charge density wave rare-earth tritellurides and the excitonic insulator Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$. Our theory establishes antisymmetric Raman response as a unique tool to probe microscopic features such as interband energy scales and to detect reflection symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Anomaly diagnosis via symmetry restriction in two-dimensional lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a method for computing the anomaly of any finite unitary symmetry group $G$ acting by finite-depth quantum circuits on a two-dimensional lattice system. The anomaly is characterized by an index valued in the cohomology group $H^4(G,U(1))$, which generalizes the Else-Nayak index for locality preserving symmetries of quantum spin chains. We show that a nontrivial index precludes the existence of a trivially gapped symmetric Hamiltonian; it is also an obstruction to ``onsiteability" of the symmetry action. We illustrate our method via a simple example with $G=\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$. Finally, we provide a diagrammatic interpretation of the anomaly formula which hints at a higher categorical structure.</description>

      <title>Topological electronic structures of non-collinear magnetic phases in a multi-orbital Hubbard model with spin-orbit interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore topological electronic structure of magnetic phases in a multi-orbital Hubbard model with spin-orbit interactions. To account for more general antiferromagnetic orders that go beyond the collinear N\'eel order, two different spin-orbit interactions, Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit interactions, are considered. By performing the canonical transformation, we derive the corresponding generalized t-J model. At half filling, employing self-consistent magnetic order calculations, we find distinctive spin arrangements under Dresselhaus or Rashba spin-orbit interactions. For the Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction, the spin configuration exhibits collinear antiferromagnetic order. On the other hand, Rashba interaction results in spins antiferromagnetically aligning in xy-plane and a small interaction controlled by hopping parameter induces spin tilting, causing antiferromagnetic alignment in xy-plane but ferromagnetic alignment in z-direction. We categorize topological properties of these phases for low doping in the generalized t-J model.: for 3D collinear antiferromagnetic order, the system possesses a modified time-reversal symmetry, characterized by the Z2 index. In contrast, for systems with tilted antiferromagnetic orders, it is protected by inversion symmetry and characterized by the Z4 index. We further examine the bulk-edge correspondence for non-collinear magnetic phases, revealing that the surface state becomes gapless when the surface is parallel to the ferromagnetic component of tilted antiferromagnetic order; otherwise, the surface state exhibits a gap. Our findings offer a comprehensive topological characterization for doped and canted antiferromagnetic insulators with spin-orbit interactions, providing valuable insights into the interplay between spin arrangements, symmetries, and topological properties in systems governed by the multi-orbital Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the conventional spin-wave dynamics and its double-constraint modification in the spin-$\mathbf{\frac{1}{2}}$ triangular-prism Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous magnon decays in an $S=\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the equilateral triangular prism are investigated in terms of modified magnon Green's functions. In one dimension, the so-called infrared divergence prevents us from calculating any -- whether static or dynamic -- structure factor within the conventional spin-wave theory even at zero temperature. The well-known modified spin-wave theory initiated by Takahashi completely fails to treat anharmonicities to cause transverse-to-longitudinal coupling which are quite characteristic of noncollinear antiferromagnets. We propose imposing a double-constraint condition on spin waves to solve all these difficulties and get a full view of the nonlinear spin-wave dynamics in one-dimensional frustrated noncollinear antiferromagnets. We reveal a novel instability of the single-particle spectrum in the absence of any well-defined magnetically ordered ground state.</description>

      <title>Pseudogap in a crystalline insulator doped by disordered metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key to understand how electrons behave in crystalline solids is the band structure that connects the energy of electron waves to their wavenumber (k). Even in the phase of matter with only short-range order (liquid or amorphous solid), the coherent part of electron waves still possesses a band structure. Theoretical models for the band structure of liquid metals were formulated more than 5 decades ago, but thus far, bandstructure renormalization and pseudogap induced by resonance scattering have remained unobserved. Here, we report the observation of this unusual band structure at the interface of a crystalline insulator (black phosphorus) and disordered dopants (alkali metals). We find that a conventional parabolic band structure of free electrons bends back towards zero k with the pseudogap of 30-240 meV from the Fermi level. This is k renormalization caused by resonance scattering that leads to the formation of quasi-bound states in the scattering potential of alkali-metal ions. The depth of this potential tuned by different kinds of alkali metal (Na, K, Rb, and Cs) allows to classify the pseudogap of p-wave and d-wave resonance. Our results may provide a clue to the puzzling spectrum of various crystalline insulators doped by disordered dopants, such as the waterfall dispersion in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Electronic rotons and Wigner crystallites in a two-dimensional dipole liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key concept proposed by Landau to explain superfluid liquid helium is the elementary excitation of quantum particles called rotons. The irregular arrangement of atoms in a liquid forms the aperiodic dispersion of rotons that played a pivotal role in understanding fractional quantum Hall liquid (magneto-rotons) and the supersolidity of Bose-Einstein condensates. Even for a two-dimensional electron or dipole liquid in the absence of a magnetic field, their repulsive interactions were predicted to form a roton minimum that can be used to trace the transition to Wigner crystals and superconductivity, but it has not been observed. Here, we report the observation of such electronic rotons in a two-dimensional dipole liquid of alkali-metal ions doping charges to surface layers of black phosphorus. Our data reveal a striking aperiodic dispersion of rotons characterized by a local minimum of energy at a finite momentum. As the density of dipoles decreases, where interactions dominate over kinetic energy, the roton gap reduces to 0 as in crystals, signalling Wigner crystallisation. Our model shows the importance of short-range order arising from repulsion between dipoles, which can be viewed as the formation of Wigner crystallites (bubbles or stripes) floating in the sea of Fermi liquids. Our results reveal that the primary origin of electronic rotons (and the pseudogap) is strong correlations.</description>

      <title>Evolution from intralayer to interlayer superconductivity in a bilayer $t$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the bilayer cuprate superconductors and nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we investigate the evolution from intralayer to interlayer superconductivity based on a bilayer two-leg $t$-$J$-$J_{\bot}$ model, where $t$ is the in-plane electron hopping, $J$ is the in-plane spin interaction, and $J_{\bot}$ is the inter-plane spin interaction. By means of the density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the system by tuning $J_{\bot}$ in a large doping range $\delta = 1/8 - 1/2$. We find that a large $J_{\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range, appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $\delta = 1/4$. By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\bot}$, as reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\bot}$ regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable, the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\rm SC} \sim 1$. At last, we show that the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\bot}$ interaction, from both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.</description>

      <title>Emergent QED$_3$ at the bosonic Laughlin state to superfluid transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions between topologically ordered and symmetry-broken phases lie beyond Landau theory. A prime example is the conjectured continuous transition from the bosonic $\nu = 1/2$ Laughlin state to a superfluid, proposed to be governed by a QED$_3$--Chern--Simons (CS) critical point whose stability remains uncertain. We study half-filled bosons in the lowest Landau level subject to a lattice potential. Infinite-cylinder DMRG reveals a single continuous Laughlin--to--superfluid transition. Adiabatic flux insertion collapses the many-body gap and exposes massless Dirac quasiparticles, while momentum-resolved correlation lengths show that three lattice-related density modes share the same critical exponent, evidencing an emergent $SO(3)$ symmetry. The joint appearance of Dirac dispersion and symmetry enlargement provides microscopic support for a stable QED$_3$--CS fixed point. Our numerical strategy also offers a blueprint for exploring Landau-forbidden transitions in fractional Chern insulators and composite Fermi liquids realised in moire and cold-atom systems.</description>

      <title>Resilient cluster Mott states in layered Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ against pressure-induced symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, by combining density-functional theory (DFT) with dynamical mean-field calculations (DMFT), we compare the crystal and electronic structures of the prototype cluster Mott insulator Nb$_{3}$Cl$_8$ at ambient and high-pressure. We explain the finite but significantly reduced charge gap experimentally observed at $P=9.7$ GPa. We reveal a local symmetry breaking of the Nb$_{3}$ trimer under pressure, reducing its symmetry from $C_{3v}$ to $C_{s}$. This leads to a strong bandwidth enhancement and a lift of band degeneracy. Crucially, despite the significant change of band details, the cluster Mott insulating state is robust against local symmetry breaking. We show that the experimental observed gap under pressure is still a cluster Mott gap and its reduced value stems from both increased bandwidth and reduced Coulomb interactions under pressure. Our study provides the first systematic theoretical elucidation of how pressure-induced symmetry breaking dictates the cluster Mott state, establishing a robust foundation for understanding the intricate relationship between symmetry, local/non-local correlations, and emergent quantum states in correlated cluster compounds.</description>

      <title>Summing Real Time Feynman Paths of Lattice Polaron with Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study numerically the real time dynamics of lattice polarons by combining the Feynman path integral and the matrix product state (MPS) approach. By constructing and solving a flow equation, we show that the integrand, viewed as a multivariable function of polaron world line parameters, can be compressed as a low bond dimension MPS, thereby allowing for efficient evaluation of various dynamical observables. We establish the effectiveness of our method by benchmarking the calculated polaron spectral function in one dimension against available results. We further demonstrate its potential by presenting the polaron spectral function in two dimensions and simulating polaron diffusion in both one and two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Pressure induced ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition in transition metal chalcogenide Cr$_{3}$Te$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have carried out a detailed high-pressure investigation on the strongly correlated transition metal chalcogenide $Cr_{3}Te_4$ using Raman spectroscopy and XRD, which is ferromagnetic and metallic at ambient conditions. We find that the monoclinic structure remains stable up to 30 GPa, the highest pressure studied. The Cr-Te bond length and octahedral volume decrease drastically up to 7.6 GPa pressure. The $A_{1g}$ Raman mode shows a red shift up to 7.6 GPa, and the $E_g$ Raman mode shows a sudden drop around the same pressure. Further low-temperature Raman spectroscopic investigation shows that the Raman modes soften at the ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition. This suggests a change in the magnetic ordering at high pressure. Our Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations reveal the change in magnetic ground state from ferromagnetic state to antiferromagnetic state above 7.6 GPa pressure, corroborating our experimental result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general framework based on the functional derivative to extract nonlinear dynamical response functions from the temporal evolution of physical quantities, without explicitly computing multipoint correlation functions. We validate our approach by calculating the second- and third-order optical responses in the Rice-Mele model and further apply it to a many-body interacting system using a tensor network method. This framework is broadly applicable to any method that can compute real-time dynamics, offering a powerful and versatile tool for investigating nonlinear responses in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Shaping Magnetic Order by Local Frustration for Itinerant Fermions on a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic magnetism is an iconic and rare example of collective quantum order that emerges from the interference of paths taken by a hole in a sea of strongly interacting fermions. Here the lattice topology plays a fundamental role, with odd loops frustrating ferromagnetism, as seen in recent experiments. However, the resulting magnetic order on a general graph has remained elusive. Here we systematically establish, using exact diagonalization, that local frustration centers on a grid strongly bind singlets while sharing a delocalized hole. This collective effect generalizes to random graphs, producing sharp and predictable variation with tunable frustration measures. Our findings demonstrate that one can shape the spin order as well as tune the net magnetization by embedding geometric frustration, opening up new avenues for spatially resolved quantum control of many-body systems. We outline a protocol to realize some of the key findings in existing cold-atom setups.</description>

      <title>Chiral superconductivity near a fractional Chern insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity arising from fully spin-polarized, repulsively interacting electrons can host intrinsically chiral Cooper pairs and Majorana zero modes, yet no concrete microscopic route to such a state has been established. Motivated by recent observations in twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene, where fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) appear adjacent to spin-valley-polarized superconductors, we investigate a minimal model: spinless electrons in the lowest Landau level subject to a tunable moire potential. Large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations show that, as the FCI gap closes, two nearly degenerate phases emerge before a metallic state forms. A chiral $f+if$ superconductor and a commensurate $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ charge-density wave (CDW) differ in energy by less than $1\%$, reproducing the distinct superconducting and re-entrant integer quantum Hall (RIQH) phases experimentally observed near the FCI regime. The superconducting dome remains robust against realistic Coulomb screening, light doping, and variations in lattice geometry. Melting the FCI therefore provides a new mechanism for realizing spin-polarized chiral superconductivity and RIQH order. We predict that twisted MoTe$_2$ at larger twist angles will develop a superconducting dome even at filling $\nu = 2/3$, and suppressing this superconductivity with a magnetic field should drive the system into an RIQH state.</description>

      <title>Majorana edge reconstruction and the $\nu=5/2$ non-Abelian thermal Hall puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pioneering thermal transport measurements on two-dimensional electron gases in high magnetic fields have demonstrated that the quantized Hall state at filling factor $\nu=5/2$ has a thermal Hall conductance $\kappa$ quantized in half-integer multiples of $\kappa_0 = {\pi^2 k_B^2 T}/{3h}$. Half-integer $\kappa/\kappa_0$ is a signature of neutral Majorana edge modes, in turn linked to the presence of non-Abelian anyon excitations in the bulk. However, the experimentally observed value of $\kappa$ corresponds to the 'PH-Pfaffian' state, in tension with numerical studies which instead favor either the Pfaffian or the AntiPfaffian. A variety of mechanisms have been invoked to explain this discrepancy, but have been either ruled out by further experiments or else involve fine-tuning. Building on density-matrix-renormalization group studies of physically realistic edges and analytic calculations of edge structure, we propose an alternative resolution of this puzzle involving an 'edge reconstruction' solely involving the neutral Majorana sector of the theory. Such a Majorana edge reconstruction can "screen'' a Pfaffian or AntiPfaffian bulk, so that transport signatures become indistinguishable from those of the PH-Pfaffian. We argue that this physically natural scenario is consistent with experiment.</description>

      <title>Magic phase transitions in monitored gaussian fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitored quantum systems, where unitary dynamics compete with continuous measurements, exhibit dynamical transitions as the measurement rate is varied. These reflect abrupt changes in the structure of the evolving wavefunction, captured by complementary complexity diagnostics that include and go beyond entanglement aspects. Here, we investigate how monitoring affects magic state resources, the nonstabilizerness, of Gaussian fermionic systems. Using scalable Majorana sampling techniques, we track the evolution of stabilizer R\'enyi entropies in large systems under projective measurements. While the leading extensive (volume-law) scaling of magic remains robust across all measurement rates, we uncover a sharp transition in the subleading logarithmic corrections. This measurement-induced complexity transition, invisible to standard entanglement probes, highlights the power of magic-based diagnostics in revealing hidden features of monitored many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Lindbladian versus Postselected Non-Hermitian Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent topological classification of non-Hermitian `Hamiltonians' is usually interpreted in terms of pure quantum states that decay or grow with time. However, many-body systems with loss and gain are typically better described by mixed-state open quantum dynamics, which only correspond to pure-state non-Hermitian dynamics upon a postselection of measurement outcomes. Since postselection becomes exponentially costly with particle number, we here investigate to what extent the most important example of non-Hermitian topology can survive without it: the non-Hermitian skin effect and its relationship to a bulk winding number in one spatial dimension. After defining the winding number of the Lindbladian superoperator for a quadratic fermion system, we systematically relate it to the winding number of the associated postselected non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We prove that the two winding numbers are equal (opposite) in the absence of gain (loss), and provide a physical explanation for this relationship. When both loss and gain are present, the Lindbladian winding number typically remains quantized and non-zero, though it can change sign at a phase transition separating the loss and gain-dominated regimes. This transition, which leads to a reversal of the Lindbladian skin effect localization, is rendered invisible by postselection. We also identify a case where removing postselection induces a skin effect from otherwise topologically trivial non-Hermitian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model: A Strongly Correlated System Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model delivers an analytically tractable framework for exotic strongly correlated phases where conventional paradigms like Landau's Fermi liquid theory collapse. This review offers a pedagogical introduction to the SYK physics, highlighting its unique capacity to model \textit{strange metals} -- systems exhibiting linear-in-temperature resistivity, Planckian dissipation, and quasiparticle breakdown. We systematically construct both Majorana and complex fermion variants, transforming them into training grounds for modern many-body physics techniques, for instance, (1) large-$N$ formulations via disorder averaging and replica symmetry, (2) Schwinger-Dyson and Kadanoff-Baym equations, (3) imaginary time Matsubara formulation, (4) real-time dynamics via Keldysh formalism, and the associated (5) non-perturbative Keldysh contour deformations. These tools lay the foundation for equilibrium thermodynamics, quantum chaos, quench dynamics, and transport in the thermodynamic limit -- all within a solvable, chaotic quantum system. Designed as a self-contained resource, the review bridges advanced technical machinery to physical insights, with computational implementations provided. Though principally treating the SYK model as a condensed matter laboratory, we also highlight its profound connection to quantum gravity -- woven throughout this work -- underscoring how this solvable chaotic fermionic model serves as a lens onto black hole thermodynamics and holographic duality.</description>

      <title>Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation for energy eigenstates of SU(2)-symmetric quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) is a fundamental result in statistical mechanics. It stipulates that, if perturbed out of equilibrium, a system responds at a rate proportional to a thermal-equilibrium property. Applications range from particle diffusion to electrical-circuit noise. To prove the FDT, one must prove that common thermal states obey a symmetry property, the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) relation. Energy eigenstates of certain quantum many-body systems were recently proved to obey the KMS relation. The proof relies on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which explains how such systems thermalize internally. This KMS relation contains a finite-size correction that scales as the inverse system size. Non-Abelian symmetries conflict with the ETH, so a non-Abelian ETH was proposed recently. Using it, we derive a KMS relation for SU(2)-symmetric quantum many-body systems' energy eigenstates. The finite-size correction scales as usual under certain circumstances but can be polynomially larger in others, we argue. We support the ordinary-scaling result numerically, simulating a Heisenberg chain of 16-24 qubits. The numerics, limited by computational capacity, indirectly support the larger correction. This work helps extend into nonequilibrium physics the effort, recently of interest across quantum physics, to identify how non-Abelian symmetries may alter conventional thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Origin of insulating-like behavior of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ under pressure: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental study on Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ superconductors has revealed an unexpected quantum phase transition from superconducting state to insulatinglike state under pressure [Zhou et al., Nat. Phys. 18, 406 (2022)]. To better understand the physical origin of this pressure-induced phenomenon, here we have studied the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of undoped and O-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi2212) under pressures based on density-functional theory calculations. We first identified the crystal structure of undoped Bi2212 with the armchair distortions in the BiO layers and reproduced the insulating feature of the parent compound. Then we added an extra O atom to the parent compound to simulate the hole-doping effect and found that the structure with O dopant located in the van der Waals (vdW) gap is energetically the most stable. Further calculations on O-doped (0.125 holes/Cu) Bi2212 revealed that the pressure can induce charge redistributions between CuO$_2$ planes and BiO layers; specifically, Cu-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals gain electrons and Cu atoms rather than O atoms dominate around the Fermi level under high pressure. Along with the increasing pressure, the density of states at the Fermi level first reaches the maximum at $\sim$ 10 GPa and then shows a valley near the Fermi level above 20 GPa, which may be responsible for the insulatinglike state observed in recent experiments. We suggest that the competition among several factors, such as the increase of electrons in the CuO$_2$ plane, the variation of in-plane hopping due to the shortened Cu-O distance, and the enhanced Coulomb repulsion among the Cu-3$d$ electrons, could lead to the exotic transition under pressure. Our work provides an explanation of the high-pressure behaviors of Bi2212, which may facilitate a comprehensive understanding of cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Observation of superconductivity-induced leading-edge gap in Sr-doped $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized bulk $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ has ignited significant interest in nickelate superconductors. Unlike cuprates, where superconductivity predominantly originates from the $\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, nickelates exhibit additional complexities involving contributions from the $\mathrm{3}d_{z^2}$ orbital, prompting fundamental questions about their pairing mechanisms. Despite recent progress in stabilizing superconductivity in $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films at ambient pressure, direct spectroscopic evidence of the superconducting gap opening remains elusive. Here, we present an in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of Sr-doped superconducting $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films. Fermi surface mapping reveals Ni-$\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$-derived $\alpha$ and $\beta$ pockets, with orbital fillings of 0.11$\pm$0.02 electrons and 0.66$\pm$0.03 holes per Ni, respectively, resulting in a total of 0.45$\pm$0.04 electrons for each Ni. These bands exhibit moderate electron correlations, characterized by a band renormalization factor of 3-4. Notably, both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ bands exhibit leading-edge shifts across the superconducting transition, with gap magnitude of ~1-2 meV at Fermi momenta along the Brillouin zone diagonal and slightly away from the zone diagonal, deviating from the conventional $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap structure. Additionally, the Ni-$\mathrm{3}d_{z^2}$-derived $\gamma$ band lies ~75 meV below the Fermi level, indicating a $\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$-dominated fermiology in this compound.</description>

      <title>Large unconventional anomalous Hall effect far above room temperature in epitaxial Fe$_3$Ga$_4$ films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noncoplanar spin textures usually exhibit a finite scalar spin chirality (SSC) that can generate effective magnetic fields and lead to additional contributions to the Hall effect, namely topological or unconventional anomalous Hall effect (UAHE). Unlike topological spin textures (e.g., magnetic skyrmions), materials that exhibit fluctuation-driven SSC and UAHE are rare. So far, their realization has been limited to either low temperatures or high magnetic fields, both of which are unfavorable for practical applications. Identifying new materials that exhibit UAHE in a low magnetic field at room temperature is therefore essential. Here, we report the discovery of a large UAHE far above room temperature in epitaxial Fe$_3$Ga$_4$ films, where the fluctuation-driven SSC stems from the field-induced transverse-conical-spiral phase. Considering their epitaxial nature and the large UAHE stabilized at room temperature in a low magnetic field, Fe$_3$Ga$_4$ films represent an exciting, albeit rare, case of a promising candidate material for spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Dark states of electrons in a quantum system with two pairs of sublattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum state of matter that is forbidden to interact with photons and is therefore undetectable by spectroscopic means is called a dark state. This basic concept can be applied to condensed matter where it suggests that a whole band of quantum states could be undetectable across a full Brillouin zone. Here we report the discovery of such condensed matter dark states in palladium diselenide as a model system that has two pairs of sublattices in the primitive cell. By using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we find valence bands that are practically unobservable over the whole Brillouin zone at any photon energy, polarisation, and scattering plane. Our model shows that two pairs of sublattices located at half-translation positions and related by multiple glide-mirror symmetries make their relative quantum phases polarised into only four kinds, three of which become dark due to double destructive interference. This mechanism is generic to other systems with two pairs of sublattices, and we show how the phenomena observed in cuprates, lead-halide perovskites, and density wave systems can be resolved by the mechanism of dark states. Our results suggest that the sublattice degree of freedom, which has been overlooked so far, should be considered in the study of correlated phenomena and optoelectronic characteristics.</description>

      <title>NNQS-AFQMC: Neural network quantum states enhanced fermionic quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient approach to implement neural network quantum states (NNQS) as trial wavefunctions in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). NNQS are a recently developed class of variational ans\"atze capable of flexibly representing many-body wavefunctions, though they often incur a high computational cost during optimization. AFQMC, on the other hand, is a powerful stochastic projector approach for ground-state calculations, but it normally requires an approximate constraint via a trial wavefunction or trial density matrix, whose quality affects the accuracy. Recent progress has shown that a broad class of highly correlated wavefunctions can be integrated into AFQMC through stochastic sampling techniques. In this work, we present a direct integration of NNQS with AFQMC, allowing NNQS to serve as high-quality trial wavefunctions for AFQMC with manageable computational cost. We test the NNQS-AFQMC method on the challenging nitrogen molecule (N$_2$) at stretched geometries. Our results demonstrate that AFQMC with an NNQS trial wavefunction can attain near-exact total energies, highlighting the potential of AFQMC with NNQS to overcome longstanding challenges in strongly correlated electronic structure calculations. We also outline future research directions for improving this promising methodology.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of bond bipolaron superconductivity in triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the diagrammatic Monte Carlo method with a lattice path-integral formulation for both electron and phonon degrees of freedom to investigate the formation and properties of bond polarons and bipolarons on a two-dimensional triangular lattice. In the adiabatic regime ($\omega/t &lt; 1.0$), single polarons remain light with a small effective mass, while bipolarons remain compact and lightweight, resulting in a high superfluid transition temperature $T_c$. We systematically study the dependence of $T_c$ on electron-phonon coupling strength and on-site interaction in the bond bipolaron model. Our results show that a moderate on-site repulsion enhances $T_c$ by stabilizing compact yet lightweight bipolarons, leading to high-$T_c$ superconductivity in the dilute limit. Notably, the triangular lattice sustains relatively high $T_c$ across a wide range of phonon frequencies, outperforming square lattice geometry. This enhancement arises from the higher coordination number and the bond-centered nature of the electron-phonon coupling. These findings suggest that triangular lattice geometry offers a promising platform for realizing high-$T_c$ bipolaronic superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the relationship between electric polarization modulation $\Delta P$ in ferroelectrics induced by a low-frequency pulsed electric field and the corresponding second harmonic intensity modulation $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$. Using nonlinear response theory, we derive their time-domain expressions linear in the pulse amplitude, revealing that not only the electric field but also its time derivative contributes to $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$. Furthermore, even when the time-derivative component is negligible, $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can be in antiphase with the pulsed field and thus with $\Delta P$. These theoretical predictions are further supported by real-time simulations of a model for electronic ferroelectrics. Our results demonstrate that the commonly assumed relation $\Delta P \propto \Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can break down under certain conditions, reflecting the complex-valued and frequency-dependent nature of nonlinear dynamical susceptibilities.</description>

      <title>Temporal and spatial separations between spin glass and short-range order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broken-symmetry-induced order parameters account for many phenomena in condensed matter physics. For spin glasses, such a framework dictates its theoretical construction, whereas experiments have only established dynamical behaviors such as frequency dependent magnetic susceptibility and aging but not the thermodynamic phase. Experimental techniques have limitations when the spin glass is probed as an isolated state. To resolve this conundrum, we create an evolution from long-range order using a well-controlled tuning of the disorder on a spinel's sublattice. Cross-referencing a series of specimens at both long (milliseconds to seconds) and short (picosecond) time scales illustrates the relationship between spin glass and long- and short-range orders. The dynamics of short- and long-range order formations are not affected by disorder, as revealed by neutron magnetic diffuse scattering, however the ranges of these orderings are changed by the introduced disorder. Across all specimens, the inflection point of the correlation length's temperature dependence fully matches with the peak in heat capacity, while spin glass can freeze either below or well above this characteristic temperature of spin order formation. Our results identify an uncorrelated coexistence of the two and attribute components of the spin glass to individual spins at domain walls between spin clusters.</description>

      <title>Coulomb interactions in systems of generalized semi-Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactions have strong effects in systems with flat bands. We examine the role of Coulomb interactions in two dimensional chiral anisotropic quasiparticles that disperse linearly in one direction and have relatively flat bands near the neutrality point in the other direction, dispersing with an arbitrary positive even power law $2n\geq2$. As in the conventional semi-Dirac case $(n=1$), we show using renormalization group that strong logarithmic divergences in the self-energy of generalized semi-Dirac fermions resum and lead to a restoration of linearity in the spectrum for arbitrary $n$ over a sizable energy window in the perturbative regime. We discuss those results in light of previous non-perturbative large $N_{f}$ results and address the implications for physical observables.</description>

      <title>Towards Excitations and Dynamical Quantities in Correlated Lattices with Density Matrix Embedding Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density matrix embedding theory (DMET) provides a framework to describe ground-state expectation values in strongly correlated systems, but its extension to dynamical quantities is still an open problem. We show one route to obtaining excitations and dynamical spectral functions by using the techniques of DMET to approximate the matrix elements that arise in a single-mode inspired excitation ansatz. We demonstrate this approach in the 1D Hubbard model, comparing the neutral excitations, single-particle density of states, charge, and spin dynamical structure factors to benchmarks from the Bethe ansatz and density matrix renormalization group. Our work highlights the potential of these ideas in building computationally efficient approaches for dynamical quantities.</description>

      <title>Slow magnetic quantum oscillations in the c-axis magnetoresistance of UTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Details of the electronic band structure in unconventional superconductors are key to the understanding of their fundamental ground state. The potential spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$, with $T_\mathrm{c}\approx 2.1\,$K, has attracted attention recently. Its main Fermi surface consists of weakly corrugated, two-dimensional Fermi-surface cylinders that run along the crystallographic $c$ axis. In addition, there is evidence for the presence of an additional small three-dimensional band. This has been discussed controversially as it may be essential for the realization of superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Here, we investigate the angle-resolved magnetoresistance and Hall effect in bulk crystalline samples with current along the $c$ axis in fields up to $60\,$T. We observe low-frequency magnetic quantum oscillations with light effective masses that are most pronounced for magnetic field applied along the $a$ axis. Two distinct frequencies indicate two separate changes in the Fermi-surface topology, likely connected with Lifshitz transitions. We discuss the origin of these oscillations in terms of magnetic breakdown, quantum interference, and other potential mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Finding local integrals of motion in quantum lattice models in the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local integrals of motion (LIOMs) play a key role in understanding the long-time properties of closed macroscopic systems. They were found for selected integrable systems via complex analytical calculations. The existence of LIOMs and their structure can also be studied via numerical methods, which, however, involve exact diagonalization of Hamiltonians, posing a bottleneck for such studies. We show that finding LIOMs in translationally invariant lattice models or unitary quantum circuits can be reduced to a problem for which one may numerically find an exact solution in the thermodynamic limit. We develop a simple algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency by calculating LIOMs and bounds on correlations (the Mazur bounds) for infinite integrable spin chains and unitary circuits. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach identifies slow modes in nearly integrable spin models and estimates their relaxation times.</description>

      <title>Combine effect of site dilution and long-range interaction on magnetic and transport properties in the half-filled Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetotransport properties of a diluted half-filled one-band Hubbard model with second-nearest-neighbor hopping on a simple cubic lattice, aiming to explore the possibility of metallicity in diluted antiferromagnetic systems. Our semiclassical Monte Carlo calculations reveal an antiferromagnetic metallic regime in diluted correlated materials. This unexpected metallic regime naturally leads to a central question: how does the introduction of dilution into an antiferromagnetic material, especially with long-range magnetic interactions, induce metallicity -- a feature not commonly associated with antiferromagnets? To address this question, we demonstrate that when the on-site repulsive Hubbard interaction strength is set to zero on a percentage of the sites (site dilution), the insulating state weakens due to percolative conduction among the diluted sites at low temperatures. Remarkably, this occurs without any significant alteration to the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic ordering in the system, thereby providing a pathway to realize antiferromagnetic metals. In addition, we show how the sublattice-dependent hopping can be exploited to engineer spin-polarized half-metallic antiferromagnets. Overall, our numerical results collectively provide a basis for understanding the combined effect of site dilution and competing interactions, which will assist in the design of new antiferromagnetic metals for future spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Solving the Hubbard model with Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of neural quantum states (NQS) has established it as a promising framework for studying quantum many-body systems. In this work, by leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales, making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates. Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging many-fermions systems.</description>

      <title>Solving the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation with Quantic Tensor Trains: Ground States and Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a tensor network framework based on the quantic tensor train (QTT) format to efficiently solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which governs Bose-Einstein condensates under mean-field theory. By adapting time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) and gradient descent methods, we accurately handle the GPE's nonlinearities within the QTT structure. Our approach enables high-resolution simulations with drastically reduced computational cost. We benchmark ground states and dynamics of BECs--including vortex lattice formation and breathing modes--demonstrating superior performance over conventional grid-based methods and stable long-time evolution due to saturating bond dimensions. This establishes QTT as a powerful tool for nonlinear quantum simulations.</description>
