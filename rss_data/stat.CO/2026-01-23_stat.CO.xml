      <title>A forward-only scheme for online learning of proposal distributions in particle filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new online approach for constructing proposal distributions in particle filters using a forward scheme. Our method progressively incorporates future observations to refine proposals. This is in contrast to backward-scheme algorithms that require access to the entire dataset, such as the iterated auxiliary particle filters (Guarniero et al., 2017, arXiv:1511.06286) and controlled sequential Monte Carlo (Heng et al., 2020, arXiv:1708.08396) which leverage all future observations through backward recursion. In comparison, our forward scheme achieves a gradual improvement of proposals that converges toward the proposal targeted by these backward methods. We show that backward approaches can be numerically unstable even in simple settings. Our forward method, however, offers significantly greater robustness with only a minor trade-off in performance, measured by the variance of the marginal likelihood estimator. Numerical experiments on both simulated and real data illustrate the enhanced stability of our forward approach.</description>

      <title>regTPS-KLE: A Novel Approach To Approximate A Gaussian Random Field for Bayesian Spatial Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian random field is a ubiquitous model for spatial phenomena in diverse scientific disciplines. Its approximation is often crucial for computational feasibility in simulation, inference, and uncertainty quantification. The Karhunen-Lo\`eve Expansion provides a theoretically optimal basis for representing a Gaussian random field as a sum of deterministic orthonormal functions weighted by uncorrelated random variables. While this is a well-established method for dimension reduction and approximation of (spatial) stochastic processes, its practical application depends on the explicit or implicit definition of the covariance structure. In this work, we propose a novel approach, referred to as regTPS-KLE, for approximating a Gaussian random field by explicitly constructing its covariance via a regularized thin plate spline (TPS) kernel. Because TPS kernels are conditionally positive definite and lack a direct spectral decomposition, we formulate the covariance as the inverse of a regularized elliptic operator. To evaluate its statistical performance, we compare its predictive accuracy and computational efficiency with a Gaussian random field approximation constructed using the stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) method and implemented within an MCMC algorithm. In simulation studies, the predictive differences between the SPDE and regTPS-KLE models were minimal when the spatial field was generated using Mat\`ern and exponential covariance functions, while regTPS-KLE models consistently outperformed the SPDE approach in terms of computational efficiency. In a real data application, regTPS-KLE exhibits superior predictive accuracy compared with SPDE models based on leave-one-out cross-validation while also achieving improved computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Spectral decomposition-assisted multi-study factor analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article focuses on covariance estimation for multi-study data. Popular approaches employ factor-analytic terms with shared and study-specific loadings that decompose the variance into (i) a shared low-rank component, (ii) study-specific low-rank components, and (iii) a diagonal term capturing idiosyncratic variability. Our proposed methodology estimates the latent factors via spectral decompositions, with a novel approach for separating shared and specific factors, and infers the factor loadings and residual variances via surrogate Bayesian regressions. The resulting posterior has a simple product form across outcomes, bypassing the need for Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and facilitating parallelization. The proposed methodology has major advantages over current Bayesian competitors in terms of computational speed, scalability and stability while also having strong frequentist guarantees. The theory and methods also add to the rich literature on frequentist methods for factor models with shared and group-specific components of variation. The approximation error decreases as the sample size and the data dimension diverge, formalizing a blessing of dimensionality. We show favorable asymptotic properties, including central limit theorems for point estimators and posterior contraction, and excellent empirical performance in simulations. The methods are applied to integrate three studies on gene associations among immune cells.</description>
