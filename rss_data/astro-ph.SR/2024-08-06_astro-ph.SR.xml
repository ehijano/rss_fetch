      <title>CHARA Near-Infrared Imaging of the Yellow Hypergiant Star $\rho$~Cassiopeiae: Convection Cells and Circumstellar Envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive evolved stars such as red supergiants and hypergiants are potential progenitors of Type II supernovae, and they are known for ejecting substantial amounts of matter, up to half their initial mass, during their final evolutionary phases. The rate and mechanism of this mass loss play a crucial role in determining their ultimate fate and the likelihood of their progression to supernovae. However, the exact mechanisms driving this mass ejection have long been a subject of research. Recent observations, such as the Great Dimming of Betelgeuse, have suggested that the activity of large convective cells, combined with pulsation, could be a plausible explanation for such mass loss events. In this context, we conducted interferometric observations of the famous yellow hypergiant, $\rho$~Cassiopeiae using the CHARA Array in H and K-band wavelengths. $\rho$~Cas is well known for its recurrent eruptions, characterized by periods of visual dimming ($\sim$~1.5-2 mag) followed by recovery. From our observations, we derived the diameter of the limb-darkened disk and found that this star has a radius of $1.04\pm0.01$ milliarcseconds (mas), or $564 - 700~R_\odot$. We performed image reconstructions with three different image reconstruction software packages, and they unveiled the presence of giant hot and cold spots on the stellar surface. We interpret these prominent hot spots as giant convection cells, suggesting a possible connection to mass ejections from the star's envelope. Furthermore, we detected spectral CO emission lines in the K-band ($\lambda=2.31-2.38 ~\mu$m), and the image reconstructions in these spectral lines revealed an extended circumstellar envelope with a radius of $1.45\pm0.10$ mas.</description>

      <title>X-Ray Flashes on Helium Novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A helium nova occurs on a white dwarf (WD) accreting hydrogen-deficient matter from a helium star companion. When the mass of a helium envelope on the WD reaches a critical value, unstable helium burning ignites to trigger a nova outburst. A bright soft X-ray phase appears in an early outbursting phase of a helium nova before it optically rises toward maximum. Such an X-ray bright phase is called the X-ray flash. We present theoretical light curves of X-ray flashes for 1.0, 1.2, and 1.35 $M_\odot$ helium novae with mass accretion rates of $(1.6-7.5) \times 10^{-7}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Long durations of the X-ray flashes (100 days to 10 years) and high X-ray luminosities ($\sim 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$) indicate that X-ray flashes are detectable as a new type of X-ray transients or persistent X-ray sources. An X-ray flash is a precursor of optical brightening, so that the detection of X-ray flashes on helium novae enables us to plan arranged observation for optical pre-maximum phases that have been one of the frontiers of nova study. We found a candidate object of helium-burning X-ray flash from literature on extra-galactic X-ray surveys. This X-ray transient source is consistent with our X-ray flash model of a $1.35 ~M_\odot$ WD.</description>

      <title>Comment on \'Ad\'am et al. (2023): Large fraction of already known systems reported</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, I report that large fraction of stars detected by \'Ad\'am et al. (2023, A&amp;A, 674, A170, arXiv:2304.08394) and noted in that work as new discoveries are in fact known systems. This is especially true for the dense bulge fields with large blending of nearby sources. Among the published 245 stars determined to be doubly eclipsing (i.e. containing two eclipsing signals), I identified 53 blends. In other words, about a quarter of the systems noted by \'Ad\'am et al. (2023, A&amp;A, 674, A170) are not actually doubly eclipsing; rather, these are contaminations of known nearby sources that have already been detected by OGLE. Such a high proportion of reported false positives should not be readily ignored and ought to be addressed in future studies.</description>

      <title>Helium Abundance of the Sun: A Spectroscopic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the He/H ratio in cool stars presents a fundamental astrophysical challenge. While this ratio is established for hot O and B stars, its extrapolation to cool stars remains uncertain due to the absence of helium lines in their observed spectra. We address this knowledge gap by focusing on the Sun as a representative cool star. We conduct spectroscopic analyses of the observed solar photospheric lines by utilizing a combination of MgH molecular lines and neutral Mg atomic lines including yet another combination of CH and C_2 molecular lines with neutral C atomic lines. Our spectroscopic analyses were further exploited by adopting solar model atmospheres constructed for distinct He/H ratios to determine the solar photospheric helium abundance. The helium abundance is determined by enforcing the fact that for an adopted model atmosphere with an appropriate He/H ratio, the derived Mg abundance from the neutral Mg atomic lines and that from the MgH molecular lines must be the same. Ditto holds for the C abundance derived from neutral C atomic lines and that from CH lines of the CH molecular band and C_2 lines from the C_2 Swan band. The estimated He/H ratio for the Sun is discussed based on the one-dimensional local thermodynamic equilibrium (1D LTE) model atmosphere. The helium abundance (He/H = 0.091(+0.019/+0.014)) obtained for the Sun serves as a critical reference point to characterize the He/H ratio of cool stars across the range in their effective temperature. Using this derived He/H ratio, the solar mass fractions are determined to be X_sun=0.7232(+0.0305/-0.0377), Y_sun=0.2633(+0.0384/-0.0311), and Z_sun=0.0135(+0.0006/-0.0007).</description>

      <title>The BANANA Project. VII. High Eccentricity Predicts Spin-Orbit Misalignment in Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree of spin-orbit alignment in a population of binary stars can be determined from measurements of their orbital inclinations and rotational broadening of their spectral lines. Alignment in a face-on binary guarantees low rotational broadening, while alignment in an edge-on binary maximizes the rotational broadening. In contrast, if spin-orbit angles ($\psi$) are random, rotational broadening should not depend on orbital inclination. Using this technique, we investigated a sample of 2{,}727 astrometric binaries from Gaia DR3 with F-type primaries and orbital periods between 50 and 1000 days (separations 0.3--2.7~au). We found that $\psi$ is strongly associated with $e$, the orbital eccentricity. When $e&lt;0.15$, the mean spin-orbit angle is $\langle\psi\rangle = 6.9_{-4.1}^{+5.4}$\,degrees, while for $e&gt;0.7$, it rises to $\langle\psi\rangle = 46_{-24}^{+26}$\,degrees. These results suggest that some binaries are affected by processes during their formation or evolution that excite both orbital eccentricity and inclination.</description>

      <title>Galactic-Field Metal-Rich RR~Lyrae Variables: Features of Kinematics and Abundances of Selected Chemical Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the relative abundance features of a number of chemical elements in the atmospheres of metal-rich ($\rm{[Fe/H]} &gt; -1.0$) Galactic-field RR~Lyrae variable stars and the kinematic characteristics of these stars. We have previously shown that the relative abundances of some $\alpha$-elements: magnesium, silicon, calcium, and to a greater extent of titanium, as well as yttrium and scandium in such stars are lower than in most of other types of stars, bearing similar metallicity. It is found here that some of these metal-rich RR~Lyrae stars also have very low relative abundances of sodium, aluminum and nickel. The orbital parameters of all the metal-rich RR~Lyrae variables studied in this paper are typical of the Galactic thin or thick disk objects, however, unusual chemical composition let us to suggests a possible extragalactic origin for some of them.</description>

      <title>A Dust-Scattering Model for M1-92: A Revised Estimate of the Mass Distribution and Inclination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preplanetary nebulae (PPNe) are formed from mass-ejecting late-stage AGB stars. Much of the light from the star gets scattered or absorbed by dust particles, giving rise to the observed reflection nebula seen at visible and near-IR wavelengths. Precursors to planetary nebulae (PNe), PPNe generally have not yet undergone any ionization by UV radiation from the still-buried stellar core. Bipolar PPNe are a common form of observed PPNe. This study lays the groundwork for future dynamical studies by reconstructing the dust density distribution of a particularly symmetric bipolar PPN, M1-92 (Minkowski's Footprint, IRAS 19343$+$2926). For this purpose, we develop an efficient single-scattering radiative transfer model with corrections for double-scattering. Using a V-band image from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we infer the dust density profile and orientation of M1-92. These results indicate that M1-92's slowly expanding equatorial torus exhibits an outer radial cutoff in its density, which implicates the influence of a binary companion during the formation of the nebula.</description>

      <title>The interplay between disk wind and magnetospheric accretion mechanisms in the innermost environment of RU Lup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: Our aim is to build upon the analysis presented in our previous work by attempting to match the observational data obtained with VLTI GRAVITY for RU Lup in 2021 with an expanded radiative transfer model of Br$\gamma$ emission. Specifically, we will determine if the inclusion of an additional disk wind as a Br$\gamma$ emitter in the inner disk will be able to reproduce the trend of increasing sizes at higher velocities, as well as the observed photocenter shifts.
  Methods: We make use of the MCFOST radiative transfer code to solve for Br$\gamma$ line formation in the innermost disk of an RU Lupl-like system. From the resulting images we compute synthetic interferometric observables. We first investigate how individual parameter variations in a pure magnetospheric accretion model and a pure parameteric disk wind model translate to changes in these derived quantities. Then we attempt to reproduce the RU Lup GRAVITY data with different parameter variants of magnetospheric accretion models, disk wind models, and combined hybrid models.
  Results: We demonstrate that magnetospheric accretion models and disk wind models on their own can emulate certain individual characteristics from the observational results, but individually fail to comprehensively reproduce the observational trends. Disk wind plus accretion hybrid models are in principle capable of explaining the variation in characteristic radii across the line and the corresponding flux ratios. While the model parameters of the hybrid models are mostly in good agreement with the known attributes of RU Lup, we find that our best-fitting models deviate in terms of rotational period and the size of the magnetosphere. The best-fitting hybrid model does not respect the co-rotation criterion, as the magnetospheric truncation radius is about 50% larger than the co-rotation radius.</description>

      <title>First Measurement of Solar $^8$B Neutrinos via Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering with XENONnT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first measurement of nuclear recoils from solar $^8$B neutrinos via coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering with the XENONnT dark matter experiment. The central detector of XENONnT is a low-background, two-phase time projection chamber with a 5.9\,t sensitive liquid xenon target. A blind analysis with an exposure of 3.51\,t$\times$y resulted in 37 observed events above 0.5\,keV, with ($26.4^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$) events expected from backgrounds. The background-only hypothesis is rejected with a statistical significance of 2.73\,$\sigma$. The measured $^8$B solar neutrino flux of $(4.7_{-2.3}^{+3.6})\times 10^6\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is consistent with results from dedicated solar neutrino experiments. The measured neutrino flux-weighted CE$\nu$NS cross-section on Xe of $(1.1^{+0.8}_{-0.5})\times10^{-39}\,\mathrm{cm}^2$ is consistent with the Standard Model prediction. This is the first direct measurement of nuclear recoils from solar neutrinos with a dark matter detector.</description>

      <title>FAST detection of OH emission in the carbon-rich planetary nebula NGC 7027</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first detection of the ground-state OH emission line at 1612 MHz toward the prototypical carbon-rich planetary nebula (PN) NGC 7027, utilizing the newly installed ultra-wideband (UWB) receiver of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). This emission is likely to originate from the interface of the neutral shell and the ionized region. The other three ground-state OH lines at 1665, 1667, and 1721 MHz are observed in absorption and have velocities well matched with that of HCO$^+$ absorption. We infer that the OH absorption is from the outer shell of NGC 7027, although the possibility that they are associated with a foreground cloud cannot be completely ruled out. All the OH lines exhibit a single blue-shifted component with respect to the central star. The formation of OH in carbon-rich environments might be via photodissociation-induced chemical processes. Our observations offer significant constraints for chemical simulations, and they underscore the potent capability of the UWB receiver of FAST to search for nascent PNe.</description>

      <title>A new code for low-resolution spectral identification of white dwarf binary candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Close white dwarf binaries (CWDBs) are considered to be progenitors of several exotic astronomical phenomena (e.g., type Ia supernovae, cataclysmic variables). These violent events are broadly used in studies of general relativity and cosmology. However, obtaining precise stellar parameter measurements for both components of CWDBs is a challenging task given their low luminosities, swift time variation, and complex orbits. High-resolution spectra (R$&gt; 20 000$) are preferred but expensive, resulting in a sample size that is insufficient for robust population study. To release the full potential of the less expensive low-resolution spectroscopic surveys, and thus greatly expand the CWDB sample size, it is necessary to develop a robust pipeline for spectra decomposition and analysis. We used an artificial neural network (ANN) to build spectrum generators for DA/DB white dwarfs and main-sequence stars. The best-fit stellar parameters were obtained by finding the least $\chi^2$ solution to these feature lines and the continuum simultaneously. We demonstrate the reliability of our code with two well-studied CWDBs, WD 1534+503 and PG 1224+309. We also estimate the stellar parameters of 14 newly identified CWDB candidates, most of which are fitted with double component models for the first time. Our estimates agree with previous results for the common stars and follow the statistical distribution in the literature. The application of our code to a large volume of white dwarf binary candidates will offer important statistic samples to stellar evolution studies and future gravitational wave monitoring.</description>

      <title>Exploring the range of impacts of helium in the spectra of double detonation models for Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the double detonation scenario the ignition of a surface He detonation on a sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf leads to a secondary core detonation. Double detonation models have shown promise for explaining Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with a variety of luminosities. A key feature of such models is unburnt He in the ejecta, which can show significant variation in both its mass and velocity distribution. Many previous radiative transfer simulations for double detonation models have neglected treatment of non-thermal ionization and excitation, preventing them from robustly assessing whether He spectral features are expected to form. We present a non local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer simulation, including treatment for non-thermal electrons, for a double detonation model with a modest mass of He (${\sim}$0.04 M${\odot}$) ejected at reasonably low velocities (${\sim}$12000$\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). Despite our simulation predicting no clear optical He features, a strong and persistent He I 10830$\,\r{A}$ absorption feature forms that is significantly blended with the spectral contribution of Mg II 10927$\,\r{A}$. For some normal SNe Ia the Mg feature shows an extended blue wing, previously attributed to C I, however the simulated He feature shows its strongest absorption at wavelengths consistent with this wing. We therefore suggest this extended wing is instead a spectral signature of He. The He feature predicted by this particular model is too strong and persistent to be consistent with normal SNe Ia, however, this motivates further work to use this observable signature to test the parameter space for double detonation models.</description>

      <title>Constraining solar electron number density via neutrino flavor data at Borexino</title>

Abstract: Understanding the physics of the deep solar interior, and the more exotic environs of core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) and binary neutron-star (NS) mergers, is of keen interest in many avenues of research. To date, this physics is based largely on simulations via forward integration. While these simulations provide valuable constraints, it could be insightful to adopt the "inverse approach" as a point of comparison. Within this paradigm, parameters of the solar interior are not output based on an assumed model, but rather are inferred based on real data. We take the specific case of solar electron number density, which historically is taken as output from the standard solar model. We show how one may arrive at an independent constraint on that density profile based on available neutrino flavor data from the Earth-based Borexino experiment. The inference technique's ability to offer a unique lens on physics can be extended to other datasets, and to analogous questions for CCSN and NS mergers, albeit with simulated data.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of Eclipsing Compact Hierarchical Triples I</title>

Abstract: Eclipsing Compact Hierarchical Triples (ECHTs) are systems with the tertiary star orbiting an eclipsing binary (EB) in an orbit of fewer than 1000 days. In a CHT, all three stars exist in a space less than 5 AU in separation. A low-mass CHT is an interesting case to understand multiple star and planet formation at such small scales. In this study, we combine spectroscopy and photometry to estimate the orbital, stellar and atmospheric parameters of stars in a sample of CHTs. Using the complete set of parameters we aim to constrain the metallicity and age of the systems. We use time-series spectroscopy to obtain radial velocities (RVs) and disentangled spectra. Using RV modelling, EB light curve modelling, and spectral analysis, we estimated the metallicities and temperatures. Using isochrone fitting, we constrain the ages of the system. We then combine observations of masses, outer eccentricities (e_2), orbital periods and age estimates of the systems from the literature. We compare the distributions of e_2, and tertiary mass ratio, q_3 = M_3/(M_1+M_2), for three different metallicity ranges and two ranges of age. We estimate masses, radii, temperatures, metallicities and age of 12 stars in 4 CHTs. The CHT CD-32 6459 shows signs of von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations while CD-62 1257 can evolve to form a triple common envelope. The rest of the CHTs are old and have an M-dwarf tertiary. We find that the q_3 distribution for CHTs with sub-solar metallicity has a uniform distribution but the systems with solar and above-solar metallicity peak between 0.5 and 1. When dividing them according to their ages, we found the q_3 of old systems around 0.5. The eccentricity e_2 favours a value around 0.3 irrespective of metallicity or age. The distributions are biased by the lack of observations and observing methods and therefore call for more observations of low-mass CHT.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the $\delta$ Scuti eclipsing binary KIC 4851217 and its tertiary companion as well as detection of tidally tilted pulsations</title>

Abstract: Stellar theory enables us to understand the properties of stars at different stages of their evolution, and contributes to other fields of astrophysics such as galactic and exoplanet studies. Assessing the accuracy of stellar theories necessitates high precision, model-independent measurements of the properties of real stars, such as those obtainable for the components of double lined eclipsing binaries (DLEBs), while asteroseismology offers probing power of the stellar interior if one or both components pulsate. KIC 4851217 is a DLEB containing two late A-type stars and exhibits pulsations of the $\delta$ Scuti type. By analysing high resolution HERMES and moderate resolution ISIS spectra, jointly with Kepler and TESS light curves, we measured the masses, radii and effective temperatures of the components to precisions of ~0.5, ~1.1 and ~1 per cent, respectively. We additionally report the discovery and characterisation of a tertiary M-dwarf companion. Models of the system's spectral energy distribution agree with an age of 0.82 Gyr, with the more massive and larger secondary component near the end of the main sequence lifetime. An examination of the pulsating component's pulsation frequencies reveals 39 pulsation multiplets that are split by the orbital frequency. For most of these, it is evident that the pulsation axes have been tilted into the orbital plane. This makes KIC 4851217 a tidally tilted pulsator (TTP). This precisely characterized $\delta$ Scuti DLEB is an ideal candidate for advancing intermediate-mass stellar theory, contributing to our understanding of hierarchichal systems as well as to the topic of TTPs.</description>

      <title>Continuous Gravitational Waves: A New Window to Look for Heavy Non-annihilating Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sun-like stars can transmute into comparable mass black holes by steadily accumulating heavy non-annihilating dark matter particles over the course of their lives. If such stars form in binary systems, they could give rise to quasi-monochromatic, persistent gravitational waves, commonly known as continuous gravitational waves, as they inspiral toward one another. We demonstrate that next-generation space-based detectors, e.g., Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and Big Bang Observer (BBO), can provide novel constraints on dark matter parameters (dark matter mass and its interaction cross-section with the nucleons) by probing gravitational waves from transmuted Sun-like stars that are in close binaries. Our projected constraints depend on several astrophysical uncertainties, nevertheless, are competitive with the existing constraints obtained from cosmological measurements as well as terrestrial direct searches, demonstrating a notable science-case for these space-based gravitational wave detectors as probes of particle dark matter.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional plasmoid-mediated reconnection and turbulence in Hall magnetohydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmoid instability accelerates reconnection in collisional plasmas by transforming a laminar reconnection layer into numerous plasmoids connected by secondary current sheets in two dimensions (2D) and by fostering self-generated turbulent reconnection in three dimensions (3D). In large-scale astrophysical and space systems, plasmoid instability likely initiates in the collisional regime but may transition into the collisionless regime as the fragmentation of the current sheet progresses toward kinetic scales. Hall MHD models are widely regarded as a simplified yet effective representation of the transition from collisional to collisionless reconnection. However, plasmoid instability in 2D Hall MHD simulations often leads to a single-X-line reconnection configuration, which significantly differs from fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulation results. This study shows that single-X-line reconnection is less likely to occur in 3D compared to 2D. Moreover, depending on the Lundquist number and the ratio between the system size and the kinetic scale, Hall MHD can also realize 3D self-generated turbulent reconnection. We analyze the features of the self-generated turbulent state, including the energy power spectra and the scale dependence of turbulent eddy anisotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We quantify the effects of light spin-zero particles with pseudoscalar couplings to leptons and scalar couplings to nucleons on the evolution of solar neutrinos. In this scenario the matter potential sourced by the nucleons in the Sun's matter gives rise to spin precession of the relativistic neutrino ensemble. As such the effects in the solar observables are different if neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles. For Dirac neutrinos the spin-flavour precession results into left-handed neutrino to right-handed neutrino (i.e., active-sterile) oscillations, while for Majorana neutrinos it results into left-handed neutrino to right-handed antineutrino (i.e., active-active) oscillations. In both cases this leads to distortions in the solar neutrino spectrum which we use to derive constraints on the allowed values of the mediator mass and couplings via a global analysis of the solar neutrino data. In addition for Majorana neutrinos spin-flavour precession results into a potentially observable flux of solar electron antineutrinos at the Earth which we quantify and constrain with the existing bounds from Borexino and KamLAND.</description>

      <title>V892 Tau: A tidally perturbed circumbinary disc in a triple stellar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: V892 Tau is a young binary star surrounded by a circumbinary disc which show hints of interaction with the low-mass nearby star V892 Tau NE. The goal of this paper is to constrain the orbit of V892 Tau NE and to determine the resulting circumbinary disc dynamics. We present new ALMA observations of the V892 Tau circumbinary disc at a twice higher angular and spectral resolution. We model the data with V892 Tau as a triple system and perform a grid of hydrodynamical simulations testing several orbits of the companion. The simulation outputs are then post-processed to build synthetic maps that we compare to the observations. The 12CO emission of the disc shows clear non-Keplerian features such as spiral arms. When comparing the data with our synthetic observations, we interpret these features as ongoing interactions with the companion. Our simulations indicate that an eccentricity of 0.5 of the companion is needed to reproduce the observed disc extent and that a mutual inclination of approximately 60{\deg} with the inner binary reproduces the measured disc tilt. In order to explain most of the features of the circumbinary disc, we propose that V892 Tau NE follows a misaligned eccentric orbit, with an eccentricity between 0.2 and 0.5 and a mutual inclination between 30{\deg} and 60{\deg}. Such a misaligned companion suggests the disc is oscillating and precessing with time, stabilising in an intermediate plane with a non-zero mutual inclination with the inner binary. Given that orbital configuration, we show that the stability of future planets is compromised in the second half of the disc once the gas has dissipated.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Supernovae Interacting with Dense Circumstellar Matter with a Flat Density Profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and dense circumstellar medium (CSM) with a flat density structure ($\rho \propto r^{-s}, s &lt; 1.5$) was recently proposed as a possible mechanism behind interacting SNe that exhibit exceptionally long rise times exceeding 100 days. In such a configuration, the interaction luminosity keeps rising until the reverse shock propagates into the inner layers of the SN ejecta. We investigate the light curves of SNe interacting with a flatly distributed CSM in detail, incorporating the effects of photon diffusion inside the CSM into the model. We show that three physical processes - the shock breakout, the propagation of the reverse shock into the inner ejecta, and the departure of the shock from the dense CSM - predominantly determine the qualitative behaviour of the light curves. Based on the presence and precedence of these processes, the light curves of SNe interacting with flatly distributed CSM can be classified into five distinct morphological classes. We also show that our model can qualitatively reproduce doubly peaked SNe whose peaks are a few tens of days apart, such as SN 2005bf and SN 2022xxf. Our results show that the density distribution of the CSM is an important property of CSM that contributes to the diversity in light curves of interacting SNe.</description>
