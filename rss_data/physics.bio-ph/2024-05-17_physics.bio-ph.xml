      <title>Challenges and opportunities for digital twins in precision medicine: a complex systems perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of digital twins (DTs) in precision medicine is increasingly viable, propelled by extensive data collection and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), alongside traditional biomedical methodologies. However, the reliance on black-box predictive models, which utilize large datasets, presents limitations that could impede the broader application of DTs in clinical settings. We argue that hypothesis-driven generative models, particularly multiscale modeling, are essential for boosting the clinical accuracy and relevance of DTs, thereby making a significant impact on healthcare innovation. This paper explores the transformative potential of DTs in healthcare, emphasizing their capability to simulate complex, interdependent biological processes across multiple scales. By integrating generative models with extensive datasets, we propose a scenario-based modeling approach that enables the exploration of diverse therapeutic strategies, thus supporting dynamic clinical decision-making. This method not only leverages advancements in data science and big data for improving disease treatment and prevention but also incorporates insights from complex systems and network science, quantitative biology, and digital medicine, promising substantial advancements in patient care.</description>

      <title>Mechanics and morphology of proliferating cell collectives with self-inhibiting growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of proliferating cell collectives whose microscopic constituents' growth is inhibited by macroscopic growth-induced stress. Discrete particle simulations of a growing collective show the emergence of concentric-ring patterns in cell size whose spatio-temporal structure is closely tied to the individual cell's stress response. Motivated by these observations, we derive a multiscale continuum theory whose parameters map directly to the discrete model. Analytical solutions of this theory show the concentric patterns arise from anisotropically accumulated resistance to growth over many cell cycles. This work shows how purely mechanical processes can affect the internal patterning and morphology of cell collectives, and provides a concise theoretical framework for connecting the micro- to macroscopic dynamics of proliferating matter.</description>

      <title>Protein folding as a jamming transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins fold to a specific functional conformation with a densely packed hydrophobic core that controls their stability. We develop a geometric, yet all-atom model for proteins that explains the universal core packing fraction of $\phi_c=0.55$ found in experimental measurements. We show that as the hydrophobic interactions increase relative to the temperature, a novel jamming transition occurs when the core packing fraction exceeds $\phi_c$. The model also recapitulates the global structure of proteins since it can accurately refold to native-like structures from partially unfolded states.</description>

      <title>Heavy-element damage seeding in proteins under X-ray free electron laser illumination conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging technique of serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) can be used to study the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules to high spatial and temporal resolutions. An ongoing challenge for SFX is the damage caused by the ultrabright X-ray free electron laser pulse. Though it is often assumed that sufficiently femtosecond pulses `outrun' radiation damage, in reality electronic damage processes commence during exposure. We model the electronic damage to protein nanocrystals using a plasma model that tracks the continuous changes to the energy distribution of the unbound electrons. Tracking the continuous energy distribution is of particular importance for distinguishing the influence of differing elements on secondary damage processes. Heavy atoms have a ubiquitous but small presence in protein targets - typically as integral components of the macromolecule and as salts in the solvent. We find that these atoms considerably influence the simulated ionization and scattering behavior of realistic targets due to their rapid seeding of secondary ionization processes. In lysozyme, even the presence of native sulfur atoms significantly contributes to theoretical measures of damage-induced noise for &gt;= 6 keV, 15 fs pulses. Contributing to the effect is that heavy atoms seed `intermediate' energy electron cascades that are particularly effective at ionizing the target on the femtosecond timescale. In addition, the disproportionate effect of heavy atoms means the damage to a protein crystal can be sensitive to their presence in the solvent. Outside of reducing the concentration of heavy atoms in the target, these results suggest the dose limits of SFX targets will be higher where the ionization of deep &gt;~ 6 keV absorption edges is minimized, or, to a lesser extent, when such edges are only ionized with X-rays &gt;&gt; 2 keV above their binding energy.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Warm Dark Matter: from Cosmological Asymmetry to Chirality of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel scenario involving asymmetric keV-range dark matter (DM) in the form of right-handed (sterile) neutrinos. Based on the Fermi-Dirac distribution, we demonstrate that asymmetric fermionic DM forms a Fermi degenerate gas, making it potentially colder than symmetric fermionic DM. This setup simultaneously accounts for the Universe's baryon asymmetry through tiny Yukawa interactions with Standard Model leptons and the Higgs field, and the homochirality of amino acids via decay into circularly polarized photons. This scenario can be investigated through soft X-ray searches conducted by current and upcoming space missions. The helical X-rays is a smoking-gun signal of our scenario. Additionally, we propose a new mechanism to suppress DM thermal production by introducing a light modulus, which may also benefit cosmology involving generic right-handed neutrinos with large mixing.</description>

      <title>Protective Effect of Trehalose Sugar on Amyloid-Membrane Interactions using BLM Electrophysiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by dementia and memory loss in the elderly population. The amyloid-$\beta$ peptide (A$\beta$ 1-42) is one of the main pathogenic factors in AD and is known to cause damage to neuronal cellular membranes. There is no cure currently available for AD and new approaches, including preventive strategies, are highly desirable. In this work, we explore the possibility of protecting neuronal membranes from amyloid-induced damage with naturally existing sugar trehalose. Trehalose has been shown to protect plant cellular membranes in extreme conditions and modify A$\beta$ misfolding. We hypothesize that trehalose can protect the neuronal membrane from amyloid toxicity. In this work, we studied the protective effect of trehalose against A$\beta$-induced damage in model lipid membranes (DPPC/POPC/Cholesterol) to mimic neuronal membranes using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and black lipid membrane (BLM) electrophysiology. Our results demonstrated that A$\beta$1-42 damaged membranes and led to ionic current leakage across these membranes due to the formation of various defects and pores. The presence of trehalose reduced the ion current across membranes caused by A$\beta$1-42 peptide damage, thus efficiently protecting the membranes. These findings suggest the trehalose sugar can be useful in protecting neuronal cellular membranes against amyloid toxicity in AD prevention.</description>

      <title>Action potential propagation properties of 4D, 3D and 2D Hodgkin-Huxley type models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between the sodium and potassium gating variables in the Hodgkin-Huxley electrophysiology model, reducing the dimension of the original 4-dimensional (4D) HH model and decreasing the complexity of the model equations. New 3D and 2D model equations have been derived. The new 3D and 2D models result from the relationship $h\simeq c-n$, where $c$ is a constant, of the gate variables $h$ and $n$ of the 4D HH model, suggesting an interdependence between the dynamics of the Na$^+$ and K$^+$ transmembrane pumps. We have derived the main properties of the propagation speed and width of action potentials for axons with Na$^+$ and K$^+$ active channels as a function of the transmembrane capacity $C_m$ and resistivity $R$ of the conducting axon. For the three HH type models, we show that the action potential propagates along the axon with speed well described by $v(R, C_m)=\alpha /({C_m R^{\beta}})=\gamma D^{\beta}$, where $\alpha&gt;0 $, $0&lt;\beta &lt;1$ and $\gamma$ are constants independent of the local intensity stimulus, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of the axon. The width $w$ of the action potential spikes depends on the resistivity of the axon with $w = \alpha_2 /R^{\beta_2}$, where $\alpha_2$ and $\beta_2$ are positive constants.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Interplay of Intrinsic Fluctuation and Complexity in Intracellular Calcium Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concentration of intracellular calcium ion (Ca$^{2+}$) exhibits complex oscillations, including bursting and chaos, as observed experimentally. These dynamics are influenced by inherent fluctuations within cells, which serve as crucial determinants in cellular decision-making processes and fate determination. In this study, we systematically explore the interplay between intrinsic fluctuation and the complexity of intracellular cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics using complexity measures such as permutation entropy (PE) and statistical complexity (SC). Using the chemical Langevin equation, we simulate the stochastic dynamics of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$. Our findings reveal that PE and SC effectively characterize the diverse, dynamic states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ and illustrate their interactions with intrinsic fluctuation. PE analysis elucidates that the chaotic state is more sensitive to intrinsic fluctuation than the other periodic states. Furthermore, we identify distinct states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ occupying specific locations within the theoretical bounds of the complexity-entropy causality plane. These locations indicate varying complexity and information content as intrinsic fluctuation varies. When adjusting the permutation order, the SC for the different states exhibits peaks in an intermediate range of intrinsic fluctuation values. Additionally, we identify scale-free or self-similar patterns in this intermediate range, which are further corroborated by multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. These high-complexity states likely correspond to optimal Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics with biological significance, revealing rich and complex dynamics shaped by the interplay of intrinsic fluctuation and complexity. Our investigation enhances our understanding of how intrinsic fluctuation modulates the complexity of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics that play crucial roles in biological cells.</description>

      <title>Simulating Light Propagation through Biological Media Using Monte-Carlo Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological tissues are complex structures composed of many elements which make light-based tissue diagnostics challenging. Over the past decades, Monte Carlo technique has been used as a fundamental and versatile approach toward modeling photon-tissue interactions. This report first describes a MC simulation of steady-state light transport in an absorbing and diffusing multi-layered structure. Further, a parallel processing solution is implemented to reduce execution time and memory requirements. Then, the nonparametric phase function, which is a discretized version of the phase function, has been discussed where the integration of the phase function is a numerical process, instead of an analytical operation. Finally, to simulate more realistic structures of biological systems, simulations are modified to incorporate objects of various shapes (sphere, ellipsoid, or cylinder) with a refractive-index mismatched boundary. The output files mainly contain 2D reflection matrix, 2D transmission matrix, and 3D absorption matrix.</description>

      <title>Effects of skull properties on transcranial focused ultrasound transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcranial focused ultrasound can deliver energy to the brain in a minimally invasive manner for a variety of clinical applications. However, acoustic inhomogeneities within the skull cause significant wave interactions, leading to difficulties in predicting the energy delivered to the target. We present a comprehensive examination of intracranial acoustic fields generated by focused ultrasound transducers and assess the characteristics of cranial bone that affect acoustic transmission. Acoustic field maps were generated at 88 regions of interest across 10 historical and 2 Thiel-embalmed human skull specimens with sonication at frequencies of 220 kHz, 650 kHz, and 1000 kHz. The average peak pressure attenuation was $3.1 \pm 1.4$ dB, $9.0 \pm 1.7$ dB, and $14.6 \pm 4.1$ dB, respectively. The average power attenuation was $5.0 \pm 2.4$ dB, $14.9 \pm 3.2$ dB, and $24.1 \pm 6.3$ dB, respectively. The effect of skull thickness, skull density ratio, and skull curvature on intracranial peak pressure and power was investigated and linear fits produced. Our results demonstrate that Thiel-embalmed samples fall within the confidence intervals of fits for historical samples. The effects of angulation and spacing between the transducer and the skull were also investigated. Results indicate that wave superposition resulting from skull and transducer spacing could lead to a 30-40% uncertainty in peak recorded intracranial pressure.</description>
