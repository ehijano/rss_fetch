      <title>Prediction-Powered Inference with Inverse Probability Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction-powered inference (PPI) is a recent framework for valid statistical inference with partially labeled data, combining model-based predictions on a large unlabeled set with bias correction from a smaller labeled subset. We show that PPI can be extended to handle informative labeling by replacing its unweighted bias-correction term with an inverse probability weighted (IPW) version, using the classical Horvitz--Thompson or H\'ajek forms. This connection unites design-based survey sampling ideas with modern prediction-assisted inference, yielding estimators that remain valid when labeling probabilities vary across units. We consider the common setting where the inclusion probabilities are not known but estimated from a correctly specified model. In simulations, the performance of IPW-adjusted PPI with estimated propensities closely matches the known-probability case, retaining both nominal coverage and the variance-reduction benefits of PPI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning work assumes a static, i.i.d training environment that doesn't truly exist. Modern ML pipelines need to learn, unlearn, and predict continuously on production streams of data. We translate the notion of the batch unlearning scenario to the online setting using notions of regret, sample complexity, and deletion capacity. We further tighten regret bounds to a logarithmic $\mathcal{O}(\ln{T})$, a first for a machine unlearning algorithm. And we swap out an expensive Hessian inversion with online variant of L-BFGS optimization, removing a memory footprint that scales linearly with time. Such changes extend the lifespan of an ML model before expensive retraining, making for a more efficient unlearning process.</description>

      <title>Dimension-Free Bounds for Generalized First-Order Methods via Gaussian Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish non-asymptotic bounds on the finite-sample behavior of generalized first-order iterative algorithms -- including gradient-based optimization methods and approximate message passing (AMP) -- with Gaussian data matrices and full-memory, non-separable nonlinearities. The central result constructs an explicit coupling between the iterates of a generalized first-order method and a conditionally Gaussian process whose covariance evolves deterministically via a finite-dimensional state evolution recursion. This coupling yields tight, dimension-free bounds under mild Lipschitz and moment-matching conditions. Our analysis departs from classical inductive AMP proofs by employing a direct comparison between the generalized first-order method and the conditionally Gaussian comparison process. This approach provides a unified derivation of AMP theory for Gaussian matrices without relying on separability or asymptotics. A complementary lower bound on the Wasserstein distance demonstrates the sharpness of our upper bounds.</description>

      <title>An Iterative Algorithm for Differentially Private $k$-PCA with Adaptive Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $n$ i.i.d. random matrices $A_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ that share a common expectation $\Sigma$, the objective of Differentially Private Stochastic PCA is to identify a subspace of dimension $k$ that captures the largest variance directions of $\Sigma$, while preserving differential privacy (DP) of each individual $A_i$. Existing methods either (i) require the sample size $n$ to scale super-linearly with dimension $d$, even under Gaussian assumptions on the $A_i$, or (ii) introduce excessive noise for DP even when the intrinsic randomness within $A_i$ is small. Liu et al. (2022a) addressed these issues for sub-Gaussian data but only for estimating the top eigenvector ($k=1$) using their algorithm DP-PCA. We propose the first algorithm capable of estimating the top $k$ eigenvectors for arbitrary $k \leq d$, whilst overcoming both limitations above. For $k=1$ our algorithm matches the utility guarantees of DP-PCA, achieving near-optimal statistical error even when $n = \tilde{\!O}(d)$. We further provide a lower bound for general $k &gt; 1$, matching our upper bound up to a factor of $k$, and experimentally demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm over comparable baselines.</description>

      <title>Conic Formulations of Transport Metrics for Unbalanced Measure Networks and Hypernetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) variant of optimal transport, designed to compare probability densities defined over distinct metric spaces, has emerged as an important tool for the analysis of data with complex structure, such as ensembles of point clouds or networks. To overcome certain limitations, such as the restriction to comparisons of measures of equal mass and sensitivity to outliers, several unbalanced or partial transport relaxations of the GW distance have been introduced in the recent literature. This paper is concerned with the Conic Gromov-Wasserstein (CGW) distance introduced by S\'{e}journ\'{e}, Vialard, and Peyr\'{e}. We provide a novel formulation in terms of semi-couplings, and extend the framework beyond the metric measure space setting, to compare more general network and hypernetwork structures. With this new formulation, we establish several fundamental properties of the CGW metric, including its scaling behavior under dilation, variational convergence in the limit of volume growth constraints, and comparison bounds with established optimal transport metrics. We further derive quantitative bounds that characterize the robustness of the CGW metric to perturbations in the underlying measures. The hypernetwork formulation of CGW admits a simple and provably convergent block coordinate ascent algorithm for its estimation, and we demonstrate the computational tractability and scalability of our approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world high-dimensional and structured datasets.</description>

      <title>CVCM Track Circuits Pre-emptive Failure Diagnostics for Predictive Maintenance Using Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation (CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset, it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes, struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures. Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving 99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems, enhancing operational reliability.</description>

      <title>xRFM: Accurate, scalable, and interpretable feature learning models for tabular data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts of training data.
  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across $200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Models for Joint Selection of Features and Auto-Regressive Lags: Theory and Applications in Environmental and Financial Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Bayesian framework for variable selection in linear regression with autocorrelated errors, accommodating lagged covariates and autoregressive structures. This setting occurs in time series applications where responses depend on contemporaneous or past explanatory variables and persistent stochastic shocks, including financial modeling, hydrological forecasting, and meteorological applications requiring temporal dependency capture. Our methodology uses hierarchical Bayesian models with spike-and-slab priors to simultaneously select relevant covariates and lagged error terms. We propose an efficient two-stage MCMC algorithm separating sampling of variable inclusion indicators and model parameters to address high-dimensional computational challenges. Theoretical analysis establishes posterior selection consistency under mild conditions, even when candidate predictors grow exponentially with sample size, common in modern time series with many potential lagged variables. Through simulations and real applications (groundwater depth prediction, S&amp;P 500 log returns modeling), we demonstrate substantial gains in variable selection accuracy and predictive performance. Compared to existing methods, our framework achieves lower MSPE, improved true model component identification, and greater robustness with autocorrelated noise, underscoring practical utility for model interpretation and forecasting in autoregressive settings.</description>

      <title>Comparison of D-Wave Quantum Annealing and Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Sampling from a Probability Distribution of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch, the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a conditional version of the classical regret-capacity theorem. This result can be used in universal prediction to find lower bounds on the minimal batch regret, which is a recently introduced generalization of the average regret, when batches of training data are available to the predictor. As an example, we apply this result to the class of binary memoryless sources. Finally, we generalize the theorem to R\'enyi information measures, revealing a deep connection between the conditional R\'enyi divergence and the conditional Sibson's mutual information.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Prediction of Parkinson's Disease Medication Needs: A Two-Stage Conformal Prediction Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from 631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving life quality.</description>

      <title>Online selective conformal inference: adaptive scores, convergence rate and optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a supervised online setting, quantifying uncertainty has been proposed in the seminal work of \cite{gibbs2021adaptive}. For any given point-prediction algorithm, their method (ACI) produces a conformal prediction set with an average missed coverage getting close to a pre-specified level $\alpha$ for a long time horizon. We introduce an extended version of this algorithm, called OnlineSCI, allowing the user to additionally select times where such an inference should be made. OnlineSCI encompasses several prominent online selective tasks, such as building prediction intervals for extreme outcomes, classification with abstention, and online testing. While OnlineSCI controls the average missed coverage on the selected in an adversarial setting, our theoretical results also show that it controls the instantaneous error rate (IER) at the selected times, up to a non-asymptotical remainder term. Importantly, our theory covers the case where OnlineSCI updates the point-prediction algorithm at each time step, a property which we refer to as {\it adaptive} capability. We show that the adaptive versions of OnlineSCI can convergence to an optimal solution and provide an explicit convergence rate in each of the aforementioned application cases, under specific mild conditions. Finally, the favorable behavior of OnlineSCI in practice is illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Unpacking the Implicit Norm Dynamics of Sharpness-Aware Minimization in Tensorized Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes. Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method, \emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our experiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or improved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.</description>

      <title>BKP: An R Package for Beta Kernel Process Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present BKP, a user-friendly and extensible R package that implements the Beta Kernel Process (BKP) -- a fully nonparametric and computationally efficient framework for modeling spatially varying binomial probabilities. The BKP model combines localized kernel-weighted likelihoods with conjugate beta priors, resulting in closed-form posterior inference without requiring latent variable augmentation or intensive MCMC sampling. The package supports binary and aggregated binomial responses, allows flexible choices of kernel functions and prior specification, and provides loss-based kernel hyperparameter tuning procedures. In addition, BKP extends naturally to the Dirichlet Kernel Process (DKP) for modeling spatially varying multinomial or compositional data. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available R package for implementing BKP-based methods. We illustrate the use of BKP through several synthetic and real-world datasets, highlighting its interpretability, accuracy, and scalability. The package aims to facilitate practical application and future methodological development of kernel-based beta modeling in statistics and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Confounding is a Pervasive Problem in Real World Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine, ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear filtering based on density approximation and deep BSDE prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel approximate Bayesian filter based on backward stochastic differential equations is introduced. It uses a nonlinear Feynman--Kac representation of the filtering problem and the approximation of an unnormalized filtering density using the well-known deep BSDE method and neural networks. The method is trained offline, which means that it can be applied online with new observations. A mixed a priori-a posteriori error bound is proved under an elliptic condition. The theoretical convergence rate is confirmed in two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Bayesian Optimization in Bioprocess Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization has become widely popular across various experimental sciences due to its favorable attributes: it can handle noisy data, perform well with relatively small datasets, and provide adaptive suggestions for sequential experimentation. While still in its infancy, Bayesian optimization has recently gained traction in bioprocess engineering. However, experimentation with biological systems is highly complex and the resulting experimental uncertainty requires specific extensions to classical Bayesian optimization. Moreover, current literature often targets readers with a strong statistical background, limiting its accessibility for practitioners.
  In light of these developments, this review has two aims: first, to provide an intuitive and practical introduction to Bayesian optimization; and second, to outline promising application areas and open algorithmic challenges, thereby highlighting opportunities for future research in machine learning.</description>

      <title>MDNS: Masked Diffusion Neural Sampler via Stochastic Optimal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from discrete state spaces where the target probability mass function $\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning, combinatorial optimization, etc. To better address this challenging task when the state space has a large cardinality and the distribution is multi-modal, we propose $\textbf{M}$asked $\textbf{D}$iffusion $\textbf{N}$eural $\textbf{S}$ampler ($\textbf{MDNS}$), a novel framework for training discrete neural samplers by aligning two path measures through a family of learning objectives, theoretically grounded in the stochastic optimal control of the continuous-time Markov chains. We validate the efficiency and scalability of MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and potential of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fairness in Autoencoders for Node-Level Graph Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks (GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements. However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed, GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data, potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection. To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose \textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Tlhey/decaf_code.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Data Reduction Criteria for Online Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty. However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior. The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets, including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP algorithm.</description>

      <title>Continuous Parallel Relaxation for Finding Diverse Solutions in Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding the optimal solution is often the primary goal in combinatorial optimization (CO). However, real-world applications frequently require diverse solutions rather than a single optimum, particularly in two key scenarios. The first scenario occurs in real-world applications where strictly enforcing every constraint is neither necessary nor desirable. Allowing minor constraint violations can often lead to more cost-effective solutions. This is typically achieved by incorporating the constraints as penalty terms in the objective function, which requires careful tuning of penalty parameters. The second scenario involves cases where CO formulations tend to oversimplify complex real-world factors, such as domain knowledge, implicit trade-offs, or ethical considerations. To address these challenges, generating (i) penalty-diversified solutions by varying penalty intensities and (ii) variation-diversified solutions with distinct structural characteristics provides valuable insights, enabling practitioners to post-select the most suitable solution for their specific needs. However, efficiently discovering these diverse solutions is more challenging than finding a single optimal one. This study introduces Continual Parallel Relaxation Annealing (CPRA), a computationally efficient framework for unsupervised-learning (UL)-based CO solvers that generates diverse solutions within a single training run. CPRA leverages representation learning and parallelization to automatically discover shared representations, substantially accelerating the search for these diverse solutions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that CPRA outperforms existing UL-based solvers in generating these diverse solutions while significantly reducing computational costs.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis Spaces for Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hypothesis space for deep learning based on deep neural networks (DNNs). By treating a DNN as a function of two variables - the input variable and the parameter variable - we consider the set of DNNs where the parameter variable belongs to a space of weight matrices and biases determined by a prescribed depth and layer widths. To construct a Banach space of functions of the input variable, we take the weak* closure of the linear span of this DNN set. We prove that the resulting Banach space is a reproducing kernel Banach space (RKBS) and explicitly construct its reproducing kernel. Furthermore, we investigate two learning models - regularized learning and the minimum norm interpolation (MNI) problem - within the RKBS framework by establishing representer theorems. These theorems reveal that the solutions to these learning problems can be expressed as a finite sum of kernel expansions based on training data.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Unification of Distributionally Robust Covariance Estimators: Shrinking the Spectrum by Inflating the Ambiguity Set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art methods for estimating high-dimensional covariance matrices all shrink the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix towards a data-insensitive shrinkage target. The underlying shrinkage transformation is either chosen heuristically - without compelling theoretical justification - or optimally in view of restrictive distributional assumptions. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to construct covariance estimators without imposing restrictive assumptions. That is, we study distributionally robust covariance estimation problems that minimize the worst-case Frobenius error with respect to all data distributions close to a nominal distribution, where the proximity of distributions is measured via a divergence on the space of covariance matrices. We identify mild conditions on this divergence under which the resulting minimizers represent shrinkage estimators. We show that the corresponding shrinkage transformations are intimately related to the geometrical properties of the underlying divergence. We also prove that our robust estimators are efficiently computable and asymptotically consistent and that they enjoy finite-sample performance guarantees. We exemplify our general methodology by synthesizing explicit estimators induced by the Kullback-Leibler, Fisher-Rao, and Wasserstein divergences. Numerical experiments based on synthetic and real data show that our robust estimators are competitive with state-of-the-art estimators.</description>

Abstract: Large-scale streaming data are common in modern machine learning applications and have led to the development of online learning algorithms. Many fields, such as supply chain management, weather and meteorology, energy markets, and finance, have pivoted towards using probabilistic forecasts. This results in the need not only for accurate learning of the expected value but also for learning the conditional heteroskedasticity and conditional moments. Against this backdrop, we present a methodology for online estimation of regularized, linear distributional models. The proposed algorithm is based on a combination of recent developments for the online estimation of LASSO models and the well-known GAMLSS framework. We provide a case study on day-ahead electricity price forecasting, in which we show the competitive performance of the incremental estimation combined with strongly reduced computational effort. Our algorithms are implemented in a computationally efficient Python package ondil.</description>

      <title>Sharp Generalization for Nonparametric Regression in Interpolation Space by Over-Parameterized Neural Networks Trained with Preconditioned Gradient Descent and Early-Stopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonparametric regression using an over-parameterized two-layer neural networks trained with algorithmic guarantees in this paper. We consider the setting where the training features are drawn uniformly from the unit sphere in $\RR^d$, and the target function lies in an interpolation space commonly studied in statistical learning theory. We demonstrate that training the neural network with a novel Preconditioned Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm, equipped with early stopping, achieves a sharp regression rate of $\cO(n^{-\frac{2\alpha s'}{2\alpha s'+1}})$ when the target function is in the interpolation space $\bth{\cH_K}^{s'}$ with $s' \ge 3$. This rate is even sharper than the currently known nearly-optimal rate of $\cO(n^{-\frac{2\alpha s'}{2\alpha s'+1}})\log^2(1/\delta)$, where $n$ is the size of the training data and $\delta \in (0,1)$ is a small probability. This rate is also sharper than the standard kernel regression rate of $\cO(n^{-\frac{2\alpha}{2\alpha+1}})$ obtained under the regular Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime when training the neural network with the vanilla gradient descent (GD), where $2\alpha = d/(d-1)$. Our analysis is based on two key technical contributions. First, we present a principled decomposition of the network output at each PGD step into a function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of a newly induced integral kernel, and a residual function with small $L^{\infty}$-norm. Second, leveraging this decomposition, we apply local Rademacher complexity theory to tightly control the complexity of the function class comprising all the neural network functions obtained in the PGD iterates. Our results further suggest that PGD enables the neural network to escape the linear NTK regime and achieve improved generalization, as it effectively induces a new kernel termed the integral kernel, compared to the regular NTK arising from the vanilla GD.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Learning-to-Defer Approach for Multi-Task Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15729v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Two-Stage Learning-to-Defer (L2D) framework has been extensively studied for classification and, more recently, regression tasks. However, many real-world applications require solving both tasks jointly in a multi-task setting. We introduce a novel Two-Stage L2D framework for multi-task learning that integrates classification and regression through a unified deferral mechanism. Our method leverages a two-stage surrogate loss family, which we prove to be both Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{R})$-consistent, ensuring convergence to the Bayes-optimal rejector. We derive explicit consistency bounds tied to the cross-entropy surrogate and the $L_1$-norm of agent-specific costs, and extend minimizability gap analysis to the multi-expert two-stage regime. We also make explicit how shared representation learning -- commonly used in multi-task models -- affects these consistency guarantees. Experiments on object detection and electronic health record analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the limitations of existing L2D methods in multi-task scenarios.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness in Two-Stage Learning-to-Defer: Algorithms and Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-stage Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables optimal task delegation by assigning each input to either a fixed main model or one of several offline experts, supporting reliable decision-making in complex, multi-agent environments. However, existing L2D frameworks assume clean inputs and are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that can manipulate query allocation--causing costly misrouting or expert overload. We present the first comprehensive study of adversarial robustness in two-stage L2D systems. We introduce two novel attack strategie--untargeted and targeted--which respectively disrupt optimal allocations or force queries to specific agents. To defend against such threats, we propose SARD, a convex learning algorithm built on a family of surrogate losses that are provably Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$-consistent. These guarantees hold across classification, regression, and multi-task settings. Empirical results demonstrate that SARD significantly improves robustness under adversarial attacks while maintaining strong clean performance, marking a critical step toward secure and trustworthy L2D deployment.</description>

      <title>Hyperflux: Pruning Reveals the Importance of Weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network pruning is used to reduce inference latency and power consumption in large neural networks. However, most existing methods use ad-hoc heuristics, lacking much insight and justified mainly by empirical results. We introduce Hyperflux, a conceptually grounded L0 pruning approach that estimates each weight's importance through its flux, the gradient's response to the weight's removal. A global pressure term continuously drives all weights toward pruning, with those critical for accuracy being automatically regrown based on their flux. We postulate several properties that naturally follow from our framework and experimentally validate each of them. One such property is the relationship between final sparsity and pressure, for which we derive a generalized scaling-law equation that is used to design our sparsity-controlling scheduler. Empirically, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results with ResNet-50 and VGG-19 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.</description>

      <title>MIRRAMS: Learning Robust Tabular Models under Unseen Missingness Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of missing values often reflects variations in data collection policies, which may shift across time or locations, even when the underlying feature distribution remains stable. Such shifts in the missingness distribution between training and test inputs pose a significant challenge to achieving robust predictive performance. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning framework designed to address this challenge, particularly in the common yet challenging scenario where the test-time dataset is unseen. We begin by introducing a set of mutual information-based conditions, called MI robustness conditions, which guide the prediction model to extract label-relevant information. This promotes robustness against distributional shifts in missingness at test-time. To enforce these conditions, we design simple yet effective loss terms that collectively define our final objective, called MIRRAMS. Importantly, our method does not rely on any specific missingness assumption such as MCAR, MAR, or MNAR, making it applicable to a broad range of scenarios. Furthermore, it can naturally extend to cases where labels are also missing in training data, by generalizing the framework to a semi-supervised learning setting. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark tabular datasets demonstrate that MIRRAMS consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines and maintains stable performance under diverse missingness conditions. Moreover, it achieves superior performance even in fully observed settings, highlighting MIRRAMS as a powerful, off-the-shelf framework for general-purpose tabular learning.</description>

      <title>Improved Regularization and Robustness for Fine-tuning in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.04578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A widely used algorithm for transfer learning is fine-tuning, where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a target task with a small amount of labeled data. When the capacity of the pre-trained model is significantly larger than the size of the target dataset, fine-tuning is prone to overfitting and memorizing the training labels. Hence, a crucial question is to regularize fine-tuning and ensure its robustness against noise. To address this question, we begin by analyzing the generalization properties of fine-tuning. We present a PAC-Bayes generalization bound that depends on the distance traveled in each layer during fine-tuning and the noise stability of the fine-tuned model. We empirically measure these quantities. Based on the analysis, we propose regularized self-labeling -- the interpolation between regularization and self-labeling methods, including (i) layer-wise regularization to constrain the distance traveled in each layer; (ii) self-label-correction and label-reweighting to correct mislabeled data points (that the model is confident) and reweight less confident data points. We validate our approach on an extensive collection of image and text datasets using multiple pre-trained model architectures. Our approach improves baseline methods by 1.76% (on average) for seven image classification tasks and 0.75% for a few-shot classification task. When the target data set includes noisy labels, our approach outperforms baseline methods by an average of 3.56% in two noisy settings.</description>

      <title>Minimax Optimality in Contextual Dynamic Pricing with General Valuation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study contextual dynamic pricing, where a decision maker posts personalized prices based on observable contexts and receives binary purchase feedback indicating whether the customer's valuation exceeds the price. Each valuation is modeled as an unknown latent function of the context, corrupted by independent and identically distributed market noise from an unknown distribution. Relying only on Lipschitz continuity of the noise distribution and bounded valuations, we propose a minimax-optimal algorithm. To accommodate the unknown distribution, our method discretizes the relevant noise range to form a finite set of candidate prices, then applies layered data partitioning to obtain confidence bounds substantially tighter than those derived via the elliptical-potential lemma. A key advantage is that estimation bias in the valuation function cancels when comparing upper confidence bounds, eliminating the need to know the Lipschitz constant. The framework extends beyond linear models to general function classes through offline regression oracles. Our regret analysis depends solely on the oracle's estimation error, typically governed by the statistical complexity of the class. These techniques yield a regret upper bound matching the minimax lower bound up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, we refine these guarantees under additional structures -- e.g., linear valuation models, second-order smoothness, sparsity, and known noise distribution or observable valuations -- and compare our bounds and assumptions with prior dynamic-pricing methods. Finally, numerical experiments corroborate the theory and show clear improvements over benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>A Parametric Contextual Online Learning Theory of Brokerage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the role of contextual information in the online learning problem of brokerage between traders. In this sequential problem, at each time step, two traders arrive with secret valuations about an asset they wish to trade. The learner (a broker) suggests a trading (or brokerage) price based on contextual data about the asset and the market conditions. Then, the traders reveal their willingness to buy or sell based on whether their valuations are higher or lower than the brokerage price. A trade occurs if one of the two traders decides to buy and the other to sell, i.e., if the broker's proposed price falls between the smallest and the largest of their two valuations. We design algorithms for this problem and prove optimal theoretical regret guarantees under various standard assumptions.</description>

      <title>Tuning-Free Online Robust Principal Component Analysis through Implicit Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of the standard Online Robust Principal Component Analysis (OR-PCA) technique depends on the optimum tuning of the explicit regularizers and this tuning is dataset sensitive. We aim to remove the dependency on these tuning parameters by using implicit regularization. We propose to use the implicit regularization effect of various modified gradient descents to make OR-PCA tuning free. Our method incorporates three different versions of modified gradient descent that separately but naturally encourage sparsity and low-rank structures in the data. The proposed method performs comparable or better than the tuned OR-PCA for both simulated and real-world datasets. Tuning-free ORPCA makes it more scalable for large datasets since we do not require dataset-dependent parameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks Generalize on Low Complexity Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12446v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation generalize on low complexity data, suitably defined. Given i.i.d.~data generated from a simple programming language, the minimum description length (MDL) feedforward neural network which interpolates the data generalizes with high probability. We define this simple programming language, along with a notion of description length of such networks. We provide several examples on basic computational tasks, such as checking primality of a natural number. For primality testing, our theorem shows the following and more. Suppose that we draw an i.i.d.~sample of $n$ numbers uniformly at random from $1$ to $N$. For each number $x_i$, let $y_i = 1$ if $x_i$ is a prime and $0$ if it is not. Then, the interpolating MDL network accurately answers, with error probability $1- O((\ln N)/n)$, whether a newly drawn number between $1$ and $N$ is a prime or not. Note that the network is not designed to detect primes; minimum description learning discovers a network which does so. Extensions to noisy data are also discussed, suggesting that MDL neural network interpolators can demonstrate tempered overfitting.</description>

      <title>Responsible Machine Learning via Mixed-Integer Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last few decades, Machine Learning (ML) has achieved significant success across domains ranging from healthcare, sustainability, and the social sciences, to criminal justice and finance. But its deployment in increasingly sophisticated, critical, and sensitive areas affecting individuals, the groups they belong to, and society as a whole raises critical concerns around fairness, transparency and robustness, among others. As the complexity and scale of ML systems and of the settings in which they are deployed grow, so does the need for responsible ML methods that address these challenges while providing guaranteed performance in deployment.
  Mixed-integer optimization (MIO) offers a powerful framework for embedding responsible ML considerations directly into the learning process while maintaining performance. For example, it enables learning of inherently transparent models that can conveniently incorporate fairness or other domain specific constraints. This tutorial paper provides an accessible and comprehensive introduction to this topic discussing both theoretical and practical aspects. It outlines some of the core principles of responsible ML, their importance in applications, and the practical utility of MIO for building ML models that align with these principles. Through examples and mathematical formulations, it illustrates practical strategies and available tools for efficiently solving MIO problems for responsible ML. It concludes with a discussion on current limitations and open research questions, providing suggestions for future work.</description>

      <title>Identifying Causal Direction via Variational Bayesian Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07503v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Telling apart the cause and effect between two random variables with purely observational data is a challenging problem that finds applications in various scientific disciplines. A key principle utilized in this task is the algorithmic Markov condition, which postulates that the joint distribution, when factorized according to the causal direction, yields a more succinct codelength compared to the anti-causal direction. Previous approaches approximate these codelengths by relying on simple functions or Gaussian processes (GPs) with easily evaluable complexity, compromising between model fitness and computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose leveraging the variational Bayesian learning of neural networks as an interpretation of the codelengths. This allows the improvement of model fitness, while maintaining the succinctness of the codelengths, and the avoidance of the significant computational complexity of the GP-based approaches. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks in cause-effect identification demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, showing promising performance enhancements on several datasets in comparison to most related methods.</description>

      <title>Curse of High Dimensionality Issue in Transformer for Long-context Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22107v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language processing tasks by capturing long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms. However, long-context modeling faces significant computational inefficiencies due to \textit{redundant} attention computations: while attention weights are often \textit{sparse}, all tokens consume \textit{equal} computational resources. In this paper, we reformulate traditional probabilistic sequence modeling as a \textit{supervised learning task}, enabling the separation of relevant and irrelevant tokens and providing a clearer understanding of redundancy. Based on this reformulation, we theoretically analyze attention sparsity, revealing that only a few tokens significantly contribute to predictions. Building on this, we formulate attention optimization as a linear coding problem and propose a \textit{group coding strategy}, theoretically showing its ability to improve robustness against random noise and enhance learning efficiency. Motivated by this, we propose \textit{Dynamic Group Attention} (DGA), which leverages the group coding to explicitly reduce redundancy by aggregating less important tokens during attention computation. Empirical results show that our DGA significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining competitive performance.Code is available at https://github.com/bolixinyu/DynamicGroupAttention.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Random Time Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the standard reinforcement learning framework to random time horizons. While the classical setting typically assumes finite and deterministic or infinite runtimes of trajectories, we argue that multiple real-world applications naturally exhibit random (potentially trajectory-dependent) stopping times. Since those stopping times typically depend on the policy, their randomness has an effect on policy gradient formulas, which we (mostly for the first time) derive rigorously in this work both for stochastic and deterministic policies. We present two complementary perspectives, trajectory or state-space based, and establish connections to optimal control theory. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that using the proposed formulas can significantly improve optimization convergence compared to traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>Optimistic critics can empower small actors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Actor-critic methods have been central to many of the recent advances in deep reinforcement learning. The most common approach is to use symmetric architectures, whereby both actor and critic have the same network topology and number of parameters. However, recent works have argued for the advantages of asymmetric setups, specifically with the use of smaller actors. We perform broad empirical investigations and analyses to better understand the implications of this and find that, in general, smaller actors result in performance degradation and overfit critics. Our analyses suggest poor data collection, due to value underestimation, as one of the main causes for this behavior, and further highlight the crucial role the critic can play in alleviating this pathology. We explore techniques to mitigate the observed value underestimation, which enables further research in asymmetric actor-critic methods.</description>

      <title>MAP Estimation with Denoisers: Convergence Rates and Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denoiser models have become powerful tools for inverse problems, enabling the use of pretrained networks to approximate the score of a smoothed prior distribution. These models are often used in heuristic iterative schemes aimed at solving Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) optimisation problems, where the proximal operator of the negative log-prior plays a central role. In practice, this operator is intractable, and practitioners plug in a pretrained denoiser as a surrogate-despite the lack of general theoretical justification for this substitution. In this work, we show that a simple algorithm, closely related to several used in practice, provably converges to the proximal operator under a log-concavity assumption on the prior $p$. We show that this algorithm can be interpreted as a gradient descent on smoothed proximal objectives. Our analysis thus provides a theoretical foundation for a class of empirically successful but previously heuristic methods.</description>
