      <title>Attosecond Time Delays at Cooper Minima in Valence-Shell Photoionization of Alkali and Alkaline-Earth Metal Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ji etal [New J. Phys. 26, 093014 (2024)] established a direct link between the photoionization cross section and the attosecond time delay near Cooper minima (CM) in the valence shells of noble-gas atoms. This link is based on the analytic properties of the ionization amplitude in the complex plane of the photoelectron energy, and is particularly sensitive to the winding number of the amplitude around the origin of the complex energy plane. Here, we demonstrate an analogous relation for photoionization of the valence $ns$ shells of alkali-metal atoms (AMA), from Na ($n=3$) to Cs ($n=6$), as well as alkaline-earth-metal atoms (AEMA), from Mg ($n=3$) to Ba ($n=6$). To this end, we employ a fully relativistic formalism that separates the two complementary $ns_{1/2} \to Ep_{1/2}$ and $Ep_{3/2}$ ionization channels. Each of these channels exhibits a phase variation close to $\pi$, but in opposite directions, near their respective Cooper minima. This phase variation vanishes in a nonrelativistic formulation, where the two channels become degenerate. For AMA, due to the threshold proximity of the CM, the universal Coulomb contribution to the time delay must be subtracted. The remaining component of the time delay is target-specific, angular-dependent, and accessible through comparative measurements.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamical resonance displacement from strongly driven cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold atoms are promising platforms for metrology and quantum computation, yet their many-body dynamics remains largely unexplored. We here investigate Rabi oscillations from optically-thick cold clouds, driven by high-intensity coherent light. A dynamical displacement from the atomic resonance is predicted, which can be detected through the collective Rabi oscillations of the atomic ensemble. Different from linear-optics shifts, this dynamical displacement grows quadratically with the optical depth, yet it reduces with increasing pump power as dipole-dipole interactions are less effective. This modification may be particularly important for Ramsey spectroscopy, when strong pulses and optically dense samples are used.</description>

      <title>Loading and Imaging Atom Arrays via Electromagnetically Induced Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arrays of neutral atoms present a promising system for quantum computing, quantum sensors, and other applications, several of which would profit from the ability to load, cool, and image the atoms in a finite magnetic field. In this work, we develop a technique to image and prepare $^{87}$Rb atom arrays in a finite magnetic field by combining EIT cooling with fluorescence imaging. We achieve 99.6(3)% readout fidelity at 98.2(3)% survival probability and up to 68(2)% single-atom stochastic loading probability. We further develop a model to predict the survival probability, which also agrees well with several other atom array experiments. Our technique cools both the axial and radial directions, and will enable future continuously-operated neutral atom quantum processors and quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Geometric interpretation of the hyperfine Breit--Rabi solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometric interpretation of the hyperfine Breit--Rabi eigenvalues and eigenvectors in alkali atoms after reformulating the standard solution into a compact form. In this picture, the nuclear magnetic moment has a polar angle fixed by the total projection quantum number. In contrast, the electron magnetic moment anti-aligns or aligns with an effective field formed by both the external magnetic flux density and the nuclear field, which simultaneously sets the mixing angle of the eigenvectors. This geometric view offers intuitive insight into the structure of the solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a mathematical analysis of time-dependent $N$-body electronic systems and establish mixed regularity for the corresponding wavefunctions. Based on this, we develop sparse grid approximations to reduce computational complexity, including a sparse grid Gaussian-type orbital (GTO) scheme. We validate the approach on the Helium atom (${\rm He}$) and Hydrogen molecule (${\rm H}_2$), showing that sparse grid GTOs offer an efficient alternative to full grid discretizations.</description>

      <title>Temperature and mean axial momentum vs. laser intensity of electrons released from O$_2$ by an 800 nm ultrashort pulsed laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A semi-empirical model is presented for the thermalized temperature $T$ and mean momentum in the direction of laser propagation &lt;$p_{fz}$&gt; of electrons released from O$_{2}$ after the passage of a focused $800$ nm ultrashort pulsed laser pulse vs. peak laser intensity $I_{0}$ to provide initial conditions for electrodynamic fluid simulations. For this, theoretical kinetic energy spectra in different directions are modified with two adjustable parameters representing the effects of electron rescatter off its parent ion during the optical cycle subsequent to ionization. The classical kinematics of rescatter, in conjunction with the spectral fits, is used to estimate &lt;$p_{fz}$&gt;.</description>

      <title>Rydberg atom reception of a handheld UHF frequency-modulated two-way radio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms, due to their large polarizabilities and strong transition dipole moments, have been utilized as sensitive electric field sensors. While their capability to detect modulated signals has been previously demonstrated, these studies have largely been limited to laboratory-generated signals tailored specifically for atomic detection. Here, we extend the practical applicability of Rydberg sensors by demonstrating the reception of real-world frequency-modulated (FM) audio transmissions using a consumer-grade handheld two-way radio operating in the UHF band. Detection is based on the AC Stark shift induced by the radio signal in a Rydberg atomic vapor, with demodulation performed using an offset local oscillator and lock-in amplification. We successfully demodulate speech signals and evaluate the audio spectral response and reception range. We show that all consumer-accessible radio channels can be simultaneously detected, and demonstrate simultaneous reception of two neighboring channels with at least 53 dB of isolation. This work underscores the potential of Rydberg atom-based receivers for practical, real-world FM signal detection.</description>

      <title>Letter of Intent: AICE - 100m Atom Interferometer Experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11867v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an O(100)m Atom Interferometer (AI) experiment - AICE - to be installed against a wall of the PX46 access shaft to the LHC. This experiment would probe unexplored ranges of the possible couplings of bosonic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) to atomic constituents and undertake a pioneering search for gravitational waves (GWs) at frequencies intermediate between those to which existing and planned experiments are sensitive, among other fundamental physics studies. A conceptual feasibility study showed that this AI experiment could be isolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and surveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no technical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that the preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and installation of an elevator platform could be carried out during LS3, allowing installation and operation of the AICE detector to proceed during Run 4 without impacting HL-LHC operation. These studies have established that PX46 is a uniquely promising location for an AI experiment. We foresee that, if the CERN management encourages this Letter of Intent, a significant fraction of the Terrestrial Very Long Baseline Atom Interferometer (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration may wish to contribute to AICE.</description>

      <title>High-capacity associative memory in a quantum-optical spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield model describes a neural network that stores memories using all-to-all-coupled spins. Memory patterns are recalled under equilibrium dynamics. Storing too many patterns breaks the associative recall process because frustration causes an exponential number of spurious patterns to arise as the network becomes a spin glass. Despite this, memory recall in a spin glass can be restored, and even enhanced, under quantum-optical nonequilibrium dynamics because spurious patterns can now serve as reliable memories. We experimentally observe associative memory with high storage capacity in a driven-dissipative spin glass made of atoms and photons. The capacity surpasses the Hopfield limit by up to seven-fold in a sixteen-spin network. Atomic motion boosts capacity by dynamically modifying connectivity akin to short-term synaptic plasticity in neural networks, realizing a precursor to learning in a quantum-optical system.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium critical scaling and universality in a quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universality and scaling laws are hallmarks of equilibrium phase transitions and critical phenomena. However, extending these concepts to non-equilibrium systems is an outstanding challenge. Despite recent progress in the study of dynamical phases, the universality classes and scaling laws for non-equilibrium phenomena are far less understood than those in equilibrium. In this work, using a trapped-ion quantum simulator with single-spin resolution, we investigate the non-equilibrium nature of critical fluctuations following a quantum quench to the critical point. We probe the scaling of spin fluctuations after a series of quenches to the critical Hamiltonian of a long-range Ising model. With systems of up to 50 spins, we show that the amplitude and timescale of the post-quench fluctuations scale with system size with distinct universal critical exponents, depending on the quench protocol. While a generic quench can lead to thermal critical behavior, we find that a second quench from one critical state to another (i.e.~a double quench) results in a new universal non-equilibrium behavior, identified by a set of critical exponents distinct from their equilibrium counterparts. Our results demonstrate the ability of quantum simulators to explore universal scaling beyond equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Squeezing atomic $p$-orbital condensates for detecting gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting the faint signal of continuous gravitational waves (CWs) stands as a major frontier in gravitational-wave astronomy, pushing the need for detectors whose sensitivity exceeds the standard quantum limit (SQL). Here, we propose an orbital optomechanical (OOM) sensor that exploits the sensitive coupling of an orbitally squeezed $p$-orbital Bose-Einstein condensate to spacetime distortions, enabling the detection of interferometer phase shifts induced by CWs. This sensor achieves a theoretical quantum-noise-limited sensitivity 16 dB below the SQL while reducing the required laser power by five orders of magnitude. The performance arises from a novel noise trade-off: a counter-propagating readout scheme suppresses photonic shot noise, while orbital squeezing minimizes the remaining atomic projection noise. By leveraging quantum control over atomic orbital degrees of freedom, this approach establishes a new framework for interferometric sensing with direct applications to the search for CWs and ultralight dark matter.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian dynamics of generation of bound states in the continuum via single-photon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The excitation of bound states in the continuum (BICs) in two- or multi-qubit systems lies at the heart of entanglement generation and harnessing in Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics platforms. However, the generation of qubit pair BICs through single-photon scattering is hindered by the fact that these states are effectively decoupled from propagating photons. We prove that scattering of a parity-invariant single photon on a qubit pair, combined with a properly engineered time variation of the qubit detuning, is not only feasible, but also more effective than strategies based on the relaxation of the excited states of the qubits when the distance between the qubits gives rise to non-negligible photon delays (non-Markovian regime). The use of tensor network methods to simulate the proposed scheme enables to include such photon delays in collision models, thus opening the possibility to follow the time evolution of the full quantum system, including qubits and field, and to efficiently implement and characterize the dynamics hence identifying optimal working points for the BIC generation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Charge and Exciton Transfer in Multi-mode Models using Engineered Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model. Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its non-equilibrium dynamics. We continuously tune the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by controlling the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of one additional vibration introduces interfering vibrationally assisted pathways and reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.</description>
