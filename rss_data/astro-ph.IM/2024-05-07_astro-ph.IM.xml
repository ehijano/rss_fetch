      <title>Design and Performance of 30/40 GHz Diplexed Focal Plane for BICEP Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a wide-band diplexed focal plane suitable for observing low-frequency foregrounds that are important for cosmic microwave background polarimetry. The antenna elements are composed of slotted bowtie antennas with 60% bandwidth that can be partitioned into two bands. Each pixel is composed of two interleaved 12$\times$12 pairs of linearly polarized antenna elements forming a phased array, designed to synthesize a symmetric beam with no need for focusing optics. The signal from each antenna element is captured in-phase and uniformly weighted by a microstrip summing tree. The antenna signal is diplexed into two bands through the use of two complementary, six-pole Butterworth filters. This filter architecture ensures a contiguous impedance match at all frequencies, and thereby achieves minimal reflection loss between both bands. Subsequently, out-of-band rejection is increased with a bandpass filter and the signal is then deposited on a transition-edge sensor bolometer island. We demonstrate the performance of this focal plane with two distinct bands, 30 and 40 GHz, each with a bandwidth of $\sim$20 and 15 GHz, respectively. The unequal bandwidths between the two bands are caused by an unintentional shift in diplexer frequency from its design values. The end-to-end optical efficiency of these detectors are relatively modest, at 20-30%, with an efficiency loss due to an unknown impedance mismatch in the summing tree. Far-field beam maps show good optical characteristics with edge pixels having no more than $\sim$ 5% ellipticity and $\sim$10-15% peak-to-peak differences for A-B polarization pairs.</description>

      <title>Modeling and performance analysis of Implicit Electric Field Conjugation with two deformable mirrors applied to the Roman Coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order wavefront sensing and control (HOWFSC) is key to create a dark hole region within the coronagraphic image plane where high contrasts are achieved. The Roman Coronagraph is expected to perform its HOWFSC with a ground-in-the-loop scheme due to the computational complexity of the Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) algorithm. This scheme provides the flexibility to alter the HOWFSC algorithm for given science objectives. The baseline HOWFSC scheme involves running EFC while observing a bright star such as {\zeta} Puppis to create the initial dark hole followed by a slew to the science target. The new implicit EFC (iEFC) algorithm removes the optical diffraction model from the controller, making the final contrast independent of model accuracy. While previously demonstrated with a single DM, iEFC is extended to two deformable mirror systems in order to create annular dark holes. The algorithm is then applied to the Wide-Field-of-View Shaped Pupil Coronagraph (SPC-WFOV) mode designed for the Roman Space Telescope using end-to-end physical optics models. Initial monochromatic simulations demonstrate the efficacy of iEFC as well as the optimal choice of modes for the SPC-WFOV instrument. Further simulations with a 3.6% wavefront control bandpass and a broader 10% bandpass then demonstrate that iEFC can be used in broadband scenarios to achieve contrasts below 1E-8 with Roman. Finally, an EMCCD model is implemented to estimate calibration times and predict the controller's performance. Here, 1E-8 contrasts are achieved with a calibration time of about 6.8 hours assuming the reference star is {\zeta} Puppis. The results here indicate that iEFC can be a valid HOWFSC method that can mitigate the risk of model errors associated with space-borne coronagraphs, but to maximize iEFC performance, lengthy calibration times will be required to mitigate the noise accumulated during calibration.</description>

      <title>A design method of an ultra wideband and easy-to-array Magic-T: A 6-14 GHz scaled model for a mm/submm camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We established a design method for a Magic-T with a single-layer dielectric/metal structure suitable for both wideband and multi-element applications for millimeter and submillimeter wave imaging observations. The design method was applied to a Magic-T with a coupled-line, stubs, and single-stage impedance transformers in a frequency-scaled model (6-14 GHz) that is relatively easy to demonstrate through manufacturing and evaluation. The major problem is that using the conventional perfect matching condition for a coupled-line alone produces an impractically large width coplanar coupled-line (CPCL) to satisfy the desired bandwidth ratio. In our study, by removing this constraint and optimizing impedances utilizing a circuit simulator with high computation speed, we found a solution with a $\sim$ 180 $\rm \mu$m wide CPCL, which is approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the conventional analytical solution. Furthermore, considering the effect of transition discontinuities in the transmission lines, we optimized the line length and obtained a design solution with return loss &lt; -20 dB, amplitude imbalance &lt; 0.1 dB, and phase imbalance &lt; 0.5$^\circ$ from 6.1 GHz to 14.1 GHz.</description>

      <title>RTModel: a platform for real-time modeling and massive analysis of microlensing events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microlensing of stars in our Galaxy has long been used to detect and characterize stellar populations, exoplanets, brown dwarfs, stellar remnants and whatever objects may magnify the source stars with their gravitational fields. The interpretation of microlensing light curves is relatively simple for single lenses and single sources but becomes more and more complicated if we add more objects and take their relative motion into account. RTModel is a modeling platform that has been very active in the real-time investigation of microlensing events, providing preliminary models that have proven very useful for driving follow-up resources towards the most interesting events. The success of RTModel is due to the ability to make a thorough and aimed exploration of the parameter space in a relatively short time. This is obtained by three key ideas: the initial conditions are chosen from a template library including all possible caustic crossing and approaches; the fits are performed by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm using a bumper mechanism to explore multiple minima; the basic computations of microlensing magnification are performed by the fast and robust VBBinaryLensing package. In this paper we will illustrate all algorithms in RTModel in detail, with the purpose of fostering new ideas in view of future microlensing pipelines aimed at massive microlensing analysis.</description>

      <title>Optical Photon Emission in Extended Airshowers -- Hybrid computing in the context of CORSIKA 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the motivation to improve experimental gains and precision, established astroparticle experiments are currently undergoing massive upgrades. In addition, several new experiments are being built or planned. With the resulting gain in observational quality, the amount and accuracy of simulated data required for the analysis is also rising. In order to meet the increasing requirements and complexity due to the experiments' growth and to provide a unified software ecosystem, it was decided to re-develop the de facto standard extensive air shower simulation CORSIKA completely in C++ based on the original Fortran code. Since one of the largest runtime consumers is the propagation of millions of optical Cherenkov and fluorescence photons, and many experiments are starting to use them for measurements, it was decided to develop hardware-accelerated code to speed up the simulation. Specific methods have been developed to propagate photons on deep learning acceleration hardware similar to classical GPUs to take additional advantage of the current and future growth of the deep learning sector. In particular, Nvidia accelerators were tested.</description>

      <title>On-orbit Degradation of the JWST/NIRSpec Micro-Shutter Array: Multiplexing and Target Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A statistical analysis of the impact of the diminishing number of operational shutters experienced by the JWST/NIRSpec Micro Shutter Array since Commissioning is presented. It is shown that the number of high priority science targets that NIRSpec is able to observe simultaneously has so far decreased by 3.1%. Of greater concern, however, is NIRSpec's diminished ability to carry out autonomous MSATA target acquisition, which is more sensitive to the loss of shutters than is the multiplexing. In the flagship case of MSA observations of deep fields, the number of pointings at which it is not possible to reach the required minimum number of 5 Valid Reference Stars has increased from 4.9% to 6.3% and is beginning to become noticeable. Similarly, the number of higher risk target acquisitions that need to be carried out with fewer than the maximum allowed number of 8 Reference Stars has grown from 27% to 31%.</description>

      <title>TRACE: a Time-Reversible Algorithm for Close Encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present TRACE, a time-reversible hybrid integrator for the planetary N-body problem. Like hybrid symplectic integrators, TRACE can resolve close encounters between particles while retaining many of the accuracy and speed advantages of a fixed timestep symplectic method such the Wisdom-Holman map. TRACE switches methods time-reversibly during close encounters following the prescription of Hernandez and Dehnen (2023). In this paper we describe the derivation and implementation of TRACE and study its performance for a variety of astrophysical systems. In all our test cases TRACE is at least as accurate and fast as the hybrid symplectic integrator MERCURIUS. In many cases TRACE's performance is vastly superior to that of MERCURIUS. In test cases with planet-planet close encounters, TRACE is as accurate as MECURIUS with a 13x speedup. If close encounters with the central star are considered, TRACE achieves good error performance while MERCURIUS fails to give qualitatively correct results. In ensemble tests of violent scattering systems, TRACE matches the high-accuracy IAS15 while providing a 20x speed-up. In large N systems simulating lunar accretion, TRACE qualitatively gives the same results as IAS15 but at a 47x speedup. We also discuss some cases such as von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles where hybrid integrators perform poorly and provide some guidance on which integrator to use for which system. TRACE is freely available within the REBOUND package.</description>

      <title>Energy and temperature dependencies for electron-induced sputtering from H$_2$O-ice: Implications for the icy Galilean moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To better assess the role that electrons play in exosphere production on icy-rich bodies, we measured the total and O$_2$ sputtering yields from H$_2$O-ice for electrons with energies between 0.75 and 10 keV and temperatures between 15 and 124.5 K. We find that both total and O$_2$ yields increase with decreasing energy over our studied range, increase rapidly at temperatures above 60 K, and that the relative amount of H$_2$O in the sputtered flux decreases quickly with increasing energy. Combining our data with other electron data in literature, we show that the accuracy of a widely used sputtering model can be improved significantly for electrons by adjusting some of the intrinsic parameter values. Applying our results to Europa, we estimate that electrons contribute to the production of the O$_2$ exosphere equally to all ion types combined. In contrast, sputtering of O$_2$ from Ganymede and Callisto appears to be dominated by irradiating ions, though electrons still likely contribute a non-negligible amount. While our estimates could be further refined by examining the importance of spatial variations in electron flux, we conclude that, at the very least, electrons seem to be important for exosphere production on icy surfaces and should be included in future modeling efforts.</description>

      <title>A MeerKAT Polarization Survey of Southern Calibration Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on full-Stokes L-band observations of 98 MeerKAT calibration sources. Linear polarization is detected in 71 objects above a fractional level of 0.2\%. We identify ten sources with strong fractional linear polarization and low Faraday Rotation Measure that could be suitable for wide-band absolute polarization calibration. We detect significant circular polarization from 24\% of the sample down to a detection level of 0.07\%. Circularly polarized emission is seen only for flat spectrum sources $\alpha &gt; -0.5$. We compare our polarized intensities and Faraday Synthesis results to data from the NVSS at 1400\,MHz and the ATCA SPASS survey at 2300\,MHz. NVSS data exists for 54 of our sources and SPASS data for 20 sources. The percent polarization and Rotation Measures from both surveys agree well with our results.
  The residual instrumental linear polarization for these observations is measured at 0.16\% and the residual instrumental circular polarization is measured at 0.05\%. These levels may reflect either instabilities in the relative bandpass between the two polarization channels with either time or antenna orientation, or atmospheric/ionospheric variations with pointing direction. Tracking of the hourly gain solutions on J0408-6545 after transfer of the primary gain solutions suggests a deterioration of the gain stability by a factor of several starting about two hours after sunrise. This suggests that observing during the nighttime could dramatically improve the precision of polarization calibration.</description>

      <title>Detectability of eccentric binary black holes with PyCBC and cWB pipelines during the third observing run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting binary black hole (BBH) mergers with quantifiable orbital eccentricity would confirm the existence of a dynamical formation channel for these binaries. The current state-of-the-art gravitational wave searches of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA strain data focus more on quasicircular mergers due to increased dimensionality and lack of efficient eccentric waveform models. In this work, we compare the sensitivities of two search pipelines, the matched filter-based \texttt{PyCBC} and the unmodelled coherent Wave Burst (\texttt{cWB}) algorithms towards the spinning eccentric BBH mergers, using a multipolar nonprecessing-spin eccentric signal model, \texttt{SEOBNRv4EHM}. Our findings show that neglecting eccentricity leads to missed opportunities for detecting eccentric BBH mergers, with \texttt{PyCBC} exhibiting a $10-20\, \%$ sensitivity loss for eccentricities exceeding $0.2$ defined at $10$ Hz. In contrast, \texttt{cWB} is resilient, with a $10\, \%$ sensitivity increase for heavier ($\mathcal{M} \ge 30 \, \text{M}_{\odot}$) eccentric BBH mergers, but is significantly less sensitive than \texttt{PyCBC} for lighter BBH mergers. Our fitting factor study confirmed that neglecting eccentricity biases the estimation of chirp mass, mass ratio, and effective spin parameter, skewing our understanding of astrophysical BBH populations, fundamental physics, and precision cosmology. Our results demonstrate that the current search pipelines are not sufficiently sensitive to eccentric BBH mergers, necessitating the development of a dedicated matched-filter search for these binaries. Whereas, burst searches should be optimized to detect lower chirp mass BBH mergers as eccentricity does not affect their search sensitivity significantly.</description>

      <title>The Chemical Composition of Ryugu: Prospects as a Reference Material for Solar System Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hayabusa 2 spacecraft sampled approximately 5.4 g of asteroid material from the Cb-type asteroid Ryugu. Initial analysis of the Ryugu materials revealed a mineralogical, chemical, and isotopic kinship to the CI chondrites. The pristine nature of Ryugu makes the returned samples ideal for constraining the composition of the Solar System. However, some elements (e.g., P, Ca, Mn, and rare earth elements) show large relative dispersions compared to the other elements in the returned materials studied so far, most likely due to the presence of aqueously formed secondary minerals (e.g., carbonates, phosphates) in Ryugu. Therefore, the estimation of the Solar System composition using currently available Ryugu data is challenging due to the so-called nugget effect of carbonates, phosphates, and possibly other accessory minerals. The nugget effect can be mitigated by analyzing a homogenized, relatively large amount of sample. We estimate that for approximately 0.1 g of Ryugu sample, the dispersion (2SD) of the bulk Mn/Cr and Rb/Sr ratios are +/-13% and +/-15%, respectively, while they will be improved to be better than +/-5% for approximately 1 g of homogenized Ryugu sample. To further constrain the Solar System composition and to evaluate if previous estimates based on CI chondrites stored in museums for decades to centuries are reliable, it is strongly recommended to determine the chemical and isotopic compositions of Ryugu using a homogenized sample prepared from relatively large (approx. 1 g) returned material. Determining Ryugu reference compositions will be used by multidisciplinary communities, including Earth and planetary sciences, astronomy, physics, and chemistry.</description>

      <title>FRECKLL: Full and Reduced Exoplanet Chemical Kinetics distiLLed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new Python 1D chemical kinetic code FRECKLL (Full and Reduced Exoplanet Chemical Kinetics distiLLed) to evolve large chemical networks efficiently. FRECKLL employs `distillation' in computing the reaction rates, which minimizes the error bounds to the minimum allowed by double precision values ($\epsilon \leq 10^{-15}$). Compared to summation of rates with traditional algorithms like pairwise summation, distillation provides a tenfold reduction in solver time for both full and reduced networks. Both the full and reduced Venot2020 networks are packaged in FRECKLL as well as a TauREx 3.1 plugin for usage in forward modelling and retrievals of exoplanet atmospheres. We present TauREx retrievals performed on a simulated HD189733 JWST spectra using the full and reduced Venot2020 chemical networks and demonstrate the viability of total disequilibrium chemistry retrievals and the ability for JWST to detect disequilibrium processes.</description>

      <title>HPX with Spack and Singularity Containers: Evaluating Overheads for HPX/Kokkos using an astrophysics application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cloud computing for high performance computing resources is an emerging topic. This service is of interest to researchers who care about reproducible computing, for software packages with complex installations, and for companies or researchers who need the compute resources only occasionally or do not want to run and maintain a supercomputer on their own. The connection between HPC and containers is exemplified by the fact that Microsoft Azure's Eagle cloud service machine is number three on the November 23 Top 500 list. For cloud services, the HPC application and dependencies are installed in containers, e.g. Docker, Singularity, or something else, and these containers are executed on the physical hardware. Although containerization leverages the existing Linux kernel and should not impose overheads on the computation, there is the possibility that machine-specific optimizations might be lost, particularly machine-specific installs of commonly used packages. In this paper, we will use an astrophysics application using HPX-Kokkos and measure overheads on homogeneous resources, e.g. Supercomputer Fugaku, using CPUs only and on heterogenous resources, e.g. LSU's hybrid CPU and GPU system. We will report on challenges in compiling, running, and using the containers as well as performance performance differences.</description>
