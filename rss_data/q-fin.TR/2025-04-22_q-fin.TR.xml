      <title>Microstructure and Manipulation: Quantifying Pump-and-Dump Dynamics in Cryptocurrency Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on our prior threshold-based analysis of six months of Poloniex trading data, we have extended both the temporal span and granularity of our study by incorporating minute-level OHLCV records for 1021 tokens around each confirmed pump-and-dump event. First, we algorithmically identify the accumulation phase, marking the initial and final insider volume spikes, and observe that 70% of pre-event volume transacts within one hour of the pump announcement. Second, we compute conservative lower bounds on insider profits under both a single-point liquidation at 70% of peak and a tranche-based strategy (selling 20% at 50%, 30% at 60%, and 50% at 80% of peak), yielding median returns above 100% and upper-quartile returns exceeding 2000%. Third, by unfolding the full pump structure and integrating social-media verification (e.g., Telegram announcements), we confirm numerous additional events that eluded our initial model. We also categorize schemes into "pre-accumulation" versus "on-the-spot" archetypes-insights that sharpen detection algorithms, inform risk assessments, and underpin actionable strategies for real-time market-integrity enforcement.</description>

      <title>Learning the Spoofability of Limit Order Books With Interpretable Probabilistic Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates real-time detection of spoofing activity in limit order books, focusing on cryptocurrency centralized exchanges. We first introduce novel order flow variables based on multi-scale Hawkes processes that account both for the size and placement distance from current best prices of new limit orders. Using a Level-3 data set, we train a neural network model to predict the conditional probability distribution of mid price movements based on these features. Our empirical analysis highlights the critical role of the posting distance of limit orders in the price formation process, showing that spoofing detection models that do not take the posting distance into account are inadequate to describe the data. Next, we propose a spoofing detection framework based on the probabilistic market manipulation gain of a spoofing agent and use the previously trained neural network to compute the expected gain. Running this algorithm on all submitted limit orders in the period 2024-12-04 to 2024-12-07, we find that 31% of large orders could spoof the market. Because of its simple neuronal architecture, our model can be run in real time. This work contributes to enhancing market integrity by providing a robust tool for monitoring and mitigating spoofing in both cryptocurrency exchanges and traditional financial markets.</description>

      <title>Realized Local Volatility Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For quantitative trading risk management purposes, we present a novel idea: the realized local volatility surface. Concisely, it stands for the conditional expected volatility when sudden market behaviors of the underlying occur. One is able to explore risk management usages by following the orthotical Delta-Gamma dynamic hedging framework. The realized local volatility surface is, mathematically, a generalized Wiener measure from historical prices. It is reconstructed via employing high-frequency trading market data. A Stick-Breaking Gaussian Mixture Model is fitted via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, producing a local volatility surface with 95% credible intervals. A practically validated Bayesian nonparametric estimation workflow. Empirical results on TSLA high-frequency data illustrate its ability to capture counterfactual volatility. We also discuss its application in improving volatility-based risk management.</description>
