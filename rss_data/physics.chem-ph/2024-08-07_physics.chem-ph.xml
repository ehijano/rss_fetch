      <title>Role of time-frequency correlations in two-photon-two-atom resonance energy transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitation energy transfer is a photophysical process upon which many chemical and biological phenomena are built. From natural small systems to synthetic multichromophoric macromolecules, energy transfer deals with the process of migration of electronic excitation energy from an excited donor to an acceptor. Although this phenomenon has been extensively studied in the past, the rapid evolution of quantum-enabled technologies has motivated the question on whether nonclassical sources of light, such as entangled photon pairs, may provide us with a better control (or enhancement) of energy transfer at the nanoscale. In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of the joint excitation of two non-interacting two-level atoms by time-frequency correlated photon pairs -- whose central frequencies are not resonant with the individual particles -- generated by means of spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). We demonstrate that while strong frequency anti-correlation between photons guarantees a large two-photon excitation (TPE) probability, photons bearing a sine cardinal spectral shape exhibit a $\sim$3.8 times larger TPE signal than photons with a Gaussian spectrum. More importantly, we find that suppression of time-ordered excitation pathways does not substantially modify the TPE probability for two-photon states with a Gaussian spectral shape; whereas photons with a sine cardinal spectrum exhibit the strongest TPE signals when two-photon excitation pathways are not suppressed. Our results not only help elucidating the role of time-frequency correlations in resonance energy transfer with SPDC photons, but also provide valuable information regarding the optimal source to be used in its experimental implementation.</description>

      <title>Self-assembled porous media from particle-stabilized emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.2974</link>
      <description>arXiv:1408.2974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism to create self-assembled porous media with highly tunable geometrical properties and permeabilities: We first allow a particle-stabilized emulsion to form from a mixture of two fluids and colloidal particles. Then, either one fluid phase or the particle layer is solidified, which can be achieved by techniques such as polymerization or freezing. Based on computer simulations we demonstrate that modifying only the particle wettability or concentration results in porous structures with a wide range of pore sizes and a permeability that can be varied by up to three orders of magnitude. We then discuss optimization of these properties for self-assembled filters or reactors and conclude that structures based on so-called "bijels" are most suitable candidates.</description>

      <title>Thermal mean-field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several closely related ab initio thermal mean-field theories for fermions, both well-established and new ones, are compared with one another at the formalism level and numerically. The theories considered are Fermi-Dirac theory, thermal Hartree-Fock (HF) theory, two modifications of the thermal single-determinant approximation of Kaplan and Argyres, and first-order finite-temperature many-body perturbation theory based on zero-temperature or thermal HF reference. The thermal full-configuration-interaction theory is used as the benchmark.</description>
