      <title>Electrostatically Controlled Pyrophototronic Effect Enabled Accident Alert System using a Strain-Polarized WS2 Phototransistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-based dynamic light detection, specifically in low illumination power environments, is a critical requirement in autonomous vehicles. This work reports low optical power photodetection through the dynamic pyrophototronic effect in an ultra-thin 2D WS2 phototransistor. A four-stage pyrophototronic photoresponse has been realized through biaxial strain-polarization of the non-centrosymmetric (5-layer) WS2 channel using a sub-wavelength, nanopatterned hBN gate dielectric. Presence of strain in WS2 has been verified through extensive spectroscopic characterization and that of strain-induced charge polarization through density functional theory calculations as well as piezo force microscopy. The pyrophototronic effect boosts dynamic photoresponsivity (0.7 A/W) and detectivity (1.2x10^(15) Jones cm^(-1)) by up to 8x and enhances the photodetection speed by 3x over the non-patterned (unstrained) phototransistor, demonstrating a path to ameliorating the responsivity-speed trade-off in 2D photodetectors. Analysis of gate voltage, wavelength, and optical power dependence of the pyrophototronic current through measurements and band physics highlights its prominence under low channel population of electrostatically- or optically-induced free carriers. Gate tunability of the pyrophototronic current has been leveraged to design an optical spike-triggered dynamic accident alert system with speed-specific control for self-driving applications under low light conditions.</description>

      <title>Model-based study of a nanowire heating and dynamic axisymmetric necking by surface electromigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axisymmetric solid-state necking of a single-crystal metallic nanowire in a thermal contact with a substrate and subjected to a surface electromigration current is accompanied by a local current crowding and a sharp rise of a resistivity of a wire material in a thinning neck. This results in a temperature spike at the neck, which feedback affects the necking via thermomigration and the temperature-dependent surface diffusivity of the adatoms. A model that incorporates these effects and couples the nonlinear dynamics of a wire temperature and a wire radius for a necking wire is presented. Conditions on the physical parameters are derived that ensure a straight wire is in the solid state prior to an onset of a morphological instability that ultimately breaks a wire via a pinch-off. The impacts of a wire radius and a wire length on the temperature spike at the break junction are studied.</description>

      <title>Model-free Optical Processors using In Situ Reinforcement Learning with Proximal Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical computing holds promise for high-speed, energy-efficient information processing, with diffractive optical networks emerging as a flexible platform for implementing task-specific transformations. A challenge, however, is the effective optimization and alignment of the diffractive layers, which is hindered by the difficulty of accurately modeling physical systems with their inherent hardware imperfections, noise, and misalignments. While existing in situ optimization methods offer the advantage of direct training on the physical system without explicit system modeling, they are often limited by slow convergence and unstable performance due to inefficient use of limited measurement data. Here, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning approach utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the in situ training of diffractive optical processors. PPO efficiently reuses in situ measurement data and constrains policy updates to ensure more stable and faster convergence. We experimentally validated our method across a range of in situ learning tasks, including targeted energy focusing through a random diffuser, holographic image generation, aberration correction, and optical image classification, demonstrating in each task better convergence and performance. Our strategy operates directly on the physical system and naturally accounts for unknown real-world imperfections, eliminating the need for prior system knowledge or modeling. By enabling faster and more accurate training under realistic experimental constraints, this in situ reinforcement learning approach could offer a scalable framework for various optical and physical systems governed by complex, feedback-driven dynamics.</description>

      <title>Superior Frequency Stability and Long-Lived State-Swapping in Cubic-SiC Mechanical Mode Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multimode cavity optomechanical system offers versatile applications including state transduction, coherent interconnection, and many-body simulations. In this study, we developed a cavity electromechanical system that integrates a 3C-SiC membrane and a rectangular superconducting cavity to observe the generation of nearly degenerate pairs of mechanical modes. Subsequently, we derive the expression for intrinsic frequency under nonuniform stress and find that this method supports a remarkably resolution for stress analysis in thin films. Experimentally, we perform collective fitting on the measured set of 57 mechanical modes, revealing deviations in biaxial non-uniform stress on the order of MPa. These degeneracy-broken mechanical modes exhibit exceptional quality factors as high as $10^8$ in a thermal bath of 10 mK. Furthermore, Allan deviation indicates that these modes exhibit extremely stable frequencies compared with different types of optomechanical devices. We then performed state-swapping between near-degenerate mode pairs, demonstrating the transfer efficiency exceeding 78\%, attributed to their exceptionally long lifetimes. This study paves the way for the design of compact quantum phononic devices featuring high-quality-factor mechanical multimode.</description>

      <title>Surface Reduction Boosts Free Electron Concentration in MXene for Enhanced Photothermal Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The photothermal properties of MXenes originate from their high free electron concentration, which drives localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). However, their intrinsic electron concentration is limited by suboptimal d-orbital occupancy, while electronegative surface terminations actively deplete free electrons through orbital-selective withdrawal. Herein, we report a sodium (Na)-mediated surface reduction strategy in molten salts to transform Ti3C2Clx into electronically tunable Ti3C2. Specifically, Na atoms remove -Cl terminations to eliminate electron withdrawal and simultaneously inject electrons into the MXene lattice via a reduction reaction. This dual effect saturates Ti 3d-orbital vacancies while reducing surface coordination sites, achieving an increase in carrier concentration to 4.92-fold, an increase in mobility to 2.63-fold, and an enhancement in conductivity to 12.96-fold. Consequently, the optimized reduced MXene achieves a record photothermal conversion efficiency of 92.36% under 808 nm laser irradiation. As a proof-of-concept, a photothermal antibacterial woundplast with ultralow MXene content demonstrates a 91.39% bacterial kill rate. This work not only shows an effective way to tune the photothermal properties of MXenes but also inspires applications that require high electron concentration, such as energy storage, sensors, and electromagnetic interference shielding.</description>

      <title>Programmable skyrmions for robust communication and intelligent sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently observed plasmonic skyrmions, as electromagnetic counterparts of topologically stable quasiparticles, hold significant promise as novel carriers for robust information transfer and manipulation of nontrivial light-matter interactions. However, their practical applications has been hindered by the lack of flexible tuning devices to encode these topological structures. Here, we present a programmable plasmonic skyrmion platform capable of coding diverse skyrmion topologies, including N\'eel-type skyrmions and merons. Based on unprecedented ultra-fast coding feature, we synthesize nonlinear skyrmions in the temporal dimension and, for the first time, applied skyrmions in communication and sensing applications. Specifically, we achieved highly robust and multi-channel wireless communications by using programmable topological skyrmions, providing a promising platform for communication in turbulent noise channels and extreme conditions. Furthermore, we implemented intelligent sensing across twenty animal models on the same platform, achieving high recognition accuracy. This design offers revolutionary insights into the programmability of skyrmions and promising potentials applications of skyrmion topologies in next-generation information communication and intelligent sensing.</description>

      <title>Critical Nodes Identification in Complex Networks: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex networks have become essential tools for understanding diverse phenomena in social systems, traffic systems, biomolecular systems, and financial systems. Identifying critical nodes is a central theme in contemporary research, serving as a vital bridge between theoretical foundations and practical applications. Nevertheless, the intrinsic complexity and structural heterogeneity characterizing real-world networks, with particular emphasis on dynamic and higher-order networks, present substantial obstacles to the development of universal frameworks for critical node identification. This paper provides a comprehensive review of critical node identification techniques, categorizing them into seven main classes: centrality, critical nodes deletion problem, influence maximization, network control, artificial intelligence, higher-order and dynamic methods. Our review bridges the gaps in existing surveys by systematically classifying methods based on their methodological foundations and practical implications, and by highlighting their strengths, limitations, and applicability across different network types. Our work enhances the understanding of critical node research by identifying key challenges, such as algorithmic universality, real-time evaluation in dynamic networks, analysis of higher-order structures, and computational efficiency in large-scale networks. The structured synthesis consolidates current progress and highlights open questions, particularly in modeling temporal dynamics, advancing efficient algorithms, integrating machine learning approaches, and developing scalable and interpretable metrics for complex systems.</description>

      <title>Linking diffusive fields to virtual waves as their propagative duals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In non-destructive and biomedical imaging, spatial patterns inside a sample are imaged without destroying it. Therefore, propagating waves, including electromagnetic or ultrasonic signals, or even diffuse heat are generated or modified by these internal patterns and transmit this structural information to the sample surface. There, the signals can be detected, and an image of the internal structure can be reconstructed from the measured signals. The amount of information about the interior of the sample that can be obtained from the detected signals at the sample surface is significantly influenced by the propagation from the internal structure to the surface. In the real world, all signal propagation is more or less irreversible. The entropy generated during propagation corresponds to the loss of information.
  In an idealized model, such propagating waves, called virtual waves, are described by the wave equation. They remain valid solutions of this equation when the direction of time is reversed, thus exhibiting reversibility and showing no entropy production and therefore no loss of information during propagation.
  We have used the locally computed virtual waves from the measured diffusive surface signals for image reconstruction using established time-of-flight methods from ultrasound or RADAR imaging. This improves the spatial resolution in thermography and compensates for the dispersion of quantum wave packets in atom probe tomography.</description>

      <title>Improved composable key rates for CV-QKD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10270v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) must take finite-size effects and composable aspects into consideration. This is also the case for continuous-variable (CV) protocols which are based on the transmission and detection of bosonic coherent states. In this paper, we refine and advance the previous theory in this area providing a more rigorous formulation for the composable key rate of a generic CV-QKD protocol. Thanks to these theoretical refinements, our general formulas allow us to prove more optimistic key rates with respect to previous literature.</description>

      <title>A Novel Hybrid Grey Wolf Differential Evolution Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a nature-inspired stochastic meta-heuristic of the swarm intelligence field that mimics the hunting behavior of grey wolves. Differential evolution (DE) is a popular stochastic algorithm of the evolutionary computation field that is well suited for global optimization. In this part, we introduce a new algorithm based on the hybridization of GWO and two DE variants, namely the GWO-DE algorithm. We evaluate the new algorithm by applying various numerical benchmark functions. The numerical results of the comparative study are quite satisfactory in terms of performance and solution quality.</description>
