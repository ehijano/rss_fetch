      <title>SPT phases for mixed states in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the specific structure of 1D SPT phases with $G\times H$ symmetry ($G, H$ are finite non-Abelian groups) and constructs an order parameter. We demonstrate that this order parameter can comprehensively describe this specific structure. Utilizing this order parameter, we prove that when the SPT phase theory of symmetry $G$ is extended to mixed states, if the density matrix is treated as a pure SPT state with $G\times G$ symmetry, the Hermiticity and positive semi-definiteness ensure that the SPT phase of the mixed state is similarly described by $H^2(G)$. Finally, we propose that under this perspective, the SPT phase of time-reversal symmetry no longer exists in mixed states.</description>

      <title>Polarization spontaneous and piezo: fundamentals and their implementation in ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fundamental properties of spontaneous and piezo polarization are reformulated and critically reviewed. It was demonstrated that Landau definition of polarization as a dipole density could be used to the infinite systems. The difference between the bulk polarization and surface polarity are distinguished thus creating clear identification of both components. The local model of spontaneous polarization was created and used to calculate spontaneous polarization as the electric dipole density. It was shown that the proposed local model correctly predicts c-axis spontaneous polarization values of the nitride wurtzite semiconductors. It was also shown that the proposed model predicts zero polarization in the plane perpendicular to the c-axis, in accordance with symmetry requirements. In addition, the model results are in accordance with polarization equal to zero for zinc blende lattice. These data confirm the basic correctness of the proposed model. The spontaneous polarization values obtained for all wurtzite III nitrides (BN, AlN, GaN and InN) are in basic agreement with the earlier calculations using Berry phase and slab models of Bernardini et al. {Bernardini et al. Phys Rev B 56 (2001) R10024 &amp; 63 (2001) 193201} but not with Dreyer et al. {Dreyer et al. Phys. Rev X 6 (2016) 021038}. Wurtzite nitride superlattices ab initio calculations were performed to derive polarization-induced fields in the coherently strained lattices showing good agreement with the polarization values. The strained superlattice data were used to determine the piezoelectric parameters of wurtzite nitrides obtaining the values that were in basic agreement with the earlier data. Zinc blende superlattices were also modeled using ab initio calculations showing results that are in agreement with the absence of polarization of all nitrides in zinc blende symmetry.</description>
