      <title>Adjoint-based optimization of the control boundaries of a microfluidic acoustic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we find the optimal control boundary (i.e., actuator velocity) that cancels the acoustic reverberations inside drop-on-demand inkjet printheads at a specific time. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize the total energy of the oscillating flow at a given time (i.e., the acoustic energy inside the microchannel and the surface energy of the droplet). We use the adjoint method to compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to the control boundary, and a gradient-based optimization algorithm to converge to the optimal solution. This methodology has been successfully applied to two generic inkjet printhead mechanisms: thin-film and bulk types. In both cases, the actuator first reduces the surface energy of the system by extracting fluid from the nozzle. In this process, acoustic waves also propagate through the channel and reverberate at the ends, which increases the acoustic energy of the system. The actuator then sends additional acoustic waves that cancel these reverberations. Both mechanisms have been able to reduce the total energy of the system by a factor of over 100 in comparison with the uncontrolled cases.</description>

      <title>Onset of thermo-convective instabilities in two-layer binary fluid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current work analyses the onset characteristics of buoyancy and thermocapillary-driven instabilities in two-layer binary fluid systems near their upper critical solution temperature (UCST). The dynamics of the binary fluids are modelled here via a diffuse interface approach (phase-field method) involving a modified free energy formulation to capture the temperature-dependent solubility and interfacial width. Using spectral collocation-based discretization and a suitable grid mapping strategy, the present work accurately predicts the neutral curves for different fluid combinations that adhere to the concept of balanced contrasts. In the case of pure buoyancy-driven (Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard) convection, the parametric range for oscillatory onset is found to shrink when the system approaches USCT, as the increased solubility results in less favourable conditions for oscillatory onset. The marginal stability curves of each fluid combination exhibit their own drift pattern based on the thermo-physical and transport properties. For systems with added thermocapillarity effects (Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard-Marangoni convection), the changing solubilities and the interfacial thickness act along with the interfacial tension to exhibit a dual role that results in system-specific expansion/shrinkage of the parametric space for oscillatory flow onset.</description>

      <title>Stochastic surfing turbulent vorticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chaotic dynamics of small-scale vorticity plays a key role in understanding and controlling turbulence, with direct implications for energy transfer, mixing, and coherent structure evolution. However, measuring or controlling its dynamics remains a major conceptual and experimental challenge due to its transient and chaotic nature. Here we use a combination of experiments, theory and simulations to show that small magnetic particles of different densities, exploring flow regions of distinct vorticity statistics, can act as effective probes for measuring and forcing turbulence at its smallest scale. The interplay between the magnetic torque, from an externally controllable magnetic field, and hydrodynamic stresses, from small-scale turbulent vorticity, reveals an extremely rich phenomenology. Notably, we present the first observation of stochastic resonance for particles in turbulence: turbulent fluctuations, effectively acting as noise, counterintuitively enhance the particle rotational response to external forcing. We identify a pronounced resonant peak in particle rotational phase-lag when the applied magnetic field matches the characteristic intensity of small-scale vortices. Furthermore, we uncover a novel symmetry-breaking mechanism: an oscillating magnetic field with zero-mean angular velocity remarkably induces net particle rotation in turbulence with zero-mean vorticity, as turbulent fluctuations aid the particle in "surfing" the magnetic field. Our findings offer insights into flexible particle manipulation in complex flows and open up a novel magnetic resonance-based approach for measuring vorticity: magnetic particles as probes emit detectable magnetic fields, enabling turbulence quantification even under optically-inaccessible conditions.</description>

      <title>Rational constitutive law for the viscous stress tensor in incompressible two-phase flows: Derivation and tests against a 3D benchmark experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the representation of viscous stresses in the one-fluid formulation of the two-phase Navier-Stokes equations, the model on which all computational approaches making use of a fixed mesh to discretize the flow field are grounded. Recognizing that the Navier-Stokes-like equations that are actually solved in these approaches result from a spatial filtering, we show by considering a specific two-dimensional flow configuration that the proper representation of the viscous stress tensor requires the introduction of two distinct viscosity coefficients, owing to the different behaviors of shear and normal stresses in control volumes straddling the interface. Making use of classical results of continuum mechanics for anisotropic fluids, we derive the general form of the constitutive law linking the viscous stress tensor of the two-phase medium to the filtered strain-rate tensor, and take advantage of the findings provided by the above two-dimensional configuration to close the determination of the fluid-dependent coefficients involved. Predictions of the resulting anisotropic model are then assessed and compared with those of available \textit{ad hoc} models against original experimental results obtained in a reference flow in which some parts of the interface are dominated by shear while others are mostly controlled by stretching. The selected configuration corresponds to a viscous buoyancy-driven exchange flow in a closed vertical pipe, generated by unstably superimposing two immiscible fluids with a large viscosity contrast and negligible interfacial tension and molecular diffusivity. Using different levels of grid refinement, we show that the anisotropic model is the only one capable of predicting correctly the evolution of the front of the ascending and descending fingers at a reasonable computational cost</description>

      <title>Autophoretic skating along permeable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of self-propelled colloidal particles are strongly influenced by their environment through hydrodynamic and, in many cases, chemical interactions. We develop a theoretical framework to describe the motion of confined active particles by combining the Lorentz reciprocal theorem with a Galerkin discretisation of surface fields, yielding an equation of motion that efficiently captures self-propulsion without requiring an explicit solution for the bulk fluid flow. Applying this framework, we identify and characterise the long-time behaviours of a Janus particle near rigid, permeable, and fluid-fluid interfaces, revealing distinct motility regimes, including surface-bound skating, stable hovering, and chemo-hydrodynamic reflection. Our results demonstrate how the solute permeability and the viscosity contrast of the surface influence a particle's dynamics, providing valuable insights into experimentally relevant guidance mechanisms for autophoretic particles. The computational efficiency of our method makes it particularly well-suited for systematic parameter sweeps, offering a powerful tool for mapping the phase space of confined active particles and informing high-fidelity numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Influence of the particle morphology on the spray characteristics in low-pressure cold gas process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of particle morphology on spray characteristics in low-pressure cold gas spraying (LPCGS) by analyzing three copper powders with distinct shapes and microstructures. A comprehensive morphology analysis was conducted using both 2D and 3D imaging techniques. Light microscopy combined with image processing quantified particle circularity in 2D projections, while X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) enabled precise 3D reconstructions to determine sphericity, surface area, and volume distributions. The results showed significant variations in the particle morphology of the investigated feedstock copper powders, with irregularly shaped particles exhibiting lower circularity and sphericity compared to more spherical feedstocks. These morphological differences had a direct impact on the particle velocity distributions and spatial dispersion within the spray jet, as measured by high-speed particle image velocimetry. Irregular particles experienced stronger acceleration and exhibited a more focused spray dispersion, whereas spherical particles reached lower maximum velocities and showed a wider dispersion in the jet. These findings highlight the critical role of particle morphology in optimization of cold spray processes for advanced coating and additive manufacturing applications.</description>

      <title>Fringe around a Beet Slice: Wetting-induced Dimple in a Thin Liquid Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a slice of beet is placed on a plate with a thin layer of beet juice, one can observe a clear fringe around the beet, where the color is more translucent than the rest of the juice. The hypotheses in literature were inconsistent and limited, which motivated us to revisit this phenomenon. Using a motorized confocal displacement sensor, we measured the temporal evolution of the liquid surface profile across the fringe. Our findings suggest that a suction flow, induced by the capillary rise of the contact line, causes a dimple - a small concave depression - to form on the liquid surface. While surface tension and gravity tends to smooth out the dimple, viscous drag acts against them if the liquid film is sufficiently thin. Our scaling analysis correctly estimates the dependence of dimple lifetime on liquid properties and film thickness. We also capture the dimple formation dynamics by numerically solving the lubrication equation with the Young-Laplace equation. This work provides a new interpretation for a common phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Stochastic elastohydrodynamics of soft valves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08248v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft valves serve to modulate and rectify flows in complex vasculatures across the tree of life, e.g. in the heart of every human reading this. Here we consider a minimal physical model of the heart mitral valve modeled as a flexible conical shell capable of flow rectification via collapse and coaptation in an impinging (reverse) flow. Our experiments show that the complex elastohydrodynamics of closure features a noise-activated rectification mechanism. A minimal theoretical model allows us to rationalize our observations while illuminating a dynamical bifurcation driven by stochastic hydrodynamic forces. Our theory also suggests a way to trigger the coaptation of soft valves on demand, which we corroborate using experiments, suggesting a design principle for their efficient operation.</description>

      <title>Lift force in chiral, compressible granular matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micropolar fluid theory, an extension of classical Newtonian fluid dynamics, incorporates angular velocities and rotational inertias and has long been a foundational framework for describing granular flows. However, existing formulations often overlook the contribution of finite odd viscosity, which is a natural occurrence in chiral micropolar fluids where parity and time-reversal symmetries are broken. In this work, we specifically explore the influence of odd viscosity on the lift forces -- a less commonly discussed force compared to drag -- experienced by a bead immersed in a compressible micropolar fluid. We analyze the lift forces on a bead embedded within a compressible flow of a granular medium, emphasizing the unique role and interplay of microrotations and odd viscosity.</description>

      <title>Magnetically assisted vorticity production in decaying acoustic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study vorticity production in isothermal, subsonic, acoustic (nonvortical), and decaying turbulence due to the presence of magnetic fields. Using three-dimensional numerical simulations, we find that the resulting kinetic energy cascade follows the ordinary Kolmogorov phenomenology involving a constant spectral energy flux. The nondimensional prefactor for acoustic turbulence is larger than the standard Kolmogorov constant due to the inefficient dissipation of kinetic energy. We also find that the Lorentz force can drive vortical motions even when the initial field is uniform, by converting a fraction of the acoustic energy into vortical energy. This conversion is shown to be quadratic in the magnetic field strength and linear in the acoustic flow speed. By contrast, the direct production of vortical motions by a non-force-free magnetic field is linear in the field strength. Our results suggest that magnetic fields play a crucial role in vorticity production in cosmological flows, particularly in scenarios where significant acoustic turbulence is prevalent. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the early Universe, where magnetic fields may convert acoustic turbulence generated during cosmological phase transitions into vortical turbulence.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects in three-dimensional high-speed compressible flows: Multiscale modeling and simulation via the discrete Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) high-speed compressible flow is a typical nonlinear, nonequilibrium, and multiscale complex flow. Traditional fluid mechanics models, based on the quasi-continuum assumption and near-equilibrium approximation, are insufficient to capture significant discrete effects and thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects (TNEs) as the Knudsen number increases. To overcome these limitations, a discrete Boltzmann modeling and simulation method, rooted in kinetic and mean-field theories, has been developed. By applying Chapman-Enskog multiscale analysis, the essential kinetic moment relations $\bm{\Phi}$ for characterizing second-order TNEs are determined. These relations are invariants in coarse-grained physical modeling, providing a unique mesoscopic perspective for analyzing TNE behaviors. A discrete Boltzmann model, accurate to the second-order in the Knudsen number, is developed to enable multiscale simulations of 3D supersonic flows. As key TNE measures, nonlinear constitutive relations (NCRs), are theoretically derived for the 3D case, offering a constitutive foundation for improving macroscopic fluid modeling. The NCRs in three dimensions exhibit greater complexity than their two-dimensional counterparts. This complexity arises from increased degrees of freedom, which introduce additional kinds of nonequilibrium driving forces, stronger coupling between these forces, and a significant increase in nonequilibrium components. At the macroscopic level, the model is validated through several classical test cases, ranging from 1D to 3D scenarios, from subsonic to supersonic regimes. At the mesoscopic level, the model accurately captures typical TNEs, such as viscous stress and heat flux, around mesoscale structures, across various scales and orders. This work provides kinetic insights that advance multiscale simulation techniques for 3D high-speed compressible flows.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Models for Unpaired Super-resolution in Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity, high-resolution numerical simulations are crucial for studying complex multiscale phenomena in fluid dynamics, such as turbulent flows and ocean waves. However, direct numerical simulations with high-resolution solvers are computationally prohibitive. As an alternative, super-resolution techniques enable the enhancement of low-fidelity, low-resolution simulations. However, traditional super-resolution approaches rely on paired low-fidelity, low-resolution and high-fidelity, high-resolution datasets for training, which are often impossible to acquire in complex flow systems. To address this challenge, we propose a novel two-step approach that eliminates the need for paired datasets. First, we perform unpaired domain translation at the low-resolution level using an Enhanced Denoising Diffusion Implicit Bridge. This process transforms low-fidelity, low-resolution inputs into high-fidelity, low-resolution outputs, and we provide a theoretical analysis to highlight the advantages of this enhanced diffusion-based approach. Second, we employ the cascaded Super-Resolution via Repeated Refinement model to upscale the high-fidelity, low-resolution prediction to the high-resolution result. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across three fluid dynamics problems. Moreover, by incorporating a neural operator to learn system dynamics, our method can be extended to improve evolutionary simulations of low-fidelity, low-resolution data.</description>
