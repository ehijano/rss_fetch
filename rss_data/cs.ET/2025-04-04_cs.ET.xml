      <title>Toward a Sustainable Low-Altitude Economy: A Survey of Energy-Efficient RIS-UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of RIS into UAV networks presents a transformative solution for achieving energy-efficient and reliable communication, particularly within the rapidly expanding low-altitude economy (LAE). As UAVs facilitate diverse aerial services-spanning logistics to smart surveillance-their limited energy reserves create significant challenges. RIS effectively addresses this issue by dynamically shaping the wireless environment to enhance signal quality, reduce power consumption, and extend UAV operation time, thus enabling sustainable and scalable deployment across various LAE applications. This survey provides a comprehensive review of RIS-assisted UAV networks, focusing on energy-efficient design within LAE applications. We begin by introducing the fundamentals of RIS, covering its operational modes, deployment architectures, and roles in both terrestrial and aerial environments. Next, advanced EE-driven strategies for integrating RIS and UAVs. Techniques such as trajectory optimization, power control, beamforming, and dynamic resource management are examined. Emphasis is placed on collaborative solutions that incorporate UAV-mounted RIS, wireless energy harvesting (EH), and intelligent scheduling frameworks. We further categorize RIS-enabled schemes based on key performance objectives relevant to LAE scenarios. These objectives include sum rate maximization, coverage extension, QoS guarantees, secrecy rate improvement, latency reduction, and age of information (AoI) minimization. The survey also delves into RIS-UAV synergy with emerging technologies like MEC, NOMA, V2X communication, and WPT. These technologies are crucial to the LAE ecosystem. Finally, we outline open research challenges and future directions, emphasizing the critical role of energy-aware, RIS-enhanced UAV networks in shaping scalable, sustainable, and intelligent infrastructures within the LAE.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of the Transparent, Interpretable, and Multimodal (TIM) AR Personal Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of an AI assistant for task guidance is rapidly shifting from a science fiction staple to an impending reality. Such a system is inherently complex, requiring models for perceptual grounding, attention, and reasoning, an intuitive interface that adapts to the performer's needs, and the orchestration of data streams from many sensors. Moreover, all data acquired by the system must be readily available for post-hoc analysis to enable developers to understand performer behavior and quickly detect failures. We introduce TIM, the first end-to-end AI-enabled task guidance system in augmented reality which is capable of detecting both the user and scene as well as providing adaptable, just-in-time feedback. We discuss the system challenges and propose design solutions. We also demonstrate how TIM adapts to domain applications with varying needs, highlighting how the system components can be customized for each scenario.</description>

      <title>AI Regulation and Capitalist Growth: Balancing Innovation, Ethics, and Global Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly central to economic growth, promising new efficiencies and markets. This economic significance has sparked debate over AI regulation: do rules and oversight bolster long term growth by building trust and safeguarding the public, or do they constrain innovation and free enterprise? This paper examines the balance between AI regulation and capitalist ideals, focusing on how different approaches to AI data privacy can impact innovation in AI-driven applications. The central question is whether AI regulation enhances or inhibits growth in a capitalist economy. Our analysis synthesizes historical precedents, the current U.S. regulatory landscape, economic projections, legal challenges, and case studies of recent AI policies. We discuss that carefully calibrated AI data privacy regulations-balancing innovation incentives with the public interest can foster sustainable growth by building trust and ensuring responsible data use, while excessive regulation may risk stifling innovation and entrenching incumbents.</description>

      <title>Extending quantum annealing to continuous domains: a hybrid method for quadratic programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Quantum Enhanced Simulated Annealing (QESA), a novel hybrid optimization framework that integrates quantum annealing (QA) into simulated annealing (SA) to tackle continuous optimization problems. While QA has shown promise in solving binary problems such as those expressed in Ising or QUBO form, its direct applicability to real-valued domains remains limited. QESA bridges this gap by using QA to select discrete search directions that guide SA through the continuous solution space, enabling the use of quantum resources without requiring full problem discretization. We demonstrate QESA's effectiveness on box-constrained quadratic programming (QP) problems, a class of non-convex optimization tasks that frequently arise in practice. Experimental results show that QESA consistently outperforms classical baselines in solution quality, particularly on larger and more ill-conditioned problems, while maintaining competitive runtime. As quantum annealing hardware matures, QESA offers a scalable and flexible strategy for leveraging quantum capabilities in continuous optimization.</description>

      <title>Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem with Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem (STSP) is a variant of the classical Traveling Salesman Problem. The STSP involves incorporating steiner nodes, which are extra nodes not originally part of the required visit set but that can be added to the route to enhance the overall solution and minimize the total travel cost. Given the NP-hard nature of the STSP, we propose a quantum approach to address it. Specifically, we employ quantum annealing using D-Wave's hardware to explore its potential for solving this problem. To enhance computational feasibility, we develop a preprocessing method that effectively reduces the network size. Our experimental results demonstrate that this reduction technique significantly decreases the problem complexity, making the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation, the standard input for quantum annealers, better suited for existing quantum hardware. Furthermore, the results highlight the potential of quantum annealing as a promising and innovative approach for solving the STSP.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Josephson Junctions Based QPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum processing units (QPUs) based on superconducting Josephson junctions promise significant advances in quantum computing. However, they face critical challenges. Decoherence, scalability limitations, and error correction overhead hinder practical, fault-tolerant implementations. This paper investigates these issues by exploring both fundamental quantum phenomena and practical engineering challenges. We analyze key quantum mechanical principles such as superposition, entanglement, and decoherence that govern the behavior of superconducting qubits. We also discuss quantum tunneling, Cooper pair formation, and the operational mechanics of Josephson junctions in detail. Additionally, we present a comparative analysis with alternative architectures, including ion trap and photonic systems. This comparison highlights the unique advantages and trade-offs of Josephson junction-based QPUs. Our findings emphasize the critical role of material innovations and optimized control techniques. These advances are essential for mitigating noise and decoherence and for realizing robust, scalable quantum computing.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Synthesis Algorithm for Reversible Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reversible computation is an emerging technology that has gained significant attention due to its critical role in quantum circuit synthesis and low-power design. This paper introduces a transformation-based method for exact synthesis of reversible circuits. The proposed approach utilizes a modified Quine-McCluskey algorithm to eliminate input-output discrepancies in the truth table, transforming the permutation matrix into an identity matrix. Furthermore, a novel search space reduction technique is presented which, combined with the primary method, enables the synthesis algorithm to handle high-input reversible functions. This approach combines the influence of multiple control qubits on a target qubit, evaluating their collective impact. This aggregation can decrease the control qubit count within quantum gates. Consequently, it proves beneficial for applications like surface code error correction architectures as well as current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardwares. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art exact synthesis methods, achieving up to 99% improvements in terms of the number of levels of T-gates.</description>

      <title>Parallel Tempering-Inspired Distributed Binary Optimization with In-Memory Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09152v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-memory computing (IMC) has been shown to be a promising approach for solving binary optimization problems while significantly reducing energy and latency. Building on the advantages of parallel computation, we propose an IMC-compatible parallelism framework based on the physics-inspired parallel tempering (PT) algorithm, enabling cross-replica communication to improve the performance of IMC solvers. This framework enables an IMC solver not only to improve performance beyond what can be achieved through parallelization, but also affords greater flexibility for the search process with low hardware overhead. We justify that the framework can be applied to almost any IMC solver. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework for the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem, using the WalkSAT heuristic as a proxy for existing IMC solvers. The resulting PT-inspired cooperative WalkSAT (PTIC-WalkSAT) algorithm outperforms the standard WalkSAT heuristic in terms of the iterations-to-solution in 84.0% of the tested problem instances and its na\"ive parallel variant (PA-WalkSAT) does so in 64.9% of the instances, and with a higher success rate in the majority of instances. An estimate of the energy overhead of the PTIC framework for two hardware accelerator architectures indicates that in both cases the overhead of running the PTIC framework would be less than 1% of the total energy required to run each accelerator.</description>
