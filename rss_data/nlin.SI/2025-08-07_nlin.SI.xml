      <title>On integrable structure of the null string in (anti-)de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Presently integrability turned the key property in the study of duality between superconformal gauge theories and strings in anti-de Sitter superspaces. Complexity of the study of integrable structure in string theory is caused by complicated dependence of background fields of the Type II supergravity multiplets, with which strings interact, on the superspace coordinates. This explains an interest to study of limiting cases, in which superstring equations simplify. In the present work considered is the limiting case of zero tension corresponding to null string. It is obtained the representation in the form of the Lax equation of null-string equations in (anti-)de Sitter space realized as coset manifold. Proposed is twistor interpretation of the Lagrangian of (null) string in anti-de Sitter space expressed in terms of group variables.</description>

      <title>Almost local integrable models from supersymmetry algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetry algebras can be used to obtain algebraic expressions for constant Yang-Baxter solutions, also known as braid group generators. This was done for non-invertible braid operators in \cite{maity2025non}. In this work we extend this construction for the invertible ones. The resulting expressions are then shown to obey relations analogous to those satisfied by quotients of braid groups. Examples of the latter include the Iwahori-Hecke algebra and the Birman-Murakami-Wenzl (BMW) algebra. As a result, we can Baxterize the constant Yang-Baxter solutions to yield spectral parameter dependent $R$-matrices. The regularity of these $R$-matrices depend on the representation of SUSY generators. In some cases they are regular in the usual sense and in the remaining they are `almost' regular. In the latter case they are also non-invertible. Nevertheless we show that they can still help us construct integrable models in all dimensions of the local Hilbert space. These models can be described by Hamiltonian densities that are either local or non-local, depending on the representation chosen for the SUSY generators. We demonstrate this for all constant $4\times 4$ invertible Yang-Baxter solutions. Apart from finding new nearest-neighbor interaction spin $\frac{1}{2}$ systems, we also find their higher spin analogs due to the algebraic [representation independent] approach.</description>

      <title>Birational Weyl group actions and q-Painleve equations via mutation combinatorics in cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06704v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A cluster algebra is an algebraic structure generated by operations of a quiver (a directed graph) called the mutations and their associated simple birational mappings. By using a graph-combinatorial approach, we present a systematic way to derive a tropical, i.e. subtraction-free birational, representation of Weyl groups from cluster algebras. Our results provide an extensive class of Weyl group actions, including previously known examples with algebro-geometric background, and hence are relevant to the q-Painleve equations and their higher-order extensions. Key ingredients of the argument are the combinatorial aspects of the reflection associated with a cycle subgraph in the quiver. We also study symplectic structures of the discrete dynamical systems thus obtained. The normal form of a skew-symmetric integer matrix allows us to choose Darboux coordinates while preserving the birationality.</description>
