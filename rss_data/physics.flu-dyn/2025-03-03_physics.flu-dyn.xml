      <title>Pattern Formation in Isothermal Miscible Protein/Sugar Systems Driven by Marangoni Effects and Evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through a combination of experiments and modeling, we have demonstrated a novel pattern formation phenomenon in an isothermal miscible fluid system involving simple protein and sugar solutions. We introduced dye-tagged protein solution into a petri dish with sugar solutions, which had higher density than the added protein solution. Initially, the protein spread and became more uniformly distributed at the air-water interface. Subsequently, it concentrated in specific areas to form spiral patterns. We propose that the mechanism involves an interplay between Marangoni effects, evaporation, and airflow. This finding is unexpected as solute Marangoni-related processes are generally characterized by fast spreading (seconds), while the pattern formation in our systems takes several minutes to form. Our work suggests that Turing reaction-diffusion patterns can be replicated by replacing the reaction-induced inhomogeneous solute distribution by evaporation-induced inhomogeneity. In both cases, the fast diffusive or Marangoni spreading of the solute is counteracted by a slower step that serves to reverse the solute homogenization. In showing that dissipative patterns can form in the absence of thermal gradients or chemical reactions, our findings significantly expand the conditions that lead to pattern formation. The insights gained also enhance our ability to manipulate and control fluid motion and surface morphology, with promising implications for many areas such as coating technologies, materials science, and microfluidics.</description>

      <title>Finite Amplitude Scaling in Transitional Pipe Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies on the finite amplitude stability of pipe flows identified a range of different scaling exponents between $\beta\approx -1 $ and $\beta\approx-1.5$, relating $A\sim Re^{\beta}$, where $A$ is the minimum amplitude of disturbance to cause a transition to turbulence and $Re$ is the Reynolds number. The circumstance under which a particular scaling exponent manifests itself is still not clear. Understanding this can shed light on the different routes to turbulence \citep{willis2008experimental} and the mechanisms involved. The exponents observed in previous experiments and simulations were explained based on the spatial localization of initial disturbances. In this paper, through direct numerical simulations (DNS), we classify the exponent, $\beta$ into two ranges; a steeper exponent with $\beta\lessapprox-1.3$ and a shallower exponent with $\beta\gtrapprox-1$. We then determine the nature of the disturbance to produce a specific exponent.
  Our results clearly show that the two ranges of the scaling exponents are related to the radial distribution of the initial disturbance, where $\beta \lessapprox -1.3$ exists for a disturbance at the boundary, and $ \beta \gtrapprox -1$ exits otherwise. We also compare the previous experiments and simulations on injection-type and push-pull-type initial disturbances. This study clarifies the nature of the initial disturbance that can result in either of the two different scaling exponents observed so far.</description>

      <title>Effects of conjugate heat transfer on large-scale flow structures in convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The constant temperature and constant heat flux thermal boundary conditions, both developing distinct flow patterns, represent limiting cases of ideally conducting and insulating plates in Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC) flows, respectively. This study bridges the gap in between, using a conjugate heat transfer (CHT) set-up and studying finite thermal diffusivity ratios $\kapparatioIL$ to better represent real-life conditions in experiments. A three-dimensional RBC configuration including two fluid-confining plates is studied via direct numerical simulation given a Prandtl number $\Pr=1$. The fluid layer of height $H$ and horizontal extension $L$ obeys no-slip boundary conditions at the two solid-fluid interfaces and an aspect ratio of $\Gamma=L/H=30$, while the relative thickness of each plate is $\Gs=H_s/H=15$. The entire domain is laterally periodic. Here, different $\kapparatioIL$ are investigated for Rayleigh numbers of $\Ra=\left\{ 10^4, 10^5 \right\}$. We observe a gradual shift of the size of the characteristic flow patterns and their induced heat and mass transfer as $\kapparatioIL$ is varied, suggesting a relation between the recently studied turbulent superstructures and supergranules for constant temperature and constant heat flux boundary conditions, respectively. Performing a linear stability analysis for this CHT configuration confirms these observations theoretically while extending previous studies by investigating the impact of a varying solid plate thickness $\Gs$. Moreover, we study the impact of $\kapparatioIL$ on the thermal and viscous boundary layers. Given the prevalence of finite $\kapparatioIL$ in nature, this work also extends our understanding of pattern formation in geo- and astrophysical convection flows.</description>

      <title>Effects of non-parallelism on standard and magnetorheological measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human blood has a complex composition and unique rheological properties, making it challenging to measure accurately. In addition to this, its mechanical properties may be influenced by external magnetic fields, which, despite being a characteristic of significant interest in the development of new treatment therapies, remains relatively unexplored. To achieve an accurate magnetorheological description of blood, the employed equipment must achieve accurate results taking into account its low viscous and elastic character. However, low and inconsistent apparent-viscosity values were observed systematically in a rotational rheometer equipped with a magnetorheological cell, without the applied magnetic field. In this work, a parametric study was conducted, experimentally and numerically, to evaluate this error source. Steady shear measurements were carried out with low-viscosity Newtonian fluids with two geometries: a parallel-plate, at different gap heights, and a cone-plate. An additional standard bottom plate for non-magnetic testing was also employed for comparison. The standard bottom plate returned constant viscosities near the expected values, whereas the plate attached to the magnetorheological cell showed a clear decrease of measured viscosity with parallel-plate gap reduction and an increase in cone-plate-measured viscosity. Numerical results corroborated the experimental observations, pointing towards an inclination of the bottom magnetic plate which can significantly affect the flow. Additional experimental and numerical work was conducted to evaluate the effects of the setup imperfection on magnetorheological measurements, unveiling magnetorheology's deep dependence on the geometric characteristics.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of the flow induced by a transcatheter intra-aortic entrainment pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the fluid dynamics inside and outside transcatheter blood pump positioned in the aorta. We focus on the pump's impact on blood component damage and arterial wall stress. CFD simulations were performed for rotational speeds ranging from 6000 to 15000 rpm, with a blood flow rate of 1.6 L/min. Results show that significant blood damage may occur at speeds as low as 12000 rpm, and the pump's outflow jet induces elevated wall shear stress, potentially leading to arterial aneurysms. These findings suggest the need for further design improvements to reduce risks when used in prolonged or transplant-related applications.</description>

      <title>Effect of inflow conditions on tip vortex breakdown in a high Reynolds number wind turbine wake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the re-energization of wind turbine wakes is crucial for the design and control of wind farms. Close to the rotor, this process is determined by the dynamics of the tip vortices. Here, we experimentally investigate the downstream evolution of the tip vortices for different inflow conditions. The experiments were performed in the Variable Density Turbulence Tunnel at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization, which uses pressurized $\mathrm{SF}_6$ as the working fluid to achieve a turbine diameter-based Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}_D=2.9\times10^6$. An active turbulence grid was used to generate atmospheric inflow conditions with varying levels of mean shear and turbulence intensity. Hot wire measurements of the streamwise velocity component were conducted in the inflow and the wake of a model wind turbine MoWiTO 0.6 for various tip speed ratios and are used to investigate the scaling of tip vortex breakdown in the near wake. While the scaling is only weakly affected by variations in mean velocity shear, both turbulence intensity and tip speed ratio have a strong effect on vortex breakdown.</description>

      <title>An analytical solution for horizontal velocity profiles in the hurricane boundary layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical analyses of the hurricane boundary layer have traditionally relied on slab models, which provide a limited description of wind profiles. Literature on height-resolving methods is typically based on linear analyses, which may fall short of capturing the full sensitivity of the solution to variations in input parameters. This work proposes an approximate analytical solution of a nonlinear single-column model for horizontal winds that uses a constant eddy viscosity and is valid outside the eyewall. Building on literature that uses a linearized system of equations, we use a series expansion to account for the nonlinearities. We find that a first-order correction is sufficient for most practical cases. This solution helps provide a simplified understanding of the sensitivity of the radial and tangential wind profiles to input parameters such as the distance from the hurricane eye and the Coriolis force.</description>

      <title>Exploring Bayesian olfactory search in realistic turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of tracking the source of a passive scalar in a turbulent flow is relevant to flying insect behavior and several other applications. Extensive previous work has shown that certain Bayesian strategies, such as "infotaxis," can be very effective for this difficult "olfactory search" problem. More recently, a quasi-optimal Bayesian strategy was computed under the assumption that encounters with the scalar are independent. However, the Bayesian approach has not been adequately studied in realistic flows which exhibit spatiotemporal correlations. In this work, we perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) of an incompressible flow at $\mathrm{Re}_\lambda\simeq150,$ while tracking Lagrangian particles which are emitted by a point source and imposing a uniform mean flow with several magnitudes (including zero). We extract the spatially-dependent statistics of encounters with the particles, which we use to build Bayesian policies, including generalized ("space-aware") infotactic heuristics and quasi-optimal policies. We then assess the relative performance of these policies when they are used to search using scalar cue data from the DNS, and in particular study how this performance depends on correlations between encounters. Among other results, we find that quasi-optimal strategies continue to outperform heuristics in the presence of strong mean flow but fail to do so in the absence of a mean flow. We also explore how to choose optimal search parameters, including the frequency and threshold concentration of observation.</description>

      <title>Flow-Driven Rotor Simulations of Seyi-Chunlei Ducted Turbine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an improved Clarkson Ducted Wind Turbine (DWT) design using a new diffuser based on the Selig S1223 airfoil at an angle of attack (AoA) of 20 degrees and a smaller tip clearance. This proposed design is hereby named Selig20 Clarkson Ducted Turbine or Seyi-Chunlei Ducted Turbine (SCDT) compared to the original Clarkson Ducted Wind Turbine (CDWT). In both SCDT and CDWT configurations, the rotor is placed a distance behind the throat of the duct. For in-depth analysis, we employ a flow-driven-rotor (FDR) model of a commercial CFD package, Simerics-MP+, based on unstructured-grid finite-volume solutions of Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations for the flow field that are two-way fully coupled with a dynamic solution of the rigid-body rotation of the turbine rotor. The FDR model successfully predicts the optimal thrust coefficient, whereas the prescribed rotation model fails to do so. Although the optimal Cp predicted by the FDR model is fairly close to the prediction from the prescribed motion model, FDR is generally more accurate in predicting underperformance under ambient wind conditions away from the optimal tip speed ratio. FDR offers a new path to simulate ducted wind turbines in ambient wind conditions. The Seyi-Chunlei Ducted Turbine is confirmed to have a Cpt peak approximately 7% higher than that of the Clarkson DWT. SCDT also has a wider range of optimal tip speed ratios, enabling it to harvest more wind energy under ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Reliability of characterising coronary artery flow with the flow-split outflow strategy: comparison against the multiscale approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In computational modelling of coronary haemodynamics, imposing patient-specific flow conditions is paramount, yet often impractical due to resource and time constraints, limiting the ability to perform a large number of simulations particularly for diseased cases. We aimed to compare coronary haemodynamics quantified using a simplified flow-split strategy with varying exponents against the clinically verified but computationally intensive multiscale simulations under both resting and hyperaemic conditions in arteries with varying degrees of stenosis.
  Six patient-specific left coronary artery trees were segmented and reconstructed, including three with severe (&gt;70%) and three with mild (&lt;50%) focal stenoses. Simulations were performed for the entire coronary tree to account for the flow-limiting effects from epicardial artery stenoses. Both a 0D-3D coupled multiscale model and a flow-split approach with four different exponents (2.0, 2.27, 2.33, and 3.0) were used. The resulting prominent haemodynamic metrics were statistically compared between the two methods.
  Flow-split and multiscale simulations did not significantly differ under resting conditions regardless of the stenosis severity. However, under hyperaemic conditions, the flow-split method significantly overestimated the time-averaged wall shear stress by up to 16.8 Pa (p=0.031) and underestimate the fractional flow reserve by 0.327 (p=0.043), with larger discrepancies observed in severe stenoses than in mild ones. Varying the exponent from 2.0 to 3.0 within the flow-split methods did not significantly affect the haemodynamic results (p&gt;0.141).
  Flow-split strategies with exponents between 2.0 and 3.0 are appropriate for modelling stenosed coronaries under resting conditions. Multiscale simulations are recommended for accurate modelling of hyperaemic conditions, especially in severely stenosed arteries.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Control of Strongly-Disturbed Unsteady Aerodynamic Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic high dimension of fluid dynamics is an inherent challenge to control of aerodynamic flows, and this is further complicated by a flow's nonlinear response to strong disturbances. Deep reinforcement learning, which takes advantage of the exploratory aspects of reinforcement learning (RL) and the rich nonlinearity of a deep neural network, provides a promising approach to discover feasible control strategies. However, the typical model-free approach to reinforcement learning requires a significant amount of interaction between the flow environment and the RL agent during training, and this high training cost impedes its development and application. In this work, we propose a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) approach by incorporating a novel reduced-order model as a surrogate for the full environment. The model consists of a physics-augmented autoencoder, which compresses high-dimensional CFD flow field snaphsots into a three-dimensional latent space, and a latent dynamics model that is trained to accurately predict the long-time dynamics of trajectories in the latent space in response to action sequences. The accuracy and robustness of the model are demonstrated in the scenario of a pitching airfoil within a highly disturbed environment. Additionally, an application to a vertical-axis wind turbine in a disturbance-free environment is discussed in the Appendix Based on the model trained in the pitching airfoil problem, we realize an MBRL strategy to mitigate lift variation during gust-airfoil encounters. We demonstrate that the policy learned in the reduced-order environment translates to an effective control strategy in the full CFD environment.</description>

      <title>The effect of gravity on bubble-particle collisions in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bubble-particle collisions in turbulence are key to the froth flotation process that is widely employed industrially to separate hydrophobic from hydrophilic materials. In our previous study (Chan et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 959, 2023, A6), we elucidated the collision mechanisms and critically reviewed the collision models in the no-gravity limit. In reality, gravity may play a role since ultimately separation is achieved through buoyancy-induced rising of the bubbles. This effect has been included in several collision models, which have remained without a proper validation thus far due to a scarcity of available data. We therefore conduct direct numerical simulations of bubbles and particles in homogeneous isotropic turbulence with various Stokes, Froude, Reynolds numbers, and particle density ratios using the point-particle approximation. Generally, turbulence enhances the collision rate compared to the pure relative settling case by increasing the collision velocity. Surprisingly, however, for certain parameters the collision rate is lower with turbulence compared to without, independent of the history force. This is due to turbulence-induced bubble-particle spatial segregation, which is most prevalent at weak relative gravity and decreases as gravitational effects become more dominant, and reduced bubble slip velocity in turbulence. The existing bubble-particle collision models only qualitatively capture the trends in our numerical data. To improve on this, we extend the model by Dodin &amp; Elperin (Phys. Fluids, vol. 14, no. 8, 2002, pp.2921-2924) to the bubble-particle case and found excellent quantitative agreement for small Stokes numbers when the history force is negligible and segregation is accounted for.</description>

      <title>Resonance of an object floating within a surface wavefield</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the interaction between floating cylindrical objects and surface waves in the gravity regime. Given that the impact of resonance phenomena associated with floating bodies, particularly at laboratory scales, remains underexplored, we focus on the influence of the floaters' resonance frequency on wave emission. We study the response of floating rigid cylinders to external mechanical perturbations. Using an optical reconstruction technique to measure wave fields, we study the natural resonance frequency of the floaters in geometry and their response to incoming waves. The results indicate that the resonance frequency is influenced by the interplay between the cylinder geometry and the solid-to-fluid density ratio. Experiments with incoming waves demonstrate that floaters diffract waves, creating complex patterns of diffusion and retro-diffusion while radiating secondary waves that interfere with the incident wavefield. Minimal wave generation is observed at resonance frequencies. These findings provide insights for elucidating the behavior of larger structures, such as sea ice floes, in natural wave fields.</description>

Abstract: The shock formation process in shock tubes has been extensively studied; however, significant gaps remain in understanding the effects of the diaphragm rupture process on the resulting flow non-uniformities. Existing models predicting the shock attenuation and propagation dynamics overlook critical diaphragm mechanics and their impact on shock behavior. Addressing this gap is vital for improving predictive capabilities and optimizing shock tube designs for applications in combustion kinetics, aerodynamics, and high-speed diagnostics. This study investigates the shock wave formation and propagation through combined experimental and numerical approaches over a range of driver-to-driven pressure ratios (Driver pressure: 9.4 - 24.2 bar of helium; Driven pressure: 100 Torr of argon). High-speed imaging captures the diaphragm opening dynamics, while pressure and shock velocity measurements along the entire driven section of the shock tube provide key validation data for CFD. Two-dimensional numerical simulations incorporate experimentally measured diaphragm opening profiles, offering detailed insights into flow features and thermodynamic gradients behind the moving shock front. Key parameters, including deceleration and acceleration phases within the shock formation region, shock formation distances, and times, have been quantified. A novel theoretical framework is introduced to correlate these parameters, enabling accurate predictions of shock Mach number evolution under varying conditions. This unified methodology bridges theoretical and experimental gaps, providing a robust foundation for advancing shock tube research and design.</description>

      <title>Artificial and Eddy Viscosity in Large Eddy Simulation Part 1: Temporal and Spatial Schemes</title>

Abstract: We propose a novel method to quantify artificial dissipation in large eddy simulation. Here, artificial dissipation is defined as the residual of the discrete turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) equation. This method is applied to turbulent channel flow at Reynolds number 180 and 550 using a minimum-dissipation model within the OpenFOAM framework, employing both symmetry-preserving and standard OpenFOAM discretizations. Our analysis reveals that artificial viscosity can both produce and dissipate TKE. To quantify the interaction between sub-grid-scale model contributions and numerical error, we introduce viscous activity parameters, which also allow for evaluating the balance between molecular and non-molecular viscosity. Examining temporal discretization schemes, we find that all methods can deliver accurate flow predictions if an appropriate time step is used. For very small time steps, Forward-Euler is more efficient and accurate than Crank-Nicolson, though a better balance of accuracy and computational efficiency for larger time steps, making it preferable for large-scale applications. On collocated meshes, Van Kan's pressure correction method predicts better results than Chorin's. Our spatial discretization study shows that the symmetry-preserving scheme outperforms standard OpenFOAM schemes, as excessive artificial errors from spatial discretization can suppress the LES model. For the symmetry-preserving scheme, both eddy and artificial viscosities vary similarly, with eddy viscosity being dominant. The role of artificial viscosity changes with mesh refinement: on coarse meshes, it mainly dissipates TKE, while on finer meshes, it can produce TKE, counteracting eddy viscosity. The most accurate Reynolds shear stress predictions occur when non-molecular dissipation is nearly zero. For accurate mean flow kinetic energy, larger non-molecular dissipation is needed on finer meshes.</description>

      <title>Artificial and Eddy Viscosity in Large Eddy Simulation Part 2: Turbulence Models</title>

Abstract: This is the second part to our companion paper. The novel method to quantify artificial dissipation proposed in Part 1 is further applied in turbulent channel flow at $\mathrm{Re_\tau}=180$ using various subgrid-scale models, with an emphasis on minimum-dissipation models (QR and AMD). We found that the amount of artificial viscosity is comparable to the eddy viscosity, but their distributions are essentially opposite. The artificial viscosity can either produce turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) in the near wall region or dissipate TKE in the bulk region. The eddy viscosity is almost uniformly distributed across the wall-normal direction and actively damps TKE at the channel center. An eddy viscosity level of $\nu_e/\nu &lt; 22\%$ leads to accurate predictions of flow quantities at the current mesh resolution. The optimal coefficients for the QR model combined with symmetry-preserving discretization were found to be C=0.092 for turbulent kinetic energy and C=0.012 for Reynolds stress terms and large scale motions. Adjusting the QR model coefficient changes the artificial viscosity and significantly impact turbulence characteristics: small-scale motions remain unaffected, while larger scales are less accurately captured with larger coefficients. For error quantification, the SGS activity parameter $\nu_{rel} = \frac{\nu_e}{\nu_e + \nu}$ helps relate and reflect the error magnitude with the SGS model. Optimal coefficients for the AMD model were also identified. The trends of varying the coefficient are similar to the QR model but differ in the amplitude of changes. The AMD model is more sensitive to the model coefficients and introduces more eddy viscosity in the near-wall region compared to the QR model. This research highlights the importance of balancing numerical and eddy viscosities for accurate LES predictions.</description>

      <title>Minimum-dissipation model and symmetry-preserving discretization for scalar transport in a turbulent flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work extends the minimum-dissipation model of large-eddy simulation and symmetry-preserving discretization to account for active or passive scalar transport and complex physical mechanisms.This novel scalar-minimum-dissipation model exhibits several desirable properties. It includes the effect of scalar transport, in addition to shear, on the suppression and production of turbulence. It switches off at no-slip walls, ensuring accurate capture of near-wall flow behavior without needing a wall model. It also switches off in laminar and transitional flows so that it is capable of predicting laminar-turbulent transition. The new scalar-minimum-dissipation model combined with the symmetry-preserving discretization is successfully tested in a differentially heated cavity in OpenFOAM. The results show that the symmetry-preserving discretization significantly improves predictions of flow quantity and heat transfer on highly stretched meshes.</description>
