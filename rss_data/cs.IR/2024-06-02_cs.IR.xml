      <title>Knowledge Enhanced Multi-intent Transformer Network for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating Knowledge Graphs into Recommendation has attracted growing attention in industry, due to the great potential of KG in providing abundant supplementary information and interpretability for the underlying models. However, simply integrating KG into recommendation usually brings in negative feedback in industry, due to the ignorance of the following two factors: i) users' multiple intents, which involve diverse nodes in KG. For example, in e-commerce scenarios, users may exhibit preferences for specific styles, brands, or colors. ii) knowledge noise, which is a prevalent issue in Knowledge Enhanced Recommendation (KGR) and even more severe in industry scenarios. The irrelevant knowledge properties of items may result in inferior model performance compared to approaches that do not incorporate knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel approach named Knowledge Enhanced Multi-intent Transformer Network for Recommendation (KGTN), comprising two primary modules: Global Intents Modeling with Graph Transformer, and Knowledge Contrastive Denoising under Intents. Specifically, Global Intents with Graph Transformer focuses on capturing learnable user intents, by incorporating global signals from user-item-relation-entity interactions with a graph transformer, meanwhile learning intent-aware user/item representations. Knowledge Contrastive Denoising under Intents is dedicated to learning precise and robust representations. It leverages intent-aware representations to sample relevant knowledge, and proposes a local-global contrastive mechanism to enhance noise-irrelevant representation learning. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets show the superior performance of our proposed method over the state-of-the-arts. And online A/B testing results on Alibaba large-scale industrial recommendation platform also indicate the real-scenario effectiveness of KGTN.</description>

      <title>Causal Distillation for Alleviating Performance Heterogeneity in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation performance usually exhibits a long-tail distribution over users -- a small portion of head users enjoy much more accurate recommendation services than the others. We reveal two sources of this performance heterogeneity problem: the uneven distribution of historical interactions (a natural source); and the biased training of recommender models (a model source). As addressing this problem cannot sacrifice the overall performance, a wise choice is to eliminate the model bias while maintaining the natural heterogeneity. The key to debiased training lies in eliminating the effect of confounders that influence both the user's historical behaviors and the next behavior. The emerging causal recommendation methods achieve this by modeling the causal effect between user behaviors, however potentially neglect unobserved confounders (\eg, friend suggestions) that are hard to measure in practice. To address unobserved confounders, we resort to the front-door adjustment (FDA) in causal theory and propose a causal multi-teacher distillation framework (CausalD). FDA requires proper mediators in order to estimate the causal effects of historical behaviors on the next behavior. To achieve this, we equip CausalD with multiple heterogeneous recommendation models to model the mediator distribution. Then, the causal effect estimated by FDA is the expectation of recommendation prediction over the mediator distribution and the prior distribution of historical behaviors, which is technically achieved by multi-teacher ensemble. To pursue efficient inference, CausalD further distills multiple teachers into one student model to directly infer the causal effect for making recommendations.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Enhanced Sequential Recommendation for Long-tail User and Item</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems (SRS) serve the purpose of predicting users' subsequent preferences based on their past interactions and have been applied across various domains such as e-commerce and social networking platforms. However, practical SRS encounters challenges due to the fact that most users engage with only a limited number of items, while the majority of items are seldom consumed. These challenges, termed as the long-tail user and long-tail item dilemmas, often create obstacles for traditional SRS methods. Mitigating these challenges is crucial as they can significantly impact user satisfaction and business profitability. While some research endeavors have alleviated these issues, they still grapple with issues such as seesaw or noise stemming from the scarcity of interactions. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) presents a promising avenue to address these challenges from a semantic standpoint. In this study, we introduce the Large Language Models Enhancement framework for Sequential Recommendation (LLM-ESR), which leverages semantic embeddings from LLMs to enhance SRS performance without increasing computational overhead. To combat the long-tail item challenge, we propose a dual-view modeling approach that fuses semantic information from LLMs with collaborative signals from traditional SRS. To address the long-tail user challenge, we introduce a retrieval augmented self-distillation technique to refine user preference representations by incorporating richer interaction data from similar users. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on three authentic datasets using three widely used SRS models, our proposed enhancement framework demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methodologies.</description>

      <title>Information Maximization via Variational Autoencoders for Cross-Domain Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) methods aim to address the data sparsity and cold-start problems present in Single-Domain Sequential Recommendation (SDSR). Existing CDSR methods typically rely on overlapping users, designing complex cross-domain modules to capture users' latent interests that can propagate across different domains. However, their propagated informative information is limited to the overlapping users and the users who have rich historical behavior records. As a result, these methods often underperform in real-world scenarios, where most users are non-overlapping (cold-start) and long-tailed. In this research, we introduce a new CDSR framework named Information Maximization Variational Autoencoder (\textbf{\texttt{IM-VAE}}). Here, we suggest using a Pseudo-Sequence Generator to enhance the user's interaction history input for downstream fine-grained CDSR models to alleviate the cold-start issues. We also propose a Generative Recommendation Framework combined with three regularizers inspired by the mutual information maximization (MIM) theory \cite{mcgill1954multivariate} to capture the semantic differences between a user's interests shared across domains and those specific to certain domains, as well as address the informational gap between a user's actual interaction sequences and the pseudo-sequences generated. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first CDSR work that considers the information disentanglement and denoising of pseudo-sequences in the open-world recommendation scenario. Empirical experiments illustrate that \texttt{IM-VAE} outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on two real-world cross-domain datasets on all sorts of users, including cold-start and tailed users, demonstrating the effectiveness of \texttt{IM-VAE} in open-world recommendation.</description>

      <title>Popularity-Aware Alignment and Contrast for Mitigating Popularity Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative Filtering (CF) typically suffers from the significant challenge of popularity bias due to the uneven distribution of items in real-world datasets. This bias leads to a significant accuracy gap between popular and unpopular items. It not only hinders accurate user preference understanding but also exacerbates the Matthew effect in recommendation systems. To alleviate popularity bias, existing efforts focus on emphasizing unpopular items or separating the correlation between item representations and their popularity. Despite the effectiveness, existing works still face two persistent challenges: (1) how to extract common supervision signals from popular items to improve the unpopular item representations, and (2) how to alleviate the representation separation caused by popularity bias. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis of popularity bias and propose Popularity-Aware Alignment and Contrast (PAAC) to address two challenges. Specifically, we use the common supervisory signals modeled in popular item representations and propose a novel popularity-aware supervised alignment module to learn unpopular item representations. Additionally, we suggest re-weighting the contrastive learning loss to mitigate the representation separation from a popularity-centric perspective. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and rationale of PAAC in mitigating popularity bias through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/miaomiao-cai2/KDD2024-PAAC.</description>

      <title>SelfGNN: Self-Supervised Graph Neural Networks for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation effectively addresses information overload by modeling users' temporal and sequential interaction patterns. To overcome the limitations of supervision signals, recent approaches have adopted self-supervised learning techniques in recommender systems. However, there are still two critical challenges that remain unsolved. Firstly, existing sequential models primarily focus on long-term modeling of individual interaction sequences, overlooking the valuable short-term collaborative relationships among the behaviors of different users. Secondly, real-world data often contain noise, particularly in users' short-term behaviors, which can arise from temporary intents or misclicks. Such noise negatively impacts the accuracy of both graph and sequence models, further complicating the modeling process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Self-Supervised Graph Neural Network (SelfGNN) for sequential recommendation. The SelfGNN framework encodes short-term graphs based on time intervals and utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn short-term collaborative relationships. It captures long-term user and item representations at multiple granularity levels through interval fusion and dynamic behavior modeling. Importantly, our personalized self-augmented learning structure enhances model robustness by mitigating noise in short-term graphs based on long-term user interests and personal stability. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that SelfGNN outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines. Our model implementation codes are available at https://github.com/HKUDS/SelfGNN.</description>

      <title>CWRCzech: 100M Query-Document Czech Click Dataset and Its Application to Web Relevance Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present CWRCzech, Click Web Ranking dataset for Czech, a 100M query-document Czech click dataset for relevance ranking with user behavior data collected from search engine logs of Seznam.cz. To the best of our knowledge, CWRCzech is the largest click dataset with raw text published so far. It provides document positions in the search results as well as information about user behavior: 27.6M clicked documents and 10.8M dwell times. In addition, we also publish a manually annotated Czech test for the relevance task, containing nearly 50k query-document pairs, each annotated by at least 2 annotators. Finally, we analyze how the user behavior data improve relevance ranking and show that models trained on data automatically harnessed at sufficient scale can surpass the performance of models trained on human annotated data. CWRCzech is published under an academic non-commercial license and is available to the research community at https://github.com/seznam/CWRCzech.</description>

      <title>Designing an Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models in Astronomy Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are shifting how scientific research is done. It is imperative to understand how researchers interact with these models and how scientific sub-communities like astronomy might benefit from them. However, there is currently no standard for evaluating the use of LLMs in astronomy. Therefore, we present the experimental design for an evaluation study on how astronomy researchers interact with LLMs. We deploy a Slack chatbot that can answer queries from users via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); these responses are grounded in astronomy papers from arXiv. We record and anonymize user questions and chatbot answers, user upvotes and downvotes to LLM responses, user feedback to the LLM, and retrieved documents and similarity scores with the query. Our data collection method will enable future dynamic evaluations of LLM tools for astronomy.</description>

      <title>Extending the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark to French</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, numerous embedding models have been made available and widely used for various NLP tasks. Choosing a model that performs well for several tasks in English has been largely simplified by the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), but extensions to other languages remain challenging. This is why we expand MTEB to propose the first massive benchmark of sentence embeddings for French. Not only we gather 22 existing datasets in an easy-to-use interface, but we also create three new French datasets for a global evaluation over 8 different tasks. We perform a large scale comparison with 46 carefully selected embedding models, conduct comprehensive statistical tests, and analyze the correlation between model performance and many of their characteristics. We find out that even if no model is the best on all tasks, large multilingual models pre-trained on sentence similarity perform particularly well. Our work comes with open-source code, new datasets and a public leaderboard.</description>

      <title>Passage-specific Prompt Tuning for Passage Reranking in Question Answering with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective passage retrieval and reranking methods have been widely utilized to identify suitable candidates in open-domain question answering tasks, recent studies have resorted to LLMs for reranking the retrieved passages by the log-likelihood of the question conditioned on each passage. Although these methods have demonstrated promising results, the performance is notably sensitive to the human-written prompt (or hard prompt), and fine-tuning LLMs can be computationally intensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, this approach limits the leverage of question-passage relevance pairs and passage-specific knowledge to enhance the ranking capabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we propose passage-specific prompt tuning for reranking in open-domain question answering (PSPT): a parameter-efficient method that fine-tunes learnable passage-specific soft prompts, incorporating passage-specific knowledge from a limited set of question-passage relevance pairs. The method involves ranking retrieved passages based on the log-likelihood of the model generating the question conditioned on each passage and the learned soft prompt. We conducted extensive experiments utilizing the Llama-2-chat-7B model across three publicly available open-domain question answering datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plagiarism is a pressing concern, even more so with the availability of large language models. Existing plagiarism detection systems reliably find copied and moderately reworded text but fail for idea plagiarism, especially in mathematical science, which heavily uses formal mathematical notation. We make two contributions. First, we establish a taxonomy of mathematical content reuse by annotating potentially plagiarised 122 scientific document pairs. Second, we analyze the best-performing approaches to detect plagiarism and mathematical content similarity on the newly established taxonomy. We found that the best-performing methods for plagiarism and math content similarity achieve an overall detection score (PlagDet) of 0.06 and 0.16, respectively. The best-performing methods failed to detect most cases from all seven newly established math similarity types. Outlined contributions will benefit research in plagiarism detection systems, recommender systems, question-answering systems, and search engines. We make our experiment's code and annotated dataset available to the community: https://github.com/gipplab/Taxonomy-of-Mathematical-Plagiarism</description>

      <title>Multi-hop Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.09140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of Question Answering (QA) has attracted significant research interest for long. Its relevance to language understanding and knowledge retrieval tasks, along with the simple setting makes the task of QA crucial for strong AI systems. Recent success on simple QA tasks has shifted the focus to more complex settings. Among these, Multi-Hop QA (MHQA) is one of the most researched tasks over the recent years. In broad terms, MHQA is the task of answering natural language questions that involve extracting and combining multiple pieces of information and doing multiple steps of reasoning. An example of a multi-hop question would be "The Argentine PGA Championship record holder has won how many tournaments worldwide?". Answering the question would need two pieces of information: "Who is the record holder for Argentine PGA Championship tournaments?" and "How many tournaments did [Answer of Sub Q1] win?". The ability to answer multi-hop questions and perform multi step reasoning can significantly improve the utility of NLP systems. Consequently, the field has seen a surge with high quality datasets, models and evaluation strategies. The notion of 'multiple hops' is somewhat abstract which results in a large variety of tasks that require multi-hop reasoning. This leads to different datasets and models that differ significantly from each other and makes the field challenging to generalize and survey. We aim to provide a general and formal definition of the MHQA task, and organize and summarize existing MHQA frameworks. We also outline some best practices for building MHQA datasets. This book provides a systematic and thorough introduction as well as the structuring of the existing attempts to this highly interesting, yet quite challenging task.</description>

      <title>Improving Text Embeddings with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel and simple method for obtaining high-quality text embeddings using only synthetic data and less than 1k training steps. Unlike existing methods that often depend on multi-stage intermediate pre-training with billions of weakly-supervised text pairs, followed by fine-tuning with a few labeled datasets, our method does not require building complex training pipelines or relying on manually collected datasets that are often constrained by task diversity and language coverage. We leverage proprietary LLMs to generate diverse synthetic data for hundreds of thousands of text embedding tasks across 93 languages. We then fine-tune open-source decoder-only LLMs on the synthetic data using standard contrastive loss. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong performance on highly competitive text embedding benchmarks without using any labeled data. Furthermore, when fine-tuned with a mixture of synthetic and labeled data, our model sets new state-of-the-art results on the BEIR and MTEB benchmarks.</description>
