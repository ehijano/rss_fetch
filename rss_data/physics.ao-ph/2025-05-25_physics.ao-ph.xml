      <title>Turbulent Snow Transport and Accumulation: New Reduced-Order Models and Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling snow particle dynamics in the atmosphere remains a significant challenge for atmospheric scientists, hydrologists, and glaciologists. Temporally and spatially varying rates of snow transport, deposition, and erosion are driven by atmospheric turbulence and further complicated by inertial particle dynamics. Even with perfectly resolved wind fields, accurately predicting the fate of mobile snow particles in wind relies on semi-empirical assumptions embedded in diffeo-integro equations that contain numerical instabilities. The present research couples a modern approach to snow particle drag with model order reduction tools from nonlinear dynamical systems. Coupled with novel accumulation diagnostics, we provide a simplified framework of snow transport with well-defined simplification errors and rigorous physical meaning.</description>

      <title>A statistical study of sea ice thickness and coverage in the Canadian Arctic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Arctic sea ice cover has significantly declined over the recent decades. The debate on whether this decline is caused by anthropogenic activity or internal cycles is still ongoing. However, despite this uncertainty, some physical factors reinforce this declining trend, one of which is sea ice thickness. The thinning of Arctic sea ice facilitates the melting of sea ice by reducing the heat capacity of the ice volume. The progression of this thinning can potentially accelerate sea ice loss. In this work, we attempt to understand the broad relationship of sea ice cover levels and average sea ice thickness in the Arctic. First, we attempt to understand whether the trend in the Arctic sea ice thickness is statistically significant over multi-year and inter-year seasonal scales, by using mostly non-parametric trend analysis tools. We subsequently study how sea ice thickness, as well as its momentum and fluctuations, are statistically correlated to those of sea ice cover in the Arctic. For this task, we use publicly available Arctic sea ice cover and thickness data from 1979 to 2021, provided by the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modelling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) and the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).</description>

      <title>PEAR: Equal Area Weather Forecasting on the Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods for global medium-range weather forecasting have recently received immense attention. Following the publication of the Pangu Weather model, the first deep learning model to outperform traditional numerical simulations of the atmosphere, numerous models have been published in this domain, building on Pangu's success. However, all of these models operate on input data and produce predictions on the Driscoll--Healy discretization of the sphere which suffers from a much finer grid at the poles than around the equator. In contrast, in the Hierarchical Equal Area iso-Latitude Pixelization (HEALPix) of the sphere, each pixel covers the same surface area, removing unphysical biases. Motivated by a growing support for this grid in meteorology and climate sciences, we propose to perform weather forecasting with deep learning models which natively operate on the HEALPix grid. To this end, we introduce Pangu Equal ARea (PEAR), a transformer-based weather forecasting model which operates directly on HEALPix-features and outperforms the corresponding model on Driscoll--Healy without any computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Nonlocally coupled moisture model for convective self-aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clouds play a central role in climate physics by interacting with precipitation, radiation, and circulation. Despite being a fundamental issue in convective organization, the self-aggregation of clouds lacks a theoretical explanation due to its complexity. In this study, we introduce an idealized mathematical model where the system's state is represented solely by the vertically integrated water vapor content of atmospheric columns under the weak temperature gradient approximation. By analyzing the nonlinear dynamics of this simplified system, we mathematically elucidate the mechanisms that determine the onset of self-aggregation and the spatial scale of the self-aggregated state. Nonlocal coupling between atmospheric columns induces bistability, leading to dry and moist equilibria. This reflects the circulation effects driven by horizontal differential heating due to convection and radiation. The bistable self-aggregated state realizes when destabilization by nonlocal coupling, triggered by finite-amplitude disturbances in the uniform state, overcomes stabilization by diffusion. For globally coupled systems where all columns are equally coupled, perturbations with the maximum wavelength exhibit the highest growth rate. This results in a solution with an infinitely long wavelength, understood as the dynamical system's heteroclinic trajectories describing the steady state's spatial evolution. Conversely, for nonlocally coupled systems with finite filter lengths, perturbations with wavelengths close to the characteristic length of the coupling are preferred. The results reveal that the balance between nonlocal coupling and diffusion is essential for understanding convective self-aggregation. Moreover, this study suggests a physical similarity between convective self-aggregation and moisture mode.</description>

      <title>Long-term prediction of El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation using reservoir computing with data-driven realtime filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the application of machine learning approaches to time-series forecasting of climate dynamical phenomena has become increasingly active. It is known that applying a band-pass filter to a time-series data is a key to obtaining a high-quality data-driven model. Here, to obtain longer-term predictability of machine learning models, we introduce a new type of band-pass filter. It can be applied to realtime operational prediction workflows since it relies solely on past time series. We combine the filter with reservoir computing, which is a machine-learning technique that employs a data-driven dynamical system. As an application, we predict the multi-year dynamics of the El Ni\~{n}o-Southern Oscillation with the prediction horizon of 24 months using only past time series.</description>
