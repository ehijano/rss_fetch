      <title>Rock vapour is opaque: implications for dynamics and observations of lava planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme instellation on lava planets causes the rocky surface to melt and vaporize. Because the rock vapour composition is intrinsically tied to the mantle, atmospheric characterization of lava planets can hold valuable insight into the interior processes of rocky planets. To help interpret current data and strategize for future observations, we develop the model SonicVapour to simulate the dynamics of chemically complex secondary atmosphere of lava planets. We find that for planets with surface temperatures exceeding 2700 K, the rock vapour outgassed is optically thick, making the atmosphere vertically isothermal thus suppressing convection and severely limiting atmospheric detection via emission spectroscopy. In contrast, cooler planets with surfaces between 2300 K - 2700 K have an atmospheric opacity close to 50% and produce distinct spectral features. Counter-intuitively, therefore, cooler lava planet atmospheres are easier to detect. Our results ultimately emphasize the importance of considering atmospheric "detectability" in tandem with signal-to-noise for future observation programs.</description>

      <title>On the coincidence between the close passage of HD7977 and the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Oort Cloud's dynamical evolution is significantly influenced by both the galactic tide and stellar flybys. This study investigates the particular case of HD7977's close encounter 2.47 Myr ago, which likely repopulated the Inner Oort Cloud and potentially triggered a significant comet shower on Earth. Our results demonstrate that the shower's intensity strongly depends on HD7977's impact parameter ($b$), with possible flyby distances ranging from 2,300 AU to $\sim$ 13,000 AU. For the closest approach ($b \sim 2,300$ AU), the terrestrial impact probability of 1 km comets increases by an order of magnitude compared to the steady state, slightly exceeding the asteroid impact probability at this size scale. We propose an analytical method to compute the probability of comet showers impacting Earth, which saves considerable computation time compared to N-body simulations. We identify a threshold diameter $D_0 = 2.25$ km for which yields $P = 1$ in our model, with $D_0$ following a logarithmic dependence on $b$. These findings suggest that HD7977's flyby may have caused an enhanced comet flux during the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition, which could plausibly be related to the environmental changes at this era.</description>

      <title>The Transition from Giant Planets to Brown Dwarfs beyond 1 au from the Stellar Metallicity Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant planets and brown dwarfs are thought to form via a combination of pathways, including bottom-up mechanisms in which gas is accreted onto a solid core and top-down mechanisms in which gas collapses directly into a gravitationally-bound object. One can distinguish the prevalence of these mechanisms using host star metallicities. Bottom-up formation thrives in metal-rich environments, whereas top-down formation is weakly dependent on ambient metal content. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model and the results of the California Legacy Survey (CLS), a low-bias and homogeneously analyzed radial velocity survey, we find evidence for a transition in the stellar metallicity distribution at a companion mass of $\gamma = 27_{-8}^{+12} \, M_{\rm Jup}$ for companions with orbital separations between $1-50$ au. Companions below and above this threshold tend to orbit stars with higher ($\rm{[Fe/H]} = 0.17 \pm 0.12$ dex) and lower ($\rm{[Fe/H]} = -0.03 \pm 0.10$ dex) metallicities, respectively. Previous studies of relatively close-in companions reported evidence of a lower transition mass of $\leq 10 \, {\rm M_{\rm Jup}}$. When applied to the CLS sample, our model predicts the probability of a transition in the stellar metallicity distribution at or below $10 \, { M_{\rm Jup}}$ to be $&lt; 1 \%$. We compare our results to estimates of $\gamma$ gleaned from other observational metrics and discuss implications for planet formation theory.</description>

      <title>Functionality of Ice Line Latitudinal EBM Tenacity (FILLET). Protocol Version 1.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Functionality of Ice Line Latitudinal EBM Tenacity (FILLET) project is a CUISINES exoplanet model intercomparison project (exo-MIP) that compares various energy balance models (EBMs) through a series of numerical experiments. The objective is to establish rigorous protocols that enable the identification of intrinsic differences among EBMs that could lead to model-dependent results for past, current, and future EBM studies. Such efforts also provide the community with an EBM ensemble average and standard deviation, rather than a single model prediction, on benchmark cases typically used by EBM studies. These experiments include Earth-like planets at different obliquity, instellation, and carbon dioxide abundance. Here we update the v1.0 protocol (Deitrick et al., 2023) to accommodate the requirements of previously untested community models. In particular, we expand the range of carbon dioxide abundances for Experiment 4 to ensure any code will capture both snowball and ice-free end states. Additionally, participants are now required to report two ice edge latitudes per hemisphere to fully distinguish all climate states (snowball, ice caps, ice belts, and ice-free). The outputs described in FILLET protocol version 1.0 have also now been revised to include the maximum and minimum ice extent, in latitude, for each hemisphere, as well as the diffusion coefficient and outgoing longwave radiative flux.</description>

      <title>Orbital Eccentricities Suggest a Gradual Transition from Giant Planets to Brown Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, hundreds of sub-stellar objects with masses between $1-80\ M_{\rm Jup}$ have been detected orbiting main-sequence stars. The current convention uses the deuterium-burning limit, $M_c \approx 13 M_{\rm Jup}$ to divide this population between giant planets and brown dwarfs. However, this classification heuristic is largely divorced from any formation physics and may not accurately reflect the astrophysical nature of these objects. Previous work has suggested that a transition from ``planet-like'' to ``brown-dwarf-like'' characteristics occurs somewhere in the range $1-10 M_{\rm Jup}$, but precise the crossover mass and whether the transition is gradual or abrupt remains unknown. Here, we explore how the occurrence rate, host star metallicity, and orbital eccentricities vary as a function of mass in a sample of 70 Doppler-detected sub-stellar objects ($0.8 &lt; M_c/M_{\rm Jup} &lt; 80$) from the California Legacy Survey. Our population consists of objects near and beyond the water ice line ($1 &lt; a / \text{AU} &lt; 10$), providing valuable clues to the details of giant planet formation physics at a location in the proto-stellar disk where planet formation efficiency is thought to be enhanced. We find that occurrence rate, host star metallicity, and orbital eccentricity all change gradually across the mass range under consideration, suggesting that ``bottom-up'' core accretion mechanisms and ``top-down'' gravitational instability mechanisms produce objects that overlap in mass. The observed eccentricity distributions could arise either from different formation channels or from post-formation dynamical interactions between massive sub-stellar objects.</description>

      <title>Orbit Elements from Kepler Solutions in Projective Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Closed-Form Kepler solutions in projective coordinates are used to define a corresponding set of eight orbit elements and obtain their governing equations for arbitrarily-perturbed two-body dynamics. The elements and their dynamics are singularity-free in all cases besides rectilinear motion (when angular momentum vanishes). The classic J2-perturbed two-body problem is developed and used for numerical verification.</description>

      <title>Shaping the Mantle: The Role of Superheated Cores After Giant Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Moon-forming giant impact significantly influenced the initial thermal state of Earth's mantle by generating a global magma ocean, marking the onset of mantle evolution. Recent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations indicate that such a collision would produce a superheated core, whose cooling would strongly influence subsequent mantle dynamics. Here, we present systematic SPH simulations of diverse giant-impact scenarios and show that the superheated core formed after the impact can trigger secondary mantle melting, thereby governing the final state of the magma ocean. To further quantify this effect, we employ a parameterized mantle-melting model to evaluate the influence of secondary melting on the lower mantle. Our results suggest three possible outcomes: complete mantle melting, the formation of a basal melt layer, or the initiation of an early superplume. Combined with recent two-phase magma-ocean solidification models, we infer that all three scenarios would result in basal melt layers of varying thickness, partially retaining the thermal energy of the superheated core. In the canonical Moon-forming scenario, the superheated core would rapidly transfer heat to Earth's lower mantle, causing secondary mantle melting within approximately 277--5983 years and generating either a basal melt layer or a fully molten mantle. Both outcomes would effectively erase primordial heterogeneities in the lower mantle and impose distinct pathways for its subsequent thermal evolution.</description>

      <title>The bulk metal content of WASP-80 b from joint interior-atmosphere retrievals: Breaking degeneracies and exploring biases with panchromatic spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WASP-80 b is an unusually low-density exoplanet in tension with the metal-rich composition expected for a planet of its mass. We aim to derive precise constraints on WASP-80 b's bulk metal mass fraction, atmospheric composition, and thermal structure. We conducted a suite of retrievals using three approaches: traditional interior-only, atmosphere-only, and joint interior-atmosphere retrievals. We coupled the open-source models GASTLI and petitRADTRANS, which describe planetary structure and thermal evolution, and atmospheric chemistry and clouds, respectively. Our retrievals combine mass and age with panchromatic spectra from JWST and HST in both transmission (0.5-4 $\mu$m) and emission (1-12 $\mu$m) as observational constraints. We identify two fiducial scenarios. In the first, WASP-80 b has an internal temperature consistent with its age in the absence of external heating sources, and its atmosphere is in chemical equilibrium, with an atmospheric metallicity M/H = 2.75$^{+0.88}_{-0.56}$x solar, a bulk metal mass fraction $Z_{planet}=0.12\pm0.02$, and a core mass $M_{core}=3.49^{+3.49}_{-1.59} \ M_{\oplus}$. In the second scenario, WASP-80 b may be inflated by an additional heat source - possibly induced by magnetic fields - with an atmospheric metallicity M/H = 10.00$^{+8.20}_{-4.75}$x solar, $Z_{planet}=0.28\pm0.11$, and $M_{core}=31.8^{+21.3}_{-17.5} \ M_{\oplus}$. The super-solar M/H and sub-solar C/O ratios in both scenarios suggest late pebble or planetesimal accretion, while additional heating is required to reconcile the data with the more massive core predicted by the core accretion paradigm. In general, joint retrievals are inherently affected by a degeneracy between atmospheric chemistry and internal structure. Together with flexible cloud treatment and an unweighted likelihood, this leads to larger uncertainties in bulk and atmospheric compositions than previously claimed.</description>

      <title>On Bayesian inference considerations and other issues concerning Drake's equation of Astrosociobiology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speculation about the existence of advanced forms of life in the Universe and in our galaxy, has been since ever a subject of fascination and discussion in fiction, as well as in astrophysics, biology and philosophy. The well-known Fermi's 1950s challenge, "Where are the aliens?" has acquired more substance with the realisation of the potentialities of radioastronomy, which led to the paradigmatic Drake's equation. The emergence of astrobiology, together with the discovery up to now of more than seven thousand exoplanets, has brought increasing support to the discussion about putative life cradles. However, after more than six decades, the only quantitative tool available to estimate how widespread is life and, in particular, advanced forms of life, is, besides direct searches, which so far provided no evidence, still Drake's equation. In the present work we review the current knowledge about this equation and present new arguments of multiple origin in order to evaluate one of its most critical terms, namely the one associated to the time span that a technological civilisation must search for detectable signs of the existence and for how long a search must be extended to bear fruits. We propose that this term should be replaced by a more specific one which involves critical parameters in the enterprise of gathering information, such as energy expenditure, searching area and entropy generation. These terms can be regarded as the capability that any cosmic civilisation must show in order to face the challenge of going beyond the climate and other crises that its development inevitably ensues. Our considerations suggest that a typical time span is about a couple of decades, meaning that a successful and systematic searching programme around about hundred stars might take around a few thousand years.</description>

      <title>The Great January Comet of 1910 (C/1910 A1): A Key Opportunity Missed by New Zealand Astronomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: C/1910 A1 was one of the Great Comets of the twentieth century. Although it was widely observed from the Northern Hemisphere, it was first discovered by observers south of the Equator. The comet arrived just months before the widely anticipated apparition of Comet 1P/Halley and was significantly more spectacular. As a result, the two comets were confused, and many who, in later years, talked about how prominent Comet 1P/Halley was in 1910 were often remembering C/1910 A1. In this paper, we present the results of a detailed search through historical records and media publications in Aotearoa / New Zealand, to investigate how extensively C/1910 A1 was observed from New Zealand. We compare our results with observations reported for Comet 1P/Halley later in 1910, finding that surprisingly few observations of C/1910 A1 were made by New Zealand observers. We discuss cases where the comet was misidentified as being an early sighting of 1P/Halley and compare the observations made in New Zealand with international observations/records/accounts. We find that, although the Great January Comet of 1910 was observed from New Zealand, it was witnessed by few compared to other parts of the world, meaning that the apparition of C/1910 A1 was something of a missed opportunity for New Zealand astronomers.</description>

      <title>Thermal infrared characterization of spatially unresolved resident space objects: Prospects from analytical two-component modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the potential of a thermal infrared (IR) space telescope to remotely characterize the component temperatures of a satellite. With the rapid increase in the number of objects launched in recent years, the ability to detect, track, identify and determine the intent of satellites has become of increasing importance. Spectral modeling of satellites from multi-wavelength photometry in the thermal IR is a technique that has the potential to derive information about the temperature and operational status of a satellite in orbit, without the requirement to spatially resolve the target. Previous work has focused on determination of a single/effective temperature for a Resident Space Objects (RSOs) - such as satellites, asteroids, debris and rocket bodies - from remote observations, obtaining mixed results in terms of ability to classify objects. To progress, we explore a two-greybody component spectral model. Using this analytical model, we investigate which temperature characteristics may be identified from unresolved multi-wavelength photometric observations as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio, under the assumption of Poisson noise-dominated data. With this instrument-agnostic framework, we then quantify the potential of this model to discriminate between RSOs with a single temperature (e.g. natural rocks) versus human-made satellites with a chassis and deployed solar panels where significant component temperature differences exist under typical orbital configurations. Last, we comment on promising prospects of this model for applications to existing and future space telescope observations to characterize RSOs from spatially unresolved photometry</description>

      <title>Stellar Flares in the TESS Light Curves of Planet-hosting M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M dwarfs are magnetically active stars that frequently produce flares, which have implications for both stellar evolution and exoplanet studies. Flare occurrence rates and activity levels of M dwarfs correlate with stellar characteristics such as age, mass, and rotation period. We search TESS observations of a known active population of M dwarfs as well as a volume-limited sample of M dwarfs within 15 parsecs. We detect flares in the light curves of these stars, including 276 of 538 M dwarfs within 15 pc, and calculate cumulative flare frequency distributions (FFDs) for each star. Based on flaring behavior, we categorize stars into relatively higher and lower activity groups and fit power laws to their FFDs to compare the power law exponent ($\alpha$) across activity levels. We find $\alpha =1.99 \pm 0.07$ for the combined FFD of the lower activity M dwarfs, compared to averages of $\alpha = 1.94 \pm 0.58$ for highly active stars with 10-100 detected flares, and $\alpha = 2.03 \pm 0.43$ for those with &gt; 100 detected flares, suggesting little evolution in the power law distribution of flares as M dwarfs transition from high to low activity states. The uncertainties for the active star groups reflect the standard deviation of $\alpha$ values across individual stars within each subset. Because stellar flares and associated stellar activity complicate exoplanet observations, we also examine the subset of M dwarfs with JWST transmission spectroscopy follow-up observations in Cycles 1-3. The flares we detect for these targets are consistent with the broader 15 pc sample, providing context for interpreting planetary atmosphere retrievals from JWST spectra.</description>

Abstract: Atmospheric convection behaves differently in hydrogen-rich atmospheres compared to higher mean molecular weight atmospheres due to compositional gradients of tracers. Previous 1D studies predict that when a condensible tracer exceeds a critical mixing ratio in H$_2$-rich atmospheres, convection is inhibited leading to the formation of radiative layers where the temperature decreases faster with height than in convective profiles. We use 3D convection-resolving simulations to test whether convection is inhibited in H$_2$-rich atmospheres when the tracer mixing ratio exceeds the critical threshold, while including processes neglected in 1D, e.g. turbulent mixing and evaporation. We run two sets of simulations. First, we perform simulations initialized on saturated isothermal states and find that compositional gradients can destabilize isothermal atmospheres. Second, we perform simulations initialized on adiabatic profiles which show distinct, stable inhibition layers form when the condensable tracer exceeds the critical threshold. Within the inhibition layer, only a small amount of energy is carried by latent heat flux, and turbulent mixing transports a small amount of tracer upwards, but both are generally too weak to sustain substantial tracer or heat transport. The thermal profile gradually relaxes to a steep radiative state, but radiative relaxation timescales are long. Our results suggest stable layers driven by condensation-induced convective inhibition form in H$_2$-rich atmospheres, including those of sub-Neptune exoplanets.</description>

Abstract: The nature of sub-Neptunes remains unknown due to degeneracies in interior structure solutions. However, a statistical set of small planets with measured masses and radii can be used to test the planet formation theory prediction of large water reservoirs on sub-Neptunes. Here, we investigate whether water is included in photoevaporative mass loss and how much can partition into the rocky and metallic interior. We couple the result of a planetary formation model to evolution models which assume perfect mixing of water with H/He in the envelope or a layered structure. For the mixed envelopes, we also include fractionation during photoevaporative mass-loss. Further, the effect of equilibrium dissolution of water into an assumed magma ocean and into the metallic core is studied for the first time in coupled formation-evolution models. Out of the four tested scenarios, the mass-radius relation of exoplanets is relatively well matched by all scenarios except the one with layered H/He above water. The agreement depends on mass, with better consistency for the model without dissolution below 3 Earth masses and hints of the opposite at higher masses. In contrast to the significant effect of water dissolution, fractionation is not found to alter the properties of the planets for our initial conditions due to initially massive envelopes on all planets. For all scenarios, we quantify the radius valley location and scaling with stellar mass and conclude that water-rich sub-Neptunes mass-radius relations are broadly consistent with observations. Statistical surveys in mass and radius are required for distinction of the scenarios. The dissolution of different volatiles into the planetary interior and solidification of the magma ocean are natural next steps toward a comprehensive treatment of atmosphere-interior interaction in planet evolution models.

      <title>Asteroids fail to retain cometary impact signatures</title>

Abstract: A bombardment of comets is thought to have occurred in the inner solar system as a result of a dynamical instability among the giant planets after gas disk dispersal. Vesta, the second largest asteroid in the main asteroid belt, likely differentiated before gas disk dispersal, implying its crust witnessed the cometary bombardment. The composition of HED meteorites, which represent fragments of Vesta's crust, could therefore have been altered by cometary impacts. Here we combine noble gas mass spectrometry measurements, N-body simulations, collision rate calculations, and impact simulations to estimate the cometary contribution to Vesta. While our dynamical simulations indicate that Vesta likely underwent a significant number of collisions with large comets, we find no xenon cometary signature in HED meteorites. This apparent contradiction arises due to the fact that cometary impacts were at high speeds and Vesta's weak gravitational attraction made it incapable of retaining cometary material. Smaller asteroids are even less likely to retain such material. Therefore, if a cometary xenon signature is ever detected in an asteroid belt object, it must have been acquired during formation, within the same source region as comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and have been implanted later into the asteroid belt.</description>

      <title>Formation of Multiple Dynamical Classes in the Kuiper Belt via Disk Dissipation</title>

Abstract: Planetesimal formation likely lasted for millions of years in the solar nebula, and the cold classicals in the Kuiper Belt are suggested to be the direct products of streaming instability. The presence of minor planetary bodies in the outer solar system and the exo-Kuiper belts provide key constraints to planet formation models. In this work, we connected dust drift and coagulation, planetesimal formation, N-body gravity, pebble accretion, planet migration, planetary core accretion, gap opening, and internal photoevaporation in one modeling framework. We demonstrate that multiple classes of minor planets, or planetesimals, can form during disk dissipation and remain afterwards, including a scattered group, a resonant group, and a dynamically cold group. Significant growth by pebble accretion was prevented by both dynamical heating due to the giant planet in the system and rapid dispersal of the disk toward the end of its lifetime. We also conducted a parameter study which showed that this is not a universal case, where the outcome is determined by the competition for dust between planetesimal formation and pebble accretion. Combining this scenario with sequential planet formation, this model provides a promising pathway toward an outer solar system formation model.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-line profiles from accreting gas giants and their CPDs</title>

Abstract: Far fewer gas giants have been caught in their accretion phase than mature ones are known. Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) instruments will have a higher sensitivity and a smaller inner working angle than instruments up to now, which should allow more productive searches and detailed characterisation. We study the observability of accreting gas giants with METIS, the first-generation ELT spectrograph. We focus on the accretion-tracing hydrogen recombination lines accessible at a resolution R=1e5, mainly Brackett alpha and Pfund-series lines. Our approach is general but we take as a fiducial case. To calculate high-resolution line profiles, we combine a semianalytical multidimensional description of the flow onto an accreting planet and its circumplanetary disc (CPD) with local non-equilibrium shock-emission models. We assume the limiting scenario of no extinction appropriate for gas giants in gaps and negligible contribution from magnetospheric accretion columns. We use simulated detector sensitivities to compute required observing times. Both the planet surface and the CPD surface shocks contribute to the total line profile, which is non-Gaussian and much narrower than the free-fall velocity. For the adopted baseline accretion rate onto the Bra line peak is equal to the photospheric continuum modulated mostly by water features. However, the rotation of the planet broadens the features, helping the shock excess stand out. At Br a, already the continuum of should yield SNR=12 in 4 h. The peak excess should require only about 15 min to reach SNR=3. Br a is a potent planet formation tracer accessible to METIS in little integration time. Resolved line profiles will place independent constraints especially on the mass and radius of an accreting planet, and help identify the accretion mechanism(s) at work.</description>

      <title>A 34.6-day transiting sub-Neptune in the TOI-1422 planetary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TOI-1422 is a G2 V star ($V = 10.6$ mag) known to host a warm Neptune-sized planet, TOI-1422 b, with a mass and radius of about $9M_{\oplus}$ and $4R_{\oplus}$, on a circular orbit with a period of $12.997$ days. An outer planetary candidate in this system had previously been suggested on the basis of a residual signal in the radial velocity (RV) data with a tentative period of $\sim$29 days, along with a possible single transit-like event, although it was not clear at the time whether the two signals belonged to the same companion. In this work, we confirm the presence of a second transiting planet, TOI-1422 c, a sub-Neptune ($R=2.61\pm0.14 R_{\oplus}$) that orbits with a longer period of 34.563 days. This confirmation is based on the detection of three TESS transits, two from newly available sectors, combined with new and archival RV measurements. The sub-Neptune ($\rho_{\rm c}=4.3^{+1.3}_{-1.0}$ g cm$^{-3}$) is more massive than the inner Neptune ($\rho_{\rm b}=0.93^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$ g cm$^{-3}$), having a mass of $M_{\rm c}=14\pm3 M_{\oplus}$, making TOI-1422 a rare anti-ordered system. Furthermore, we detect transit timing variations (TTVs) on the inner planet, with amplitudes of up to 5 hours, suggesting ongoing dynamical interactions. A dynamical analysis that combined TTVs and RVs indicates that planet c alone is unlikely to account for the full TTV amplitude observed on TOI-1422 b. We investigated whether an additional, as yet undetected companion could account for the observed signal, exploring a range of plausible orbital configurations and finding that a low-mass planet located between the two known orbits may be responsible.</description>
