      <title>The TRGB-SBF Project. II. Resolving the Virgo Cluster with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Virgo Cluster is the nearest substantial cluster of galaxies to the Milky Way and a cornerstone of the extragalactic distance scale. Here, we present JWST/NIRCam observations that simultaneously cover the cores and halos of ten galaxies in and around the Virgo Cluster and are designed to perform simultaneous measurements of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and surface brightness fluctuations (SBF). Seven of the targets are within the Virgo Cluster and where we are able to resolve some of the cluster's substructure, while an additional three provide important constraints on Virgo infall. The seven galaxies within Virgo itself all have SBF measurements from the Advanced Camera for Surveys Virgo Cluster Survey (ACSVCS). After adjusting the ACSVCS measurements for the offset from our new JWST TRGB measurements, we determine a distance to the Virgo Cluster of d $=$ 16.17 $\pm$ 0.25 (stat) $\pm$ 0.47 (sys) Mpc. The work presented here is part of a larger program to develop a Population II distance scale through the TRGB and SBF that is completely independent of the prominent Cepheid + Type Ia supernova ladder. The TRGB distances to the galaxies presented here, when combined with future SBF measurements, will provide a crucial step forward for determining whether or not systematic errors can explain the well-known "Hubble tension'' or if there is significant evidence for cracks in the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Milky Way disc formation time encrypted in the chrono-kinematics of the bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method to constrain the formation time of the Milky Way disc using the chrono-kinematic signatures of the inner Galaxy. We construct an O-rich Mira variable sample from the Gaia Long-period Variable catalogue to study the kinematic behaviour of stars with different ages in the inner Galaxy. From the Auriga suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations, we find that the age of the oldest stellar population with imprints of the bar in density and kinematics matches the disc spin-up epoch. This is because stars born before the spin-up show insufficient rotation and are not kinematically cold enough to be efficiently trapped by the bar. We find that the bar kinematic signature disappears for Mira variables with a period shorter than 190 days. Using the period-age relation of Mira variables, we constrain the spin-up epoch of the Milky Way to be younger than $\sim11-12$~Gyr (redshift $\sim3$). We also discuss and compare our method and result to other evidence of the Milky Way spin-up epoch under the context of a realistic age uncertainty. Age uncertainty leads to an overestimation of the disc formation time when performing backward modelling. Our constrain of the spin-up epoch is independent from previous studies because it relies on the kinematics of the inner Galaxy instead of the solar vicinity.</description>

      <title>Dark matter halo properties from spatially integrated HI flux profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolved rotation curves (RCs) are our best probe of the dark matter distribution around individual galaxies. However their acquisition is resource-intensive, rendering them impractical for large-scale surveys and studies at higher redshift. Spatially integrated HI flux profiles on the other hand are observationally abundant and also probe dynamics across the whole HI disc. Despite this, they are typically only studied using the highly compressed linewidth summary statistic, discarding much of the available information. Here we construct a Bayesian model to infer halo properties from the full shape of the spatially integrated 21-cm line profile of a galaxy, utilising all the available information. We validate our model by assessing the consistency of halo parameters obtained from the flux profile with those obtained from RC fits for galaxies where both are available, finding good agreement provided the profile is not strongly asymmetric. We study the relative constraining power (quantified using the Kullback--Leibler divergence of the posterior from the prior), finding the flux profile inference recovers posteriors on generalised Navarro--Frenk--White halo parameters on average three times tighter than those from the linewidth, and in some cases as tight as those from resolved RCs. Finally we introduce and validate a probabilistic empirical model for the spatial distribution of HI, enabling our model to be applied to datasets for which no spatially resolved HI information is available. As the next-generation of HI observatories comes online, our framework will enable mass modelling in new regimes, with particular utility for constraining the dark matter content of galaxies across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>KASHz+SUPER: Evidence of cold molecular gas depletion in AGN hosts at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy released by AGN has the potential to heat or remove the gas of the ISM, thus likely impacting the cold molecular gas reservoir of host galaxies at first, with star formation following on longer timescales. Previous works on high-z galaxies have yielded conflicting results, possibly due to selection biases and other systematics. To provide a reliable benchmark for galaxy evolution models at cosmic noon (z=1-3), two surveys were conceived: SUPER and KASHz, both targeting unbiased X-ray-selected AGN at z&gt;1 that span a wide bolometric luminosity range. In this paper, we assess the effects of AGN feedback on the molecular gas content of host galaxies in a statistically robust, uniformly selected, coherently analyzed sample of AGN at z=1-2.6, drawn from the KASHz and SUPER surveys. By using ALMA data in combination with dedicated SED modeling, we retrieve CO and FIR luminosity as well as $M_*$ of SUPER and KASHz AGN. We selected non-active galaxies from PHIBBS, ASPECS and multiple ALMA/NOEMA surveys of sub-mm galaxies. By matching the samples in z, $M_*$ and $L_{FIR}$, we compared the properties of AGN and non-active galaxies within a Bayesian framework. We find that AGN hosts at given $L_{FIR}$ are on average CO depleted compared to non-active galaxies, confirming what was previously found in the SUPER survey. Moreover, the molecular gas fraction distributions of AGN and non-active galaxies are statistically different, with that of of AGN being skewed to lower values. Our results indicate that AGN can indeed reduce the total cold molecular gas reservoir of their host galaxies. Lastly, by comparing our results with predictions from three cosmological simulations (TNG, Eagle and Simba) filtered to match the observed properties, we confirm already known discrepancies and highlight new ones between observations and simulations.[Abridged]</description>

      <title>QSO MUSEUM II: Search for extended Ly$\alpha$ emission around 8 $z \sim 3$ quasar pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended Ly$\alpha$ emission is routinely found around single quasars (QSO) across cosmic time. However, few studies have investigated how such emission changes in fields with physically associated QSO pairs, which should reside in dense environments and are predicted to be linked through intergalactic filaments. We present VLT/MUSE snapshot observations (45 min./source) to unveil extended Ly$\alpha$ emission on scales of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around the largest sample of physically associated QSO pairs to date, encompassing 8 pairs (14 observed QSOs) at $z$~3 with $i$-band magnitude between 18 and 22.75. The pairs are either at close (~50-100 kpc, 5 pairs) or wide (~450-500 kpc, 3 pairs) separation with velocity differences of $\Delta$v &lt; 2000 km s$^{-1}$. We detect extended emission around 12 of the 14 targeted QSOs and investigate the luminosity, size, kinematics and morphology of these Ly$\alpha$ nebulae. On average, they span 90 kpc and are 2.8 $\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ bright. Irrespective of the QSOs' projected distance, the nebulae often (~45 %) extend toward the other QSO in the pair, leading to asymmetric emission whose flux-weighted centroid is at an offset position from any QSO location. We show that large nebulae are preferentially aligned with the large-scale structure as traced by the two QSOs, and conclude that the cool gas (10$^4$ K) in the CGM traces well the direction of cosmic web filaments. Additionally, the radial profile of the Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness around QSO pairs can be described by a power law with a shallower slope (~$-1.6$) with respect to single QSOs (~$-2$), indicative of increased CGM densities out to large radii and/or enhanced contribution from the intergalactic medium (IGM). The sample presented in this study contains excellent targets for ultra-deep observations to directly study filamentary IGM structures in emission.</description>

      <title>Mapping AGN winds: a connection between radio-mode AGN and the AGN feedback cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a kinematic analysis based on the large Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) dataset of SDSS-IV MaNGA (10.000 galaxies). We have compiled a diverse sample of 594 unique Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), identified through a variety of independent selection techniques, encompassing radio (1.4 GHz) observations, optical emission line diagnostics (BPT), broad Balmer emission lines, mid-infrared colors, and hard X-ray emission. We investigate how ionized gas kinematics behave in these different AGN populations through stacked radial profiles of the [OIII]~5007 emission-line width across each AGN population. We contrast AGN populations against each other (and non-AGN galaxies) by matching samples by stellar mass, [OIII]~5007 luminosity, morphology, and redshift. We find similar kinematics between AGN selected by BPT diagnostics compared to broad-line selected AGN. We also identify a population of non-AGN with similar radial profiles as AGN, indicative of the presence of remnant outflows (or fossil outflows) of a past AGN activity. We find that purely radio-selected AGN display enhanced ionized gas line widths across all radii. This suggests that our radio-selection technique is sensitive to a population where AGN-driven kinematic perturbations have been active for longer durations (potentially due to recurrent activity) than in purely optically selected AGN. This connection between radio activity and extended ionized gas outflow signatures is consistent with recent evidence that suggests radio emission (expected to be diffuse) originated due to shocks from outflows. We conclude that different selection techniques can trace different AGN populations not only in terms of energetics but also in terms of AGN evolutionary stages. Our results are important in the context of AGN duty cycle and highlight IFU data's potential to deepen our knowledge of AGN and galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>The PAU Survey: Enhancing photometric redshift estimation using DEEPz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present photometric redshifts for 1 341 559 galaxies from the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS) over 50.38 ${\rm deg}^{2}$ of sky to $i_{\rm AB}=23$. Redshift estimation is performed using DEEPz, a deep-learning photometric redshift code. We analyse the photometric redshift precision when varying the photometric and spectroscopic samples. Furthermore, we examine observational and instrumental effects on the precision of the photometric redshifts, and we compare photometric redshift measurements with those obtained using a template method-fitting BCNz2. Finally, we examine the use of photometric redshifts in the identification of close galaxy pairs. We find that the combination of samples from W1+W3 in the training of DEEPz significantly enhances the precision of photometric redshifts. This also occurs when we recover narrow band fluxes using broad bands measurements. We show that DEEPz determines the redshifts of galaxies in the prevailing spectroscopic catalogue used in the training of DEEPz with greater precision. For the faintest galaxies ($i_{\rm AB}=21-23$), we find that DEEPz improves over BCNz2 both in terms of the precision (20-50 per cent smaller scatter) and in returning a smaller outlier fraction in two of the wide fields. The catalogues were tested for the identification of close galaxy pairs, showing that DEEPz is effective for the identification of close galaxy pairs for samples with $i_{\rm AB} &lt; 22.5$ and redshift $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6$. In addition, identifying close galaxy pairs common between DEEPz and BCNz2 is a promising approach to improving the purity of the catalogues of these systems.</description>

      <title>The masses, structure and lifetimes of cold clouds in a high-resolution simulation of a low metallicity starburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the cold gas phase in a low metallicity starburst generated in a high-resolution hydrodynamical simulation of a gas-rich dwarf galaxy merger as part of the GRIFFIN project. The simulations resolve (4 M$_\odot$ gas phase mass resolution, $\sim$ 0.1 pc spatial resolution) the multi-phase interstellar medium with a non-equilibrium chemical heating/cooling network at temperatures below $10^4$ K. Massive stars are sampled individually and interact with the ISM through the formation of HII regions and supernova explosions. In the extended starburst phase, the ISM is dominated by cold ($T_\mathrm{gas} &lt; 300$ K) filamentary clouds with self-similar internal structures. The clouds have masses of $10^{2.6}$ - $10^{5.6}$ M$_\odot$ with a power law mass function, $dN/dM \propto M^\alpha$ with $\alpha = -1.78 (\pm 0.08)$. They also follow the Larson relations, in good agreement with observations. We trace the lifecycle of the cold clouds and find that they follow an exponential lifetime distribution and an e-folding time of $\sim$ 3.5 Myr. Clouds with peak masses below $10^4$ M$_\odot$ follow a power law relation with their average lifetime $\tau_\mathrm{life} \propto M^{0.3}_\mathrm{max}$ which flattens out for higher cloud masses at $ &lt; 10$ Myr. A similar relation exists between cloud size at peak mass and lifetime. This simulation of the evolution of a realistic galactic cold cloud population supports the rapid formation and disruption of star-forming clouds by stellar radiation and supernovae on a timescale less than 10 Myr.</description>

      <title>Mapping and characterizing magnetic fields in the Rho Ophiuchus-A molecular cloud with SOFIA/HAWC$+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) Together with gravity, turbulence, and stellar feedback, magnetic fields (B-fields) are thought to play a critical role in the evolution of molecular clouds and star formation processes. We aim to map the morphology and measure the strength of B-fields of the nearby molecular cloud, rho Ophiuchus-A ($\rho$ Oph-A), and then to understand the role of B-fields in regulating star formation and shaping the cloud. We have analyzed the far-infrared (FIR) polarization of thermal dust emission observed by SOFIA/HAWC$+$ at 89 and 154 $\mu$m toward the densest part of $\rho$ Oph-A, which is irradiated by the nearby B3/4 star, Oph-S1. The cloud exhibits well-ordered B-fields with magnetic orientations mainly perpendicular to the ridge of the cloud toward the densest region and B-field strengths are in the range of 0.2-2.5 mG, using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The B-fields are strongest at the densest part of the cloud, which is associated with the starless core SM1, and decreases toward the outskirts of the cloud. By calculating the map of the mass-to-flux ratio, Alfv\'en Mach number, and plasma $\beta$ parameter in $\rho$ Oph-A, we find that the cloud is predominantly magnetically sub-critical, sub-Alfv\'enic, which implies that the cloud is supported by strong B-fields that dominate over gravity, turbulence, and thermal gas energy. Measured B-field strengths at two densest subregions using other methods that account for the compressible mode are relatively lower than that measured with the DCF method but do not significantly change our conclusions on the roles of B-fields relative to gravity and turbulence on star formation. A virial analysis suggests that the cloud is gravitationally unbound. We find that B-fields are sufficiently strong to support the cloud against radiative feedback and to regulate the shape of the cloud.</description>

      <title>Excitation and spatial study of a prestellar cluster towards G+0.693-0.027 in the Galactic centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation in the central molecular zone (CMZ) is suppressed with respect to that of the Galactic disk, and this is likely related to its high turbulent environment. This turbulence impedes the potential detection of prestellar cores. We present the temperature, density, and spatial structure of the CMZ molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027, which has been proposed to host a prestellar cluster in the Sgr B2 region. We analysed multiple HC$_{3}$N rotational transitions that were observed with the IRAM 30m, APEX, Yebes 40m, and GBT radio telescopes, together with SMA+APEX spatially resolved maps. The spectral shape of HC$_{3}$N lines shows three velocity components: a broad component with a line width of 23 km s$^{-1}$ (C1), and two narrow components with line widths of 7.2 and 8.8 km s$^{-1}$ (C2 and C3). This suggests that a fraction of the molecular gas in this cloud is undergoing turbulence dissipation. From a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis we have found H$_{2}$ densities of 2$\times$10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, 5$\times$10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, and 4$\times$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and kinetic temperatures of 140 K, 30 K, and 80 K for C1, C2, and C3, respectively. The spatially resolved maps confirm that the colder and high-density condensations C2 and C3, which peak in the 70-85 km s$^{-1}$ velocity range, are embedded in a more diffuse and warmer gas (C1). The larger-scale structure of the Sgr B2 region shows a hole at 40-50 km s$^{-1}$ that is likely due to a small cloud that shocked the Sgr B2 region and is spatially related with a massive cloud at 60-80 km s$^{-1}$. We propose that the impacting small cloud sequentially triggered the formation of Sgr B2(M), (N), and (S) and the condensations in G+0.693-0.027 during its passage. Based on the analysis of the masses of the two condensations and on the virial parameters, C2 might expand, while C3 might further fragment or collapse.</description>

      <title>Impact of ice growth on the physical and chemical properties of dense cloud cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the effect of time-dependent ice growth on dust grains on the opacity and hence on the dust temperature in a collapsing molecular cloud core, with the aim of quantifying the effect of the dust temperature variations on ice abundances as well as the evolution of the collapse. We employed a one-dimensional collapse model that self-consistently and time-dependently combines hydrodynamics with chemical and radiative transfer simulations. The dust opacity was updated on-the-fly based on the ice growth as a function of location in the core. The results of the fully dynamical model were compared against simulations assuming fixed ice thickness. We found that the ice thickness increases fast and reaches a saturation value of approximately 90 monolayers in the central core (volume density $\sim$$10^4\,\rm cm^{-3}$), and several tens of monolayers at a volume density of $\sim$$10^3\,\rm cm^{-3}$, after only a few $10^5\,\rm yr$ of evolution. The results thus exclude the adoption of thin ($\sim$10 monolayer) ices in molecular cloud simulations except at very short timescales. The differences in abundances and dust temperature between the fully dynamic simulation and those with fixed dust opacity are small; abundances change between the solutions generally within a factor of two. The assumptions on the dust opacity do have an effect on the collapse dynamics through the influence of the photoelectric effect on the gas temperature, and the simulations take a different time to reach a common central density. In conclusion, carrying out chemical simulations using a dust temperature corresponding to a fixed opacity seems to be a good approximation. Still, although at least in the present case its effect on the overall results is limited - as long as the grains are monodisperse - ice growth should be considered to obtain the most accurate representation of the collapse dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Pristine Survey -- XXVII. Journey to the Galactic outskirts -- Mapping the outer halo red giant stars down to the very metal-poor end</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: In the context of Galactic archaeology, the outer halo remains relatively unexplored with respect to its metallicity distribution, merger debris, and the abundance of known very/extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H]&lt;-2.5) stars. Aim: We utilize the Pristine survey's publicly available, Pristine data release 1 (PDR1) and Pristine-Gaia synthetic (PGS) catalogues of photometric metallicities, to select Red Giant Branch (RGB) stars in the outer halo. Methods: The RGB selection pipeline selects giants based on the absence of a well-measured parallax in the brightness range where dwarfs have reasonable parallax estimate from Gaia DR3 data. The photometric distances are calculated using a BaSTI-isochrone fitting code and the photometric metallicities. Results: Photometric distances derived from PDR1- and PGS-giants show typical uncertainties of 12% and a scatter of up to 20% and 40% respectively, when validated against inverted-parallax and Starhorse-code distances. The PDR1-giants catalogue provides a low-to-no bias view of the metallicity structure versus distance compared to the PGS-giants catalogue (with a distance-metallicity selection bias), while the PGS-giants catalogue provides an all-sky view of the outer halo, especially in the VMP end. The PDR1-giants catalogue is used to study the metallicity distribution function of the halo out to ~100 kpc, using Gaussian Mixture Model decomposition. Additionally, we use the PDR1-giants with radial velocities from spectroscopic surveys to map the metallicity view of the integrals-of-motion space where accreted dwarf galaxy debris conserve their orbital parameters for a long time. Using the PGS-giants catalogue, we associate 41 stars tentatively to the stellar counterpart of the Magellanic stream in the VMP end, out to 70 kpc. Conclusions: We publish two RGB catalogues between -4.0&lt;[Fe/H]&lt;+0.1 with reliable photometric distances and metallicities.</description>

      <title>Exploring mass measurements of supermassive black holes in AGN using GAMA photometry and spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of massive photometric surveys, we explore several approaches to estimate the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) from optical ground-based imaging, in each case comparing to the independent SMBH mass measurement obtained from spectroscopic data. We select a case-study sample of 28 type 1 AGN hosted by nearby galaxies from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We perform multi-component spectral decomposition, extract the AGN component and calculate the SMBH mass from the broad H$\alpha$ emission line width and luminosity. The photometric $g$ and $i$ band data is decomposed into AGN+spheroid(+disc)(+bar) components with careful surface brightness fitting. From these, the SMBH mass is estimated using its relation with the spheroid S\'ersic index or effective radius (both used for the first time on ground-based optical imaging of AGN); and the more widely used scaling relations based on bulge or galaxy stellar mass. We find no correlation between the H$\alpha$-derived SMBH masses and those based on the spheroid S\'ersic index or effective radius, despite these being the most direct methods involving only one scaling relation. The bulge or galaxy stellar mass based methods both yield significant correlations, although with considerable scatter and, in the latter case, a systematic offset. We provide possible explanations for this and discuss the requirements, advantages and drawbacks of each method. These considerations will be useful to optimise stategies for upcoming high quality ground-based and space-borne sky surveys to estimate SMBH masses in large numbers of AGN.</description>

      <title>Dark and bright sides of the Broad Line Region clouds as seen in the FeII emission of SDSS RM 102</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contamination from singly ionized iron emission is one of the greatest obstacles to determining the intensity of emission lines in the UV and optical wavelength ranges. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the FeII emission in the bright quasar RM 102, based on the most recent version of the CLOUDY software, with the goal of simultaneously reproducing UV and optical FeII emission. We employ a constant pressure model for the emitting clouds, instead of the customary constant density assumption. The allowed parameter range is broad, with metallicity up to 50 times the solar value and turbulent velocity up to 100 km s$^{-1}$ for a subset of models. We also consider geometrical effects that could enhance the visibility of the non-illuminated faces of the clouds, as well as additional mechanical heating. Our investigation reveals that the broad line region of RM 102 is characterized by highly metallic gas. The observed FeII features provide strong evidence for an inflow pattern geometry that favours the dark sides of clouds over isotropic emission. This study confirms the presence of chemically enriched gas in the broad line region of bright quasars, represented by RM 102, which is necessary to explain the strong FeII emission and its characteristic features. Additionally, we report that CLOUDY currently still lacks certain transitions in its atomic databases which prevents it from fully reproducing some observed FeII features in quasar spectra.</description>

      <title>Virgo Filaments. III. The gas content of galaxies in filaments as predicted by the GAEA semi-analytic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy evolution depends on the environment in which galaxies are located. The various physical processes (ram-pressure stripping, tidal interactions, etc.) that can affect the gas content in galaxies have different efficiencies in different environments. In this work, we examine the gas (atomic \ce{HI} and molecular \ce{H2}) content of local galaxies inside and outside clusters, groups, and filaments as well as in isolation using observational and simulated data. We exploited a catalog of galaxies in the Virgo cluster(including the surrounding filaments) and compared the data against the predictions of the Galaxy Evolution and Assembly(GAEA) semi-analytic model, which has explicit prescriptions for partitioning the cold gas content in its atomic and molecular phases. We extracted from the model a mock catalog that mimics the observational biases and one not tailored to observations to study the impact of observational limits on the results and predict trends in regimes not covered by the current observations. The observations and simulated data show that galaxies within filaments exhibit intermediate cold gas content between galaxies in clusters and isolation. The amount of \ce{HI} is typically more sensitive to the environment than \ce{H2} and low-mass galaxies ($\log_{10} [{\rm M}_{\star} / \rm{M}_{\sun} ] &lt; 10$) are typically more affected than their massive ($\log_{10} [{\rm M}_{\star} / \rm{M}_{\sun} ] &gt; 10$) counterparts. Considering only model data, we identified two distinct populations among filament galaxies present in similar proportions: those simultaneously lying in groups and isolated galaxies. The former has properties more similar to cluster and group galaxies, and the latter is more similar to those of field galaxies. We therefore did not detect filaments' strong effects on galaxies' gas content, and we ascribe the results to the presence of groups in filaments.</description>

      <title>Optical variability of Gaia CRF3 sources with robust statistics and the 5000 most variable quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the light curve time series data for more than 11.7 million variable sources published in the Gaia Data Release 3, the average magnitudes, colors, and variability parameters have been computed for 0.836 million Gaia CRF objects, which are mostly quasars and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). To mitigate the effects of occasional flukes in the data, robust statistical measures have been employed, namely, the median, median absolute deviation, and Spearman correlation. We find that the majority of the CRF sources have moderate amplitudes of variability in the Gaia $G$ band just below 0.1 mag. The heavy-tailed distribution of variability amplitudes (quantified as robust standard deviations) does not find a single analytical form, but is closer to Maxwell distribution with a scale of 0.078 mag. The majority of CRF sources have positive correlations between $G$ magnitude and $G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP}$ colors, meaning that these quasars and AGNs become bluer when they are brighter. The variations in the BP and RP bands are also mostly positively correlated. Dependencies of all variability parameters with cosmological redshift are fairly flat for the more accurate estimates above redshift 0.7, while the median color shows strong systematic variations with redshift. Using a robust normalized score of magnitude deviations, a sample of 5000 most variable quasars is selected and published. The intersection of this sample with the ICRF3 catalog shows a much higher rate of strongly variable quasars (mostly, blazars) in ICRF3.</description>

      <title>Mapping radial abundance gradients with Gaia-ESO open clusters: Evidence of recent gas accretion in the Milky Way disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Recent evidences from spectroscopic surveys point towards the presence of a metal-poor, young stellar population in the chemical thin disk. In this context, the investigation of the spatial distribution and time evolution of precise, unbiased abundances is fundamental to disentangle the scenarios of evolution of the Galaxy. Aims. We study the evolution of abundance gradients in the Milky Way by taking advantage of a large sample of open clusters, which are among the best tracers for this purpose. In particular, we use data from the last release of the Gaia-ESO survey. Methods. We perform careful selection of open cluster stars excluding those that may be affected by biases in spectral analysis. The cleaned open clusters sample is compared with detailed chemical evolution models for the Milky Way, using well tested stellar yields and prescription for radial migration. Different scenarios of Galaxy evolution are tested to explain the data, i.e. the two-infall and the three-infall frameworks, suggesting that the chemical thin disk is formed by one or two subsequent gas accretion episodes, respectively. Results. With the performed selection in cluster stars, we still find a metallicity decrease between intermediate age (1&lt;Age/Gyr&lt;3) and young (Age&lt;1Gyr) open clusters. This decrease cannot be explained in the context of the two-infall scenario, even by accounting for the effect of migration and yield prescriptions. The three-infall model, with its late gas accretion in the last 3 Gyr, can explain the low metallic content in young clusters. However, we invoke a milder metal dilution relative to previous findings. Conclusions. To explain the observed low metallic content in young clusters, we propose that a late gas accretion episode triggering metal dilution should have taken place, extending the framework of the three-infall model for the first time to the entire Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>Broad-line Region of the Quasar PG 2130+099. II. Doubling the Size Over Four Years?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past three decades, multiple reverberation mapping (RM) campaigns conducted for the quasar PG 2130+099 have exhibited inconsistent findings with time delays ranging from $\sim$10 to $\sim$200 days. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the geometry and dynamics of the broad-line region (BLR) in PG 2130+099, we continued an ongoing high-cadence RM monitoring campaign using the Calar Alto Observatory 2.2m optical telescope for an extra four years from 2019 to 2022. We measured the time lags of several broad emission lines (including He II, He I, H$\beta$, and Fe II) with respect to the 5100 {\AA} continuum, and their time lags continuously vary through the years. Especially, the H$\beta$ time lags exhibited approximately a factor of two increase in the last two years. Additionally, the velocity-resolved time delays of the broad H$\beta$ emission line reveal a back-and-forth change between signs of virial motion and inflow in the BLR. The combination of negligible ($\sim$10%) continuum change and substantial time-lag variation (over two times) results in significant scatter in the intrinsic $R_{\rm H\beta}-L_{\rm 5100}$ relationship for PG 2130+099. Taking into account the consistent changes in the continuum variability time scale and the size of the BLR, we tentatively propose that the changes in the measurement of the BLR size may be affected by 'geometric dilution'.</description>

      <title>Magnetising galaxies with cold inflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-redshift ($z\sim2-3$) galaxies accrete circumgalactic gas through cold streams. Recent high-resolution MHD simulations of these streams showed a significant amplification of the intergalactic magnetic field in the shear layer around them. In this work we estimate the magnetisation of high-redshift galaxies that would result purely due to the accretion of already magnetised gas from cold streams. We use the mass inflow rates and saturated magnetic field values from cold stream simulations as input to a simple analytic model that calculates the galactic magnetic field purely from mass accretion. Our model predicts average magnetic field strengths that exceed $\rm\mu G$ values at $z\sim 2-3$ for inflow rates above $0.1 \, \rm{M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}$. For high inflow rates, our model results are consistent with the recent detection of a strong magnetic field in a $z=2.6$ galaxy by Geach et al. (2023). Within the assumptions of our simple model, magnetised cold streams emerge as a viable mechanism for seeding a dynamically important galactic magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Intensity mapping of intergalactic Lyman-$\alpha$ haloes before reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the inferred evolution of Lyman-$\alpha$ luminosities of galaxies in the redshift range of $z \sim 9-16$ from the $James \ Webb \ Space \ Telescope$ (JWST) data to predict the power spectrum of Loeb-Rybicki haloes formed by scattered Lyman-$\alpha$ radiation in the diffuse intergalactic hydrogen before reionization. We find excellent prospects for a statistical detection of the intensity mapping signal with current and future experiments such as the JWST, SPHEREx and CDIM. We also describe the detectability of the signal in cross-correlation with the 21-cm emission from atomic hydrogen in the intergalactic medium at these redshifts. We find that the cross-correlation signal should be detectable at a significance of a few tens of standard deviations out to $z \sim 16$ using the above experiments in combination with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-LOW and its pathfinder, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).</description>

      <title>The cosmic rate of Pair-Instability Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) have crucial implications for many astrophysical topics, including the search for very massive stars, the black hole mass spectrum, and galaxy chemical enrichment. To this end, we need to understand where PISNe are across cosmic time, and what are their favourable galactic environments. We present a new determination of the PISN rate as a function of redshift, obtained by combining up-to-date stellar evolution tracks from the PARSEC and FRANEC codes, with an up-to-date semi-empirical determination of the star formation rate and metallicity evolution of star-forming galaxies throughout cosmic history. We find the PISN rate to exhibit a huge dependence on the model assumptions, including the criterion to identify stars unstable to pair production, and the upper limit of the stellar initial mass function. Remarkably, the interplay between the maximum metallicity at which stars explode as PISNe, and the dispersion of the galaxy metallicity distribution, dominates the uncertainties, causing a $\sim$ seven-orders-of-magnitude PISN rate range. Furthermore, we show a comparison with the core-collapse supernova rate, and study the properties of the favourable PISN host galaxies. According to our results, the main contribution to the PISN rate comes from metallicities between $\sim 10^{-3}$ and $10^{-2}$, against the common assumption that views very-low-metallicity, Population III stars as exclusive or dominant PISN progenitors. The strong dependencies we find offer the opportunity to constrain stellar and galaxy evolution models based on possible future (or the lack of) PISN observations.</description>

      <title>On the Cosmic Variance of the Merger Rate Density of Binary Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic variance on the star formation history may lead to bias to the merger rate density estimation of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers by the compact binary population synthesis. In this paper, we take the advantage of the large boxsize of the Millennium Simulation combined with the semi-analytic galaxy formation model GABE, and the parameterized population binary star evolution (BSE) model to examine how much effect will the cosmic variance introduce on the estimation of merger rate density of BNS mergers. We find that for sub-box size of $100\rm Mpc$ and $200\rm Mpc$, the variance of merger rate density $\sigma_{\rm R}/\rm R$ at different redshift is about $23\%-35\%$ and $13\%-20\%$ respectively. On one hand, as for the variance of the detection rate on BNS mergers with current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detector network, this value is very small $\lesssim 10\%$, which indicates ignoring the cosmic variance is reasonable for estimating the merger rate density from current LVK observation. On the other hand, with next-generation gravitational wave detectors, it is possible to localize BNS mergers within sub-boxes possessing length of $\rm 40 Mpc$ for source redshift $z_{s}&lt;0.2$. In such a small box, the cosmic variance of the merger rate density is significant, i.e., the value of $\sigma_{\rm R}/\rm R$ is about $\sim 55\%$. This hints that estimating the merger rate density of BNS in different sky areas may provide useful information on the cosmic variance.</description>

      <title>Millimetre observations of the S-type AGB star $\chi$ Cygni: variability of the emission of the inner envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17000</link>

Abstract: New observations are presented of millimetre line emissions of the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of AGB star $\chi$ Cygni using the recently upgraded NOEMA array. $\chi$ Cygni is an S-type Mira variable, at the border between oxygen-rich and carbon-rich, that has been observed for over 40 years to display features giving evidence for the strong role played by pulsation-associated shock waves in the generation of its wind. The new observations give evidence for a bright H$^{12}$CN(3-2) line emission confined to the very close neighbourhood of the star, however significantly more extended in 2024 than in 2023. Interpretation of such variability in terms of maser emission is considered but found to raise significant unanswered questions. Moreover, other unexpected features are observed in the very close neighbourhood of the star, including low Si$^{16}$O(6-5)/Si$^{17}$O(6-5), $^{28}$SiO(5-4)/$^{29}$SiO(5-4) and $^{12}$CO(2-1)/$^{13}$CO(2-1) line emission ratios. Possibly confirming the important role played by shocks, we discuss a measurement of the SiO(5-4)/SiO(6-5) emission ratio, evidence for a recent mass ejection particularly enhanced in the north-western red-shifted octant of the circumstellar envelope, leaving a depression of emission in its wake, and patterns of enhanced CO(2-1) line-emission suggesting an interpretation in terms of episodic outflows enhanced over solid angles associated with the surface of convective cells and on a time scale of a few decades. Unravelling the mechanisms underlying such newly observed features is very challenging and confirmation of the reported observations with improved sensitivity and angular resolution would be highly welcome. Observation of SiO maser emission in the ($\nu$=1,$J$=6-5) transition is reported for the first time.</description>

      <title>The size of accretion disks from self-consistent X-ray spectra + UV/optical/NIR photometry fitting: applications to ASASSN-14li and HLX-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement a standard thin disk model with the outer disk radius ($R_{\rm out}$) as a free parameter, integrating it into standard X-ray fitting package to enable self-consistent and simultaneous fitting of X-ray spectra and UV/optical/NIR photometry. We apply the model to the late-time data ($\Delta t \approx 350-1300$ days) of the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-14li. We show that at these late-times the multi-wavelength emission of the source can be fully described by a bare compact accretion disk. We obtain a black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) of $7^{+3}_{-2}\times10^{6} M_{\odot}$, consistent with host-galaxy scaling relations; and an $R_{\rm out}$ of $45 \pm 13 \, R_{\rm g}$, consistent with the circularization radius, with possible expansion at the latest epoch. We discuss how simplistic models, such as a single-temperature blackbody fitted to either X-ray spectra or UV/optical photometry, lead to erroneous interpretations on the scale/energetics of TDE emission. We also apply the model to the soft/high state of the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) candidate HLX-1. The model fits the full spectral energy distribution (from X-rays to NIR) without needing an additional stellar population component. We investigate how relativistic effects improve our results by implementing a version of the model with full ray tracing calculations in the Kerr metric. For HLX-1, we find $M_{\rm BH} = 4^{+3}_{-1} \times 10^{4} M_{\odot}$ and $R_{\rm out} \approx {\rm few} \times 10^{3} \, R_{\rm g}$, in agreement with previous findings. The relativistic model can constrain the inclination ($i$) of HLX-1 to be $20^o \leq i \leq 70^o$.</description>

      <title>Back from the dead: AT2019aalc as a candidate repeating TDE in an AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. To date, three nuclear transients have been associated with high-energy neutrino events. These transients are generally thought to be powered by tidal disruptions of stars (TDEs) by massive black holes. However, AT2019aalc, hosted in a Seyfert-1 galaxy, was not yet classified due to a lack of multiwavelength observations. Interestingly, the source has re-brightened 4 years after its discovery. Aims. We aim to classify the transient and explain the mechanism responsible for its second optical flare. Methods. We conducted a multi-wavelength monitoring program (from radio to X-rays) of AT2019aalc during its re-brightening in 2023. Results. The observations revealed a uniquely bright UV counterpart and multiple X-ray flares during the second optical flaring episode of the transient. The second flare, similarly to the first one, is also accompanied by IR dust echo emission. A long-term radio flare is found with an inverted spectrum. Optical spectroscopic observations reveal the presence of Bowen Fluorescence lines and strong high-ionization coronal lines indicating an extreme level of ionization in the system. Conclusions. The results suggest that the transient can be classified as a Bowen Fluorescence Flare (BFF), a relatively new sub-class of flaring active galactic nuclei (AGN). AT2019aalc can be also classified as an extreme coronal line emitter (ECLE). We found that, in addition to AT2019aalc, another BFF AT2021loi is spatially coincident with a high-energy neutrino event. The multi-wavelength properties of these transients suggest a possible connection between ECLEs, BFFs and TDEs in AGN.</description>

      <title>Different regulation of stellar metallicities between star-forming and quiescent galaxies -- Insights into galaxy quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most important questions in astrophysics is what causes galaxies to stop forming stars. Previous studies have shown a tight link between quiescence and black hole mass. Other studies have revealed that quiescence is also associated with 'starvation', the halting of gas inflows, which results in the remaining gas being used up by star formation and in rapid chemical enrichment. In this work, we find the missing link between these two findings. Using a large sample of galaxies, we uncover the intrinsic dependencies of the stellar metallicity on galaxy properties. In the case of star-forming galaxies, stellar metallicity is primarily driven by stellar mass. However, for passive galaxies, the stellar metallicity is primarily driven by the stellar velocity dispersion. The latter is known to be tightly correlated with black hole mass. This result can be seen as connecting previous studies, where the integrated effect of black hole feedback (i.e. black hole mass, traced by the velocity dispersion) prevents gas inflows, starving the galaxy, which is seen by the rapid increase in the stellar metallicity, and leading to the galaxy becoming passive.</description>

      <title>The evolution of galaxy morphology from redshift z=6 to 3: Mock JWST observations of galaxies in the ASTRID simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present mock JWST observations for more than 250,000 different galaxies from the Astrid simulation with $3 \leq z \leq 6$. The mock observations are made using the BPASS stellar SED model, and a simple dust model. They are then viewed through NIRCam filters, convolved with a PSF, have noise added, and are drizzled together to emulate the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey. We analyse this dataset by computing a number of morphological measures and find our catalog to have comparable statistics to similar mock catalogs, and the first release of CEERS data. We find that most of the Sersic indices of galaxies in our redshift range are lower than observed, with most having n less than one. Additionally, we observe the sizes of galaxies of all masses to increase from redshift z=6 to redshift z=3 consistent with other results. The number of galaxies in our catalog allows us to examine how relationships like the mass-size relation evolve with redshift, and compare the accuracy of a variety of traditional galaxy classification techniques (Sersic fit, Asymmetry-Concentration, and Gini-$M_{20}$) within our redshift range. We find the mass-size relation to be nearly flat at redshift z=6, and consistently increases as redshift decreases, and find the galaxy classification methods have minimal correlation with each other in our redshift range. We also investigate the impact that different stages of our imaging pipeline have on these morphological measures to determine how robust mock catalogs are to different choices at each step. Finally, we test the addition of incorporating light from AGNs into our pipeline and find that while the population of galaxies that have significant AGN luminosity is low, those galaxies do tend to have higher Sersic indices once the AGN luminosity is added, rectifying some of the systematic bias towards lower Sersic indices present in our dataset.</description>

      <title>AXES-2MRS: A new all-sky catalogue of extended X-ray galaxy groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new all-sky catalogue of X-ray detected groups (AXES-2MRS), based on the identification of large X-ray sources found in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) with the Two Micron Redshift Survey (2MRS) Bayesian Group Catalogue. We study the basic properties of these galaxy groups to gain insights into the effect of different group selections on the properties. In addition to X-ray luminosity coming from shallow survey data of RASS, we have obtained detailed X-ray properties of the groups by matching the AXES-2MRS catalogue to archival X-ray observations by XMM-Newton and complemented this by adding the published XMM-Newton results on galaxy clusters in our catalogue. We analyse temperature and density to the lowest overdensity accessible by the data, obtaining hydrostatic mass estimates and comparing them to the velocity dispersions of the groups. We find a large spread in the central mass to virial mass ratios for galaxy groups in the XMM-Newton subsample. This can either indicate large non-thermal pressure of galaxy groups affecting our X-ray mass measurements, or the effect of a diversity of halo concentrations on X-ray properties of galaxy groups. Previous catalogues, based on detecting the peak of the X-ray emission preferentially sample the high-concentration groups, while our new catalogue includes many low-concentration groups.

      <title>No top-heavy stellar initial mass function needed: the ionizing radiation of GS9422 can be powered by a mixture of AGN and stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST is producing high-quality rest-frame optical and UV spectra of faint galaxies at $z&gt;4$ for the first time, challenging models of galaxy and stellar populations. One galaxy recently observed at $z=5.943$, GS9422, has nebular line and UV continuum emission that appears to require a high ionizing photon production efficiency. This has been explained with an exotic stellar initial mass function (IMF), 10-30x more top-heavy than a Salpeter IMF (Cameron et al. 2023). Here we suggest an alternate explanation to this exotic IMF. We use a new flexible neural net emulator for CLOUDY, Cue, to infer the shape of the ionizing spectrum directly from the observed emission line fluxes. By describing the ionizing spectrum with a piece-wise power-law, Cue is agnostic to the source of the ionizing photons. Cue finds that the ionizing radiation from GS9422 can be approximated by a double power law characterized by $\frac{Q_\mathrm{HeII}}{Q_\mathrm{H}} = -1.5$, which can be interpreted as a combination of young, metal-poor stars and a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN) with $F_{\nu} \propto \lambda ^ {2}$ in a 65%/35% ratio. This suggests a significantly lower nebular continuum contribution to the observed UV flux (24%) than a top-heavy IMF ($\gtrsim80$%), and hence, necessitates a damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorber (DLA) to explain the continuum turnover bluewards of $\sim1400$ Angstrom. While current data cannot rule out either scenario, given the immense impact the proposed top-heavy IMF would have on models of galaxy formation, it is important to propose viable alternative explanations and to further investigate the nature of peculiar high-z nebular emitters.</description>

      <title>Emission-line galaxies at $z\sim1$ from near-IR HST Slitless Spectroscopy: metallicities, star formation rates and redshift confirmations from VLT/FORS2 spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We follow up emission line galaxies identified through the near-infrared slitless HST/WFC3 WISP survey with VLT/FORS2 optical spectroscopy. Over 4 WISP fields, we targetted 85 of 138 line emission objects at $0.4&lt;z&lt;2$ identified in WFC3 spectroscopy. Half the galaxies are fainter than $H_{AB}=24$mag, and would not have been included in many well-known surveys based on broad-band magnitude selection. We confirm 95% of the initial WFC3 grism redshifts in the 38 cases where we detect lines in FORS2 spectroscopy. However, for targets which exhibited a single emission line in WFC3, up to 65% at $z&lt;1.28$ did not have expected emission lines detected in FORS2 and hence may be spurious (although this false-detection rate improves to 33% using the latest public WISP emission line catalogue). From the Balmer decrement the extinction of the WISP galaxies is consistent with $A($H$\alpha)=1$mag. From SED fits to multi-band photometry including Spitzer $3.6\mu$m, we find a median stellar mass of $\log_{10}(M/M_{\odot})=8.94$. Our emission-line-selected galaxies tend to lie above the star-forming main sequence (i.e. higher specific star formation rates). Using [OIII], [OII] and H$\beta$ lines to derive gas-phase metallicities, we find typically sub-solar metallicities, decreasing with redshift. Our WISP galaxies lie below the $z=0$ mass-metallicity relation, and galaxies with higher star formation rates tend to have lower metallicity. Finally, we find a strong increase with redshift of the H$\alpha$ rest-frame equivalent width in this emission-line selected sample, with higher $EW_0$ galaxies having larger [OIII]/H$\beta$ and O32 ratios on average, suggesting lower metallicity or higher ionisation parameter in these extreme emission line galaxies.</description>

      <title>Cepheid Metallicity in the Leavitt Law (C- MetaLL) survey: VI: Radial abundance gradients of 29 chemical species in the Milky Way Disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids (DCEPs) are crucial for calibrating the extragalactic distance ladder, ultimately enabling the determination of the Hubble constant through the PL and PW relations they exhibit. Hence it's vital to understand how the PL and PW relations depend on metallicity. This is the purpose of the C-MetaLL survey within which this work is situated. DCEPs are also very important tracers of the young populations placed along the Galactic disc. We aim to enlarge the sample of DCEPs with accurate abundances from high-resolution spectroscopy. Our goal is to extend the range of measured metallicities towards the metal-poor regime to better cover the parameter space. We observed objects in a wide range of Galactocentric radii, allowing us to study in detail the abundance gradients present in the Galactic disc. We present the results of the analysis of 331 spectra obtained for 180 individual DCEPs with a variety of high-resolution spectrographs. We derived accurate atmospheric parameters, radial velocities, and abundances for up to 29 different species. The iron abundances range between 0.5 and -1 dex with a rather homogeneous distribution in metallicity. The sample presented in this paper was complemented with that already published in the context of the C-MetaLL survey, resulting in a total of 292 pulsators whose spectra have been analysed in a homogeneous way. These data were used to study the abundance gradients of the Galactic disc in a range of Galactocentric radii spanning the range 5-20 kpc. For most of the elements we found a clear negative gradient, with a slope of -0.071\pm0.003 dex kpc^-1 for [Fe/H] case. Through a qualitative fit with the Galactic spiral arms we shown how our farthest targets (R_GC&gt;10 kpc) trace both the Outer and OSC arms. The homogeneity of the sample will be of pivotal importance for the study of the metallicity dependance of the DCEP PL relations.</description>

      <title>Gravothermal Catastrophe in Resonant Self-interacting Dark Matter Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model featuring a velocity-dependent cross section with an order-of-magnitude resonant enhancement of the cross section at $\sim 16\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$. To understand the implications for the structure of dark matter halos, we perform N-body simulations of isolated dark matter halos of mass $\sim 10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot$, a halo mass selected to have a maximum response to the resonance. We track the core formation and the gravothermal collapse phases of the dark matter halo in this model and compare the halo evolving with the resonant cross section with halos evolving with velocity-independent cross sections. We show that dark matter halo evolution with the resonant cross section exhibits a deviation from universality that characterizes halo evolution with velocity-independent cross sections. The halo evolving under the influence of the resonance reaches a lower minimum central density during core formation. It subsequently takes about $20\%$ longer to reach its initial central density during the collapse phase. These results motivate a more detailed exploration of halo evolution in models with pronounced resonances.</description>

      <title>JWST's PEARLS: resolved study of the stellar and dust components in starburst galaxies at cosmic noon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) contribute significantly to the stellar buildup at cosmic noon. Major mergers and gas accretion are often invoked to explain DSFGs' prodigious star-formation rates (SFRs) and large stellar masses. We conducted a spatially-resolved morphological analysis of the rest-frame UV/NIR emission in three DSFGs at z~2.5. Initially discovered as CO emitters by NOEMA observations of a bright Herschel source, we observed them with the JWST/NIRCam as part of the PEARLS program. The NIRCam data reveal the galaxies' stellar populations and dust distributions on scales of 250 pc. Spatial variations in stellar mass, SFR, and dust extinction are determined in resolved maps obtained through pixel-based SED fitting. The CO emitters are massive, dusty starburst galaxies with SFRs=340-2500 Msun/yr, positioning them among the most active SFGs at 2&lt;z&lt;3. They belong to the ~1.5% of the entire JWST population with extremely red colors. Their morphologies are disk like, with radii of 2.0-4.4 kpc, and exhibit substructures such as clumps and spiral arms. The galaxies have dust extinctions up to Av=5-7 mag extending over several kpc with asymmetric distributions that include off-center regions resembling bent spiral arms and clumps. Their NIR dust-attenuation curve deviates from standard laws, possibly implying different dust-star geometries or dust grain properties than commonly assumed in starburst galaxies. The proximity of galaxies with consistent redshifts, strong color gradients, an overall disturbed appearance, asymmetric dust obscuration, and widespread star formation collectively favor interactions (minor mergers and flybys) as the mechanism driving the CO galaxies' exceptional SFRs. The galaxies' large masses and rich environment hint at membership in two proto-structures, as initially inferred from their association with a Planck-selected high-z source.</description>

Abstract: Stellar ages are an important parameter to study the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. In recent years, several studies have established the existence of a relationship between chemical clocks and stellar ages. The [Y/Mg] clock is a promising technique, but there are still several open questions, such as its validity for metal-poor stars and differences between the thin and thick disk populations. Our aim is to study the behaviour of the [Y/Mg] chemical clock with stellar ages and the effect of metallicity and population on this chemical clock for a sample of solar-type disk stars. We have derived the precise stellar atmospheric parameters as well as the elemental abundances of Mg and Y through line-by-line differential spectroscopic analysis for a sample of 48 metal-poor solar-type stars based on high-quality, high-resolution ESO/HARPS spectra. From the high-precision Gaia astrometric data, stellar masses and ages were estimated through isochrone-fitting. A joint analysis of our sample, together with a sample of 185 solar-twins and analogues from our previous works, is performed to calibrate the [Y/Mg] chemical clock in the Galactic disk for $-$0.71 $\leq$ [Fe/H] $&lt;$ +0.34. Open clusters and stars with asteroseismic ages have been used to validate our relations. Two different populations could be clearly seen in the [Mg/Fe] - [Fe/H] plane - the thick and thin disks. We found a metallicity-dependent, strong anti-correlation between the [Y/Mg] ratio and stellar ages of our sample. For the first time in the literature, we report similar correlations for the thin and thick disk stars. The [Y/Mg] relation(s) found here for solar-type stars is compatible with the literature using solar-twins. Our relation provides higher accuracy and precision of 0.45 and 0.99 Gyr, respectively, comparable with the best accuracy achieved for the solar-twins till date.</description>

      <title>Isotopic abundance of carbon in the DLA towards QSO B1331+170</title>

Abstract: Chemical evolution models predict a gradual build-up of $^{13}$C in the universe, based on empirical nuclear reaction rates and assumptions on the properties of stellar populations. However, old metal-poor stars within the Galaxy contain more $^{13}$C than is predicted, suggesting that further refinements to the models are necessary. Gas at high redshift provides important supplementary information at metallicities $-2\lesssim$ [Fe/H] $\lesssim-1$, for which there are only a few measurements in the Galaxy. We obtained new, high-quality, VLT/ESPRESSO observations of the QSO B1331+170 and used them to measure $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C in the damped Lyman-$\alpha$ system (DLA) at $z_{abs}=1.776$, with [Fe/H]=-1.27. AI-VPFIT, an Artificial Intelligence tool based on genetic algorithms and guided by a spectroscopic information criterion, was used to explore different possible kinematic structures of the carbon gas. Three hundred independent AI-VPFIT models of the absorption system were produced using pre-set $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C values, ranging from 4 to 500. Our results show that $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C$=28.5^{+51.5}_{-10.4}$, suggesting a possibility of $^{13}$C production at low metallicity.</description>

      <title>The Radio Galaxy Environment Reference Survey (RAGERS): a submillimetre study of the environments of massive radio-quiet galaxies at $z = 1{\rm -}3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21099</link>

Abstract: Measuring the environments of massive galaxies at high redshift is crucial to understanding galaxy evolution and the conditions that gave rise to the distribution of matter we see in the Universe today. While high-$z$ radio galaxies (H$z$RGs) and quasars tend to reside in protocluster-like systems, the environments of their radio-quiet counterparts are relatively unexplored, particularly in the submillimetre, which traces dust-obscured star formation. In this study we search for 850 $\mu$m-selected submillimetre galaxies in the environments of massive ($M_{\star} &gt; 10^{11} M_{\odot}$), radio-quiet ($L_{500 {\rm MHz}} \lesssim 10^{25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) galaxies at $z \sim 1\text{--}3$ using S2COSMOS data. By constructing number counts in circular regions of radius 1--6 arcmin and comparing with blank-field measurements, we find no significant overdensities of SMGs around massive radio-quiet galaxies at any of these scales, despite being sensitive down to overdensities of $\delta \sim 0.4$. To probe deeper than the catalogue we also examine the distribution of peaks in the SCUBA-2 SNR map, which reveals only tentative signs of any difference in the SMG densities of the radio-quiet galaxy environments compared to the blank field, and only on smaller scales (1$^{\prime}$ radii, corresponding to $\sim0.5$ Mpc) and higher SNR thresholds. We conclude that massive, radio-quiet galaxies at cosmic noon are typically in environments with $\delta\lesssim0.4$, which are either consistent with the blank field or contain only weak overdensities spanning sub-Mpc scales. The contrast between our results and studies of H$z$RGs with similar stellar masses and redshifts implies an intrinsic link between the wide-field environment and radio AGN luminosity at high redshift.</description>

      <title>A galactic outflow traced by its extended Mg II emission out to a $\sim30$ kpc radius in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field with MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a rare Mg II $\lambda$$\lambda$ 2796, 2803 doublet emission halo around a star forming galaxy with $\log (M_\star$/M$_\odot) = 10.3 \pm 0.3$ at $z=0.737$ in deep (9.94 h) VLT/MUSE data from the MUSE-HUDF mosaic. While the central region prominently displays an absorption-dominated Mg II doublet, characterized by discernible P-Cyg features, our examination reveals a remarkably extended Mg II emission, spanning approximately $\sim30$ kpc from the central galaxy. We introduce a simple outflow radiative transfer modeling scheme based on the Sobolev approximation, and we employ a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) fitting to find the best-fitting parameters that match our data. The model reproduces several key features of the observed Mg II halo and allows us to constrain the kinematics and geometry of the outflowing gas. Our data are consistent with a biconical wind whose velocity increases with radius, pointing nearly towards the observer, with an opening angle of $59\pm4^{\circ}$ In general, we find that our outflow model performs better in the inner regions of the galactic wind ($\lesssim 10$ kpc $\approx 6$ half-light radii), reaching a velocity of $\sim120$ km s$^{-1}$ at 10 kpc from the central galaxy. However, discrepancies between the data and the model in the outer regions suggest the possible influence of additional mechanisms, such as inflows, satellite interactions, or turbulence, which might significantly shape the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies at larger impact parameters. This analysis underscores the complexity of galactic outflows and encourages further exploration of the processes governing the dynamics of galactic winds through spatially resolved studies of the CGM.</description>

      <title>Images of Kerr-MOG black holes surrounded by geometrically thick magnetized equilibrium tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adopt general relativistic ray-tracing (GRRT) schemes to study images of Kerr-MOG black holes surrounded by geometrically thick magnetized equilibrium tori, which belong to steady-state solutions of thick accretion disks within the framework of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD). The black hole possesses an extra dimensionless MOG parameter described its deviation from usual Kerr one. Our results show that the presence of the MOG parameter leads to smaller disks in size, but enhances the total flux density and peak brightness in their images. Combining with observation data of black hole M87* from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), we make a constraint on parameters of the Kerr-MOG black hole and find that the presence of the MOG parameter broadens the allowable range of black hole spin.</description>

      <title>SHARP -- A near-IR multi-mode spectrograph conceived for MORFEO@ELT</title>

Abstract: The Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs), thanks to their large apertures and cutting-edge Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems, promise to deliver sharper and deeper data even than the JWST. SHARP is a concept study for a near-IR (0.95-2.45 $\mu$m) spectrograph conceived to fully exploit the collecting area and the angular resolution of the upcoming generation of ELTs. In particular, SHARP is designed for the 2nd port of MORFEO@ELT. Composed of a Multi-Object Spectrograph, NEXUS, and a multi-Integral Field Unit, VESPER, MORFEO-SHARP will deliver high angular ($\sim$30 mas) and spectral (R$\simeq$300, 2000, 6000, 17000) resolution, outperforming NIRSpec@JWST (100 mas). SHARP will enable studies of the nearby Universe and the early Universe in unprecedented detail. NEXUS is fed by a configurable slit system deploying up to 30 slits with $\sim$2.4 arcsec length and adjustable width, over a field of about 1.2"$\times$1.2" (35 mas/pix). Each slit is fed by an inversion prism able to rotate by an arbitrary angle the field that can be seen by the slit. VESPER is composed of 12 probes of 1.7"$\times$1.5" each (spaxel 31 mas) probing a field 24"$\times$70". SHARP is conceived to exploit the ELTs apertures reaching the faintest flux and the sharpest angular resolution by joining the sensitivity of NEXUS and the high spatial sampling of VESPER to MORFEO capabilities. This article provides an overview of the scientific design drivers, their solutions, and the resulting optical design of the instrument achieving the required optical performance.</description>
