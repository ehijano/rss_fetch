      <title>Constrained Coding and Deep Learning Aided Threshold Detection for Resistive Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistive random access memory (ReRAM) is a promising emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technology that shows high potential for both data storage and computing. However, its crossbar array architecture leads to the sneak path problem, which may severely degrade the reliability of data stored in the ReRAM cell. Due to the complication of memory physics and unique features of the sneak path induced interference (SPI), it is difficult to derive an accurate channel model for it. The deep learning (DL)-based detection scheme \cite{zhong2020sneakdl} can better mitigate the SPI, at the cost of additional power consumption and read latency. In this letter, we first propose a novel CC scheme which can not only reduce the SPI in the memory array, but also effectively differentiate the memory arrays into two categories of sneak-path-free and sneak-path-affected arrays. For the sneak-path-free arrays, we can use a simple middle-point threshold detector to detect the low and high resistance cells of ReRAM. For the sneak-path-affected arrays, a DL detector is first trained off-line (prior to the data detection of ReRAM). To avoid the additional power consumption and latency introduced by the DL detector, we further propose a DL-based threshold detector, whose detection threshold can be derived based on the outputs of the DL detector. It is then utilized for the online data detection of all the identified sneak-path-affected arrays. Simulation results demonstrate that the above CC and DL aided threshold detection scheme can effectively mitigate the SPI of the ReRAM array and achieve better error rate performance than the prior art detection schemes, without the prior knowledge of the channel.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Graph Signals from Noisy Dynamical Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical sampling space-time trade-off problem within a graph setting. Specifically, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for space-time sampling that enable the reconstruction of an initial band-limited signal on a graph. Additionally, we develop and test numerical algorithms for approximating the optimal placement of sensors on the graph to minimize the mean squared error when recovering signals from time-space measurements corrupted by i.i.d.~additive noise. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms previously proposed algorithms for related problems.</description>

      <title>ISAC Super-Resolution Receivers: The Effect of Different Dictionary Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an off-the-grid estimator for ISAC systems using lifted atomic norm minimization (LANM). The main challenge in the ISAC systems is the unknown nature of both transmitted signals and radar-communication channels. We use a known dictionary to encode transmit signals and show that LANM can localize radar targets and decode communication symbols when the number of observations is proportional to the system's degrees of freedom and the coherence of the dictionary matrix. We reformulate LANM using a dual method and solve it with semidefinite relaxation (SDR) for different dictionary matrices to reduce the number of observations required at the receiver. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed LANM accurately estimates communication data and target parameters under varying complexity by selecting different dictionary matrices.</description>

      <title>Radiance Field Delta Video Compression in Edge-Enabled Vehicular Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offload computationally intensive tasks to multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, enabling applications within the vehicular metaverse, which transforms physical environment into the digital space enabling advanced analysis or predictive modeling. A core challenge is physical-to-virtual (P2V) synchronization through digital twins (DTs), reliant on MEC networks and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). To address this, we introduce radiance field (RF) delta video compression (RFDVC), which uses RF-encoder and RF-decoder architecture using distributed RFs as DTs storing photorealistic 3D urban scene in compressed form. This method extracts differences between CAV-frame capturing actual traffic and RF-frame capturing empty scene from the same pose in batches encoded and transmitted over the MEC network. Experiments show data savings up to 90% against H.264 codec and 45% against H.265 codec under different conditions as lighting changes, rain and fog. RFDVC exhibits greater resilience to transmission errors, achieving a bit error rate (BER) of approximately 10^-1.6 at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB, compared to 10^-1.4 for standard video coding.</description>

Abstract: In this short survey we concern ourselves with minimal codes, a classical object in coding theory. We will explain the relation between minimal codes and various other mathematical domains, in particular with finite projective geometry. This latter connection has sparked a renewed interest in minimal codes, giving rise to new constructions as well as new questions.</description>

      <title>The Generalization Error of Machine Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the method of gaps, a technique for deriving closed-form expressions in terms of information measures for the generalization error of machine learning algorithms is introduced. The method relies on two central observations: $(a)$~The generalization error is an average of the variation of the expected empirical risk with respect to changes on the probability measure (used for expectation); and~$(b)$~these variations, also referred to as gaps, exhibit closed-form expressions in terms of information measures. The expectation of the empirical risk can be either with respect to a measure on the models (with a fixed dataset) or with respect to a measure on the datasets (with a fixed model), which results in two variants of the method of gaps. The first variant, which focuses on the gaps of the expected empirical risk with respect to a measure on the models, appears to be the most general, as no assumptions are made on the distribution of the datasets. The second variant develops under the assumption that datasets are made of independent and identically distributed data points. All existing exact expressions for the generalization error of machine learning algorithms can be obtained with the proposed method. Also, this method allows obtaining numerous new exact expressions, which improves the understanding of the generalization error; establish connections with other areas in statistics, e.g., hypothesis testing; and potentially, might guide algorithm designs.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification via Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach for fine-grained uncertainty quantification (UQ) using a collision matrix. For a classification problem involving $K$ classes, the $K\times K$ collision matrix $S$ measures the inherent (aleatoric) difficulty in distinguishing between each pair of classes. In contrast to existing UQ methods, the collision matrix gives a much more detailed picture of the difficulty of classification. We discuss several possible downstream applications of the collision matrix, establish its fundamental mathematical properties, as well as show its relationship with existing UQ methods, including the Bayes error rate. We also address the new problem of estimating the collision matrix using one-hot labeled data. We propose a series of innovative techniques to estimate $S$. First, we learn a contrastive binary classifier which takes two inputs and determines if they belong to the same class. We then show that this contrastive classifier (which is PAC learnable) can be used to reliably estimate the Gramian matrix of $S$, defined as $G=S^TS$. Finally, we show that under very mild assumptions, $G$ can be used to uniquely recover $S$, a new result on stochastic matrices which could be of independent interest. Experimental results are also presented to validate our methods on several datasets.</description>

      <title>Age of Information Minimization in UAV-Assisted Covert Communication: Trajectory and Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential for time-sensitive applications. Due to wireless channel variation, received data may have an expiration time, particularly in critical situations such as rescue operations, natural disasters, or the military. Age of Information (AoI) is a metric that measures the freshness of received packets to specify the validity period of information. In addition, it is necessary to guarantee the privacy of confidential information transmission through air-to-ground links against eavesdroppers. This paper investigates UAV-assisted covert communication to minimize AoI in the presence of an aerial eavesdropper for the first time. However, to ensure the eavesdropper's error detection rate, UAV-enabled beamforming employs the power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) technique to cover the covert user by a public user. PD-NOMA technique significantly improves the user's AoI, too. The joint optimization problem contains non-convex constraints and coupled optimization variables, including UAV trajectory, beamforming design, and the user's AoI which is challenging to derive a direct solution. We have developed an efficient alternating optimization technique to address the formulated optimization problem. Numerical results demonstrate the impact of the main parameters on the performance of the proposed communication system.</description>

      <title>Learning multivariate Gaussians with imperfect advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of distribution learning within the framework of learning-augmented algorithms. In this setting, we explore the scenario where a probability distribution is provided as potentially inaccurate advice on the true, unknown distribution. Our objective is to develop learning algorithms whose sample complexity decreases as the quality of the advice improves, thereby surpassing standard learning lower bounds when the advice is sufficiently accurate.
  Specifically, we demonstrate that this outcome is achievable for the problem of learning a multivariate Gaussian distribution $N(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})$ in the PAC learning setting. Classically, in the advice-free setting, $\tilde{\Theta}(d^2/\varepsilon^2)$ samples are sufficient and worst case necessary to learn $d$-dimensional Gaussians up to TV distance $\varepsilon$ with constant probability. When we are additionally given a parameter $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}$ as advice, we show that $\tilde{O}(d^{2-\beta}/\varepsilon^2)$ samples suffices whenever $\| \tilde{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}^{-1/2} \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \tilde{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}^{-1/2} - \boldsymbol{I_d} \|_1 \leq \varepsilon d^{1-\beta}$ (where $\|\cdot\|_1$ denotes the entrywise $\ell_1$ norm) for any $\beta &gt; 0$, yielding a polynomial improvement over the advice-free setting.</description>

      <title>Information Theory of Meaningful Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Shannon's seminal paper, entropy of printed English, treated as a stationary stochastic process, was estimated to be roughly 1 bit per character. However, considered as a means of communication, language differs considerably from its printed form: (i) the units of information are not characters or even words but clauses, i.e. shortest meaningful parts of speech; and (ii) what is transmitted is principally the meaning of what is being said or written, while the precise phrasing that was used to communicate the meaning is typically ignored. In this study, we show that one can leverage recently developed large language models to quantify information communicated in meaningful narratives in terms of bits of meaning per clause.</description>

      <title>Noise-Robust One-Bit Diffraction Tomography and Optimal Dose Fractionation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a noise-robust framework for 1-bit diffraction tomography, a novel imaging approach that relies on intensity-only binary measurements obtained through coded apertures. The proposed reconstruction scheme leverages random matrix theory and iterative algorithms, including power iteration and shifted inverse power iteration, to effectively recover 3D object structures under high-noise conditions. Theoretical analysis highlights the de-noising capabilities of the 1-bit scheme, with numerical experiments validating its robustness across varying noise levels, projection densities, and mask configurations.
  A key contribution is the investigation of dose fractionation, revealing optimal performance at a signal-to-noise ratio near 1, independent of the total dose. This finding addresses the dose-damage trade-off critical in radiation-sensitive imaging applications, such as biological microscopy. The study also explores the spectral properties of the reconstruction process, providing insights into algorithmic convergence and the interplay between eigenvector correlations and spectral gaps.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Computation and Communication over MAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study communication over a Gaussian multiple-access channel (MAC) with two types of transmitters: Digital transmitters hold a message from a discrete set that needs to be communicated to the receiver with vanishing error probability. Analog transmitters hold sequences of analog values, and some functions of these distributed values (but not the values themselves) need to be conveyed to the receiver, subject to a fidelity criterion such as mean squared error (MSE) or a certain maximum error with given confidence. For the case in which the computed function for the analog transmitters is a sum of values in [-1,1], we derive inner and outer bounds for the tradeoff of digital and analog rates of communication under peak and average power constraints for digital transmitters and a peak power constraint for analog transmitters. We then extend the achievability result to a class of functions that includes all linear and some non-linear functions. The practicality of our proposed communication scheme is shown in channel simulations that use a version of the scheme based on low density parity check (LDPC) coding and evaluate the system performance for different block lengths and Gaussian as well as non-Gaussian noise distributions.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Coding over General Noisy Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified one-shot coding framework designed for the communication and compression of messages among multiple nodes across a general acyclic noisy network. Our setting can be seen as a one-shot version of the acyclic discrete memoryless network studied by Lee and Chung, and noisy network coding studied by Lim, Kim, El Gamal and Chung. We design a proof technique, called the exponential process refinement lemma, that is rooted in the Poisson matching lemma by Li and Anantharam, and can significantly simplify the analyses of one-shot coding over multi-hop networks. Our one-shot coding theorem not only recovers a wide range of existing asymptotic results, but also yields novel one-shot achievability results in different multi-hop network information theory problems, such as compress-and-forward and partial-decode-and-forward bounds for a one-shot (primitive) relay channel, and a bound for one-shot cascade multiterminal source coding. In a broader context, our framework provides a unified one-shot bound applicable to any combination of source coding, channel coding and coding for computing problems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Communication and Key Rate Region for Hierarchical Secure Aggregation with User Collusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14035v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secure aggregation is concerned with the task of securely uploading the inputs of multiple users to an aggregation server without letting the server know the inputs beyond their summation. It finds broad applications in distributed machine learning paradigms such as federated learning (FL) where multiple clients, each having access to a proprietary dataset, periodically upload their locally trained models (abstracted as inputs) to a parameter server which then generates an aggregate (e.g., averaged) model that is sent back to the clients as an initializing point for a new round of local training. To enhance the data privacy of the clients, secure aggregation protocols are developed using techniques from cryptography to ensure that the server infers no more information of the users' inputs beyond the desired aggregated input, even if the server can collude with some users. Although laying the ground for understanding the fundamental utility-security trade-off in secure aggregation, the simple star client-server architecture cannot capture more complex network architectures used in practical systems. Motivated by hierarchical federated learning, we investigate the secure aggregation problem in a $3$-layer hierarchical network consisting of clustered users connecting to an aggregation server through an intermediate layer of relays. Besides the conventional server security which requires that the server learns nothing beyond the desired sum of inputs, relay security is also imposed so that the relays infer nothing about the users' inputs and remain oblivious. For such a hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) problem, we characterize the optimal multifaceted trade-off between communication (in terms of user-to-relay and relay-to-server communication rates) and secret key generation efficiency (in terms of individual key and source key rates).</description>

      <title>From Classical to Quantum: Uniform Continuity Bounds on Entropies in Infinite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a variety of new and refined uniform continuity bounds for entropies of both classical random variables on an infinite state space and of quantum states of infinite-dimensional systems. We obtain the first tight continuity estimate on the Shannon entropy of random variables with a countably infinite alphabet. The proof relies on a new mean-constrained Fano-type inequality and the notion of maximal coupling of random variables. We then employ this classical result to derive the first tight energy-constrained continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy of states of infinite-dimensional quantum systems, when the Hamiltonian is the number operator, which is arguably the most relevant Hamiltonian in the study of infinite-dimensional quantum systems in the context of quantum information theory.
  The above scheme works only for Shannon- and von Neumann entropies. Hence, to deal with more general entropies, e.g. $\alpha$-R\'enyi and $\alpha$-Tsallis entropies, with $\alpha \in (0,1)$, for which continuity bounds are known only for finite-dimensional systems, we develop a novel approximation scheme which relies on recent results on operator H\"older continuous functions and the equivalence of all Schatten norms in special spectral subspaces of the Hamiltonian. This approach is, as we show, motivated by continuity bounds for $\alpha$-R\'enyi and $\alpha$-Tsallis entropies of random variables that follow from the H\"older continuity of the entropy functionals. Bounds for $\alpha&gt;1$ are provided, too. Finally, we settle an open problem on related approximation questions posed in the recent works by Shirokov on the so-called Finite-dimensional Approximation (FA) property.</description>

      <title>Regulating Chatbot Output via Inter-Informational Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of ChatGPT has sparked over a year of regulatory frenzy. However, few existing studies have rigorously questioned the assumption that, if left unregulated, AI chatbot's output would inflict tangible, severe real harm on human affairs. Most researchers have overlooked the critical possibility that the information market itself can effectively mitigate these risks and, as a result, they tend to use regulatory tools to address the issue directly. This Article develops a yardstick for reevaluating both AI-related content risks and corresponding regulatory proposals by focusing on inter-informational competition among various outlets. The decades-long history of regulating information and communications technologies indicates that regulators tend to err too much on the side of caution and to put forward excessive regulatory measures when encountering the uncertainties brought about by new technologies. In fact, a trove of empirical evidence has demonstrated that market competition among information outlets can effectively mitigate most risks and that overreliance on regulation is not only unnecessary but detrimental, as well. This Article argues that sufficient competition among chatbots and other information outlets in the information marketplace can sufficiently mitigate and even resolve most content risks posed by generative AI technologies. This renders certain loudly advocated regulatory strategies, like mandatory prohibitions, licensure, curation of datasets, and notice-and-response regimes, truly unnecessary and even toxic to desirable competition and innovation throughout the AI industry. Ultimately, the ideas that I advance in this Article should pour some much-needed cold water on the regulatory frenzy over generative AI and steer the issue back to a rational track.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence and Distinguishability: A Resource-Theoretic Perspective on Wave-Particle Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14323</link>

Abstract: Wave-particle duality, the cornerstone of quantum mechanics, illustrates essential trade-offs between two complementary aspects of quantum systems. Captured by Bohr's complementarity principle, the wave-particle duality relation indicates that perfect path discrimination in a multipath interferometer obliterates interference patterns and vice versa. In this work, from the perspective of coherence resource manipulation, we uncover a novel duality relation between quantum coherence and distinguishability in ensembles of mutually orthogonal pure states. We demonstrate the sum of `co-bits', coherence preserved after discrimination, and classical bits, distinguishability extracted through perfect discrimination is bounded. One cannot simultaneously extract all classical information and preserve coherence. Such duality relation exposes an inherent trade-off between quantum coherence and classical distinguishability resources. Our findings offer a fresh perspective and advance our understanding of the intrinsic complementary relationship between quantum and classical resources.</description>

      <title>Learning Personalized Treatment Decisions in Precision Medicine: Disentangling Treatment Assignment Bias in Counterfactual Outcome Prediction and Biomarker Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision medicine has the potential to tailor treatment decisions to individual patients using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), but it faces significant challenges due to complex biases in clinical observational data and the high-dimensional nature of biological data. This study models various types of treatment assignment biases using mutual information and investigates their impact on ML models for counterfactual prediction and biomarker identification. Unlike traditional counterfactual benchmarks that rely on fixed treatment policies, our work focuses on modeling different characteristics of the underlying observational treatment policy in distinct clinical settings. We validate our approach through experiments on toy datasets, semi-synthetic tumor cancer genome atlas (TCGA) data, and real-world biological outcomes from drug and CRISPR screens. By incorporating empirical biological mechanisms, we create a more realistic benchmark that reflects the complexities of real-world data. Our analysis reveals that different biases lead to varying model performances, with some biases, especially those unrelated to outcome mechanisms, having minimal effect on prediction accuracy. This highlights the crucial need to account for specific biases in clinical observational data in counterfactual ML model development, ultimately enhancing the personalization of treatment decisions in precision medicine.</description>

      <title>Local Optimality of Dictator Functions with Applications to Courtade--Kumar and Li--M\'edard Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10147v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a convex function $\Phi:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$, the $\Phi$-stability of a Boolean function $f$ is $\mathbb{E}[\Phi(T_{\rho}f(\mathbf{X}))]$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is a random vector uniformly distributed on the discrete cube $\{\pm1\}^{n}$ and $T_{\rho}$ is the Bonami-Beckner operator. In this paper, we prove that dictator functions are locally optimal in maximizing the $\Phi$-stability of $f$ over all balanced Boolean functions. When focusing on the symmetric $q$-stability, combining this result with our previous bound, we use computer-assisted methods to prove that dictator functions maximize the symmetric $q$-stability for $q=1$ and $\rho\in[0,0.914]$ or for $q\in[1.36,2)$ and all $\rho\in[0,1]$. In other words, we confirm the (balanced) Courtade--Kumar conjecture with the correlation coefficient $\rho\in[0,0.914]$ and the (symmetrized) Li--M\'edard conjecture with $q\in[1.36,2)$. We conjecture that dictator functions maximize both the symmetric and asymmetric $\frac{1}{2}$-stability over all balanced Boolean functions. Our proofs are based on the majorization of noise operators and hypercontractivity inequalities.</description>
