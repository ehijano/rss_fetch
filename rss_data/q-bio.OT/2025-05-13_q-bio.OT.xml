      <title>Contributions of the Petabyte Scale Sequence Search Codeathon toward efforts to scale sequence-based searches on SRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The volume of biological data being generated by the scientific community is growing exponentially, reflecting technological advances and research activities. The National Institutes of Health's (NIH) Sequence Read Archive (SRA), which is maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Library of Medicine (NLM), is a rapidly growing public database that researchers use to drive scientific discovery across all domains of life. This increase in available data has great promise for pushing scientific discovery but also introduces new challenges that scientific communities need to address. As genomic datasets have grown in scale and diversity, a parade of new methods and associated software have been developed to address the challenges posed by this growth. These methodological advances are vital for maximally leveraging the power of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. With the goal of laying a foundation for evaluation of methods for petabyte-scale sequence search, the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER), the NIH Office of Data Science Strategy (ODSS), and NCBI held a virtual codeathon 'Petabyte Scale Sequence Search: Metagenomics Benchmarking Codeathon' on September 27 - Oct 1 2021, to evaluate emerging solutions in petabyte scale sequence search. The codeathon attracted experts from national laboratories, research institutions, and universities across the world to (a) develop benchmarking approaches to address challenges in conducting large-scale analyses of metagenomic data (which comprises approximately 20% of SRA), (b) identify potential applications that benefit from SRA-wide searches and the tools required to execute the search, and (c) produce community resources i.e. a public facing repository with information to rebuild and reproduce the problems addressed by each team challenge.</description>

      <title>Understanding nature's choice of genetic languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All living organisms use the same genetic languages in their molecular biology machinery. They can be understood as the optimal solutions to the replication tasks involving DNA and proteins. These solutions perfectly fit the pattern predicted by Grover's algorithm, which is more efficient than the best Boolean search algorithm (i.e. binary tree search) that predicts a different pattern. The challenge is to demonstrate how Grover's algorithm would be executed in vivo by the living organisms.</description>

      <title>Alternatives to the statistical mass confusion of testing for no-effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cell biology, statistical analysis means testing the hypothesis that there was no effect. This weak form of hypothesis testing neglects effect size, is universally misinterpreted, and is disastrously prone to error when combined with high-throughput cell biology. The solution is for analysis of measurements to start and end with an interpretation of effect size.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Biomedicine: A Survey of Technologies, Datasets, and Clinical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks. However, their application in the biomedical domain presents unique challenges, particularly regarding factual accuracy and up-to-date knowledge integration. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges by combining the generative capabilities of LLMs with external knowledge retrieval. This comprehensive survey examines the application of RAG in the biomedical domain, focusing on its technological components, available datasets, and clinical applications. We present a systematic analysis of retrieval methods, ranking strategies, and generation models, while also exploring the challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving field. Our work provides researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of the current state of biomedical RAG systems and identifies key areas for future research and development.</description>
