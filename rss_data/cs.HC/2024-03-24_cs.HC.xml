      <title>Identifying Challenges in Designing, Developing and Evaluating Data Visualizations for Large Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growth of data sizes, visualizing them becomes more complex. Desktop displays are insufficient for presenting and collaborating on complex data visualizations. Large displays could provide the necessary space to demo or present complex data visualizations. However, designing and developing visualizations for such displays pose distinct challenges. Identifying these challenges is essential for researchers, designers, and developers in the field of data visualization. In this study, we aim to gain insights into the challenges encountered by designers and developers when creating data visualizations for large displays. We conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with experts who had experience in large displays and, through affinity diagramming, categorized the challenges.</description>

      <title>(Un)making AI Magic: a Design Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the role that enchantment plays in the design of AI things by constructing a taxonomy of design approaches that increase or decrease the perception of magic and enchantment. We start from the design discourse surrounding recent developments in AI technologies, highlighting specific interaction qualities such as algorithmic uncertainties and errors and articulating relations to the rhetoric of magic and supernatural thinking. Through analyzing and reflecting upon 52 students' design projects from two editions of a Master course in design and AI, we identify seven design principles and unpack the effects of each in terms of enchantment and disenchantment. We conclude by articulating ways in which this taxonomy can be approached and appropriated by design/HCI practitioners, especially to support exploration and reflexivity.</description>

      <title>Visual Highlighting for Situated Brushing and Linking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brushing and linking is widely used for visual analytics in desktop environments. However, using this approach to link many data items between situated (e.g., a virtual screen with data) and embedded views (e.g., highlighted objects in the physical environment) is largely unexplored. To this end, we study the effectiveness of visual highlighting techniques in helping users identify and link physical referents to brushed data marks in a situated scatterplot. In an exploratory virtual reality user study (N=20), we evaluated four highlighting techniques under different physical layouts and tasks. We discuss the effectiveness of these techniques, as well as implications for the design of brushing and linking operations in situated analytics.</description>

      <title>AI Sustainability in Practice Part One: Foundations for Sustainable AI Projects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sustainable AI projects are continuously responsive to the transformative effects as well as short-, medium-, and long-term impacts on individuals and society that the design, development, and deployment of AI technologies may have. Projects, which centre AI Sustainability, ensure that values-led, collaborative, and anticipatory reflection both guides the assessment of potential social and ethical impacts and steers responsible innovation practices.
  This workbook is the first part of a pair that provides the concepts and tools needed to put AI Sustainability into practice. It introduces the SUM Values, which help AI project teams to assess the potential societal impacts and ethical permissibility of their projects. It then presents a Stakeholder Engagement Process (SEP), which provides tools to facilitate proportionate engagement of and input from stakeholders with an emphasis on equitable and meaningful participation and positionality awareness.</description>

      <title>AI Fairness in Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reaching consensus on a commonly accepted definition of AI Fairness has long been a central challenge in AI ethics and governance. There is a broad spectrum of views across society on what the concept of fairness means and how it should best be put to practice. In this workbook, we tackle this challenge by exploring how a context-based and society-centred approach to understanding AI Fairness can help project teams better identify, mitigate, and manage the many ways that unfair bias and discrimination can crop up across the AI project workflow.
  We begin by exploring how, despite the plurality of understandings about the meaning of fairness, priorities of equality and non-discrimination have come to constitute the broadly accepted core of its application as a practical principle. We focus on how these priorities manifest in the form of equal protection from direct and indirect discrimination and from discriminatory harassment. These elements form ethical and legal criteria based upon which instances of unfair bias and discrimination can be identified and mitigated across the AI project workflow.
  We then take a deeper dive into how the different contexts of the AI project lifecycle give rise to different fairness concerns. This allows us to identify several types of AI Fairness (Data Fairness, Application Fairness, Model Design and Development Fairness, Metric-Based Fairness, System Implementation Fairness, and Ecosystem Fairness) that form the basis of a multi-lens approach to bias identification, mitigation, and management. Building on this, we discuss how to put the principle of AI Fairness into practice across the AI project workflow through Bias Self-Assessment and Bias Risk Management as well as through the documentation of metric-based fairness criteria in a Fairness Position Statement.</description>

      <title>ClickTree: A Tree-based Method for Predicting Math Students' Performance Based on Clickstream Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prediction of student performance and the analysis of students' learning behavior play an important role in enhancing online courses. By analysing a massive amount of clickstream data that captures student behavior, educators can gain valuable insights into the factors that influence academic outcomes and identify areas of improvement in courses. In this study, we developed ClickTree, a tree-based methodology, to predict student performance in mathematical assignments based on students' clickstream data. We extracted a set of features, including problem-level, assignment-level and student-level features, from the extensive clickstream data and trained a CatBoost tree to predict whether a student successfully answers a problem in an assignment. The developed method achieved an AUC of 0.78844 in the Educational Data Mining Cup 2023 and ranked second in the competition. Furthermore, our results indicate that students encounter more difficulties in the problem types that they must select a subset of answers from a given set as well as problem subjects of Algebra II. Additionally, students who performed well in answering end-unit assignment problems engaged more with in-unit assignments and answered more problems correctly, while those who struggled had higher tutoring request rate. The proposed method can be utilized to improve students' learning experiences, and the above insights can be integrated into mathematical courses to enhance students' learning outcomes.</description>

      <title>Sora OpenAI's Prelude: Social Media Perspectives on Sora OpenAI and the Future of AI Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Generative AI (Gen-AI) is transforming Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), with significant implications across various sectors. This study investigates the public's perception of Sora OpenAI, a pioneering Gen-AI video generation tool, via social media discussions on Reddit before its release. It centers on two main questions: the envisioned applications and the concerns related to Sora's integration. The analysis forecasts positive shifts in content creation, predicting that Sora will democratize video marketing and innovate game development by making video production more accessible and economical. Conversely, there are concerns about deepfakes and the potential for disinformation, underscoring the need for strategies to address disinformation and bias. This paper contributes to the Gen-AI discourse by fostering discussion on current and future capabilities, enriching the understanding of public expectations, and establishing a temporal benchmark for user anticipation. This research underscores the necessity for informed, ethical approaches to AI development and integration, ensuring that technological advancements align with societal values and user needs.</description>

      <title>Can 'Robots Won't Save Japan' Save Robotics? Reviewing an Ethnography of Eldercare Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imagine activating new robots meant to aid staff in an elder care facility, only to discover the robots are counterproductive. They undermine the most meaningful moments of the jobs and increase staff workloads, because robots demand care too. Eventually, they're returned. This vignette captures key elements of James Adrian Wright's ethnography, "Robots Won't Save Japan", an essential resource for understanding the state of elder care robotics. Wright's rich ethnographic interviews and observations challenge the prevailing funding, research, and development paradigms for robotics. Elder care residents tend to be Disabled, so this review article augments Wrights' insights with overlooked perspectives from Disability and Robotics research. This article highlights how care recipients' portrayal suggests that Paro, a plush robot seal, might perform better than the care team and author indicated -- leading to insights that support urgent paradigm shifts in elder care, ethnographic studies, and robotics. It presents some of the stronger technical status quo counter-arguments to the book's core narratives, then confronts their own assumptions. Furthermore, it explores exceptional cases where Japanese and international roboticists attend to care workers and recipients, justifying key arguments in Wright's compelling book. Finally, it addresses how "Robots won't save Japan" will save Robotics.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Domain Adaptation with Temporal Relation Knowledge for Cross-User Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In human activity recognition (HAR), the assumption that training and testing data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) often fails, particularly in cross-user scenarios where data distributions vary significantly. This discrepancy highlights the limitations of conventional domain adaptation methods in HAR, which typically overlook the inherent temporal relations in time-series data. To bridge this gap, our study introduces a Conditional Variational Autoencoder with Universal Sequence Mapping (CVAE-USM) approach, which addresses the unique challenges of time-series domain adaptation in HAR by relaxing the i.i.d. assumption and leveraging temporal relations to align data distributions effectively across different users. This method combines the strengths of Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Universal Sequence Mapping (USM) to capture and utilize common temporal patterns between users for improved activity recognition. Our results, evaluated on two public HAR datasets (OPPT and PAMAP2), demonstrate that CVAE-USM outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, offering a more accurate and generalizable solution for cross-user activity recognition.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-Loop AI for Cheating Ring Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online exams have become popular in recent years due to their accessibility. However, some concerns have been raised about the security of the online exams, particularly in the context of professional cheating services aiding malicious test takers in passing exams, forming so-called "cheating rings". In this paper, we introduce a human-in-the-loop AI cheating ring detection system designed to detect and deter these cheating rings. We outline the underlying logic of this human-in-the-loop AI system, exploring its design principles tailored to achieve its objectives of detecting cheaters. Moreover, we illustrate the methodologies used to evaluate its performance and fairness, aiming to mitigate the unintended risks associated with the AI system. The design and development of the system adhere to Responsible AI (RAI) standards, ensuring that ethical considerations are integrated throughout the entire development process.</description>

      <title>Curvature Augmented Manifold Embedding and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new dimensional reduction (DR) and data visualization method, Curvature-Augmented Manifold Embedding and Learning (CAMEL), is proposed. The key novel contribution is to formulate the DR problem as a mechanistic/physics model, where the force field among nodes (data points) is used to find an n-dimensional manifold representation of the data sets. Compared with many existing attractive-repulsive force-based methods, one unique contribution of the proposed method is to include a non-pairwise force. A new force field model is introduced and discussed, inspired by the multi-body potential in lattice-particle physics and Riemann curvature in topology. A curvature-augmented force is included in CAMEL. Following this, CAMEL formulation for unsupervised learning, supervised learning, semi-supervised learning/metric learning, and inverse learning are provided. Next, CAMEL is applied to many benchmark datasets by comparing existing models, such as tSNE, UMAP, TRIMAP, and PacMap. Both visual comparison and metrics-based evaluation are performed. 14 open literature and self-proposed metrics are employed for a comprehensive comparison. Conclusions and future work are suggested based on the current investigation. Related code and demonstration are available on https://github.com/ymlasu/CAMEL for interested readers to reproduce the results and other applications.</description>

      <title>The opportunities and risks of large language models in mental health</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global rates of mental health concerns are rising and there is increasing realization that existing models of mental healthcare will not adequately expand to meet the demand. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has come great optimism regarding their promise to create novel, large-scale solutions to support mental health. Despite their nascence, LLMs have already been applied to mental health-related tasks. In this review, we summarize the extant literature on efforts to use LLMs to provide mental health education, assessment, and intervention and highlight key opportunities for positive impact in each area. We then highlight risks associated with LLMs application to mental health and encourage adoption of strategies to mitigate these risks. The urgent need for mental health support must be balanced with responsible development, testing, and deployment of mental health LLMs. Especially critical is ensuring that mental health LLMs are fine-tuned for mental health, enhance mental health equity, adhere to ethical standards, and that people, including those with lived experience with mental health concerns, are involved in all stages from development through deployment. Prioritizing these efforts will minimize potential harms to mental health and maximize the likelihood that LLMs will positively impact mental health globally.</description>

      <title>Extracting Human Attention through Crowdsourced Patch Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In image classification, a significant problem arises from bias in the datasets. When it contains only specific types of images, the classifier begins to rely on shortcuts - simplistic and erroneous rules for decision-making. This leads to high performance on the training dataset but inferior results on new, varied images, as the classifier's generalization capability is reduced. For example, if the images labeled as mustache consist solely of male figures, the model may inadvertently learn to classify images by gender rather than the presence of a mustache. One approach to mitigate such biases is to direct the model's attention toward the target object's location, usually marked using bounding boxes or polygons for annotation. However, collecting such annotations requires substantial time and human effort. Therefore, we propose a novel patch-labeling method that integrates AI assistance with crowdsourcing to capture human attention from images, which can be a viable solution for mitigating bias. Our method consists of two steps. First, we extract the approximate location of a target using a pre-trained saliency detection model supplemented by human verification for accuracy. Then, we determine the human-attentive area in the image by iteratively dividing the image into smaller patches and employing crowdsourcing to ascertain whether each patch can be classified as the target object. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our method in mitigating bias through improved classification accuracy and the refined focus of the model. Also, crowdsourced experiments validate that our method collects human annotation up to 3.4 times faster than annotating object locations with polygons, significantly reducing the need for human resources. We conclude the paper by discussing the advantages of our method in a crowdsourcing context, mainly focusing on aspects of human errors and accessibility.</description>

      <title>Language Models in Dialogue: Conversational Maxims for Human-AI Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern language models, while sophisticated, exhibit some inherent shortcomings, particularly in conversational settings. We claim that many of the observed shortcomings can be attributed to violation of one or more conversational principles. By drawing upon extensive research from both the social science and AI communities, we propose a set of maxims -- quantity, quality, relevance, manner, benevolence, and transparency -- for describing effective human-AI conversation. We first justify the applicability of the first four maxims (from Grice) in the context of human-AI interactions. We then argue that two new maxims, benevolence (concerning the generation of, and engagement with, harmful content) and transparency (concerning recognition of one's knowledge boundaries, operational constraints, and intents), are necessary for addressing behavior unique to modern human-AI interactions. The proposed maxims offer prescriptive guidance on how to assess conversational quality between humans and LLM-driven conversational agents, informing both their evaluation and improved design.</description>

      <title>Blockchain-based Pseudonym Management for Vehicle Twin Migrations in Vehicular Edge Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by the great advances in metaverse and edge computing technologies, vehicular edge metaverses are expected to disrupt the current paradigm of intelligent transportation systems. As highly computerized avatars of Vehicular Metaverse Users (VMUs), the Vehicle Twins (VTs) deployed in edge servers can provide valuable metaverse services to improve driving safety and on-board satisfaction for their VMUs throughout journeys. To maintain uninterrupted metaverse experiences, VTs must be migrated among edge servers following the movements of vehicles. This can raise concerns about privacy breaches during the dynamic communications among vehicular edge metaverses. To address these concerns and safeguard location privacy, pseudonyms as temporary identifiers can be leveraged by both VMUs and VTs to realize anonymous communications in the physical space and virtual spaces. However, existing pseudonym management methods fall short in meeting the extensive pseudonym demands in vehicular edge metaverses, thus dramatically diminishing the performance of privacy preservation. To this end, we present a cross-metaverse empowered dual pseudonym management framework. We utilize cross-chain technology to enhance management efficiency and data security for pseudonyms. Furthermore, we propose a metric to assess the privacy level and employ a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) approach to obtain an optimal pseudonym generating strategy. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed schemes are high-efficiency and cost-effective, showcasing their promising applications in vehicular edge metaverses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper I describe the design of an introductory course in Human-Robot Interaction. This project-driven course is designed to introduce undergraduate and graduate engineering students, especially those enrolled in Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, and Robotics degree programs, to key theories and methods used in the field of Human-Robot Interaction that they would otherwise be unlikely to see in those degree programs. To achieve this aim, the course takes students all the way from stakeholder analysis to empirical evaluation, covering and integrating key Qualitative, Design, Computational, and Quantitative methods along the way. I detail the goals, audience, and format of the course, and provide a detailed walkthrough of the course syllabus.</description>

      <title>LLMR: Real-time Prompting of Interactive Worlds using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Large Language Model for Mixed Reality (LLMR), a framework for the real-time creation and modification of interactive Mixed Reality experiences using LLMs. LLMR leverages novel strategies to tackle difficult cases where ideal training data is scarce, or where the design goal requires the synthesis of internal dynamics, intuitive analysis, or advanced interactivity. Our framework relies on text interaction and the Unity game engine. By incorporating techniques for scene understanding, task planning, self-debugging, and memory management, LLMR outperforms the standard GPT-4 by 4x in average error rate. We demonstrate LLMR's cross-platform interoperability with several example worlds, and evaluate it on a variety of creation and modification tasks to show that it can produce and edit diverse objects, tools, and scenes. Finally, we conducted a usability study (N=11) with a diverse set that revealed participants had positive experiences with the system and would use it again.</description>

      <title>3DA: Assessing 3D-Printed Electrodes for Measuring Electrodermal Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrodermal activity (EDA) reflects changes in skin conductance, which are closely tied to human psychophysiological states. For example, EDA sensors can assess stress, cognitive workload, arousal, or other measures tied to the sympathetic nervous system for interactive human-centered applications. Yet, current limitations involve the complex attachment and proper skin contact with EDA sensors. This paper explores the concept of 3D printing electrodes for EDA measurements, integrating sensors into arbitrary 3D-printed objects, alleviating the need for complex assembly and attachment. We examine the adaptation of conventional EDA circuits for 3D-printed electrodes, assessing different electrode shapes and their impact on the sensing accuracy. A user study (N=6) revealed that 3D-printed electrodes can measure EDA with similar accuracy, suggesting larger contact areas for improved precision. We derive design implications to facilitate the integration of EDA sensors into 3D-printed devices to foster diverse integration into everyday objects for prototyping physiological interfaces.</description>

      <title>HealMe: Harnessing Cognitive Reframing in Large Language Models for Psychotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can play a vital role in psychotherapy by adeptly handling the crucial task of cognitive reframing and overcoming challenges such as shame, distrust, therapist skill variability, and resource scarcity. Previous LLMs in cognitive reframing mainly converted negative emotions to positive ones, but these approaches have limited efficacy, often not promoting clients' self-discovery of alternative perspectives. In this paper, we unveil the Helping and Empowering through Adaptive Language in Mental Enhancement (HealMe) model. This novel cognitive reframing therapy method effectively addresses deep-rooted negative thoughts and fosters rational, balanced perspectives. Diverging from traditional LLM methods, HealMe employs empathetic dialogue based on psychotherapeutic frameworks. It systematically guides clients through distinguishing circumstances from feelings, brainstorming alternative viewpoints, and developing empathetic, actionable suggestions. Moreover, we adopt the first comprehensive and expertly crafted psychological evaluation metrics, specifically designed to rigorously assess the performance of cognitive reframing, in both AI-simulated dialogues and real-world therapeutic conversations. Experimental results show that our model outperforms others in terms of empathy, guidance, and logical coherence, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential positive impact on psychotherapy.</description>

      <title>"This is not a data problem": Algorithms and Power in Public Higher Education in Canada</title>

Abstract: Algorithmic decision-making is increasingly being adopted across public higher education. The expansion of data-driven practices by post-secondary institutions has occurred in parallel with the adoption of New Public Management approaches by neoliberal administrations. In this study, we conduct a qualitative analysis of an in-depth ethnographic case study of data and algorithms in use at a public college in Ontario, Canada. We identify the data, algorithms, and outcomes in use at the college. We assess how the college's processes and relationships support those outcomes and the different stakeholders' perceptions of the college's data-driven systems. In addition, we find that the growing reliance on algorithmic decisions leads to increased student surveillance, exacerbation of existing inequities, and the automation of the faculty-student relationship. Finally, we identify a cycle of increased institutional power perpetuated by algorithmic decision-making, and driven by a push towards financial sustainability.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Worker Recruitment in Collaborative Mobile Crowdsourcing: A Graph Neural Network Trust Evaluation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04366v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collaborative Mobile Crowdsourcing (CMCS) allows platforms to recruit worker teams to collaboratively execute complex sensing tasks. The efficiency of such collaborations could be influenced by trust relationships among workers. To obtain the asymmetric trust values among all workers in the social network, the Trust Reinforcement Evaluation Framework (TREF) based on Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) is proposed in this paper. The task completion effect is comprehensively calculated by considering the workers' ability benefits, distance benefits, and trust benefits in this paper. The worker recruitment problem is modeled as an Undirected Complete Recruitment Graph (UCRG), for which a specific Tabu Search Recruitment (TSR) algorithm solution is proposed. An optimal execution team is recruited for each task by the TSR algorithm, and the collaboration team for the task is obtained under the constraint of privacy loss. To enhance the efficiency of the recruitment algorithm on a large scale and scope, the Mini-Batch K-Means clustering algorithm and edge computing technology are introduced, enabling distributed worker recruitment. Lastly, extensive experiments conducted on five real datasets validate that the recruitment algorithm proposed in this paper outperforms other baselines. Additionally, TREF proposed herein surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art trust evaluation methods in the literature.</description>

      <title>AutoTAMP: Autoregressive Task and Motion Planning with LLMs as Translators and Checkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For effective human-robot interaction, robots need to understand, plan, and execute complex, long-horizon tasks described by natural language. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for translating natural language into robot action sequences for complex tasks. However, existing approaches either translate the natural language directly into robot trajectories or factor the inference process by decomposing language into task sub-goals and relying on a motion planner to execute each sub-goal. When complex environmental and temporal constraints are involved, inference over planning tasks must be performed jointly with motion plans using traditional task-and-motion planning (TAMP) algorithms, making factorization into subgoals untenable. Rather than using LLMs to directly plan task sub-goals, we instead perform few-shot translation from natural language task descriptions to an intermediate task representation that can then be consumed by a TAMP algorithm to jointly solve the task and motion plan. To improve translation, we automatically detect and correct both syntactic and semantic errors via autoregressive re-prompting, resulting in significant improvements in task completion. We show that our approach outperforms several methods using LLMs as planners in complex task domains.

      <title>FERGI: Automatic Annotation of User Preferences for Text-to-Image Generation from Spontaneous Facial Expression Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers have proposed to use data of human preference feedback to fine-tune text-to-image generative models. However, the scalability of human feedback collection has been limited by its reliance on manual annotation. Therefore, we develop and test a method to automatically annotate user preferences from their spontaneous facial expression reaction to the generated images. We collect a dataset of Facial Expression Reaction to Generated Images (FERGI) and show that the activations of multiple facial action units (AUs) are highly correlated with user evaluations of the generated images. Specifically, AU4 (brow lowerer) is reflective of negative evaluations of the generated image whereas AU12 (lip corner puller) is reflective of positive evaluations. These can be useful in two ways. Firstly, we can automatically annotate user preferences between image pairs with substantial difference in these AU responses with an accuracy significantly outperforming state-of-the-art scoring models. Secondly, directly integrating the AU responses with the scoring models improves their consistency with human preferences. Finally, this method of automatic annotation with facial expression analysis can be potentially generalized to other generation tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/ShuangquanFeng/FERGI, and the dataset is also available at the same link for research purposes.</description>

      <title>LaMI: Large Language Models for Multi-Modal Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative large language model (LLM)-based robotic system for enhancing multi-modal human-robot interaction (HRI). Traditional HRI systems relied on complex designs for intent estimation, reasoning, and behavior generation, which were resource-intensive. In contrast, our system empowers researchers and practitioners to regulate robot behavior through three key aspects: providing high-level linguistic guidance, creating "atomic actions" and expressions the robot can use, and offering a set of examples. Implemented on a physical robot, it demonstrates proficiency in adapting to multi-modal inputs and determining the appropriate manner of action to assist humans with its arms, following researchers' defined guidelines. Simultaneously, it coordinates the robot's lid, neck, and ear movements with speech output to produce dynamic, multi-modal expressions. This showcases the system's potential to revolutionize HRI by shifting from conventional, manual state-and-flow design methods to an intuitive, guidance-based, and example-driven approach.

      <title>Tur[k]ingBench: A Challenge Benchmark for Web Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent chatbots have demonstrated impressive ability to understand and communicate in raw-text form. However, there is more to the world than raw text. For example, humans spend long hours of their time on web pages, where text is intertwined with other modalities and tasks are accomplished in the form of various complex interactions. Can state-of-the-art multi-modal models generalize to such complex domains?
  To address this question, we introduce TurkingBench, a benchmark of tasks formulated as web pages containing textual instructions with multi-modal context. Unlike existing work which employs artificially synthesized web pages, here we use natural HTML pages that were originally designed for crowdsourcing workers for various annotation purposes. The HTML instructions of each task are also instantiated with various values (obtained from the crowdsourcing tasks) to form new instances of the task. This benchmark contains 32.2K instances distributed across 158 tasks.
  Additionally, to facilitate the evaluation on TurkingBench, we develop an evaluation framework that connects the responses of chatbots to modifications on web pages (modifying a text box, checking a radio, etc.). We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art models, including language-only, vision-only, and layout-only models, and their combinations, on this benchmark. Our findings reveal that these models perform significantly better than random chance, yet considerable room exists for improvement. We hope this benchmark will help facilitate the evaluation and development of web-based agents.</description>
