      <title>Dual Plo\v{s}\v{c}ica spaces of ortholattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe digraphs with topology which give dual representations of ortholattices. This is done via so-called dual Plo\v{s}\v{c}ica spaces of lattices. First, we improve the definition of Plo\v{s}\v{c}ica spaces from an earlier paper to give a straight and natural generalisation of the total order disconnectedness of Priestley spaces. Then we define the dual space of a general ortholattice as the dual Plo\v{s}\v{c}ica space of the lattice-reduct of the ortholattice equipped with a map representing the orthocomplement operation. We introduce an abstract ortho-Plo\v{s}\v{c}ica space capturing the properties of the dual space of an ortholattice, and we present dual representation theorems between general ortholattices and the ortho-Plo\v{s}\v{c}ica spaces. We illustrate our dual representations by examples.</description>

      <title>Properties, deformation quantizations and bialgebras for dual pre-Poisson algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dual pre-Poisson algebra is an algebraic structure that integrates a permutative algebra and a Leibniz algebra under certain compatibility conditions. As the Koszul dual notion of the pre-Poisson algebra, this structure serves as a natural generalization of the Poisson algebra. In this paper, we commence a study on dual pre-Poisson algebras from the algebraic point of view and establish a bialgebra theory for dual pre-Poisson algebras. We begin by investigating the fundamental properties of dual pre-Poisson algebras and provide several explicit constructions. In particular, we prove that the operad of dual pre-Poisson algebras is Koszul, and we compute its Hilbert-Poincar\'e series and codimension. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of diassociative formal deformations of permutative algebras and show that dual pre-Poisson algebras are the corresponding semi-classical limits. Moreover, we introduce dual pre-Poisson bialgebras, which are characterized both by Manin triples and by matched pairs of dual pre-Poisson algebras, thus developing a bialgebra theory for dual pre-Poisson algebras. Then our study leads to the permutative-Leibniz Yang-Baxter equation (PLYBE) that is composed of the permutative and the classical Leibniz Yang-Baxter equation. We conclude by introducing $\mathcal{O}$-operators and pre-dual pre-Poisson algebras, which provide a systematic method for constructing symmetric solutions to the PLYBE and, consequently, dual pre-Poisson bialgebras.</description>

      <title>Semigroup automorphisms of total positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Totally positive (TP) and totally nonnegative (TN) matrices connect to analysis, mechanics, and to dual canonical bases in reductive groups, by well-known works of Schoenberg, Gantmacher-Krein, Lusztig, and others. TP matrices form a multiplicatively closed semigroup, contained in the larger monoid of invertible totally nonnegative (ITN) matrices. Whitney and Berenstein-Fomin-Zelevinsky found bidiagonal factorizations of all $n\times n$ ITN and TP matrices into multiplicative generators; a natural question now is to classify the multiplicative automorphisms of these semigroups. In this article, we classify all automorphisms of these semigroups of ITN and TP matrices. In particular, we show that the automorphisms are the same, and they respect the multiplicative generators.</description>

      <title>Null Lagrangians in free Novikov algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the symmetrization of the Novikov product. Using the embedding of a free Novikov algebra into a differential algebra over a field of characteristic zero and the Euler operators (variational derivatives), we show that the space of null Lagrangians coincides with the subspace of elements closed under the symmetrized product $a\circ b=ab+ba$. We also completely describe its module structure over symmetric group.</description>

      <title>Selected facts on products of two involutions in the Riordan group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An element of a group is called \emph{reversible} if it is conjugate to its inverse, and \emph{strongly reversible} if it can be expressed as a product of two involutions. We study strongly reversible elements in the Riordan group and in several of its important subgroups. We show that not every reversible element in the Riordan group is strongly reversible, and we investigate products of reversible elements in the Riordan group.</description>

      <title>Krull-Gabriel dimension of Skew group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an algebraically closed field K, let G be a finite abelian group of K-linear automorphisms of a finite-dimensional algebra A and AG is the associated skew group algebra. The author with S. Trepode and A. G. Chaio introduced the notion of a Galois semi-covering functor to study the irreducible morphisms over skew group algebras. In this paper, we establish a Galois semi-covering functor between the morphism categories as well as the functor categories over the algebras A and AG and prove that their Krull-Gabriel dimension are equal. This computation confirms Prests conjecture on the finiteness of Krull-Gabriel dimension and Schroers conjecture on its connection with the stable rank (the least stabilized radical power) over skew gentle algebras. Moreover, we determine all posible stable ranks for (skew) Brauer graph algebras.</description>

      <title>Commutativity criteria for prime rings with involution via pairs of endomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to investigate central-valued identities involving pairs of endomorphisms on prime rings equipped with an involution of the second kind. Extending the recent contributions of Mir et al. (2020) and Boua et al. (2024), we establish several new commutativity criteria for such rings in the presence of two distinct nontrivial endomorphisms. Our approach provides a unified technique that covers multiple classes of $\ast$-identities and yields generalizations of earlier single-endomorphism results. Moreover, explicit counterexamples are constructed to demonstrate the necessity of the hypotheses on primeness and on the nature of the involution.</description>
