      <title>Nuclear clock based on the Th V ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that a nuclear clock based on the Th~V ion may achieve the highest accuracy among different Th ions. The Th$^{4+}$ ion has a rigid closed-shell core with zero total electron angular momentum, effectively eliminating frequency shifts in the nuclear transition caused by black-body radiation and external fields, which primarily interact with electrons. We calculate the energy shift of the nuclear clock transition frequency in $^{229}$Th due to the Coulomb field of atomic electrons. The relative frequency shift between Th~IV and Th~V ions is found to be $2.5 \times 10^{-7}$, which is twelve orders of magnitude larger than the projected uncertainty of the nuclear clock transition frequency. Additionally, we perform calculations of the energy levels and ionization potential of the Th~V ion. While all excitation energies in Th~V are significantly higher than the nuclear excitation energy ($\omega_N$), the energy intervals between certain excited states are close to $\omega_N$.</description>

      <title>Electrically-Small Rydberg Sensor for Three-Dimensional Determination of rf k-Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an electrically-small Rydberg atom electric field sensor with the ability to extract the three-dimensional $k$-vector of an elliptically polarized radio frequency (rf) field. In most mediums, the $k$-vector (or wave vector) provides the direction of propagation of an electromagnetic wave. Our method uses a field vector measurement at a single point in space and is thus compatible with a sensor volume that is arbitrarily small compared to the carrier wavelength. We measure the $k$-vector of a circularly polarized signal field with average absolute errors in the polar and azimuthal angles of $33~\text{mrad}$ and $43~\text{mrad}$ respectively, and statistical noise of $1.3~\text{mrad}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ and $1.5~\text{mrad}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$. Additionally, we characterize the performance of the sensor as a function of the ellipticity of the input field and the size of the sensing region. We find that the sensor works over a broad range of ellipticities and validate that an electrically-small sensing region is optimal.</description>

      <title>All-optical coherent control of chiral electronic transitions for highly enantioselective photochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enantioselective photochemistry provides access to unique molecular structures and functions, with deep implications for fundamental science and industrial applications. Current methods for highly enantioselective photochemistry critically rely on chiral sensitisers, as circularly polarised light on its own yields vanishingly weak enantioselectivity. Here, we introduce a quantum control strategy to drive highly enantioselective electronic excitations in randomly oriented samples using a pulsed ($\sim$22 fs) IR laser and two of its harmonics, in the absence of intermediate resonances. Our approach addresses electronic transitions, does not require chiral sensitisers, or cold molecules, or long electronic coherence times, is relevant for liquid-phase samples, and remains effective over interaction regions extending across many laser wavelengths, even in the presence of dispersion. We show how, by 3D shaping the field's polarisation over the interaction region, we can achieve enantioselective coherent control over electronic population transfer. Our ab-initio simulations in the chiral molecule carvone yield a selectivity of $\sim$30 % in the populations of the first excited electronic state, three orders-of-magnitude higher than what is possible with circularly polarised light ($\sim$0.01 %). These results bring all-optical enantioselective photochemistry into the realm of practical applications.</description>
