      <title>Programmable Space-Frequency Linear Transformations in Photonic Interlacing Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable photonic circuits are versatile platforms that route light through multiple interference paths using reconfigurable optoelectronic elements to perform complex discrete linear operations. These circuits offer the potential for high-speed and low-power photonic information processing in various applications. The mainstream research on programmable photonics has focused on implementing linear operations on discrete signals encoded in the modal amplitudes of an array of spatially separated single-mode waveguides. However, many photonic device applications require simultaneous transformations in the space-frequency domain, where information is encoded in both the spatial modes of waveguides and their spectral content. Here, we experimentally demonstrate linear space-frequency transformations using a $4 \times 4$-port programmable silicon photonic circuit with an alternating architecture. This design leverages the limited dispersion of coupled waveguide arrays to enable linear operations with reconfigurable frequency-dependent matrix elements. We utilize this device to perform wavelength demultiplexing and filtering. This architecture platform can pave the way for versatile devices with applications ranging from wavelength routing to programmable dispersion control.</description>

      <title>An indirect correlation of dielectric properties using optical trapping and dielectric resonance in two different frequency regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric permittivity, $\varepsilon_r$, of materials are often limited to a sub-GHz range using normal LCR meters. In the GHz range the $\varepsilon_r$ can be measured using Vector Network Analyzers and measurement jigs (waveguides) which are specific for different frequency regimes. Hence, to measure er for the entire frequency range one needs several components and is an extremely costly experiment. However, for applications such as Dielectric Resonator Antennas one need to know the er and the dielectric loss to estimate the resonant frequency. An indirect method is proposed in this letter to find the er from Transversely Misaligned Dual-Fiber Optical Trapping at the optical frequency range to approximately estimate {\epsilon}r and thereby understand the correlation between these two regimes of frequency responses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical time-frequency transfer establishes the metrological linkage in large-scale clock networks, which facilitates various applications. Fiber-based transfer benefits from the abundant deployment of fiber infrastructures to achieve this advantage. In this Review, we provide an overview of the advances in optical two-way time-frequency transfer, which began with characterizing the time-frequency transfer stability. Then, we discuss the system configuration, key modules, main challenges, and mainstream transfer methods. Finally, the Review concludes with an outlook on further applications toward global-scale high-precision clock networks.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Distortion Equalization in Multi-Span Optical Links Via a Feed-Forward Photonic Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear and nonlinear distortions in optical communication signals are equalized using an integrated feed-forward Photonic Neural Network (PNN). The PNN is based on a linear stage made of an 8-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter, featuring tunable amplitude and phase weights at each tap, and of a nonlinear stage achieved through the square modulus operation at the end-of-line photodetector. Within an Intensity Modulation/Direct Detection (IMDD) system, the PNN is applied to 2-level Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM2) optical signals undergoing multi-span propagation. Each 50 km segment includes fiber transmission, optical power restoration, and optional chromatic dispersion compensation via a Tunable Dispersion Compensator. Positioned at the receiver, the PNN enables fully optical signal processing with minimal latency and power consumption. Experimental validation is conducted using a Silicon-On-Insulator device operating on 10 Gbps signals. It demonstrates chromatic dispersion equalization over distances up to 200 km and self-phase modulation (with dispersion removed) up to 450 km. Simulations explore PNN adaptation for 100 Gbps modulations and its potential for cross-phase modulation equalization.</description>

      <title>Room-Temperature Surface Exciton Polaritons in Colloidal J-Aggregate Flakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: J-aggregates are promising organic materials for nanophotonic applications due to their excitonic properties and ability to support surface exciton polaritons at room temperature, providing a robust platform for nanoscale light manipulation. While thin films composed of J-aggregates have demonstrated these advantages, colloidal J-aggregate nanoparticles remain underexplored. Herein, we report the synthesis of colloidal J-aggregate flakes by electrostatic interaction of cyanine molecules (TDBC) and oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride, PDDA). These flakes exhibit colloidal stability maintaining the J-aggregate conformation even in solvents that favoured their monomeric state. The characterization of the colloidal J-aggregate flakes reveals their capability to support surface exciton polaritons at room temperature. This was further confirmed at single-particle level by observing an angular-independent Reststrahlen band near the excitonic resonance. In addition, the colloidal flakes exhibit a strong scattering component that broadens the extinction band and redshifts the photoluminescence, indicating that the colloidal architecture influences the optical response. These findings introduce a versatile colloidal system for constructing excitonic nanostructures tailored for advanced photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Exploiting scattering-based point spread functions for snapshot 5D and modality-switchable lensless imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Snapshot multi-dimensional imaging offers a promising alternative to traditional low-dimensional imaging techniques by enabling the simultaneous capture of spatial, spectral, polarization, and other information in a single shot for improved imaging speed and acquisition efficiency. However, existing snapshot multi-dimensional imaging systems are often hindered by their large size, complexity, and high cost, which constrain their practical applicability. In this work, we propose a compact lensless diffuser camera for snapshot multi-dimensional imaging (Diffuser-mCam), which can reconstruct five-dimensional (5-D) images from a single-shot 2D recording of speckle-like measurement under incoherent illumination. By employing both the scattering medium and the space-division multiplexing strategy to extract high-dimensional optical features, we show that the multi-dimensional data (2D intensity distribution, spectral, polarization, time) of the desired light field can be encoded into a snapshot speckle-like pattern via a diffuser, and subsequently decoded using a compressed sensing algorithm at the sampling rate of 2.5%, eliminating the need for multi-scanning processes. We further demonstrate that our method can be flexibly switched between 5D and selectively reduced-dimensional imaging, providing an efficient way of reducing computational resource demands. Our work presents a compact, cost-effective, and versatile framework for snapshot multi-dimensional imaging and opens up new opportunities for the design of novel imaging systems for applications in areas such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Overprinting with Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing (TVAM) is a light-based 3D printing technique capable of producing centimeter-scale objects within seconds. A key challenge lies in the calculation of projection patterns under non-standard conditions, such as the presence of occlusions and materials with diverse optical properties, including varying refractive indices or scattering surfaces. This work focuses on demonstrating a wide variety of overprinting scenarios. First, utilizing a telecentric laser-based TVAM (LaserTVAM), we demonstrate the printing of a microfluidic perfusion system with biocompatible resins on existing nozzles for potential biomedical applications. In a subsequent demonstration, embedded spheres within the bio-resins are localized inside this perfusion system, optimized into specific patterns, and successfully connected to the nozzles via printed channels in less than three minutes. As a final LaserTVAM example, we print gears on a glossy metal rod, taking into account the scattered rays from the rod's surface. Using a non-telecentric LED-based TVAM (LEDTVAM), we then overprint engravings onto an existing LED placed in the resin. With an additional printed lens on this LED, we can project those engravings onto a screen. In a similar application with the same setup, we print microlenses on a glass tube filled with water, allowing us to image samples embedded within the glass tubes. Based on a differentiable physically-based ray optical approach, we are able to optimize all these scenarios within our existing open-source framework called Dr.TVAM. This framework enables the optimization of high-quality projections for both LaserTVAM and LEDTVAM setups within minutes, as well as lower-quality projections within seconds, outperforming existing solutions in terms of speed, flexibility, and quality.</description>

      <title>Sub-kelvin measurement of silicon thermal expansion with a Fabry-P\'erot cavity stabilized laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we report the measurement of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of single-crystal silicon from 655 mK to 16 K using an ultra-stable laser based on a single-crystal silicon Fabry-Perot cavity. Below 1 K temperatures, the CTE is in the $10^{-13}$ K$^{-1}$ range with a lowest point at $\boldsymbol{\alpha(}655$ mK$ \boldsymbol{)=} 3.5 \pm 0.4 \times 10^{-13}$ K$^{-1}$. We produce a theoretical model based on Debye and Einstein models to effectively approximate the CTE measured in this temperature range. This is the lowest-temperature CTE measurement of silicon to date, as well as the lowest operating temperature for an ultra-stable Fabry-Perot cavity for laser frequency stabilization.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Integration of Quantum Cascade Lasers with Germanium-on-Silicon waveguides for Mid-Infrared Sensing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel scheme for hybrid integration of quantum cascade laser bars with germanium-on-silicon waveguides operating in the mid-infrared. The laser bars are flip-chip bonded onto a germanium-on-silicon target chip without active alignment, acheiving end-fire coupling efficiency of up to 45% (3.5 dB loss) in pulsed operation. Optical power estimates indicate 20-30 mW coupled into the waveguides. The passive alignment approach, combined with a CMOS-compatible photonic integrated circuit fabrication process, offers a scalable pathway to fully integrated mid-infrared photonic systems for sensing, free-space communications, and the realisation of novel light sources.</description>

      <title>Multimode Nanobeam Photonic Crystal Cavities for Purcell Enhanced Quantum Dot Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epitaxial III-V semiconductor quantum dots in nanopthonic structures are promising candidates for implementing on-demand indistinguishable single-photon emission in integrated quantum photonic circuits. Quantum dot proximity to the etched sidewalls of hosting nanophotonic structures, however, has been shown to induce linewidth broadening of excitonic transitions, which limits emitted single-photon indistinguishability. Here, we design and demonstrate GaAs photonic crystal nanobeam cavities that maximize quantum dot distances to etched sidewalls beyond an empirically determined minimum that curtails spectral broadening. Although such geometric constraint necessarily leads to multimode propagation in nanobeams, which significantly complicates high quality factor cavity design, we achieve resonances with quality factors $Q\approx10^3$, which offer the potential for achieving Purcell radiative rate enhancements $F_p\approx100$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Wavefront sensing with static Foucault and pyramid tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavefront sensors (WFS) are now core components in the fields of metrology of optical systems, biomedical optics and adaptive optics systems for astronomy. Nowadays, the most popular WFS is the Shack-Hartmann, which is fully static but suffers from a limited spatial resolution in the pupil plane of the tested optical system. Higher spatial resolutions are achievable with other types of sensors, e.g. the pyramid WFS that requires temporal modulation of the recorded signals and implies high mechanical and electronic complexity. This paper examines the possibility of performing quantitative wavefront sensing inspired from the well-known Foucault test and only comprising static, non-modulated optical components. Here, two candidate designs of static WFS are proposed, based on a set of reflective prisms. Those prisms may be coated with gradient density filters. A simplified mathematical model allows for the definition of the wavefront slopes reconstruction formula and for the calculation of the wavefront itself. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the wavefront measurement accuracy is compliant with classical diffraction limit criteria when using coated prisms. Thus accurate WFE measurements are feasible in that case.</description>

      <title>Harnessing multi-mode optical structure for chemical reactivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prospect of controlling chemical reactivity using frequency-tunable optical microcavities has materialized over the past decade, evolving into a fascinating yet challenging new field of polaritonic chemistry, a multidisciplinary domain at the intersection of quantum optics, chemical dynamics, and non-equilibrium many-body physics. While most theoretical efforts to date have focused on single-mode cavities, practical implementations in polaritonic chemistry typically involve planar optical cavities that support a series of equally spaced photon modes, determined by the cavity geometry. In this work, we present a numerically exact, fully quantum-mechanical study of chemical reactions in few-mode cavities, revealing two key scenarios by which multi-mode effects can enhance cavity-modified reactivity. The first scenario emerges when the free spectral range is comparable to the single-mode Rabi splitting. In such cases, hybridization between a rate-decisive molecular vibration and a central resonant cavity mode reshapes the resonance landscape, enabling additional reaction pathways mediated by adjacent cavity modes. The second scenario exploits the intrinsic anharmonicity of molecular vibrations, which gives rise to multiple dipole-allowed transitions with distinct energies. Under multi-mode strong coupling, where different cavity modes individually resonate with these distinct transitions, multi-photon processes involving sequential absorption across multiple modes become accessible. This leads to a nontrivial and non-additive rate enhancement via cascade-like vibrational ladder climbing. Together, these findings offer new strategies for tailoring chemical reactivity by harnessing the structural richness of multi-mode structure, offering valuable insights for optimal experimental designs in polaritonic catalysis.</description>

      <title>Novel techniques of imaging interferometry analysis to study gas and plasma density for laser-plasma experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-plasma based experiments are always more demanding about the plasma characteristics which need to be generated during the interaction. This is valid for laser-plasma acceleration as well as for inertial confinement fusion experiments. Most of these experiments are moving toward high repetition rate operation regimes, making even more demanding the requests on the plasma sources and the diagnostics to be implemented.\\ Interferometry is one of the most used methods to characterize these sources, since it allows for non-perturbative, single-shot measurements either of the neutral gas or the plasma density. The design of the interferometric setup is non-trivial and needs to be shaped on the actual conditions of the experiment. Similarly, the analysis of the raw data is a complex task, prone to many sources of error and dependent on the manual inputs.\\ In this work, we will present the techniques we are developing for the analysis of the interferograms to measure both the gas and plasma density. We will show the methods, the progress and the problems we encountered in the development of novel routines of analysis based on machine learning. The architectures and the methods to obtain data used for training and testing them will be introduced. The study is ongoing and preliminary results with synthetic data will be presented. The goal is to set up a fast and operator independent diagnostic for the feedback of plasma sources toward high repetition rate experiments.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization of a Metamaterial Absorber for Solar Energy Harvesting in the THz Frequency Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the design and comprehensive characterization of a novel three-layer metamaterial absorber, engineered to exploit the unique optical properties of gold, vanadium dioxide, and silicon dioxide. At the core of this design, silicon dioxide serves as a robust substrate that supports an intricately structured layer of gold and a top layer of vanadium dioxide. This configuration is optimized to harness and enhance absorption capabilities effectively across a broadband terahertz (THz) spectrum. The absorber demonstrates an extensive absorption bandwidth of 3.00 THz, spanning frequencies from 2.414 THz to 5.417 THz. Remarkably, throughout this range, the device maintains a consistently high absorption efficiency, exceeding 90%. This efficiency is characterized by two sharp absorption peaks located at 2.638 THz and 5.158 THz, which signify the precise tuning of the metamaterial structure to interact optimally with specific THz frequencies. The absorbance of the proposed model is almost equal to 99%. This absorber is polarization insensitive. The development of this absorber involved a series of theoretical simulations backed by experimental validations, which helped refine the metamaterial's geometry and material composition. This process illuminated the critical role of the dielectric properties of silicon dioxide and the plasmonic effects induced by gold and vanadium dioxide layers, which collectively contribute to the high-performance metrics observed.</description>

      <title>Achieving precision in measuring birefringence characteristics of a periodically-poled Lithium Niobate waveguide</title>

Abstract: The refraction of light in an optical medium is not only a subject of fundamental interest, but the refractive index also plays a crucial role in applications involving integrated and non-linear optics. One such application is photon-pair generation in waveguides with second-order nonlinearity. The spectral properties of the generated photon pairs are governed by the effective group refractive indices of the interacting modes, which normally are calculated via Sellmeier's equations for bulk crystals. However, in integrated optics, the effective group refractive indices experienced by the propagating modes can differ from those in bulk materials. Therefore, we present an accurate, in-situ measurement technique for determining the birefringence characteristics of a structure with high reflective end facets by performing a Fourier transformation of the light transmission spectrum and apply this method to a periodically-poled Lithium Niobate waveguide resonator in the telecom wavelength range. We directly predict important spectral figures of merit of the photon-pair generation process, which depend on the optical path length difference that can be resolved with a high precision of more than 16 standard deviations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Nonlocal Metasurface for Harmonic Generation and Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06180</link>

Abstract: The discovery of second harmonic generation in 1961 marked the birth of nonlinear optics, unlocking a range of applications from frequency conversion to quantum light generation. Yet, phase matching in bulk nonlinear crystals remains a key bottleneck. Thinning nonlinear media eases this constraint but severely reduces nonlinear efficiency due to limited interaction length. Photonic metasurfaces, planar arrays of subwavelength meta atoms, offer a compelling alternative by supporting resonant modes that enhance local fields. However, existing designs suffer from a trade off between the high efficiency of nonlocal metasurfaces and the precise wavefront control enabled by local ones. These two capabilities have remained decoupled due to their fundamentally different mechanisms. Here, we design a nonlinear nonlocal metasurface supporting quasi trapped modes (QTM), enabling efficient third harmonic generation and meta atom level phase manipulation. Using topologically asymmetric all-dielectric meta-atoms, we achieve strong field confinement and demonstrate THG enhancement exceeding three orders of magnitude compared to unstructured films. By exploiting symmetry and Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase via meta atom rotation, we realize helicity dependent wavefront control at both the fundamental and TH wavelengths. A slight boundary perturbation yields geometric phase accumulation only at resonance, a behavior absent in conventional PB based metasurfaces. This selectivity arises from QTM field profiles that maintain global symmetry off resonance while enabling local geometric phase encoding at resonance. Our results advance silicon photonics and reveal new mechanisms for nonlinear geometric phase control at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Cavity-less Brillouin strong coupling in a solid-state continuous system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly coupling two systems allows them to exchange coherent information before the systems decohere. This important regime in light-matter interactions has predominantly been reached in optical resonator configurations. In this work, we present the experimental realization of strong coupling between optical and acoustic fields within a continuum of modes in a cavity-less configuration after a single-pass through an optical waveguide. The underlying physical effect of anti-Stokes Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering in a highly nonlinear fiber at T = 4 K allows us to experimentally demonstrate strong coupling in a waveguide scenario. We show the splitting of the optoacoustic spectral response and introduce a novel technique to measure the avoided crossing of hybrid optoacoustic modes via forced detuning. This demonstration opens a path towards in-line acoustic-waves-based quantum signal processing in waveguide systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the Maxwell system of electrodynamics within the framework of distributions. A primary objective is to establish boundary conditions for fields at interfaces when the charge and current densities are measures localized on the interface. From this analysis, the paper presents a derivation of the generalized Snell's law, along with formulas for the amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted waves in terms of the incident amplitude.</description>

      <title>An Overview of CV-MDI-QKD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum key distribution (QKD) emerges as a robust defense against quantum computer threats, significant advancements have been realized by researchers. A pivotal focus has been the development of protocols that not only simplify hardware implementation like the use of continuous-variable (CV) systems, but also negate the necessity for trusted nodes, as seen with the measurement-device independent (MDI) approach. This paper delves into the integration of these methodologies in the CV-MDI-QKD protocol, offering an in-depth exploration of its evolution, primary characteristics, and the latest advancements in both theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium origin of cavity-induced resonant modifications of chemical reactivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12568v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the influence of light-matter coupling on reaction dynamics and equilibrium properties of a single molecule inside an optical cavity. The reactive molecule is modeled using a triple-well potential, allowing two competing reaction pathways that yield distinct products. Dynamical and equilibrium simulations are performed using the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion approach in real- and imaginary-time formulations, respectively, both implemented with tree tensor network decomposition schemes. We consider two illustrative cases: one dominated by slow kinetics and another by ultrafast processes. Our results demonstrate that the rates of ground-state reaction pathways can be selectively enhanced when the cavity frequency is tuned into resonance with a vibrational transition directly leading to the formation of the corresponding product, even when that transition is spectroscopically dark. However, tuning cavity frequency to match an absorption-dominant transition shared across both reaction pathways does not necessarily result in pronounced rate enhancements and selectivity. Together with an additional analysis using an asymmetric double-well model, we highlight the greater complexity of underlying factors governing chemical reactivity, which extend beyond considerations of transition dipole strengths and thermal population distributions that shape linear spectroscopy. Furthermore, we found that in all scenarios, the equilibrium populations remain unchanged when the molecule is moved into the cavity, regardless of the cavity frequency. Thus, our study confirms at a fully quantum-mechanical level that cavity-induced modifications of chemical reactivities in resonant conditions arise from dynamical and non-equilibrium interactions between the cavity mode and molecular vibrations, rather than from the significant changes in equilibrium properties.</description>

      <title>Fibonacci Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a powerful framework for engineering quantum interactions, traditionally relying on periodic photonic arrays with continuous energy bands. Here, we investigate waveguide QED in a fundamentally different environment: A one-dimensional photonic array whose hopping strengths are structured aperiodically according to the deterministic Fibonacci-Lucas substitution rule. These "Fibonacci waveguides" lack translational invariance and are characterized by a singular continuous energy spectrum and critical eigenstates, representing a deterministic intermediate between ordered and disordered systems. We demonstrate how to achieve decoherence-free, coherent interactions in this unique setting. We analyze two paradigmatic cases: (i) Giant emitters resonantly coupled to the simplest aperiodic version of a standard waveguide. For these, we show that atom photon bound states form only for specific coupling configurations dictated by the aperiodic sequence, leading to an effective atomic Hamiltonian, which itself inherits the Fibonacci structure; and (ii) emitters locally and off-resonantly coupled to the aperiodic version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide. In this case the mediating bound states feature aperiodically modulated profiles, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian with multifractal properties. Our work establishes Fibonacci waveguides as a versatile platform, which is experimentally feasible, demonstrating that the deterministic complexity of aperiodic structures can be directly engineered into the interactions between quantum emitters.</description>
