      <title>Audio-JEPA: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture for Audio Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) paradigm, a recent self-supervised learning framework that predicts latent representations of masked regions in high-level feature spaces, we propose Audio-JEPA (Audio Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), tailored specifically for audio data. Audio-JEPA uses a simple Vision Transformer backbone to predict latent representations of masked spectrogram patches rather than reconstructing raw audio. We pre-train on unlabeled AudioSet clips (10s, 32kHz) with random patch masking on mel-spectrograms. We evaluate on the X-ARES suite covering speech, music, and environmental sound tasks. Although our implementation is a straightforward translation of the original model to audio, the results still show comparable performance to wav2vec 2.0 and data2vec while using less than one-fifth of their training data and with no hyper-parameter tuning. All code and pretrained checkpoints will be released on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Toward Efficient Speech Emotion Recognition via Spectral Learning and Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) traditionally relies on auditory data analysis for emotion classification. Several studies have adopted different methods for SER. However, existing SER methods often struggle to capture subtle emotional variations and generalize across diverse datasets. In this article, we use Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as spectral features to bridge the gap between computational emotion processing and human auditory perception. To further improve robustness and feature diversity, we propose a novel 1D-CNN-based SER framework that integrates data augmentation techniques. MFCC features extracted from the augmented data are processed using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture enhanced with channel and spatial attention mechanisms. These attention modules allow the model to highlight key emotional patterns, enhancing its ability to capture subtle variations in speech signals. The proposed method delivers cutting-edge performance, achieving the accuracy of 97.49% for SAVEE, 99.23% for RAVDESS, 89.31% for CREMA-D, 99.82% for TESS, 99.53% for EMO-DB, and 96.39% for EMOVO. Experimental results show new benchmarks in SER, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in recognizing emotional expressions with high precision. Our evaluation demonstrates that the integration of advanced Deep Learning (DL) methods substantially enhances generalization across diverse datasets, underscoring their potential to advance SER for real-world deployment in assistive technologies and human-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>Eigenvoice Synthesis based on Model Editing for Speaker Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speaker generation task aims to create unseen speaker voice without reference speech. The key to the task is defining a speaker space that represents diverse speakers to determine the generated speaker trait. However, the effective way to define this speaker space remains unclear. Eigenvoice synthesis is one of the promising approaches in the traditional parametric synthesis framework, such as HMM-based methods, which define a low-dimensional speaker space using pre-stored speaker features. This study proposes a novel DNN-based eigenvoice synthesis method via model editing. Unlike prior methods, our method defines a speaker space in the DNN model parameter space. By directly sampling new DNN model parameters in this space, we can create diverse speaker voices. Experimental results showed the capability of our method to generate diverse speakers' speech. Moreover, we discovered a gender-dominant axis in the created speaker space, indicating the potential to control speaker attributes.</description>

      <title>Speaker-agnostic Emotion Vector for Cross-speaker Emotion Intensity Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-speaker emotion intensity control aims to generate emotional speech of a target speaker with desired emotion intensities using only their neutral speech. A recently proposed method, emotion arithmetic, achieves emotion intensity control using a single-speaker emotion vector. Although this prior method has shown promising results in the same-speaker setting, it lost speaker consistency in the cross-speaker setting due to mismatches between the emotion vector of the source and target speakers. To overcome this limitation, we propose a speaker-agnostic emotion vector designed to capture shared emotional expressions across multiple speakers. This speaker-agnostic emotion vector is applicable to arbitrary speakers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method succeeds in cross-speaker emotion intensity control while maintaining speaker consistency, speech quality, and controllability, even in the unseen speaker case.</description>

      <title>MaskBeat: Loopable Drum Beat Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MaskBeat, a transformer-based approach for loopable drum pattern generation. Rather than predicting drum hits sequentially, our method uses bidirectional attention with iterative refinement, allowing instruments to be generated in parallel while maintaining musical coherence. Additionally, we introduce custom loss functions that capture drum-specific musical relationships. Our experiments show that MaskBeat generates higher quality and more musically coherent drum patterns than baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Direction Estimation of Sound Sources Using Microphone Arrays and Signal Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound-tracking refers to the process of determining the direction from which a sound originates, making it a fundamental component of sound source localization. This capability is essential in a variety of applications, including security systems, acoustic monitoring, and speaker tracking, where accurately identifying the direction of a sound source enables real-time responses, efficient resource allocation, and improved situational awareness. While sound-tracking is closely related to localization, it specifically focuses on identifying the direction of the sound source rather than estimating its exact position in space. Despite its utility, sound-tracking systems face several challenges, such as maintaining directional accuracy and precision, along with the need for sophisticated hardware configurations and complex signal processing algorithms. This paper presents a sound-tracking method using three electret microphones. We estimate the direction of a sound source using a lightweight method that analyzes signals from three strategically placed microphones. By comparing the average power of the received signals, the system infers the most probable direction of the sound. The results indicate that the power level from each microphone effectively determines the sound source direction. Our system employs a straightforward and cost-effective hardware design, ensuring simplicity and affordability in implementation. It achieves a localization error of less than 6 degrees and a precision of 98%. Additionally, its effortless integration with various systems makes it versatile and adaptable. Consequently, this technique presents a robust and reliable solution for sound-tracking and localization, with potential applications spanning diverse domains such as security systems, smart homes, and acoustic monitoring.</description>

      <title>Robust Localization of Partially Fake Speech: Metrics, Models, and Out-of-Domain Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial audio deepfake localization pose unique challenges and remain underexplored compared to full-utterance spoofing detection. While recent methods report strong in-domain performance, their real-world utility remains unclear. In this analysis, we critically examine the limitations of current evaluation practices, particularly the widespread use of Equal Error Rate (EER), which often obscures generalization and deployment readiness. We propose reframing the localization task as a sequential anomaly detection problem and advocate for the use of threshold-dependent metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which better reflect real-world behavior. Specifically, we analyze the performance of the open-source Coarse-to-Fine Proposal Refinement Framework (CFPRF), which achieves a 20-ms EER of 7.61% on the in-domain PartialSpoof evaluation set, but 43.25% and 27.59% on the LlamaPartialSpoof and Half-Truth out-of-domain test sets. Interestingly, our reproduced version of the same model performs worse on in-domain data (9.84%) but better on the out-of-domain sets (41.72% and 14.98%, respectively). This highlights the risks of over-optimizing for in-domain EER, which can lead to models that perform poorly in real-world scenarios. It also suggests that while deep learning models can be effective on in-domain data, they generalize poorly to out-of-domain scenarios, failing to detect novel synthetic samples and misclassifying unfamiliar bona fide audio. Finally, we observe that adding more bona fide or fully synthetic utterances to the training data often degrades performance, whereas adding partially fake utterances improves it.</description>

      <title>RECA-PD: A Robust Explainable Cross-Attention Method for Speech-based Parkinson's Disease Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects over 10 million people globally, with speech impairments often preceding motor symptoms by years, making speech a valuable modality for early, non-invasive detection. While recent deep-learning models achieve high accuracy, they typically lack the explainability required for clinical use. To address this, we propose RECA-PD, a novel, robust, and explainable cross-attention architecture that combines interpretable speech features with self-supervised representations. RECA-PD matches state-of-the-art performance in Speech-based PD detection while providing explanations that are more consistent and more clinically meaningful. Additionally, we demonstrate that performance degradation in certain speech tasks (e.g., monologue) can be mitigated by segmenting long recordings. Our findings indicate that performance and explainability are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Future work will enhance the usability of explanations for non-experts and explore severity estimation to increase the real-world clinical relevance.</description>

      <title>MusGO: A Community-Driven Framework For Assessing Openness in Music-Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since 2023, generative AI has rapidly advanced in the music domain. Despite significant technological advancements, music-generative models raise critical ethical challenges, including a lack of transparency and accountability, along with risks such as the replication of artists' works, which highlights the importance of fostering openness. With upcoming regulations such as the EU AI Act encouraging open models, many generative models are being released labelled as 'open'. However, the definition of an open model remains widely debated. In this article, we adapt a recently proposed evidence-based framework for assessing openness in LLMs to the music domain. Using feedback from a survey of 110 participants from the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community, we refine the framework into MusGO (Music-Generative Open AI), which comprises 13 openness categories: 8 essential and 5 desirable. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art generative models and provide an openness leaderboard that is fully open to public scrutiny and community contributions. Through this work, we aim to clarify the concept of openness in music-generative AI and promote its transparent and responsible development.</description>

      <title>CLEP-DG: Contrastive Learning for Speech Emotion Domain Generalization via Soft Prompt Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is fundamental to affective computing and human-computer interaction, yet existing models struggle to generalize across diverse acoustic conditions. While Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) provides strong multimodal alignment, it lacks dedicated mechanisms for capturing emotional cues, making it suboptimal for SER. To address this, we propose CLEP-DG, a framework that enhances CLAP's robustness in emotion recognition. First, we fine-tune CLAP to obtain CLEP, adapting it on large-scale emotional speech datasets to better encode emotion-relevant features. Then, we introduce Acoustic Context Prompt Tuning (ACPT), a text-driven augmentation strategy that optimizes learnable prompt vectors to model diverse acoustic environments without additional labeled audio. Finally, leveraging cross-modal transferability, we train a classifier on text-derived embeddings and apply it to the audio encoder during inference, mitigating domain shifts between textual supervision and audio-based emotion recognition. Experiments across five benchmark datasets show that CLEP-DG outperforms prior CLAP-based approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both supervised and domain generalization settings.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Sustain Pedal Depth Estimation from Piano Audio Across Room Acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piano sustain pedal detection has previously been approached as a binary on/off classification task, limiting its application in real-world piano performance scenarios where pedal depth significantly influences musical expression. This paper presents a novel approach for high-resolution estimation that predicts continuous pedal depth values. We introduce a Transformer-based architecture that not only matches state-of-the-art performance on the traditional binary classification task but also achieves high accuracy in continuous pedal depth estimation. Furthermore, by estimating continuous values, our model provides musically meaningful predictions for sustain pedal usage, whereas baseline models struggle to capture such nuanced expressions with their binary detection approach. Additionally, this paper investigates the influence of room acoustics on sustain pedal estimation using a synthetic dataset that includes varied acoustic conditions. We train our model with different combinations of room settings and test it in an unseen new environment using a "leave-one-out" approach. Our findings show that the two baseline models and ours are not robust to unseen room conditions. Statistical analysis further confirms that reverberation influences model predictions and introduces an overestimation bias.</description>

      <title>TTS-CtrlNet: Time varying emotion aligned text-to-speech generation with ControlNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) have enabled natural speech synthesis, but fine-grained, time-varying emotion control remains challenging. Existing methods often allow only utterance-level control and require full model fine-tuning with a large emotion speech dataset, which can degrade performance. Inspired by adding conditional control to the existing model in ControlNet (Zhang et al, 2023), we propose the first ControlNet-based approach for controllable flow-matching TTS (TTS-CtrlNet), which freezes the original model and introduces a trainable copy of it to process additional conditions. We show that TTS-CtrlNet can boost the pretrained large TTS model by adding intuitive, scalable, and time-varying emotion control while inheriting the ability of the original model (e.g., zero-shot voice cloning &amp; naturalness). Furthermore, we provide practical recipes for adding emotion control: 1) optimal architecture design choice with block analysis, 2) emotion-specific flow step, and 3) flexible control scale.
  Experiments show that ours can effectively add an emotion controller to existing TTS, and achieves state-of-the-art performance with emotion similarity scores: Emo-SIM and Aro-Val SIM. The project page is available at: https://curryjung.github.io/ttsctrlnet_project_page</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic data provide scientific and engineering insights in fields ranging from bioacoustics and communications to ocean and earth sciences. In this review, we survey recent advances and the transformative potential of machine learning (ML) in acoustics, including deep learning (DL). Using the Python high-level programming language, we demonstrate a broad collection of ML techniques to detect and find patterns for classification, regression, and generation in acoustics data automatically. We have ML examples including acoustic data classification, generative modeling for spatial audio, and physics-informed neural networks. This work includes AcousticsML, a set of practical Jupyter notebook examples on GitHub demonstrating ML benefits and encouraging researchers and practitioners to apply reproducible data-driven approaches to acoustic challenges.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised learning of speech representations with Dutch archival data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04554v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of Dutch archival television broadcast data for self-supervised learning of speech foundation models, specifically wav2vec 2.0. We first study data quality assumptions for pre-training, and show how music, noise and speaker overlap affect SSL convergence and downstream fine-tuning performance. Secondly, we explore effectively pre-processing strategies to convert the noisy broadcast dataset into a qualitative dataset for pre-training, by using Whisper and WhisperX. Thirdly, we compare mono-lingual and multi-lingual pre-training with equivalent amounts of data, and show that mono-lingual pre-training is more robust to out-of-domain data. Lastly, we achieve a state-of-the-art LARGE wav2vec 2.0 model for the Dutch language, by a continuation of pre-training a wav2vec 2.0 XLS-R model checkpoint with our 55k hour archival dataset.</description>

      <title>Multi-Step Prediction and Control of Hierarchical Emotion Distribution in Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate hierarchical emotion distribution (ED) for achieving multi-level quantitative control of emotion rendering in text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). We introduce a novel multi-step hierarchical ED prediction module that quantifies emotion variance at the utterance, word, and phoneme levels. By predicting emotion variance in a multi-step manner, we leverage global emotional context to refine local emotional variations, thereby capturing the intrinsic hierarchical structure of speech emotion. Our approach is validated through its integration into a variance adaptor and an external module design compatible with various TTS systems. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances emotional expressiveness and enables precise control of emotion rendering across multiple speech granularities.</description>

      <title>Improving BERT for Symbolic Music Understanding Using Token Denoising and Pianoroll Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a pre-trained BERT-like model for symbolic music understanding that achieves competitive performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. To achieve this target, we design two novel pre-training objectives, namely token correction and pianoroll prediction. First, we sample a portion of note tokens and corrupt them with a limited amount of noise, and then train the model to denoise the corrupted tokens; second, we also train the model to predict bar-level and local pianoroll-derived representations from the corrupted note tokens. We argue that these objectives guide the model to better learn specific musical knowledge such as pitch intervals. For evaluation, we propose a benchmark that incorporates 12 downstream tasks ranging from chord estimation to symbolic genre classification. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed pre-training objectives on downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Fast-VGAN: Lightweight Voice Conversion with Explicit Control of F0 and Duration Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control over speech characteristics, such as pitch, duration, and speech rate, remains a significant challenge in the field of voice conversion. The ability to manipulate parameters like pitch and syllable rate is an important element for effective identity conversion, but can also be used independently for voice transformation, achieving goals that were historically addressed by vocoder-based methods.
  In this work, we explore a convolutional neural network-based approach that aims to provide means for modifying fundamental frequency (F0), phoneme sequences, intensity, and speaker identity. Rather than relying on disentanglement techniques, our model is explicitly conditioned on these factors to generate mel spectrograms, which are then converted into waveforms using a universal neural vocoder. Accordingly, during inference, F0 contours, phoneme sequences, and speaker embeddings can be freely adjusted, allowing for intuitively controlled voice transformations.
  We evaluate our approach on speaker conversion and expressive speech tasks using both perceptual and objective metrics. The results suggest that the proposed method offers substantial flexibility, while maintaining high intelligibility and speaker similarity.</description>

      <title>Towards Human-in-the-Loop Onset Detection: A Transfer Learning Approach for Maracatu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore transfer learning strategies for musical onset detection in the Afro-Brazilian Maracatu tradition, which features complex rhythmic patterns that challenge conventional models. We adapt two Temporal Convolutional Network architectures: one pre-trained for onset detection (intra-task) and another for beat tracking (inter-task). Using only 5-second annotated snippets per instrument, we fine-tune these models through layer-wise retraining strategies for five traditional percussion instruments. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline performance, with F1 scores reaching up to 0.998 in the intra-task setting and improvements of over 50 percentage points in best-case scenarios. The cross-task adaptation proves particularly effective for time-keeping instruments, where onsets naturally align with beat positions. The optimal fine-tuning configuration varies by instrument, highlighting the importance of instrument-specific adaptation strategies. This approach addresses the challenges of underrepresented musical traditions, offering an efficient human-in-the-loop methodology that minimizes annotation effort while maximizing performance. Our findings contribute to more inclusive music information retrieval tools applicable beyond Western musical contexts.</description>

      <title>Music Boomerang: Reusing Diffusion Models for Data Augmentation and Audio Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models of music audio are typically used to generate output based solely on a text prompt or melody. Boomerang sampling, recently proposed for the image domain, allows generating output close to an existing example, using any pretrained diffusion model. In this work, we explore its application in the audio domain as a tool for data augmentation or content manipulation. Specifically, implementing Boomerang sampling for Stable Audio Open, we augment training data for a state-of-the-art beat tracker, and attempt to replace musical instruments in recordings. Our results show that the rhythmic structure of existing examples is mostly preserved, that it improves performance of the beat tracker, but only in scenarios of limited training data, and that it can accomplish text-based instrument replacement on monophonic inputs. We publish our implementation to invite experiments on data augmentation in other tasks and explore further applications.</description>

      <title>EXPOTION: Facial Expression and Motion Control for Multimodal Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Expotion (Facial Expression and Motion Control for Multimodal Music Generation), a generative model leveraging multimodal visual controls - specifically, human facial expressions and upper-body motion - as well as text prompts to produce expressive and temporally accurate music. We adopt parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on the pretrained text-to-music generation model, enabling fine-grained adaptation to the multimodal controls using a small dataset. To ensure precise synchronization between video and music, we introduce a temporal smoothing strategy to align multiple modalities. Experiments demonstrate that integrating visual features alongside textual descriptions enhances the overall quality of generated music in terms of musicality, creativity, beat-tempo consistency, temporal alignment with the video, and text adherence, surpassing both proposed baselines and existing state-of-the-art video-to-music generation models. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset consisting of 7 hours of synchronized video recordings capturing expressive facial and upper-body gestures aligned with corresponding music, providing significant potential for future research in multimodal and interactive music generation.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Difficulty of Saxophone Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In learning music, difficulty is an important factor in choice of repertoire, choice of tempo, and structure of practice. These choices are typically done with the guidance of a teacher; however, not all learners have access to one. While piano and strings have had some attention devoted to automated difficulty estimation, wind instruments have so far been under-served. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the difficulty of pieces for winds and implement it for the tenor saxophone. We take the cost-of-traversal approach, modelling the part as a sequence of transitions -- note pairs. We estimate transition costs from newly collected recordings of trill speeds, comparing representations of saxophone fingerings at various levels of expert input. We then compute and visualise the cost of the optimal path through the part, at a given tempo. While we present this model for the tenor saxophone, the same pipeline can be applied to other woodwinds, and our experiments show that with appropriate feature design, only a small proportion of possible trills is needed to estimate the costs well. Thus, we present a practical way of diversifying the capabilities of MIR in music education to the wind family of instruments.</description>

      <title>LAPS-Diff: A Diffusion-Based Framework for Singing Voice Synthesis With Language Aware Prosody-Style Guided Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) has seen significant advancements in recent years due to the rapid progress of diffusion-based approaches. However, capturing vocal style, genre-specific pitch inflections, and language-dependent characteristics remains challenging, particularly in low-resource scenarios. To address this, we propose LAPS-Diff, a diffusion model integrated with language-aware embeddings and a vocal-style guided learning mechanism, specifically designed for Bollywood Hindi singing style. We curate a Hindi SVS dataset and leverage pre-trained language models to extract word and phone-level embeddings for an enriched lyrics representation. Additionally, we incorporated a style encoder and a pitch extraction model to compute style and pitch losses, capturing features essential to the naturalness and expressiveness of the synthesized singing, particularly in terms of vocal style and pitch variations. Furthermore, we utilize MERT and IndicWav2Vec models to extract musical and contextual embeddings, serving as conditional priors to refine the acoustic feature generation process further. Based on objective and subjective evaluations, we demonstrate that LAPS-Diff significantly improves the quality of the generated samples compared to the considered state-of-the-art (SOTA) model for our constrained dataset that is typical of the low resource scenario.</description>

      <title>DiceHuBERT: Distilling HuBERT with a Self-Supervised Learning Objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DiceHuBERT, a knowledge distillation framework for compressing HuBERT, a widely used self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech foundation model. Unlike existing distillation methods that rely on layer-wise and feature-wise mapping between teacher and student models, DiceHuBERT leverages HuBERT's iterative self-distillation mechanism by directly replacing the original model with a student model. This replacement allows the student to be trained using the same SSL objective used when pre-training HuBERT, eliminating the need for additional modules or architectural constraints. Experimental results on SUPERB show that DiceHuBERT consistently outperforms existing distillation methods, improving phoneme recognition performance by over 21% and ASR performance by more than 14%. Furthermore, DiceHuBERT demonstrates competitive performance across multiple tasks, highlighting its clear advantage.</description>

      <title>A Unified Speech LLM for Diarization and Speech Recognition in Multilingual Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) have emerged as a crucial paradigm in recent years, extending the capabilities of traditional LLMs to speech tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken dialogue modeling. However, their effectiveness in real-world multilingual conversations remains limited by the scarcity of data that captures natural conversational phenomena. To address this, the MLC-SLM Challenge provides a multilingual conversational dataset and evaluates models on two tasks: ASR with oracle segmentation (Task I) and joint diarization and recognition without oracle information (Task II). In this paper, we focus on Task II and propose a unified speech LLM that jointly performs diarization and ASR in an end-to-end manner. By reformulating the training data format and modifying the inference procedure, our model addresses the ambiguity inherent in pre-segmented audio and achieves a 54.87\% relative improvement in tcpWER/tcpCER over the baseline, ranking 8th overall, despite using a smaller LLM backbone. We also report results from Task I using a fine-tuned speech LLM.</description>

      <title>K-Function: Joint Pronunciation Transcription and Feedback for Evaluating Kids Language Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early evaluation of children's language is frustrated by the high pitch, long phones, and sparse data that derail automatic speech recognisers. We introduce K-Function, a unified framework that combines accurate sub-word transcription, objective scoring, and actionable feedback. Its core, Kids-WFST, merges a Wav2Vec2 phoneme encoder with a phoneme-similarity Dysfluent-WFST to capture child-specific errors while remaining fully interpretable. Kids-WFST attains 1.39% phoneme error on MyST and 8.61% on Multitudes--absolute gains of 10.47 and 7.06 points over a greedy-search decoder. These high-fidelity transcripts power an LLM that grades verbal skills, milestones, reading, and comprehension, aligning with human proctors and supplying tongue-and-lip visualizations plus targeted advice. The results show that precise phoneme recognition cements a complete diagnostic-feedback loop, paving the way for scalable, clinician-ready language assessment.</description>

      <title>DeepGesture: A conversational gesture synthesis system based on emotions and semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Along with the explosion of large language models, improvements in speech synthesis, advancements in hardware, and the evolution of computer graphics, the current bottleneck in creating digital humans lies in generating character movements that correspond naturally to text or speech inputs.
  In this work, we present DeepGesture, a diffusion-based gesture synthesis framework for generating expressive co-speech gestures conditioned on multimodal signals-text, speech, emotion, and seed motion. Built upon the DiffuseStyleGesture model, DeepGesture introduces novel architectural enhancements that improve semantic alignment and emotional expressiveness in generated gestures. Specifically, we integrate fast text transcriptions as semantic conditioning and implement emotion-guided classifier-free diffusion to support controllable gesture generation across affective states. A lightweight Transformer backbone combines full self-attention and cross-local attention for effective feature fusion of heterogeneous modalities. To visualize results, we implement a full rendering pipeline in Unity based on BVH output from the model. Evaluation on the ZeroEGGS dataset shows that DeepGesture produces gestures with improved human-likeness and contextual appropriateness, outperforming baselines on Mean Opinion Score and Frechet Gesture Distance metrics. Our system supports interpolation between emotional states and demonstrates generalization to out-of-distribution speech, including synthetic voices-marking a step forward toward fully multimodal, emotionally aware digital humans.</description>

      <title>Improving Low-Resource Dialect Classification Using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models for dialect identification are often limited by the scarcity of dialectal data. To address this challenge, we propose to use Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC) as an effective data augmentation method for a low-resource German dialect classification task. By converting audio samples to a uniform target speaker, RVC minimizes speaker-related variability, enabling models to focus on dialect-specific linguistic and phonetic features. Our experiments demonstrate that RVC enhances classification performance when utilized as a standalone augmentation method. Furthermore, combining RVC with other augmentation methods such as frequency masking and segment removal leads to additional performance gains, highlighting its potential for improving dialect classification in low-resource scenarios.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Viability of Wave Field Synthesis in VR-Based Cognitive Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the viability of Wave Field Synthesis (WFS) for enhancing auditory immersion in VR-based cognitive research. While Virtual Reality (VR) offers significant advantages for studying human perception and behavior, auditory cues are often underutilized. WFS, an advanced audio rendering technique, can create highly realistic and spatially accurate soundscapes, potentially increasing ecological validity. This study evaluates WFS by implementing a sample experiment where participants localize static and moving sound sources in both a WFS-rendered environment and a conventional stereo headphone setup. The research explores the impact of virtual environments, sound types, and durations on localization accuracy and search behavior. Findings indicate that while stereo setups can achieve higher accuracy, WFS provides a more natural and intuitive auditory experience, particularly for directional cues. The study also highlights limitations of current WFS systems, such as the lack of height localization, occlusion simulation, and user-dependent optimization, which affect performance, especially for centrally located sound sources. Despite these challenges, WFS shows promise for specialized auditory perception research, particularly for complex soundscapes where directional information is paramount.</description>

      <title>Latent FxLMS: Accelerating Active Noise Control with Neural Adaptive Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Filtered-X LMS (FxLMS) is commonly used for active noise control (ANC), wherein the soundfield is minimized at a desired location. Given prior knowledge of the spatial region of the noise or control sources, we could improve FxLMS by adapting along the low-dimensional manifold of possible adaptive filter weights. We train an auto-encoder on the filter coefficients of the steady-state adaptive filter for each primary source location sampled from a given spatial region and constrain the weights of the adaptive filter to be the output of the decoder for a given state of latent variables. Then, we perform updates in the latent space and use the decoder to generate the cancellation filter. We evaluate how various neural network constraints and normalization techniques impact the convergence speed and steady-state mean squared error. Under certain conditions, our Latent FxLMS model converges in fewer steps with comparable steady-state error to the standard FxLMS.</description>

      <title>Prosody Labeling with Phoneme-BERT and Speech Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a model for automatic prosodic label annotation, where the predicted labels can be used for training a prosody-controllable text-to-speech model. The proposed model utilizes not only rich acoustic features extracted by a self-supervised-learning (SSL)-based model or a Whisper encoder, but also linguistic features obtained from phoneme-input pretrained linguistic foundation models such as PnG BERT and PL-BERT. The concatenation of acoustic and linguistic features is used to predict phoneme-level prosodic labels. In the experimental evaluation on Japanese prosodic labels, including pitch accents and phrase break indices, it was observed that the combination of both speech and linguistic foundation models enhanced the prediction accuracy compared to using either a speech or linguistic input alone. Specifically, we achieved 89.8% prediction accuracy in accent labels, 93.2% in high-low pitch accents, and 94.3% in break indices.</description>

      <title>Navigating Speech Recording Collections with AI-Generated Illustrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the amount of available spoken content is steadily increasing, extracting information and knowledge from speech recordings remains challenging. Beyond enhancing traditional information retrieval methods such as speech search and keyword spotting, novel approaches for navigating and searching spoken content need to be explored and developed. In this paper, we propose a novel navigational method for speech archives that leverages recent advances in language and multimodal generative models. We demonstrate our approach with a Web application that organizes data into a structured format using interactive mind maps and image generation tools. The system is implemented using the TED-LIUM~3 dataset, which comprises over 2,000 speech transcripts and audio files of TED Talks. Initial user tests using a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire indicate the application's potential to simplify the exploration of large speech collections.</description>

      <title>WSCoach: Wearable Real-time Auditory Feedback for Reducing Unwanted Words in Daily Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of wearable smart devices raises unprecedented opportunities for self-improvement through ubiquitous behavior tracking and guidance. However, the design of effective wearable behavior intervention systems remains relatively unexplored. To address this gap, we conducted controlled studies focusing on the reduction of unwanted words (e.g., filler words, swear words) in daily communication through auditory feedback using wearable technology. We started with a design space exploration, considering various factors such as the type, duration, and timing of the auditory feedback. Then, we conducted pilot studies to reduce the space of design choices and prototyped a system called WSCoach (Wearable Speech Coach), which informs users when they utter unwanted words in near-real-time. To evaluate WSCoach, we compared it with a state-of-the-art mobile application supporting post-hoc conversation analysis. Both approaches were effective in reducing the occurrence of unwanted words, but WSCoach appears to be more effective in the long run. Finally, we discuss guidelines for the design of wearable audio-based behavior monitoring and intervention systems and highlight the potential of wearable technology for facilitating behavior correction and improvement.

      <title>Adaptive Slimming for Scalable and Efficient Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) enables robust speech recognition, real-time communication, hearing aids, and other applications where speech quality is crucial. However, deploying such systems on resource-constrained devices involves choosing a static trade-off between performance and computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce dynamic slimming to DEMUCS, a popular SE architecture, making it scalable and input-adaptive. Slimming lets the model operate at different utilization factors (UF), each corresponding to a different performance/efficiency trade-off, effectively mimicking multiple model sizes without the extra storage costs. In addition, a router subnet, trained end-to-end with the backbone, determines the optimal UF for the current input. Thus, the system saves resources by adaptively selecting smaller UFs when additional complexity is unnecessary. We show that our solution is Pareto-optimal against individual UFs, confirming the benefits of dynamic routing. When training the proposed dynamically-slimmable model to use 10% of its capacity on average, we obtain the same or better speech quality as the equivalent static 25% utilization while reducing MACs by 29%.</description>

      <title>Hear-Your-Click: Interactive Video-to-Audio Generation via Object-aware Contrastive Audio-Visual Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation shows great potential in fields such as film production. Despite significant advances, current V2A methods, which rely on global video information, struggle with complex scenes and often fail to generate audio tailored to specific objects or regions in the videos. To address these limitations, we introduce Hear-Your-Click, an interactive V2A framework that enables users to generate sounds for specific objects in the videos by simply clicking on the frame. To achieve this, we propose Object-aware Contrastive Audio-Visual Fine-tuning (OCAV) with a Mask-guided Visual Encoder (MVE) to obtain object-level visual features aligned with corresponding audio segments. Furthermore, we tailor two data augmentation strategies: Random Video Stitching (RVS) and Mask-guided Loudness Modulation (MLM), aimed at enhancing the model's sensitivity to the segmented objects. To effectively measure the audio-visual correspondence, we design a new evaluation metric, the CAV score, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework offers more precise control and improved generation performance across various metrics.

      <title>OpenS2S: Advancing Fully Open-Source End-to-End Empathetic Large Speech Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05177v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empathetic interaction is a cornerstone of human-machine communication, due to the need for understanding speech enriched with paralinguistic cues and generating emotional and expressive responses. However, the most powerful empathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about the architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior, we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM designed to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content and controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional variation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic diversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source OpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and fine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate innovation in empathetic speech systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ConversaSynth, a framework designed to generate synthetic conversation audio using large language models (LLMs) with multiple persona settings. The framework first creates diverse and coherent text-based dialogues across various topics, which are then converted into audio using text-to-speech (TTS) systems. Our experiments demonstrate that ConversaSynth effectively generates highquality synthetic audio datasets, which can significantly enhance the training and evaluation of models for audio tagging, audio classification, and multi-speaker speech recognition. The results indicate that the synthetic datasets generated by ConversaSynth exhibit substantial diversity and realism, making them suitable for developing robust, adaptable audio-based AI systems.</description>

      <title>AADNet: An End-to-End Deep Learning Model for Auditory Attention Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Auditory attention decoding (AAD) is the process of identifying the attended speech in a multi-talker environment using brain signals, typically recorded through electroencephalography (EEG). Over the past decade, AAD has undergone continuous development, driven by its promising application in neuro-steered hearing devices. Most AAD algorithms are relying on the increase in neural entrainment to the envelope of attended speech, as compared to unattended speech, typically using a two-step approach. First, the algorithm predicts representations of the attended speech signal envelopes; second, it identifies the attended speech by finding the highest correlation between the predictions and the representations of the actual speech signals. In this study, we proposed a novel end-to-end neural network architecture, named AADNet, which combines these two stages into a direct approach to address the AAD problem. We compare the proposed network against the traditional approaches, including linear stimulus reconstruction, canonical correlation analysis, and an alternative non-linear stimulus reconstruction using two different datasets. AADNet shows a significant performance improvement for both subject-specific and subject-independent models. Notably, the average subject-independent classification accuracies from 56.1 % to 82.7 % with analysis window lengths ranging from 1 to 40 seconds, respectively, show a significantly improved ability to generalize to data from unseen subjects. These results highlight the potential of deep learning models for advancing AAD, with promising implications for future hearing aids, assistive devices, and clinical assessments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Music102, an advanced model aimed at enhancing chord progression accompaniment through a $D_{12}$-equivariant transformer. Inspired by group theory and symbolic music structures, Music102 leverages musical symmetry--such as transposition and reflection operations--integrating these properties into the transformer architecture. By encoding prior music knowledge, the model maintains equivariance across both melody and chord sequences. The POP909 dataset was employed to train and evaluate Music102, revealing significant improvements over the non-equivariant Music101 prototype Music101 in both weighted loss and exact accuracy metrics, despite using fewer parameters. This work showcases the adaptability of self-attention mechanisms and layer normalization to the discrete musical domain, addressing challenges in computational music analysis. With its stable and flexible neural framework, Music102 sets the stage for further exploration in equivariant music generation and computational composition tools, bridging mathematical theory with practical music performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global aging population faces considerable challenges, particularly in communication, due to the prevalence of hearing and speech impairments. To address these, we introduce the AVE speech, a comprehensive multi-modal dataset for speech recognition tasks. The dataset includes a 100-sentence Mandarin corpus with audio signals, lip-region video recordings, and six-channel electromyography (EMG) data, collected from 100 participants. Each subject read the entire corpus ten times, with each sentence averaging approximately two seconds in duration, resulting in over 55 hours of multi-modal speech data per modality. Experiments demonstrate that combining these modalities significantly improves recognition performance, particularly in cross-subject and high-noise environments. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available sentence-level dataset integrating these three modalities for large-scale Mandarin speech recognition. We expect this dataset to drive advancements in both acoustic and non-acoustic speech recognition research, enhancing cross-modal learning and human-machine interaction.</description>

      <title>Serenade: A Singing Style Conversion Framework Based On Audio Infilling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Serenade, a novel framework for the singing style conversion (SSC) task. Although singer identity conversion has made great strides in the previous years, converting the singing style of a singer has been an unexplored research area. We find three main challenges in SSC: modeling the target style, disentangling source style, and retaining the source melody. To model the target singing style, we use an audio infilling task by predicting a masked segment of the target mel-spectrogram with a flow-matching model using the complement of the masked target mel-spectrogram along with disentangled acoustic features. On the other hand, to disentangle the source singing style, we use a cyclic training approach, where we use synthetic converted samples as source inputs and reconstruct the original source mel-spectrogram as a target. Finally, to retain the source melody better, we investigate a post-processing module using a source-filter-based vocoder and resynthesize the converted waveforms using the original F0 patterns. Our results showed that the Serenade framework can handle generalized SSC tasks with the best overall similarity score, especially in modeling breathy and mixed singing styles. We also found that resynthesizing with the original F0 patterns alleviated out-of-tune singing and improved naturalness, but found a slight tradeoff in similarity due to not changing the F0 patterns into the target style.</description>

      <title>SwitchCodec: A High-Fidelity Nerual Audio Codec With Sparse Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural audio compression has emerged as a promising technology for efficiently representing speech, music, and general audio. However, existing methods suffer from significant performance degradation at limited bitrates, where the available embedding space is sharply constrained. To address this, we propose a universal high-fidelity neural audio compression algorithm featuring Residual Experts Vector Quantization (REVQ), which substantially expands the embedding space with minimal impact on bandwidth. A gentle load-balancing strategy is introduced to ensure the full utilization of this expanded space. Furthermore, we develop a novel multi-tiered discriminator that periodically stratifies STFT spectra, guiding the generator to focus on critical spectral regions. To support multiple bitrates without quality loss at the lower end, we adopt an efficient post-training strategy. Our proposed model achieves impressive performance, with PESQ and ViSQOL scores of 2.87 and 4.27, respectively, at 2.67 kbps bandwidth. The approach effectively reduces spectral blur, decreasing the distance to the original mel-spectrogram by 13%. Notably, our post-training strategy achieves performance comparable to dedicated fixed-bitrate models while reducing the required training time by half. Extensive ablation studies confirm the superiority of our method over baselines.</description>

      <title>UltrasonicSpheres: Localized, Multi-Channel Sound Spheres Using Off-the-Shelf Speakers and Earables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a demo of UltrasonicSpheres, a novel system for location-specific audio delivery using wearable earphones that decode ultrasonic signals into audible sound. Unlike conventional beamforming setups, UltrasonicSpheres relies on single ultrasonic speakers to broadcast localized audio with multiple channels, each encoded on a distinct ultrasonic carrier frequency. Users wearing our acoustically transparent earphones can demodulate their selected stream, such as exhibit narrations in a chosen language, while remaining fully aware of ambient environmental sounds. The experience preserves spatial audio perception, giving the impression that the sound originates directly from the physical location of the source. This enables personalized, localized audio without requiring pairing, tracking, or additional infrastructure. Importantly, visitors not equipped with the earphones are unaffected, as the ultrasonic signals are inaudible to the human ear. Our demo invites participants to explore multiple co-located audio zones and experience how UltrasonicSpheres supports unobtrusive delivery of personalized sound in public spaces.</description>

      <title>An introduction to pitch strength in contemporary popular music analysis and production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07473v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Music information retrieval distinguishes between low- and high-level descriptions of music. Current generative AI models rely on text descriptions that are higher level than the controls familiar to studio musicians. Pitch strength, a low-level perceptual parameter of contemporary popular music, may be one feature that could make such AI models more suited to music production. Signal and perceptual analyses suggest that pitch strength (1) varies significantly across and inside songs; (2) contributes to both small- and large-scale structure; (3) contributes to the handling of polyphonic dissonance; and (4) may be a feature of upper harmonics made audible in a perspective of perceptual richness.</description>

      <title>Manipulated Regions Localization For Partially Deepfake Audio: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of audio deepfake techniques, attacks with partially deepfake audio are beginning to rise. Compared to fully deepfake, it is much harder to be identified by the detector due to the partially cryptic manipulation, resulting in higher security risks. Although some studies have been launched, there is no comprehensive review to systematically introduce the current situations and development trends for addressing this issue. Thus, in this survey, we are the first to outline a systematic introduction for partially deepfake audio manipulated region localization tasks, including the fundamentals, branches of existing methods, current limitations and potential trends, providing a revealing insight into this scope.</description>

      <title>Evolving music theory for emerging musical languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This chapter reconsiders the concept of pitch in contemporary popular music (CPM), particularly in electronic contexts where traditional assumptions may fail. Drawing on phenomenological and inductive methods, it argues that pitch is not an ontologically objective property but a perceptual construct shaped by listeners and conditions. Analyses of quasi-harmonic tones reveal that a single tone can convey multiple pitches, giving rise to tonal fission. The perception of pitch may also be multistable, varying for the same listener over time. In this framework, the tuning system may emerge from a tone's internal structure. A parallel with the coastline paradox supports a model of pitch grounded in perceptual variability, challenging inherited theoretical norms.</description>

      <title>AVTENet: A Human-Cognition-Inspired Audio-Visual Transformer-Based Ensemble Network for Video Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent proliferation of hyper-realistic deepfake videos has drawn attention to the threat of audio and visual forgeries. Most previous studies on detecting artificial intelligence-generated fake videos only utilize visual modality or audio modality. While some methods exploit audio and visual modalities to detect forged videos, they have not been comprehensively evaluated on multimodal datasets of deepfake videos involving acoustic and visual manipulations, and are mostly based on convolutional neural networks with low detection accuracy. Considering that human cognition instinctively integrates multisensory information including audio and visual cues to perceive and interpret content and the success of transformer in various fields, this study introduces the audio-visual transformer-based ensemble network (AVTENet). This innovative framework tackles the complexities of deepfake technology by integrating both acoustic and visual manipulations to enhance the accuracy of video forgery detection. Specifically, the proposed model integrates several purely transformer-based variants that capture video, audio, and audio-visual salient cues to reach a consensus in prediction. For evaluation, we use the recently released benchmark multimodal audio-video FakeAVCeleb dataset. For a detailed analysis, we evaluate AVTENet, its variants, and several existing methods on multiple test sets of the FakeAVCeleb dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms all existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on Testset-I and Testset-II of the FakeAVCeleb dataset. We also compare AVTENet against humans in detecting video forgery. The results show that AVTENet significantly outperforms humans.</description>

      <title>SEE-2-SOUND: Zero-Shot Spatial Environment-to-Spatial Sound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating combined visual and auditory sensory experiences is critical for the consumption of immersive content. Recent advances in neural generative models have enabled the creation of high-resolution content across multiple modalities such as images, text, speech, and videos. Despite these successes, there remains a significant gap in the generation of high-quality spatial audio that complements generated visual content. Furthermore, current audio generation models excel in either generating natural audio or speech or music but fall short in integrating spatial audio cues necessary for immersive experiences. In this work, we introduce SEE-2-SOUND, a zero-shot approach that decomposes the task into (1) identifying visual regions of interest; (2) locating these elements in 3D space; (3) generating mono-audio for each; and (4) integrating them into spatial audio. Using our framework, we demonstrate compelling results for generating spatial audio for high-quality videos, images, and dynamic images from the internet, as well as media generated by learned approaches.</description>

      <title>UniForm: A Unified Multi-Task Diffusion Transformer for Audio-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03897v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of diffusion models, audio-video generation has been revolutionized. However, most existing methods rely on separate modules for each modality, with limited exploration of unified generative architectures. In addition, many are confined to a single task and small-scale datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce UniForm, a unified multi-task diffusion transformer that generates both audio and visual modalities in a shared latent space. By using a unified denoising network, UniForm captures the inherent correlations between sound and vision. Additionally, we propose task-specific noise schemes and task tokens, enabling the model to support multiple tasks with a single set of parameters, including video-to-audio, audio-to-video and text-to-audio-video generation. Furthermore, by leveraging large language models and a large-scale text-audio-video combined dataset, UniForm achieves greater generative diversity than prior approaches. Experiments show that UniForm achieves performance close to the state-of-the-art single-task models across three generation tasks, with generated content that is not only highly aligned with real-world data distributions but also enables more diverse and fine-grained generation.</description>

      <title>ALAS: Measuring Latent Speech-Text Alignment For Spoken Language Understanding In Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Spoken Language Understanding (SLU), where effective multimodal learning depends on the alignment between audio and text. Despite various fusion methods, no standard metric exists to assess this alignment. This work introduces ALAS (Automatic Latent Alignment Score), a metric that evaluates alignment by measuring correlations between audio and text representations across transformer layers. Experiments on Spoken Question Answering and Emotion Recognition show that ALAS captures meaningful patterns across tasks and layers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents our system for the MLC-SLM Challenge 2025, focusing on multilingual speech recognition and language modeling with large language models (LLMs). Our approach combines a fine-tuned Whisper-large-v3 encoder with efficient projector architectures and various decoder configurations. We employ a three-stage training methodology that progressively optimizes the encoder, projector, and LLM components. Our system achieves competitive performance with a private test average WER/CER result of 16.63% using the Gemma3-12B and 18.6% using the Qwen2.5-7B as decoder-only language model.</description>

      <title>Self-Steering Deep Non-Linear Spatially Selective Filters for Efficient Extraction of Moving Speakers under Weak Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works on deep non-linear spatially selective filters demonstrate exceptional enhancement performance with computationally lightweight architectures for stationary speakers of known directions. However, to maintain this performance in dynamic scenarios, resource-intensive data-driven tracking algorithms become necessary to provide precise spatial guidance conditioned on the initial direction of a target speaker. As this additional computational overhead hinders application in resource-constrained scenarios such as real-time speech enhancement, we present a novel strategy utilizing a low-complexity tracking algorithm in the form of a particle filter instead. Assuming a causal, sequential processing style, we introduce temporal feedback to leverage the enhanced speech signal of the spatially selective filter to compensate for the limited modeling capabilities of the particle filter. Evaluation on a synthetic dataset illustrates how the autoregressive interplay between both algorithms drastically improves tracking accuracy and leads to strong enhancement performance. A listening test with real-world recordings complements these findings by indicating a clear trend towards our proposed self-steering pipeline as preferred choice over comparable methods.</description>
