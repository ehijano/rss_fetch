      <title>Semiclassical scattering by edge imperfections in topological insulators under magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scattering of edge states of 2D topological insulator (TI) in the uniform external magnetic field due to edge imperfections, common in realistic 2D TI samples. The external magnetic field breaks time reversal (TR) symmetry, opening the possibility of the scattering of otherwise topologically protected fermionic edge states. The scattering happens to be always an over-barrier event, irrespective of the shape of the edge deformation and magnitude of the magnetic field. We use the advanced Pokrovsky-Khalatnikov semiclassical approach, which allows us to obtain analytically both the main exponential and pre-exponential factors of the scattering amplitude for wide classes of analytic deformation profiles.</description>

      <title>Engineering a Josephson junction chain for the simulation of the clock model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous improvement of fabrication techniques and high-quality semiconductor-superconductor interfaces allowed for unprecedented tunability of Josephson junction arrays (JJA), making them a promising candidate for analog quantum simulations of many-body phenomena. While most experimental proposals so far focused on quantum simulations of ensembles of two-level systems, the possibility of tuning the current-phase relation beyond the sinusoidal regime paves the way for studying statistical physics models with larger local Hilbert spaces. Here, we investigate a particular JJA architecture that can be mapped into a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model. Through matrix-product-states simulations and bosonization analysis, we show that few experimentally accessible control parameters allow for the exploration of the rich phase diagrams of the associated low-energy field theories. Our results expand the horizon for analog quantum simulations with JJAs towards models that can not be efficiently captured with qubit architectures.</description>

      <title>Floating Edge Bands in the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model with Altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floating edge bands (FEB) have been identified in systems such as obstructed atomic insulators and layered nonsymmorphic semimetals, attracting considerable interest recently. Here we demonstrate that FEB can arise in a simplified model incorporating altermagnetism. By enhancing the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model on a square lattice with additional altermagnetic and Zeeman fields perpendicular to the 2D plane, we uncover the emergence of FEB that are distinct from the bulk bands across the entire Brillouin zone and over broad parameter regimes. We calculate topological phase diagrams, highlighting the strong topological properties characterized by the Chern number and the weak topological properties marked by the winding number. Furthermore, we provide analytical results of the energy spectrum and the wave functions of the FEB. We also study the robustness of the FEB, showcasing its resilience against various perturbations such as geometric rotation, energy spectrum asymmetry, and spin coupling. Our findings advance our understanding of FEB and may pave new avenues for further exploration of topological phases in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear thermoplasmonics in graphene nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear electronic dispersion relation of graphene endows the atomically thin carbon layer with a large intrinsic optical nonlinearity, with regard to both parametric and photothermal processes. While plasmons in graphene nanostructures can further enhance nonlinear optical phenomena, boosting resonances to the technologically relevant mid- and near-infrared (IR) spectral regime necessitates patterning on $\sim10$ nm length scales, for which quantum finite-size effects play a crucial role. Here we show that thermoplasmons in narrow graphene nanoribbons can be activated at mid- and near-IR frequencies with moderate absorbed energy density, and furthermore can drive substantial third-harmonic generation and optical Kerr nonlinearities. Our findings suggest that photothermal excitation by ultrashort optical pulses offers a promising approach to enable nonlinear plasmonic phenomena in nanostructured graphene that avoids potentially invasive electrical gating schemes and excessive charge carrier doping levels.</description>

      <title>Impact of biased cooling on the operation of undoped silicon quantum well field-effect devices for quantum circuit applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gate-tunable semiconductor nanosystems are getting more and more important in the realization of quantum circuits. While such devices are typically cooled to operation temperature with zero bias applied to the gate, biased cooling corresponds to a non-zero gate voltage being applied before reaching the operation temperature. We systematically study the effect of biased cooling on different undoped SiGe/Si/SiGe quantum well field-effect stacks (FESs), designed to accumulate and density-tune two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs). In an empirical model, we show that biased cooling of the undoped FES induces a static electric field, which is constant at operation temperature and superimposes onto the field exerted by the top gate onto the 2DEG. We show that the voltage operation window of the field-effect-tuned 2DEG can be chosen in a wide range of voltages via the choice of the biased cooling voltage. Importantly, quality features of the 2DEG such as the mobility or the temporal stability of the 2DEG density remain unaltered under biased cooling. We discuss how this additional degree of freedom in the tunability of FESs may be relevant for the operation of quantum circuits, in particular for the electrostatic control of spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Single-mode spin-wave laser driven by spin-orbit torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central goal in spintronics and magnonics is the use of spin waves rather than electrons for efficient information processing. The key to integrate such spintronic circuits with electronic circuits is the ability to inject, control and detect coherent spin waves with charge currents. Here, we propose a tunable setup consisting of a synthetic antiferromagnet in an inhomogeneous magnetic field in which one of the magnetic layers is thin and biased by spin-orbit torque. We show that for appriopriate conditions single-mode coherent spin waves are emitted in this set-up. The set-up implements coupling of continuum spin waves with a finite region of negative energy spin waves, such that specific frequencies become self-amplified and thus start lasing. We show there exist a large region in parameter space for which the coherent spin wave laser is stabilized by non-linearities and spin-orbit torques. Our findings may lead to new ways of injecting coherent spin waves with direct currents.</description>

      <title>High fidelity TiN processing modes for multi-gate Ge-based quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge or spin-qubits can be realized by using gate-defined quantum dots (QDs) in semiconductors in a similar fashion to the processes used in CMOS for conventional field-effect transistors or more recent fin FET technology. However, to realize larger number of gate-defined qubits, multiples of gates with ultimately high resolution and fidelity is required. Electron beam lithography (EBL) offers flexible and tunable patterning of gate-defined spin-qubit devices for studying important quantum phenomena. While such devices are commonly realized by a positive resist process using metal lift-off, there are several clear limitations related to the resolution and the fidelity of patterning. Herein, we report a systematic study of an alternative TiN multi-gates definition approach based on the highest resolution hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) EBL resist and all associated processing modes. The TiN gate arrays formed show excellent fidelity, dimensions down to 15 nm, various densities, and complexities. The processing modes developed were used to demonstrate applicability of this approach to forming multi-gate architectures for two types of spin-qubit devices prototypic to i) NW/fin-type FETs and ii) planar quantum well-type devices, both utilizing epi-grown Ge device layers on Si, where GeSn or Ge are the host materials for the QDs.</description>

      <title>Exact Polaron-Polaron interactions in a Quantum Hall Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact solution for effective polaron-polaron interactions between heavy impurities, mediated by a sea of non-interacting light fermions in the quantum Hall regime with highly degenerate Landau levels. For weak attraction between impurities and fermions, where only the manifold of lowest Landau levels is relevant, we obtain an analytical expression of mediated polaron-polaorn interactions. Remarkably, polaron interactions are exactly zero when fermions in lowest Landau levels outnumber heavy impurities. For strong attraction, different manifolds of higher Landau levels come into play and we derive a set of equations that can be used to numerically solve the mediated polaron interaction potential. We find that the potential vanishes when the distance R between impurities is larger than the magnetic length, but strongly diverges at short range following a Coulomb form -1/R. Our exact results of polaron-polaron interactions might be examined in cold-atom setups, where a system of Fermi polarons in the quantum Hall regime is realized with synthetic gauge field or under fast rotation. Our predictions could also be useful to understand the effective interaction between exciton-polarons in electron-doped semiconductors under strong magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Magnetization patterns in $\text{GaAs}$-$\text{Fe}_{\text{33}}\text{Co}_{\text{67}}$ core-shell nanorods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study on the static magnetic properties of individual $\text{GaAs}$-$\text{Fe}_{\text{33}}\text{Co}_{\text{67}}$ core-shell nanorods. X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism combined with Photoemission Electron Microscopy (XMCD-PEEM) and Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) were used to investigate the magnetic nanostructures. The magnetic layer is purposely designed to establish a magnetic easy axis neither along a high symmetry nor mirror axes to promote 3D magnetic helical order on the curved surface. In practice, two types of magnetic textures with in-plane magnetization were found inside the nanostructures' facets: magnetic domains with almost longitudinal or almost perpendicular magnetization with respect to the axis of the tube. We observe that a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the long axis of the nanostructure can add an azimuthal component of the magnetization to the previously almost longitudinal magnetization.</description>

      <title>Squeezed state protection of fine structure in "Poor Man's Majorana" via quantum spin coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "Poor Man's Majorana" [Phys. Rev. B 86, 134528 (2012)] devoid of topological protection has been theoretically predicted to rely on the minimal Kitaev chain. Afterward, a pair of superconducting and spinless quantum dots turned the proposal practicable and differential conductance pinpointed consistent fingerprints with such a scenario [Nature 614, 445 (2023) and Nature 630, 329 (2024)]. In this work, we propose a model wherein the "Poor Man's Majorana" presents protection when one of the dots is exchange coupled to a quantum spin. If this quantum dot is perturbed by tuning the exchange coupling, the well-known spill over-like behavior of this Majorana surprisingly remains unchanged, and solely half of the fine structure is unexpectedly viewed. As a matter of fact, the "Poor Man's Majorana" zero mode consists in squeezing of the other half at zero frequency, which imposes its pinning there and prevents the mixing of the mode with the explicit fine structure. We claim that if the supposed unavoidable split of the zero mode by the fine structure is unexpectedly absent, then the "Poor Man's Majorana" can be considered robust against the quantum spin. In this way, it becomes protected and the lack of topological protection paradigm of the "Poor Man's Majorana" has been revisited, pushing this seemingly well-established issue into a new direction.</description>

      <title>Bounds and anomalies of inhomogeneous anomalous Hall effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well recognized that interpreting transport experiment results can be challenging when the samples being measured are spatially nonuniform. However, quantitative understanding on the differences between measured and actual transport coefficients, especially the Hall effects, in inhomogeneous systems is lacking. In this work we use homogenization theory to find exact bounds of the measured or homogenized anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in inhomogeneous conductors under minimal assumptions. In particular, we prove that the homogenized AHC cannot exceed the bounds of the local AHC. However, in common experimental setups, anomalies that appear to violate the above bounds can occur, with a popular example being the "humps" or "dips" of the Hall hysteresis curves usually ascribed to the topological Hall effect (THE). We give two examples showing how such apparent anomalies could be caused by different types of inhomogeneities and discuss their relevance in experiments.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Chiral Superconductivity in Rhombohedral Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral superconductors are unconventional superconducting states that break time reversal symmetry spontaneously and typically feature Cooper pairing at non-zero angular momentum. Such states may host Majorana fermions and provide an important platform for topological physics research and fault-tolerant quantum computing. Despite of intensive search and prolonged studies of several candidate systems, chiral superconductivity has remained elusive so far. Here we report the discovery of unconventional superconductivity in rhombohedral tetra-layer graphene. We observed two superconducting states in the gate-induced flat conduction bands with Tc up to 300 mK and charge density ne as low as 2.4*1011 cm-2, appearing robustly in three different devices, where electrons reside close to a proximate WSe2 layer, far away from WSe2, and in the absence of WSe2 respectively. Spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry-breaking (TRSB) due to electron's orbital motion is found, and several observations indicate the chiral nature of these superconducting states, including 1. In the superconducting state, Rxx shows fluctuations at zero magnetic field and magnetic hysteresis versus an out-of-plane magnetic field B, which are absent from all other superconductors; 2. one superconducting state develops within a spin- and valley-polarized quarter-metal phase, and is robust against the neighboring spin-valley-polarized quarter-metal state under B; 3. the normal states show anomalous Hall signals at zero magnetic field and magnetic hysteresis. We also observed a critical B &gt; 0.9 Tesla, higher than any graphene superconductivity reported so far and indicates a strong-coupling superconductivity close the BCS-BEC crossover. Our observations establish a pure carbon material for the study of topological superconductivity, and pave the way to explore Majorana modes and topological quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Obstruction to Broken Symmetries in Topological Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the abundance of symmetry breaking states in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene and other two-dimensional materials, we study superconducting (SC) and charge orders in two-dimensional topological flat bands in the strong correlation regime. By relating the half-filled 2D topological flat bands to the surface states of 3D topological insulators in symmetry class AIII, we reveal the topological obstruction to the formation of gapped SC and inter-valley charge orders without intrinsic topological orders, in the presence of the anti-unitary particle-hole symmetry at half filling. This is a generalization of the Li-Haldane arguments for nodal superconductivity to strongly interacting electrons. In contrast to the $\mathbb{Z}$-valued obstruction derived from the non-interacting band topology, the topological obstruction of interacting electrons in half-filled flat bands has a $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$ classification, depending on the charge (valley) Chern number of the superconducting (inter-valley charge) orders. This is demonstrated by an interacting Hamiltonian for half-filled flat bands with a net Chern number $C=4$, where superconductivity and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order coexist in a gapped ground state with particle-hole symmetry.</description>

      <title>Universal MJ Spintronic Model: Navigating a Serendipitous Expedition in the Quantum World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a pair of novel universal MJ spintronic models that precisely mirror the complex spin textures observed in materials. The spin-orbit coupled (SOC) Hamiltonians $\mathcal{H}_{MJ1}$ and $\mathcal{H}_{MJ2}$ reveal a range of novel and intriguing spin phenomena by modulating spin-orbit interactions. These Hamiltonians exemplify two distinct spin textures: $\mathcal{H}_{MJ1}$ distinguishes between unidirectional momentum-independent persistent spin texture (PST) and bidirectional partial PST while $\mathcal{H}_{MJ2}$ portrays a spiral spin texture that can be conceptually tied to the expansion/contraction of the quantum universe in a two-dimensional plane. We also explore the fundamental aspects of earlier analytical models that underpin the construction of the present MJ spintronic model. The physical interpretation of these models is illustrated graphically and the emerging spin phenomena resulting from complex SOC are elucidated using a simple vector model.</description>

      <title>Electron ptychography reveals a ferroelectricity dominated by anion displacements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sodium niobate, a lead-free ferroic material, hosts delicately-balanced, competing order parameters, including ferroelectric states that can be stabilized by epitaxial strain. Here, we show that the resulting macroscopic ferroelectricity exhibits an unconventional microscopic structure using multislice electron ptychography. This technique overcomes multiple scattering artifacts limiting conventional electron microscopy, enabling both lateral spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit and recovery of three-dimensional structural information. These imaging capabilities allow us to separate the ferroelectric interior of the sample from the relaxed surface structure and identify the soft phonon mode and related structural distortions with picometer precision. Unlike conventional ferroelectric perovskites, we find that the polar distortion in this material involves minimal distortions of the cation sublattices and is instead dominated by anion displacements. We establish limits on film thickness for interfacial octahedral rotation engineering and directly visualize an incommensurate octahedral rotation pattern, arising from the flat dispersion of the associated phonon mode.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure and Topology in Gulf-edged Zigzag Graphene Nanoribbons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With advanced synthetic techniques, a wide variety of well-defined graphene nano-ribbons (GNRs) can be produced with atomic precision. Hence, finding the relation between their structures and properties becomes important for the rational design of GNRs. In this work, we explore the complete chemical space of gulf-edged zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNR-Gs), a subclass of zigzag GNRs in which the zigzag edges miss carbon atoms in a regular sequence. We demonstrate that the electronic properties of ZGNR-Gs depend on four structural parameters: ribbon width, gulf edge size, unit length, and gulf offset. Using tight-binding calculations and the Hubbard model, we find that all ZGNR-Gs are semiconductors with varying band gaps; there are no metals in this class of materials. Notably, when spin polarization is considered, most ZGNR-Gs exhibit antiferromagnetic behavior, with the spin moments and spin-induced band gap opening being stabilized by longer zigzag segments at the edges. Furthermore, we provide simple empirical rules that describe the Z2 topological invariant based on the aforementioned structural parameters. By analyzing the full chemical space of ZGNR-Gs, we offer insights into the design of GNRs with desired electronic, magnetic, and topological properties for nanoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the reactivity of Si(100)-Cl toward PBr3 by charging Si dangling bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of the PBr3 molecule with Si dangling bonds (DBs) on a chlorinated Si(100) surface was studied. The DBs were charged in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and then exposed to PBr3 directly in the STM chamber. Uncharged DBs rarely react with molecules. On the contrary, almost all positively charged DBs were filled with molecule fragments. As a result of the PBr3 interaction with the positively charged DB, the molecule dissociated into PBr2 and Br with the formation of a Si-Br bond and PBr2 desorption. These findings show that charged DBs significantly modify the reactivity of the surface towards PBr3. Additionally, we calculated PH3 adsorption on a Si(100)-2x1-H surface with DBs and found that the DB charge also has a significant impact. As a result, we demonstrated that the positively charged DB with a doubly unoccupied state enhances the adsorption of molecules with a lone pair of electrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in spin transport research have highlighted the potential of quantum paramagnets as platforms for exploring novel phenomena and developing next-generation technologies. In this paper, we investigate the flavor Nernst effect (FNE) in quantum paramagnets, focusing on the Hall-type thermal spin transport of crystal electric field (CEF) excitations with spin-orbit couplings. As a proof of principle, we investigate the quantum paramagnetic ground state in an effective spin-1 Hamiltonian with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and a large hard-axis anisotropy. We employ linear flavor-wave theory to analyze the low-energy excitations, and obtain the flavor Nernst coefficients from the linear response theory. We demonstrate the FNE in a 2D pyrochlore thin film with an all-in-all-out Ising axis configuration, and investigate their dependence on temperature, anisotropy, DM interaction, and external fields. Our results reveal the connection between the FNE and the Berry curvature of the CEF excitations, suggesting potential applications in manipulating thermal spin currents and exploring topological spin transport phenomena in quantum paramagnets.</description>

      <title>Theory of High-Temperature Superfluorescence in Hybrid Perovskite Thin Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superfluorescence in hybrid perovskite thin films has opened new possibilities for harnessing macroscopic quantum phenomena in nanotechnology. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism that enables high-temperature superfluorescence in these systems. The proposed model describes a quasi-2D Wannier exciton in a thin film that interacts with phonons via the longitudinal optical phonon-exciton Frohlich interaction. We show that the superradiant properties of the coherent state in hybrid perovskites are stable against perturbations caused by the longitudinal optical phonon-exciton Frohlich interaction. Using the multiconfiguration Hartree approach, we derive semiclassical equations of motion for a single-exciton wavefunction, where the vibrational degrees of freedom interact with the Wannier exciton through a mean-field Hartree term. Superradiance is effectively described by a non-Hermitian term in the Hamiltonian. The analysis was then extended to multiple excited states using the semiclassical Hamiltonian as the basic model. We demonstrate that the ground state of the model exciton Hamiltonian with long-range interactions is a symmetric Dicke superradiant state, where the Frohlich interaction is nullified. The additional density matrix-based consideration draws an analogy between this system and stable systems, where the conservation laws determine the nullification of the constant (momentum-independent) decay rate part. In the exciton-phonon system, nullification is associated with the absence of a momentum-independent component in the Wannier exciton-phonon interaction coupling function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.03429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological band theory has conventionally been concerned with the topology of bands around a single gap. Only recently non-Abelian {topologies that thrive on involving multiple gaps} were studied, unveiling a new horizon {in topological physics} beyond the conventional paradigm. Here, we report on the first experimental realization of a topological Euler insulator phase with unique meronic characterization in an acoustic metamaterial. We demonstrate that this topological phase has several nontrivial features: First, the system cannot be {described} by conventional topological band theory, but has a nontrivial Euler class that captures the unconventional geometry {of the Bloch} bands {in the Brillouin zone}. Second, we uncover in theory and probe in experiments a meronic configuration of the bulk Bloch states for the first time. Third, using a detailed symmetry {analysis}, we show that the topological Euler insulator evolves from {a non-Abelian topological semimetal phase via the annihilation of Dirac points in pairs in one of the band gaps}. With these nontrivial properties, we establish concretely an unconventional bulk-edge correspondence which is confirmed by directly measuring the edge states via {pump-probe techniques}. Our work thus unveils a nontrivial topological Euler insulator phase with {a unique} meronic {pattern} and paves the way as a platform for {non-Abelian topological} phenomena.</description>

Abstract: The unambiguous identification of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) is one of the most outstanding problems of condensed matter physics. Thermal transport provides a detection tool that is sensitive to these chargeless quasiparticles. We study thermoelectric transport between metallic leads transverse to a Josephson junction. The central double quantum dot hosts conventional or topological Andreev states that depend on the phase difference $\phi$. We show that the presence of MZMs can be identified by a significant amplification of both the electrical and thermal conductance at $\phi \approx \pi$ as well as the Seebeck coefficient at $\phi \approx 0$. In addition, we show that the Wiedemann-Franz law is strongly violated in the presence of MZMs around $\phi \approx \pi$ when compared to the conventional case. We further investigate the robustness of our results against Cooper pair splitting processes.</description>

      <title>Charge and spin current pumping by ultrafast demagnetization dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surprising discovery of ultrafast demagnetization -- where electric field of femtosecond laser pulse couples to electrons of a ferromagnetic (FM) layer causing its magnetization vector {\em to shrink while not rotating}, is also assumed to be accompanied by generation of spin current in the direction orthogonal to electric field. However, understanding of the microscopic origin of such spin current and how efficiently it can be converted into charge current, as the putative source of THz radiation, is lacking despite nearly three decades of intense studies. Here we connect the standard pumping phenomena driven by microwave precession of magnetization vector replacing periodic time-dependence of magnetization precession with nonperiodic time-dependence of demagnetization, as obtained from experiments on ultrafast-light-driven Ni layer. Applying time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's functions, able to evolve such setup with arbitrary time dependence, reveals how demagnetization dynamics pumps both charge and spin currents in directions both parallel and orthogonal to electric field of laser pulse, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling and thereby induced spin-to-charge conversion mechanisms. Although pumped currents follow $dM_z/dt$ in some setups, this becomes obscured when NM layers are disconnected and pumped currents start to reflect from FM boundaries (as is the case of experimental setups). Finally, we use the Jefimenko equations to compute electromagnetic radiation by charge current pumped in disconnected setup during demagnetization, or later during its slow recovery, unraveling that radiated electric field only in the former time interval exhibits features in 0.1--30 THz frequency range probed experimentally or explored for applications of spintronic THz emitters.</description>

Abstract: A fully analytical approach based on the equation of motion technique to investigate the spectral properties and orbital occupations in an interacting double quantum dot in equilibrium is presented. By solving a linear system for the density correlators analytically, an explicit expression for the one body Green's function in terms of local occupations, intra- and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, and the model parameters is derived. In the uncontacted limit, the results coincide with those obtained from the grand canonical ensemble. The analytical results compare favourably with numerical results obtained with the Non-Crossing Approximation and the Hierarchical Equation of Motion methods accurately reproducing peak positions and spectral weight distributions in the Coulomb blockade regime.</description>

Abstract: Floquet engineering of topological phase transitions driven by a high-frequency time-periodic field is a promising approach to realizing new topological phases of matter distinct from static states. Here, we theoretically investigate Floquet engineering topological phase transitions in the quantum spin Hall $\alpha$-$T_{3}$ system driven by an off-resonant circularly polarized light. In addition to the quantum spin (anomalous) Hall insulator phase with multiple helical (chiral) edge states, spin-polarized topological metallic phases are observed, where the bulk topological band gap of one spin sub-band overlaps with the other gapless spin sub-band. Moreover, with a staggered potential, the topological invariants of the system depend on whether the middle band is occupied because of the breaking of particle-hole symmetry. Our work highlights the significance of Floquet engineering in realizing new topological phases in $\alpha$-$T_{3}$ lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I consider a nonlinear response of conventional superconductors contaminated with potential impurities or imperfections to a circular polarized light. I focus on dc contributions to the induced current density which describe the emergence of the static magnetization in a superconductor. This effect is known as inverse Faraday effect. By employing quasiclassical theory of superconductivity I derive an expression for the induced static magnetization as a function of frequency of an external ac field and disorder scattering rate. The scattering of electrons off potential impurities is taken into account within the framework of the self-consistent Born approximation. It is found that the magnitude of the inverse Faraday effect decreases with an increase in disorder scattering rate. I have also discovered that the value of the induced magnetization has a characteristic minimum at a frequency which approximately equals twice the value of the pairing gap in a clean superconductor and shifts to higher values with an increase in disorder scattering rate.</description>

      <title>Quantum Shortcut to Adiabaticity for State Preparation in a Finite-Sized Jaynes-Cummings Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In noisy quantum systems, achieving high-fidelity state preparation using the adiabatic approach faces a dilemma: either extending the evolution time to reduce diabatic transitions or shortening it to mitigate decoherence effects. Here, we present a quantum shortcut to adiabaticity for state preparation in a finite-sized Jaynes-Cummings lattice by applying counter-diabatic (CD) driving along given adiabatic trajectories. Leveraging the symmetry of eigenstates in our system, we convert the CD driving to an implementable Hamiltonian that only involves local qubit-cavity couplings for a two-site lattice with one polariton excitation. Additionally, we derive a partial analytical form of the CD driving for the lattice with two excitations. Our numerical results demonstrate that circuit errors and environmental noise have negligible effects on our scheme under practical parameters. We also show that our scheme can be characterized through the detection of qubit operators. This approach can lead to a promising pathway to high-fidelity state preparation in a significantly reduced timescale when compared to conventional adiabatic methods.</description>

      <title>Transport properties in non-Fermi liquid phases of nodal-point semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this review, we survey the current progress in computing transport properties in semimetals which harbour non-Fermi liquid phases. We first discuss the widely-used Kubo formalism, which can be applied to the effective theory describing the stable non-Fermi liquid phase obtained via a renormalization group procedure and, hence, is applicable for temperatures close to zero (e.g., optical conductivity). For finite-temperature regimes, which apply to the computations of the generalized DC conductivity tensors, we elucidate the memory matrix approach. This approach is based on an effective hydrodynamic description of the system, and is especially suited for tackling transport calculations in strongly-interacting quantum field theories, because it does not rely on the existence of long-lived quasiparticles. As a concrete example, we apply these two approaches to find the response of the so-called Luttinger-Abrikosov-Benelavskii phase of isotropic three-dimensional Luttinger semimetals, which arises under the effects of long-ranged (unscreened) Coulomb interactions, with the chemical potential fine-tuned to cut exactly the nodal point. In particular, we focus on the electric conductivity tensors, thermal and thermoelectric response, Raman response, free energy, entropy density, and shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Interacting Crystalline Topological Insulators in two-dimensions with Time-Reversal Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topology is routinely used to understand the physics of electronic insulators. However, for strongly interacting electronic matter, such as Mott insulators, a comprehensive topological characterization is still lacking. When their ground state only contains short-range entanglement and does not break symmetries spontaneously, they generically realize crystalline fermionic symmetry-protected topological phases (cFSPTs), supporting gapless modes at the boundaries or at the lattice defects. Here, we provide an exhaustive classification of cFSPTs in two dimensions with $\mathrm{U}(1)$ charge-conservation and spinful time-reversal symmetries, namely, those generically present in spin-orbit coupled insulators, for any of the 17 wallpaper groups. It has been shown that the classification of cFSPTs can be understood from appropriate real-space decorations of lower-dimensional subspaces, and we expose how these relate to the Wyckoff positions of the lattice. We find that all nontrivial one-dimensional decorations require electronic interactions. Furthermore, we provide model Hamiltonians for various decorations, and discuss the signatures of cFSPTs. This classification paves the way to further explore topological interacting insulators, providing the backbone information in generic model systems and ultimately in experiments.</description>

Abstract: In pulsed laser deposition, along the traditionally exploited deposition on the front-side of the plasma-plume, a coating forms on the surface of the target as well. For reproducibility, this residue is usually cleaned and discarded. Here we instead investigate the target-side coated materials and employ them as a binder-free supercapacitor electrode. The ballistic-aggregated, target-side nanofoam is compact and features a larger fraction of sp2-carbon, higher nitrogen content with higher graphitic-N and lower oxygen content with fewer COOH groups than that of diffusive-aggregated conventional nanofoams. They are highly hydrogenated graphite-like amorphous carbon and superhydrophilic. The resulting symmetric micro-supercapacitor delivers higher volumetric capacitance of 522 mF/cm3 at 100 mV/s and 104% retention after 10000 charge-discharge cycles over conventional nanofoam (215 mF/cm3 and 85% retention) with an areal capacitance of 134 {\mu}F/cm2 at 120 Hz and ultrafast frequency response. Utilizing the normally discarded target-side material can therefore enable high performing devices while reducing waste, cost and energy input per usable product. leading towards a greater sustainability on nanomaterials synthesis and deposition techniques.</description>
