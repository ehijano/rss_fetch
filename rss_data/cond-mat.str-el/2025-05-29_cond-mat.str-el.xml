      <title>Localized Triplons and Site Stuffing in the Quantum Dimer Magnet BiYbGeO$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic and muon spin-relaxation measurements have recently highlighted BiYbGeO$_5$ as a new example of a rare-earth-based quantum dimer magnet with isolated Yb$^{3+}$ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ dimers. However, direct spectroscopic evidence of the triplet excitations and measurements of the structural disorder are lacking. In this work, polycrystalline BiYbGeO$_5$ was synthesized using conventional high-temperature solid-state methods and investigated via high-resolution neutron powder diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering. Diffraction measurements down to 58 mK reveal no signatures of magnetic order and indicate that nearly 20\% of Yb$^{3+}$ sites are replaced by non-magnetic Bi$^{3+}$, introducing significant structural disorder. Inelastic neutron scattering shows dispersionless triplon excitations, consistent with localized, non-interacting spin dimers. Fits to the triplet excitation spectrum identify an XXZ-type anisotropic exchange with $J_{XX}$ = 0.11(2) meV and $J_Z = 0.15(1)$ meV. These findings establish BiYbGeO$_5$ as a structurally disordered but magnetically well-isolated quantum dimer system, providing a model platform for studying the resilience of entangled spin states to site dilution.</description>

      <title>Quantum multicriticality and emergent symmetry in Dirac systems with two order parameters at three-loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials with interacting Dirac excitations can host quantum multicritical behavior near the phase boundaries of the semimetallic and two-ordered phases. We study such behavior in Gross--Neveu--Yukawa field theories where $N_f$ flavors of Dirac fermions are coupled to two order-parameter fields with $SO(N_A)$ and $SO(N_B)$ symmetry, respectively. To that end, we employ the perturbative renormalization group up to three-loop order in $4-\epsilon$ spacetime dimensions. We distinguish two key scenarios: (i) The two orders are compatible as characterized by anticommuting mass terms, and (ii) the orders are incompatible. For the first case, we explore the stability of a quantum multicritical point with emergent $SO(N_A\!+\!N_B)$ symmetry. We find that the stability is controlled by increasing the number of Dirac fermion flavors. Moreover, we extract the series expansion of the leading critical exponents for the chiral $SO(4)$ and $SO(5)$ models up to third order in $\epsilon$. Notably, we find a tendency towards rapidly growing expansion coefficients at higher orders, rendering an extrapolation to $\epsilon=1$ difficult. For the second scenario, we study a model with $SO(4) \simeq SO(3) \times SO(3)$ symmetry, which was recently suggested to describe criticality of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in Dirac systems. However, it was also argued that a physically admissible renormalization-group fixed point only exists for $N_f$ above a critical number $N_{c}^&gt;$. We determine the corresponding series expansion at three-loop order as $N_{c}^&gt;\approx 16.83-7.14\epsilon-7.12\epsilon^2$. This suggests that the physical choice of $N_f=2$ may be a borderline case, where true criticality and pseudocriticality, as induced by fixed-point annihilation, are extremely challenging to distinguish.</description>

      <title>Kekul\'e order from diffuse nesting near higher-order Van Hove points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Translation symmetry-breaking order is assumed to be suppressed by the lack of Fermi surface nesting near certain higher-order Van Hove singularities (HOVHS). We show the anisotropic band-flattening inherent to such HOVHS, combined with broadening of the Fermi surface due to elevated critical temperatures, results in the Fermi surface becoming approximately nested at a wavevector unrelated to the precise shape of the Fermi surface - leading to a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ Kekul\'e density wave formation. The effect is demonstrated using unbiased renormalization group calculations for a model of the breathing kagome lattice. Our mechanism - termed diffuse nesting - represents an entirely new notion in the study of Fermi surface instabilities.</description>

      <title>Molecular anyons in fractional quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the profound consequences of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect is the notion of fractionally charged anyons. In spite of extensive experimental study, puzzles remain, however. For example, both shot-noise and Aharonov-Bohm interference measurements sometimes report a charge that is a multiple of the elementary charge. We report here high-precision microscopic calculations that reveal the surprising result that the FQH anyons often bind together into stable clusters, which we term molecular anyons. This is counterintuitive, given that the elementary anyons carry the same charge and are therefore expected to repel one another. The number of anyons in a cluster, its binding energy and its size depend sensitively on the parent FQH state and the interaction between electrons (which is experimentally tunable, e.g., by varying the quantum well width). Our calculations further suggest that the charge-$1/4$ non-Abelian anyons of the $5/2$ FQH state may also bind to form charge-$1/2$ Abelian clusters. The existence of molecular anyons not only can provide a natural explanation for the observed charges, but also leads to a host of new predictions for future experiments and invites a re-analysis of many past ones.</description>

      <title>Probing disorder-induced Fisher information matrix and Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound by STM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic local density of states of solids, if normalized correctly, represents the probability density that the electron at a specific position has a particular energy. Because this probability density can vary in space in disordered systems, we propose that one can either treat the energy as a random variable and position as an external parameter to construct a real space Fisher information matrix, or treat the position as a random variable and energy as an external parameter to construct an energy space Fisher information, both quantify the variation of local density of states caused by the disorder. The corresponding Cram\'{e}r-Rao bounds in these two scenarios set a limit on the energy variance and the position variance of electrons, respectively, pointing to new interpretations of STM measurements. Our formalism thus bring the notion of information geometry into STM measurements, as demonstrated explicitly by lattice models of metals and topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Magnetostrictive Phononic Frequency Combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetostriction, mechanical-to-magnetic or magnetic-to-mechanical response, plays a pivotal role in magneto-mechanical systems. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a magneto-mechanical frequency comb via the three-wave mixing mechanism, which solely requires the involvement of the fundamental mode f0 of a magnetostrictive macroresonator. Two types of combs, i.e., the integer-harmonic combs and the half-integer-harmonic combs, are observed in kHz regime with Hz resolution by magnetically pumping the mm-scale resonator with near-resonant f0. The integer-harmonic combs are centered at lfp, while the half-integer-harmonic combs are centered at (2n - 1) fp/2 resulting from the period-doubling bifurcation of fp. The tooth spacing of both types of combs is determined and can be continuously tuned by changing fs from Hz to kHz. Moreover, the half-integer-harmonic combs can be purposely switched with frequency shifting half a tooth spacing via suppressing period-doubling bifurcation. The experimentally observed formation, evolution, and switching of combs can be well understood by introducing the bias magnetical force and modulated linear stiffness into the Duffing equation. Our findings on magnetically manipulated phononic frequency comb could provide a magneto-mechanical platform for potential non-invasive and contactless sensing and even antenna for wireless operation.</description>

      <title>Magnonic chaotic comb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical chaotic comb, possessing the key metrics of intrinsic random amplitude, phase, and frequency modulation of comb lines, emerges as a novel chaotic source in information systems for coherence tomography, parallel ranging, and secure communications. Considering the analogies between magnons and photons, the magnonic analog of optical chaotic combs is expected but not yet explored. Here, we propose a scenario of generating magnonic chaotic combs based on mode coupling mechanism in magnonic systems. Especially, we theoretically demonstrate the realization of magnonic frequency combs through three-wave mixing between ultra-strongly coupled magnons in silicon based synthetic antiferromagnet platform. It is found that the realized magnonic frequency combs can transition to chaos via various routes, i.e., subcritical Hopf bifurcation, torus-doubling bifurcation, and torus breakdown. The robustness of magnonic chaotic combs is verified by characterizing the Poincare map, the bifurcation diagrams, and the largest Lyapunov exponents. Furthermore, the unique characters of chaotic combs, perturbation hypersensitivity and noise immunity, are conceptually validated by identifying latent magnetic signal contaminated by inherent noise. Our findings provide a magnonic paradigm of chaotic dynamics in complex systems for potential applications in CMOS-integrated metrology, sensing, and communication.</description>

      <title>Emergent Quasiparticles \&amp; Field-Tuned RIXS Spectra in a Trimerized Spin-1/2 Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin-flip excitations in the spin-1/2 trimer chain $\rm{Cu_3(P_2O_6OH)_2}$, featuring an antiferromagnetic exchange motif $J_1$-$J_1$-$J_2$ with $J_1 &lt; J_2$. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate that single-spin-flip processes induced by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) generate emergent gapless modes governed by the underlying trimer periodicity alongside distinct high-energy excitations. By combining exact diagonalization and real-space renormalization group (RG) techniques, we attribute these features to fractionalized spinons and composite quasiparticles arising from one- and two-trimer excitations. Furthermore, we show that multi-spin RIXS excitations yield experimentally distinguishable spectral signatures of composite modes absent in single-spin-flip spectra. At the field-induced 1/3 magnetization plateau, single-spin-flip RIXS spectra evolves with the magnetic field to favor spin-polarized composite quasiparticles. This trend culminates in a gapless spectrum of spin-1 excitations beyond the plateau, paving the way for field-tuned Bose condensation of composite modes.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Chern number of Kitaev quantum spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is now well understood that non-Kitaev spin interactions can be added to the Kitaev quantum spin liquid by applying external fields. Recent years have seen intensive discussion on the possible phase transitions that these spin interactions induce. In this paper, we will show through the perturbation theory the possibility of accessing a gapped spin liquid phase with a higher Chern number through, in contrast to the cases studied in literature, a continuous phase transition. Such a transition may be induced by external tuning parameters such as electric field and hydrostatic pressure.</description>

      <title>Importance of pressure-dependent electronic interactions and magnetic order on pressure-driven insulator-metal transitions in MnO and NiO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pressure-driven insulator-metal transition is a crucial topic in condensed matter physics. However, even for the prototypical strongly correlated system, NiO, the critical pressure for transition remains debated. In this work, we evaluated the electronic interactions over a wide range of pressures based on our developed doubly-screened Coulomb correction method and investigated the effects of pressure-dependent electronic interactions and their interplay with magnetic order on the transition. As a validation of the method, we also performed calculations on MnO. The results show that the hybrid functional combined with pressure-dependent screening parameters reasonably describes the insulator-metal transition in MnO. The insulating band gap of antiferromagnetic (AFM) NiO also match well with experiments in both trend and value, which is better than the method using fixed parameters. Further calculations considering magnetic order indicate that as the electronic interactions weaken under pressure, the AFM state of NiO will no longer be stable, a phenomenon that was not observed in previous works. In addition, the results show that, compared with DFT+$U$ within the on-site Coulomb correction framework, the hybrid functional provides a more accurate description of the properties of MnO and NiO at high pressures, highlighting the key role of non-local effects. Our work provides a possible explanation for the long-standing discrepancies in NiO and offers guidance for the development of first-principles methods for correlated electron systems under pressure.</description>

      <title>Dominant Kitaev interaction and field-induced quantum phase transitions in triangular-lattice KCeSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing Kitaev interactions on triangular lattices offers a compelling platform for exploring quantum-spin-liquid physics beyond the conventional honeycomb lattice framework. Here, we investigate the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet KCeSe2, where multiple probes reveal strong magnetic anisotropy suggesting significant Kitaev physics. Through detailed and combined analysis of magnetization, neutron scattering, and thermodynamic experiments, we identify dominant ferromagnetic Kitaev ($K = -1.82$ K) and antiferromagnetic Heisenberg ($J = 1.34$ K) interactions that stabilize a stripe-$yz$ ordered ground state via an order-by-disorder mechanism. Magnetic fields applied along the Kitaev bond direction induce two phase transitions at 1.67 T and 3.8 T, consistent with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations predictions of a progression from stripe-$yz$ to stripe-canted and spin-polarized phases. Near the 1.67 T quantum critical point, enhanced quantum fluctuations suggest conditions favorable for exotic excitations. These results establish KCeSe2 as a platform for exploring Kitaev physics on triangular lattices.</description>

      <title>Dyn-HTE: High-temperature expansion of the dynamic Matsubara spin correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-temperature series expansion for quantum spin models is a well-established tool to compute thermodynamic quantities and equal-time spin correlations, in particular for frustrated interactions. We extend the scope of this expansion to the dynamic Matsubara spin-spin correlator and develop a fully analytic algorithm to compute its expansion coefficients. We focus on Heisenberg models with a single coupling constant J and spin lengths S=1/2,1. The expansion coefficients up to 12th order in J/T are precomputed on all possible ~10^6 graphs embeddable in arbitrary lattices and are provided under https://github.com/bsbierski/Dyn-HTE. This enables calculation of static momentum-resolved susceptibilities for arbitrary site-pairs or wavevectors. We test our results for the S=1/2 Heisenberg chain and on the triangular lattice model. Moreover, the analytic frequency dependence in the expansion allows for stable analytic continuation to the real-frequency dynamic structure factor. This important application is discussed in a companion letter.</description>

      <title>Flow to Nishimori universality in weakly monitored quantum circuits with qubit loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.</description>

      <title>Symmetry tuning topological states of an axion insulator with noncollinear magnetic order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological properties of quantum materials are intimately related to symmetry. Here, we tune the magnetic order of the axion insulator candidate EuIn$_2$As$_2$ from its broken-helix ground state to the field-polarized phase by applying an in-plane magnetic field. Using results from neutron diffraction and magnetization measurements with ab inito theory and symmetry analysis, we determine how the field tunes the magnetic symmetry within individual magnetic domains and examine the resulting changes to the topological surface states and hinge states existing on edges shared by certain surfaces hosting gapped Dirac states. We predict field-tunable complex and domain-specific hinge-state patterns, with some crystal surfaces undergoing a field-induced topological phase transition. We further find that domain walls have pinned hinge states when intersecting certain crystal surfaces, providing another channel for tuning the chiral-charge-transport pathways.</description>

      <title>V. J. Emery and P. W. Anderson's views and related issues regarding the basics of cuprates: a re-look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1991, V. J. Emery in his important review article entitled "Some aspects of the theory of high temperature superconductors"\cite{emery1} argued against the Zhang-Rice reduction of three-band to an effective one-band model. In his words "...therefore it seems that the simple $t-J$ model does not account for the properties of high temperature superconductors". Over approximately 35 years after the initial debates\cite{debates} much has happened in the field pertaining to this topic. Even though it is one of the most discussed issue, a comprehensive account and the required resolution are lacking. Connected to the debate over one-band versus three-band models is another discussion: the one-component versus two-component model for cuprates. The two-component model is most strongly advocated by Barzykin and Pines\cite{bp}. In this article the author attempts a perspective and a re-look on some of these issues. After an analysis of a large body of literature, author finds that V. J. Emery's criticism of the Zhang-Rice reduction was correct. Many central experimental features of cuprates cannot be rationalized within the one-band model, and Johnston-Nakano scaling is one such example. Other examples are also discussed. Author introduces a simple-minded toy model to illustrate the core issues involved.</description>

      <title>Condensates, crystals, and renormalons in the Gross-Neveu model at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $O(2N)$ symmetric Gross-Neveu model at finite density in the presence of a $U(1)$ chemical potential $h$ for a generic number $a \leq N-2$ of fermion fields. By combining perturbative QFT, semiclassical large $N$, and Bethe ansatz techniques, we show that at finite $N$ two new dynamically generated scales $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ appear in the theory, governing the mass gap of neutral and charged fermions, respectively. Above a certain threshold value for $h$, $a$-fermion bound states condense and form an inhomogeneous configuration, which at infinite $N$ is a crystal spontaneously breaking translations. At large $h$, this crystal has mean $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and spatial oscillations of amplitude $2\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$. The two scales also control the nonperturbative corrections to the free energy, resolving a puzzle concerning fractional-power renormalons and predicting new ones.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) for off-diagonal matrix elements in integrable spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators in integrable spin chains, focusing on the isotropic spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg chain ($XXX$ chain). We employ state-of-the-art Algebraic Bethe Ansatz results, which allow us to efficiently compute matrix elements of operators with support up to two sites between generic energy eigenstates. We consider both matrix elements between eigenstates that are in the same thermodynamic macrostate, as well as eigenstates that belong to different macrostates. In the former case, focusing on thermal states we numerically show that matrix elements are compatible with the exponential decay as $\exp(-L |{M}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}_{ij}|)$. The probability distribution functions of ${M}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}$ depend on the observable and on the macrostate, and are well described by Gumbel distributions. On the other hand, matrix elements between eigenstates in different macrostates decay faster as $\exp(-|{M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}|L^2)$, with ${M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle \mathcal{O}}$, again, compatible with a Gumbel distribution.</description>

      <title>Group Convolutional Neural Network Ground State of the Quantum Dimer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We estimate the ground state of the square lattice Quantum Dimer Model in a $\rm{p4m}$-symmetric Group Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) representation and show that results in agreement with exact diagonalization (ED) and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) can be obtained with a $\mathcal{L}=2$ layer network. In systems of linear size $L=8$ with Hilbert space dimension $3.1\times 10^8$, GCNN shows fidelity as high as $0.99999$ with ED. For $12\leq L\leq 32$, we find excellent agreement with QMC estimates of energy, order parameters and correlation functions. The network is optimized by minimizing the energy estimated from a Metropolis algorithm assisted by a directed loop sampler. We analyze the quantum geometric tensor at the minima for $\mathcal{L}=1,2$ and $3$ and show that the empirical quantum dimension saturates with increasing network complexity due to Metropolis sampling constraints.</description>

      <title>Two-particle self-consistent approach for broken symmetry phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking of interacting fermion systems constitutes a major challenge for many-body theory due to the proliferation of new independent scattering channels once absent or degenerate in the symmetric phase. One example is given by the ferro/antiferromagnetic broken symmetry phase (BSP) of the Hubbard model, where vertices in the spin-transverse and spin-longitudinal channels become independent with a consequent increase in the computational power for their calculation. We generalise the non-perturbative Two-Particle- Self-Consistent method (TPSC) to address broken SU(2) magnetic phases in the Hubbard model, offering an efficient approach that incorporates strong correlations. We show that in the BSP, the sum-rule enforcement of susceptibilities must be accompanied by a modified gap equation resulting in a renormalisation of the order parameter, vertex corrections and the preservation of the gap-less feature of the Goldstone modes. We then apply the theory to the antiferromagnetic phase of the Hubbard model in the cubic lattice at half-filling. We compare our results of double occupancies and staggered magnetisation to the ones obtained using Diagrammatic Monte Carlo showing excellent quantitative agreement. We demonstrate how vertex corrections play a central role in lowering the Higgs resonance with respect to the quasi-particle excitation gap in the spin-longitudinal susceptibility, yielding a well visible Higgs-mode.</description>

      <title>Dirac points and topological phases in correlated altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a two-dimensional Hubbard model adapted to host altermagnetic states. Utilizing Hartree-Fock (HF) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), we uncover that the magnetic solutions of this model feature Dirac points in their spectrum. HF predicts a gap opening at a critical interaction strength, a result corroborated by DMFT calculations at zero temperature. However, at finite temperature and high interaction strengths, Dirac points re-emerge at high energies in the spectral function, even if they are absent in the non-interacting and HF-predicted band structures. Analytical arguments reveal that this phenomenon arises near Mott insulating solutions from the frequency dependence of the self-energy, a behavior not captured by static mean-field theory. We identify distinctive dynamical signatures of correlated altermagnetic states in the spin-resolved optical conductivity, notably a double-peak structure likely linked to high-energy Dirac cone-like bands. Moreover, the spin-resolved response exhibits spin-selective activation at different photon energies, pointing to potential applications in spin-dependent optical control. We also propose perturbations to the model that can induce a topological gap in the spectrum, leading to a transition from topologically trivial to non-trivial states by varying doping, interaction strength, and temperature.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the discommensuration between the Fermi surfaces of a conduction sea and an underlying spin liquid provides a natural mechanism for the spontaneous formation of pair density waves. Using a recent formulation of the Kondo lattice model which incorporates a Yao Lee spin liquid proposed by the authors, we demonstrate that doping away from half-filling induces finite-momentum electron-Majorana pair condensation, resulting in amplitude-modulated PDWs. Our approach provides a precise, analytically tractable pathway for understanding the spontaneous formation of PDWs in higher dimensions and offers a natural mechanism for PDW formation in the absence of a Zeeman field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many microscopic models with the interaction between the next-nearest neighbours as a key parameter for cuprate physics have inspired us to study the diagonal superexchange interaction in a CuO$_2$ layer. Our investigation shows that models with extended hopping provide a correct representation of magnetic interactions only in a hypothetical square CuO$_2$ layer, where the diagonal superexchange interaction with the next-nearest neighbors always has the AFM nature. The conclusions are based on the symmetry prohibition on FM contribution to the diagonal superexchange between the next-nearest neighbors for a simple square CuO$_2$ layer rather than for a real CuO$_2$ layer, where diagonal AFM superexchange may be overestimated. We also discuss the reasons for magnetic frustration effects and high sensitivity of spin nanoinhomogeneity to square symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>The Saga of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$: Parameters, Models, and Phase Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: RuCl$_3$ was likely the first ever deliberately synthesized ruthenium compound, following the discovery of the $_{44}$Ru element in 1844. For a long time it was known as an oxidation catalyst, with its physical properties being discrepant and confusing, until a decade ago when its allotropic form $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ rose to exceptional prominence. This "re-discovery" of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has not only reshaped the hunt for a material manifestation of the Kitaev spin liquid, but it has opened the floodgates of theoretical and experimental research in the many unusual phases and excitations that the anisotropic-exchange magnets as a class of compounds have to offer. Given its importance for the field of Kitaev materials, it is astonishing that the low-energy spin model that describes this compound and its possible proximity to the much-desired spin-liquid state is still a subject of significant debate ten years later. In the present study, we argue that the existing key phenomenological observations put strong natural constraints on the effective microscopic spin model of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and specifically on its spin-orbit-induced anisotropic-exchange parameters that are responsible for the non-trivial physical properties of this material. These constraints allow one to focus on the relevant region of the multi-dimensional phase diagram of the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ model, suggest an intuitive description of it via a different parametrization of the exchange matrix, offer a unifying view on the earlier assessments of its parameters, and bring closer together several approaches to the derivation of anisotropic-exchange models. We explore extended phase diagrams relevant to the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ parameter space using quasi-classical, Luttinger-Tisza, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix renormalization group methods, demonstrating a remarkably c...

Abstract: This work focuses on the layered perovskite Sr$_2$NbO$_4$, a 4$d$ analogue of Sr$_2$VO$_4$, which remains an unsolved puzzle with a possible intriguing hidden magnetic order. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate the robust thermodynamic stability and exfoliability of Sr$_2$NbO$_4$, suggesting potential applications as a 2D material. Imperfect Fermi surface nesting indicates instabilities that may drive symmetry lowering, charge/orbital density waves, or superconductivity. Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations reveal moderate mass renormalization $(m^*/m\sim1.3)$ and an itinerant character of magnetism with strong longitudinal spin fluctuations. The exchange interaction is dominated by in-plane ferromagnetic coupling with much weaker interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Eigenstate Thermalization for Non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) has been highly influential in explaining thermodynamic behavior of closed quantum systems. As of yet, it is unclear whether and how the ETH applies to non-Hermitian systems. Here, we introduce a framework that extends the ETH to non-Hermitian systems, within which expectation values of local operators reproduce statistical and scaling predictions known from Hermitian ETH. We illustrate the validity of the framework on non-Hermitian random-matrix and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models. Further, we show numerically how the static ETH predictions become imprinted onto the dynamics of local observables. Finally, we present a prescription for observing both ETH-obeying and ETH-violating regimes in an optical-lattice experiment that implements a disordered interacting Hatano-Nelson model. Our results generalize the celebrated ETH to the non-Hermitian setting, and they show how it affects the system dynamics, and how the salient signatures can be observed in present-day cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the Fuzzy Sphere regulator to study the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. The model is defined by deforming the Ising model on the Fuzzy Sphere via a purely imaginary longitudinal magnetic field. This model undergoes a quantum phase transition, whose critical point we determine and identify with the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. We show how to tune the model and find that the lowest-lying states of the Hamiltonian align well with the expected CFT spectrum. We discuss the Fuzzy Sphere estimates for the scaling dimension $\Delta_\phi$ of the lowest primary operator. Finally, we interpret small deviations from the CFT expectations in terms of the leading irrelevant operators of the Lee-Yang CFT. We show that the Fuzzy Sphere calculations are compatible with the best five-loop $\epsilon$-expansion estimates.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous probes of pseudogap and disorder by hard x-ray photoemission applied for a candidate thermoelectric Al-Pd-Ru quasicrystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bulk electronic structure of Al-Pd-Ru quasicrystal (QC) have been investigated by hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES). We have found an intrinsic pseudogap structure in which the spectral weight in the vicinity of the Fermi level (E_F) is remarkably suppressed at any photon energy. The valence-band HAXPES spectra and the asymmetry of the core-level peaks indicate a contribution of the Al sites to the electronic structure in the vicinity of E_F with less contributions from the Pd and Ru sites. The disorder effects are found in the core-level lineshapes of the Al-Pd-Ru QC, of which the widths are much broader than those of the other reference crystalline solids with less disorder.</description>
