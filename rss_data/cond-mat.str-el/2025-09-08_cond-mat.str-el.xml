      <title>Symmetric entanglers for non-invertible SPT phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested that non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases (SPT), due to the lack of a stacking structure, do not have symmetric entanglers (globally symmetric finite-depth quantum circuits) connecting them. Using topological holography, we argue that a symmetric entangler should in fact exist for $1+1$d systems whenever the non-invertible symmetry has SPT phases connected by fixed-charge dualities (FCD). Moreover, we construct an explicit example of a symmetric entangler for the two SPT phases with $\mathrm{Rep}(A_4)$-symmetry, as a matrix product unitary (MPU).</description>

      <title>Strongly Entangled Kondo and Kagome Lattices and the Emergent Magnetic Ground State in Heavy-Fermion Kagome Metal YbV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we present compelling spectroscopic evidence demonstrating the intertwining and mutual interaction between the Kondo and kagome sublattices in heavy-fermion intermetallic compound YbV$_6$Sn$_6$. We reveal the Yb 4$f$-derived states near the Fermi level, along with the presence of bulk kagome bands and topological surface states. We unveil strong interactions between the 4$f$ and itinerant electrons, where the kagome bands hosting the Dirac fermions and van Hove singularities predominate. Such findings are well described using a $c$-$f$ hybridization model. On the other hand, our systematic characterization of magnetic properties demonstrates an unusually enhanced antiferromagnetic ordering, where the kagome-derived van Hove singularities near $E_F$ play a vital role in determining the unconventional nature of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction and Kondo coupling. These unique kagome-state-mediated exchange interactions have never been reported before and could lead to a novel phase diagram and various quantum critical behaviors in YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ and its siblings. Our results not only expand the family of exotic quantum phases entangled with kagome structure to the strongly correlated regime, but also establish YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ as an unprecedented platform to explore unconventional many-body physics beyond the standard Kondo picture.</description>

      <title>$^{51}$V NMR evidence for interlayer-modulated charge order and a first-order low-temperature transition in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge order in the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits a complex three-dimensional organization and intermediate-temperature anomalies whose bulk character has remained unsettled. We use orientation-dependent $^{51}$V NMR as a site-selective probe to determine the stacking of the charge density wave (CDW) state and its thermal evolution. Below $T_{\mathrm{CDW}}\!\approx\!94$~K, the field-linear splitting of the $^{51}$V central transition together with the anisotropy of the Knight-shift tensor identify an interlayer-modulated $3\mathbf{q}$ CDW whose local environments are consistent with a four-layer $2\times2\times4$ stacking with mixed trihexagonal/Star-of-David distortions, in agreement with synchrotron x-ray determinations. For comparison, RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ serves as a reference exhibiting a uniform trihexagonal $2\times2\times2$ stacking, allowing us to isolate features unique to the $2\times2\times4$ state in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. With $\mathbf{H}_0\!\parallel\!c$, the $^{51}$V quadrupolar satellites through the intermediate temperature scale near $T_{\mathrm{CO}}\!\approx\!65$ K reorganize into two well-resolved electric-field-gradient manifolds that coexist over a finite interval; their relative spectral weights interchange on cooling while the total integrated satellite intensity remains conserved and $\nu_Q$ within each manifold is nearly temperature independent. The coexistence without critical broadening, together with conserved intensity, provides bulk evidence consistent with a first-order charge-order transition near $T_{\mathrm{CO}}$. Our measurements do not resolve whether this lower-temperature transition corresponds to a distinct in-plane order or a reorganization of the $3\mathbf{q}$ state; rather, they delimit this window and provide bulk, site-resolved constraints that connect prior reported anomalies to a thermodynamic first-order transition.</description>

      <title>Dynamical crossover between stretched- and compressed-exponential relaxation in a photoexcited crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous relaxation is one of the hallmarks of disordered systems. Following perturbation by an external source, many glassy, jammed and amorphous systems relax as a stretched or compressed exponential as a function of time. However, despite their ubiquity, the origins of and the connection between these phenomenological relaxation functions remains to be understood. Here, we observe a tunable crossover from stretched- to compressed-exponential relaxation by photoexciting single crystal Ca3Ru2O7 across a structural phase transition. We present a simple lattice model that shows how spatial inhomogeneity and local, strain-mediated interactions cooperate to produce the dynamical crossover. Our work reveals anomalous relaxation dynamics in an idealized single crystal material and establishes photoexcited solids as promising platforms for probing the mechanisms underlying anomalous relaxation.</description>

      <title>Low-frequency interlayer phonon dynamics and photoinduced terahertz absorption in black phosphorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong interlayer coupling in black phosphorus (BP), arising from wavefunction overlap between layers, is critical for understanding its electronic and optical properties. Here, we utilize terahertz (THz) spectroscopy to study phonon dynamics in BP. We identify two peaks at 6 and 8.5 meV in steady-state THz spectra, which are attributed to low-frequency interlayer phonon modes. Both modes exhibit anharmonic phonon coupling behavior below 150 K, manifesting as temperature-dependent red-shifts. Using time-resolved THz spectroscopy, we observe significantly increased THz absorption under photoexcitation, arising from the transient enhancements of the extended Drude component and the oscillator strengths of interlayer phonons in non-equilibrium. These findings highlight the critical role of interlayer phonon dynamics in understanding many-body physics in BP.</description>

      <title>Coexisting Kagome and Heavy Fermion Flat Bands in YbCr$_6$Ge$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands, emergent in strongly correlated electron systems, stand at the frontier of condensed matter physics, providing fertile ground for unconventional quantum phases. Recent observations of dispersionless bands at the Fermi level in kagome lattice open the possibility of unifying the disjoint paradigms of topology and correlation-driven heavy fermion liquids. Here, we report the unprecedented coexistence of these mechanisms in the layered kagome metal YbCr6Ge6. At high temperatures, an intrinsic kagome flat band-arising from the frustrated hopping on the kagome lattice-dominates the Fermi level. Upon cooling, localized Yb 4f-states hybridize with the topological kagome flat bands, transforming this state into the Kondo resonance states that are nearly dispersionless across the entire Brillouin zone. Crystalline symmetry forbids hybridization along specific high-symmetry lines, which stabilizes Dirac crossings of heavy-fermion character. Topological analysis of the resulting gaps reveals both trivial and nontrivial Z2 invariants, establishing the emergence of a Dirac-Kondo semimetal phase. Taken together, these results identify YbCr6Ge6 as a prototype of a topological heavy-fermion system and a platform where geometric frustration, strong correlations, and topology converge, with broad implications for correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Note on searching for critical lattice models as entropy critical points from strange correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04947v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An entropy function is proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 251602] as a way to detect criticality even when the system size is small. In this note we apply this strategy in the search for criticality of lattice transfer matrices constructed based on the topological holographic principle. We find that the combination of strategy is indeed a cost-effective and efficient way of identifying critical boundary conditions, estimating central charges and moreover, plotting entire phase diagrams in a multi-dimensional phase space.</description>

      <title>Efficient iPEPS Simulation on the Honeycomb Lattice via QR-based CTMRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a QR-based corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) framework for contracting infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) on honeycomb lattices. Our method explicitly uses the lattice's native C3v symmetry at each site, generalizing QR-based acceleration (previously limited to square lattices) to enable efficient and stable contractions. This approach achieves order-of-magnitude speedups over conventional singular value decomposition (SVD)-based CTMRG while maintaining high numerical precision. Comprehensive benchmark calculations for the spin-1/2 Heisenberg and Kitaev models demonstrate higher computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. We further employ our method to study the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, where we provide numerical evidence for the universal 1/r^4 decay of the dimer-dimer correlation function within the quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. Our work establishes a framework for extending QR-based CTMRG to other lattice geometries, opening new avenues for studying exotic quantum phases with tensor networks.</description>

      <title>Correlation-driven 3d Heavy Fermion behavior in LiV2O4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiV2O4 is a spinel-structured compound that stands out as the first known 3d-electron system exhibiting typical heavy fermion behavior. A central question is how such strong mass renormalization emerges in the absence of f-electrons. In this work, we investigate the three-dimensional electronic structure of LiV2O4 thin films using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We identify that an electron-like flat band is derived from a1g orbitals, along with a highly dispersive e'g band strongly coupled with phonons. The overall agreement with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations highlights the essential role of inter-orbital Hund's coupling in reducing the a1g bandwidth to 25 meV, approaching a Mott state. Notably, we find that heavy-fermion behavior arises from additional renormalization at the a1g band near the Fermi level, likely driven by many-body interactions at energy scales down to a few meV and potentially linked to geometric frustration inherent to the spinel lattice. These results provide crucial insights into the origin of the heavy fermion behavior in 3d-electron systems.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics in natural multiferroic pyroxene NaFeSi$_2$O$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin dynamics in the natural mineral aegirine, NaFeSi$_2$O$_6$, a member of the pyroxene family, was studied by elastic and inelastic neutron scattering. Magnetization and specific heat measurements as well as single-crystal neutron diffraction maps, taken in the temperature range 2 - 20 K, confirm two successive magnetic transitions at 8.8 and 5.8 K, consistent with previous studies. The observed spin-wave excitations emerge from the incommensurate magnetic Bragg peaks corresponding to the propagation vector $k_{\rm ICM} = (0, 0.77, 0)$, and extend up to energies of about 1.5 meV. In the low-temperature helical phase, the spin dynamics of the Fe$^{3+}$ ions is well described by a simple linear spin-wave model. The observed excitations can be modeled using a spin Hamiltonian that includes three primary exchange interactions - intrachain coupling $J=0.142(2)$ meV, interchain couplings $J_1=0.083(1)$ meV and $J_2=0.186(1)$ meV - and an easy-plane anisotropy $D=0.020(6)$ meV. Our results show that no single exchange interaction dominates the spin dynamics. The similar strengths of the intrachain and interchain couplings point to the fact that the magnetic interactions in aegirine are three-dimensional rather than confined along one direction. As a result, the system cannot be considered quasi-one-dimensional, as previously suggested, and calls for further investigations.</description>

      <title>Dirac quantum criticality in twisted double bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of moir\'e double bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides with ABBA stacking as a function of twist angle and applied pressure. At hole filling $\nu = 2$ per moir\'e unit cell, the noninteracting system hosts a Dirac semimetal with graphene-like low-energy bands in the moir\'e Brillouin zone. At small twist angles, the Fermi velocity is reduced and interactions dominate the low-temperature behavior. A strong-coupling analysis identifies insulating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground-state candidates, characterized by spin-density modulations set by the moir\'e scale. Using a realistic continuum model with long-range Coulomb interactions, we perform self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations to study the competition between these states. Varying the twist angle or pressure drives a transition from a Dirac semimetal to an antiferromagnetic insulator, which breaks SU(2) spin rotation and two-fold lattice rotation symmetries. This semimetal-to-insulator transition is continuous and belongs to the (2+1)D relativistic Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality class with $N = 2$ four-component Dirac fermions. Finite heterostrain, relevant in realistic samples, induces a crossover from Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality at intermediate temperatures to conventional (2+1)D Heisenberg criticality at the lowest temperatures. Further decreasing the twist angle can cause a level crossing from the antiferromagnetic insulator into a ferromagnetic insulator with spin-split bands. Our results provide a comprehensive theoretical framework that complements and elucidates recent experiments in twisted double bilayer WSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Superconducting pairing symmetries in charge-ordered kagom\'e metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting state in a kagom\'e lattice, with intertwined charge order and time-reversal symmetry-breaking loop current, using self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism to find the emergent pairing symmetries. Using local and nearest-neighbor attractive interactions, treated within Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation, we obtain all possible pairing symmetries in position space. Our findings indicate that the uniform $s$-wave symmetry, arising in the absence of the charge order and the loop current, modifies to a pair density wave of $s$-wave symmetry of 2$\times$2 lattice periodicity in the presence of the charge order, and a chiral pair density wave of $d_{x^2-y^2}\!+\!id_{xy}$-wave symmetry of the same 2$\times$2 periodicity in the presence of the charge order and loop current order, in both onsite and nearest-neighbor channels. In the absence of inversion symmetry, such as in the thin-film geometry, Rashba spin-orbit coupling appears, inducing an additional nearest-neighbor triplet $p_x\pm ip_y$-wave pairing. The results are relevant to superconductivity found in $A$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs), coexisting with a charge order that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We discuss fingerprints of these different pairing symmetries in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.</description>

Abstract: Groundstates of 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) satisfy a local entropic condition called the vector fixed point equation. This condition is surprisingly well satisfied by groundstates of quantum critical lattice models even at small system sizes. We perform a search in the space of states of very small systems (four qubits and four qutrits) and examine the states that satisfy this condition. By reconstructing a local Hamiltonian from each state, we are able to identify many of these solutions with known CFTs; others are gapped fixed points, or involve large relevant perturbations, and others are CFTs we have not yet identified. These ideas are also useful for identifying continuous quantum phase transitions in a given family of Hamiltonians, and for identifying the nature of the critical theory in small systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Dynamics of Spin-Orbit Entangled Excitons Coupled to Magnetic Ordering in van der Waals Antiferromagnet NiPS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit entangled excitons (SOEE) in two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnets provide a direct access to explore unconventional many body interactions in correlated electron systems. In this work, we carry out a detailed investigation using non-degenerate isotropic and anisotropic pump-probe reflection spectroscopy to probe the ultrafast dynamics of SOEE and their coupling to spin fluctuations in NiPS3. Transient reflectivity data reveals acoustic phonon oscillations at ~ 27 GHz, along with two distinct relaxation timescales: fast (1-9 ps) and slower components (1-4 ns) associated with SOEE coherence and spin reordering, respectively. Both timescales exhibit pronouns temperature dependence near the exciton dissociation (TED = 120 K) and Neel TN = 155 K) temperatures. The SOEE coherence shortens from ~ 8-9 ps at T &lt; TED to ~ 3 ps at T &gt; TED with a finite tail persisting beyond TN. The spin reordering time grows near 120 K, and shows critical slowing down around TN. Pump fluence studies further corroborate their spin origin. Our findings uncover the direct interplay between the excitonic and spin degrees of freedom across ultrafast and longer timescales, offering new opportunities to probe and engineer emergent many-body interactions in 2D antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Supersolidity induced flux magnetism with magnetic atoms in an anti-magic wavelength optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersolidity and magnetism are fundamental phenomena characterizing strongly correlated states of matter. Here, we unveil a mechanism that establishes a direct connection between these quantum regimes and can be experimentally accessed in ultracold atomic systems. Specifically, we exploit the distinctive properties of ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one dimensional anti-magic wavelength optical lattice. This allows us to design a realistic implementation of a triangular Bose-Hubbard ladder featuring two essential ingredients: strong long-range interactions and tunable gauge fields. Thanks to these unconventional properties, our numerical analysis highlights that, among the others, a robust lattice supersolid regime with finite fluxes in each triangular plaquette occurs. Remarkably, we show that the specific density distribution of the supersolid phase leads to the magnetic ordering of fluxes, which can form ferrimagnetic and ferromagnetic structures. Our results thus discover a fascinating quantum mechanical effect that bridges supersolidity and magnetism.</description>

      <title>Reply to the Comment by Tikhonov and Khrapai on "Long-range crossed Andreev reflection in a topological insulator nanowire proximitized by a superconductor"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The comment (arXiv:2505.23490) fails to identify any scientific errors and its central arguments actually support the main conclusions of our publication [Nat. Phys. 21, 708 (2025)]. Firstly, the whole argument of the comment to try to explain our data explicitly relies on the existence of a large crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) effect. The presence of a sizable CAR transmission probability over a surprisingly long distance is the first conclusion of our publication. Secondly, the comment discusses the complex interplay of CAR and elastic co-tunneling, especially in the presence of local effects. This complex interplay is precisely the second conclusion of our publication. In essence, the comment amounts to merely pointing out that there is a broader sense in the notion of "dominant CAR" when nonlinear effects become relevant.</description>

      <title>Orbital Ordering in the Charge Density Wave Phases of BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use resonant X-ray scattering at the nickel L$_{2,3}$ edges to investigate the interplay between orbital degrees of freedom and charge density waves (CDW) in the superconductor BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$. Both the incommensurate and commensurate CDWs in this system exhibit strong resonant enhancement with distinct energy and polarization dependencies, indicative of orbital ordering. Azimuthal-angle-dependent measurements reveal a lowering of the local Ni site symmetry, consistent with monoclinic or lower point group symmetry. The scattering signatures of both CDWs are dominated by contributions from Ni d$_{xz,yz}$ orbitals, with similar orbital character despite their distinct wave vectors. These findings point to a shared orbital-driven formation mechanism and provide new insight into the symmetry breaking and orbital/nematic fluctuations in the high-temperature regime of the superconductor BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$.</description>

Abstract: We define a measurable spin for the edge of a lowest Landau level and incompressible fractional quantum Hall state in the presence of an Abelian or non-Abelian bulk quasiparticle. We show that this quantity takes a fractional value inherited from the fractional spin of the bulk quasiparticle. We present a geometric picture that does not rely on global symmetries of the wavefunction but is able to treat quasiparticles and edges with different shapes. We study finite-size many-body wavefunctions on the cylinder with circular quasiparticles and straight edges. Our results are supported by matrix-product-state calculations for the Laughlin and the k=3 Read-Rezayi states.</description>

      <title>Twist-angle evolution of the intervalley-coherent antiferromagnet in twisted WSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental reports of correlated physics in twisted homobilayer WSe$_2$ have spurred interest in the interplay of electronic interactions and topology in this system. Here, we explore its phase diagram using the Hartree-Fock approximation within a three-orbital Wannier model of the bilayer. Our analysis reveals a dominant intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic instability, whose stability in the space of twist angle, interaction strength, out-of-plane displacement field, and hole density is primarily set by nesting and commensurability. At large angles or low interaction-to-bandwidth ratios, the instability arises at hole densities above half filling near a van-Hove line where the strong Fermi surface nesting occurs due to the flatness of the band in a region enclosing the van-Hove and $\kappa$ points. Increasing interaction strength or decreasing the twist angle gradually shifts the ordered phase toward half filling, where the strongest antiferromagnetic order gets pinned due to commensurability effects that enable a full gap opening. The antiferromagnetic order parameter strongly couples to the layer polarization, which makes its transition to the normal state sharp in the strong-coupling limit and carries implications for collective modes. Our Hartree-Fock phase diagram reproduces key aspects of recent experiments and the reconstructed Fermi surfaces and DOS in the antiferromagnetic phase account for subtle transport signatures observed in these studies.</description>

      <title>Charge gap and charge redistribution among copper and oxygen orbitals in the normal state of the Emery model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unraveling the behavior of the electrons in the copper-oxygen planes of cuprate superconductors remains a challenge. Here we examine the electronic charge redistribution among planar copper and oxygen orbitals and the charge gap using the Emery model in the normal state, solved with cellular dynamical mean-field theory at finite temperature. We quantify the charge redistribution as a function of the onsite Coulomb repulsion on the copper orbitals, the bare copper-oxygen energy difference, and the hole or electron doping. We find that the position relative to the metal to insulator boundary of the Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen diagram determines the charge redistribution among copper and oxygen orbitals. For a fixed bare Cu-O energy difference, an increase in the Cu electron repulsion leads to a transfer of the electronic charge from Cu to O orbitals. For a fixed charge gap size of the undoped state, as the system evolves from a charge-transfer to a Mott-Hubbard regime, the electronic charge is transferred from Cu to O orbitals. Our findings posit the Coulomb repulsion and the bare charge-transfer energy as key drivers of the microscopic process of charge redistribution in the CuO$_2$ plane. They quantify the anticorrelation between the charge gap size and oxygen hole content. They show that for fixed band-structure parameters, the charge gap and the charge redistribution between Cu and O orbitals provide a way to understand observed trends in cuprates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general necessary condition for a spin chain with SO(3) spin-rotation symmetry to be gapped. Specifically, we prove that the ground state(s) of an SO(3)-symmetric gapped spin chain must be spin singlet(s), and the expectation value of a twisting operator asymptotically approaches unity in the thermodynamic limit, where finite-size corrections are inversely proportional to the system size. This theorem provides (i) supporting evidence for various conjectured gapped phases, and (ii) a sufficient criterion for identifying gapless spin chains. We verify our theorem by numerical simulations for a variety of spin models and show that it offers a novel efficient way to identify gapless phases in spin chains with spin-rotation symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We study thermodynamic consequences of the hidden Bose-Einstein singularities, which have been predicted to cause a pseudogap phase, based on quantum field theory of ordered phases. Starting from the Luttinger-Ward functional for the grand thermodynamic potential, we derive expressions of the Helmholtz free energy, internal energy, entropy, and heat capacity in a form suitable for numerical studies. They are applied to the weakly attractive Hubbard model in three dimensions to calculate the thermodynamic potentials numerically and continuously for the normal, pseudogap, and superconducting phases on the same footing. It is shown that the entry into the pseudogap phase is detectable as singularities of thermodynamic potentials, especially a discontinuity in the heat capacity.</description>

Abstract: Following recent intensive studies on altermagnets(ALM) characterized by non-relativistic even-parity spin splitting, realizing unconventional odd-parity magnetism has also attracted increasing interest. Here, using symmetry arguments based on spin-group analyses, we elucidate the sufficient condition, the breaking nonmagnetic time reversal symmetry(TRS), for the presence of odd-parity spin splitting in the collinear antiferromagnetic(AFM) systems, which is also proved as a standard odd-parity ALM. Then, we utilize the well-known Haldane-Hubbard model to identify the odd-parity spin splitting in the collinear AFM ground state where the nonmagnetic TRS is broken by sublattice currents coming from the Haldane hopping term. A comprehensive phase diagram involving the Haldane hopping strength and on-site coulomb repulsion is established to elucidate correlation-driven electronic phases. Moreover, we calculate the optical conductivity to illustrate the sublattice current induced odd-parity ALM, displaying a significant spin-degenerate peak in the vicinity of the single-particle energy gap. This work reveals the underlying mechanism for the realization of the unconventional odd-parity ALM in collinear AFM systems.</description>

Abstract: Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries which do not commute with spatial symmetries; dipolar symmetries are a prime example. We give a general recipe for constructing topological phases protected by modulated symmetries via a defect network construction, generalizing the crystalline equivalence principle to modulated symmetries. We demonstrate that modulated symmetries can be treated identically to unmodulated symmetries in the absence of spatial symmetries, but in the presence of spatial symmetries, some defect networks which are non-anomalous for unmodulated symmetries become anomalous for modulated symmetries. We apply this understanding to classify symmetry-protected topological phases protected by translation symmetry plus either discrete or continuous dipolar symmetries in (1+1)D and (2+1)D and obtain a number of other (1+1)D classification results for modulated symmetry-protected topological phases.</description>

      <title>Intricacies of Frustrated Magnetism in the Kondo Metal YbAgGe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combination of localized magnetic moments, their frustration and interaction with itinerant electrons is a key challenge of condensed matter physics. Frustrated magnetic interactions promote degenerate ground states with enhanced fluctuations, a topic that is predominantly studied in magnetic insulators. The coupling between itinerant and localized electrons in metals add complexity to the problem, and presently formulated only for extreme cases in which the itinerant electrons mediate exchange between localized spins (RKKY interaction) or suppress the formation of magnetic moments (Kondo screening). Here, we report an in-depth experimental study of the distorted Kagome metal YbAgGe, unravelling the open questions of how frustration, localized magnetism and itinerant electrons are intertwined in frustrated Kondo metals. We find that coupled itinerant and localized electrons give rise to dynamic magnetic correlations below T* ~ 20 K. At lower temperature, frustrated magnetic interactions establish anisotropic magnetic short-range correlations that culminate into antiferromagnetic long-range order below TN = 0.68 K with a significantly reduced modulated magnetic moment. We show that local moment Hamiltonians can yield limited understanding of the microscopic behaviour in frustrated metals, and prompt the extension of more sophisticated model Hamiltonians incorporating itinerant effects.</description>

      <title>A new rung on the ladder: exploring topological frustration towards two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological frustration arises when boundary conditions impose geometric frustration in a quantum system, creating delocalized defects in the ground states and profoundly altering the low-energy properties. While previous studies have been concerned with one-dimensional systems, showing that the ground state structure can be described in terms of quasiparticle excitations, the two-dimensional setting remains unexplored. We address this gap by studying a three-legged antiferromagnetic quantum Ising ladder on a torus using tensor network methods, where topological frustration is induced by an odd number of spins along both spatial directions. Our results reveal the first instance in which topological frustration shifts the position of the quantum critical point. By studying the entanglement structure, we find that the ground state can be characterized as hosting three delocalized quasiparticles. This work builds the quasiparticle picture of topological frustration toward higher dimensions and more complex systems than those considered so far.</description>

      <title>Circular dichroism on the edge of quantum Hall systems: From many-body Chern number to anisotropy measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Hall states are characterized by a topological invariant, the many-body Chern number, which determines their quantized Hall conductivity. This invariant also emerges in circular dichroic responses, namely, by applying a circular drive and comparing excitation rates for opposite orientations. This work explores the dichroic response of confined, isolated quantum Hall systems, where bulk and edge contributions cancel exactly: When the edge response is properly isolated, the circular dichroic signal becomes quantized, serving as a direct and elegant probe of the many-body Chern number encoded in the edge physics. We demonstrate that this quantized edge response is entirely captured by low-energy chiral edge modes, allowing for a universal description of this effect based on Wen's edge theory. Its low-energy nature implies that the quantized edge response can be distinguished from the bulk response in the frequency domain. The edge response is also shown to be a sensitive diagnostic of geometric features. This opens the possibility of characterizing the shape of quantum Hall droplets through edge spectroscopic measurements, without requiring knowledge of the system's boundary profile. We illustrate our findings using realistic models of integer and fractional Chern insulators, with different edge geometries, and propose detection schemes suitable for ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Electrical control of topological 3Q state in intercalated van der Waals antiferromagnet Cox-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnets have opened a new avenue of opportunities encompassing various interesting phases. Co1/3TaS2-an intercalated metallic vdW antiferromagnet-is one of the latest additions to this growing list of materials due to its unique topologically nontrivial triple-Q (3Q) ground state. This 3Q tetrahedral structure, which critically depends on the Co content, yields the highest-density Skyrmion lattice with scalar spin chirality, resulting in a noticeable anomalous Hall effect. In this work, we demonstrate control of this topological phase via ionic gating. Using four CoxTaS2 devices with different Co compositions, we show that ionic gating can cover the entire 3Q topological phase and reveal the nature of the thermodynamically inaccessible phase space. Another striking finding in our data is the existence of an adiabatic discontinuity in the phase boundary between the 3Q and 1Q phases. Our work constitutes one of the first examples of electrical control of scalar spin chirality using an antiferromagnetic metal.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Unusual Temperature Dependence of the Upper Critical Field of Kagome Superconductor CsV3Sb5: Multiple Bands or van Hove Singularities?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Van Hove singularities (vHs) located close to the Fermi level in Kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) have profound influence on their electronic and transport characteristics. Specifically, magneto-transport and susceptibility measurements on CsV3Sb5 reveal an anomalous temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_c2 (T), characterized by a pronounced upward curvature for both in-plane and c-axis magnetic fields, with zero-temperature H_c2 values of ~6.0 T and ~1.2 T, respectively. Our theoretical analysis, using a newly developed single-band model incorporating vHs and gap anisotropy, suggests that the observed upper critical field behavior is predominantly driven by the anisotropy of the Fermi velocity originating from vHs, instead of multi-band effects or gap anisotropy. Increased electron scattering introduced by proton irradiation defects smears out the vHs, reduces anisotropy, and recovers the conventional H_c2 (T) behavior, corroborating our proposed model.</description>

      <title>Fractal decompositions and tensor network representations of Bethe wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00923v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure of a generic $M$-particle Bethe wavefunction (not necessarily an eigenstate of an integrable model) on a 1d lattice by dividing the lattice into $L$ parts and decomposing the wavefunction into a sum of products of $L$ local wavefunctions. Using the fact that a Bethe wavefunction accepts a \textit{fractal} multipartite decomposition -- it can always be written as a linear combination of $L^M$ products of $L$ local wavefunctions, where each local wavefunction is in turn also a Bethe wavefunction -- we then build \textit{exact, analytical} tensor network representations with finite bond dimension $\chi=2^M$, for a generic planar tree tensor network (TTN), which includes a matrix product states (MPS) and a regular binary TTN as prominent particular cases. For a regular binary tree, the network has depth $\log_{2}(N/M)$ and can be transformed into an adaptive quantum circuit of the same depth, composed of unitary gates acting on $2^M$-dimensional qudits and mid-circuit measurements, that deterministically prepares the Bethe wavefunction. Finally, we put forward a much larger class of \textit{generalized} Bethe wavefunctions, for which the above decompositions, tensor network and quantum circuit representations are also possible.</description>

      <title>System-environmental entanglement in critical spin systems under $ZZ$-decoherence and its relation to strong and weak symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum many-body systems exhibit nontrivial behavior under decoherence. In particular, system-environmental entanglement (SEE) is one of the efficient quantities for classifying mixed states subject to decoherence. In this work, we investigate the SEE of critical spin chains under nearest-neighbor $ZZ$-decoherence. We numerically show that the SEE exhibits a specific scaling law, in particular, its system-size-independent term (``$g$-function'') changes drastically its behavior in the vicinity of phase transition caused by decoherence. For the XXZ model in its gapless regime, a transition diagnosed by strong R\'{e}nyi-2 correlations occurs as the strength of the decoherence increases. We determine the location of the phase transition by investigating the $g$-function that exhibits a sharp change in the critical region of the transition. Furthermore, we find that the value of the SEE is twice that of the system under single-site $Z$-decoherence, which was recently studied by conformal field theory. From the viewpoint of R\'{e}nyi-2 Shannon entropy}, which is closely related to the SEE at the maximal decoherence, we clarify the origin of this $g$-function behavior.</description>

      <title>Gauging Quantum Phases: A Matrix Product State Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the framework of matrix product states, we investigate gauging as a method for exploring quantum phases of matter. Specifically, we describe how symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phases in one-dimensional spin systems behave under twisted gauging, a generalization of the well-known gauging procedure for globally symmetric states. Compared to previous, order parameter-based, approaches our analysis is not limited to the case of maximally non-commutative (MNC) phases and we use our findings to propose a generalization of the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation to the non-MNC setting. A key result of our work is that gauging produces configurations characterized by a combination of MNC order and symmetry breaking, when applied to non-MNC SPT phases. More generally, we conjecture a precise correspondence between SSB and non-MNC SPT phases, possibly enabling the detection of such phases using local and string order parameters.</description>

      <title>Higher symmetries and anomalies in quantum lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an 't Hooft anomaly index for a group acting on a 2d quantum lattice system by finite-depth circuits. It takes values in the degree-4 cohomology of the group and is an obstruction to on-siteability of the group action. We introduce a 3-group (modeled as a crossed square) describing higher symmetries of a 2d lattice system and show that the 2d anomaly index is an obstruction for promoting a symmetry action to a morphism of 3-groups. This demonstrates that 't Hooft anomalies are a consequence of a mixing between ordinary symmetries and higher symmetries. Similarly, to any 1d lattice system we attach a 2-group (modeled as a crossed module) and interpret the Nayak-Else anomaly index as an obstruction for promoting a group action to a morphism of 2-groups. The meaning of indices of Symmetry Protected Topological states is also illuminated by higher group symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Hubbard model on a graphene hexagon: Strengths of IQPE and noise constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers transformative potential for simulating real-world materials, providing a powerful platform to investigate complex quantum systems across quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. In this work, we leverage this capability to simulate the Hubbard model on a six-site graphene hexagon using Qiskit, employing the Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation (IQPE) and adiabatic evolution algorithms to determine its ground-state properties. Our results show that a single Slater determinant is sufficient to initialize IQPE and accurately recover ground-state energies (GSEs) in small-scale Hubbard systems. In noiseless simulations, IQPE converges within a few iterations to exact GSEs, while adiabatic simulations yield charge and spin densities and correlation functions in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization. However, deploying IQPE and adiabatic evolution on today's noisy quantum hardware remains highly challenging. To investigate these limitations in IQPE, we use the Qiskit Aer simulator with a custom noise model tailored to the characteristics of IBM's real hardware. This model includes realistic depolarizing gate errors, thermal relaxation, and readout noise, allowing us to explore how these factors degrade simulation accuracy. Further, we implement the IQPE algorithm on IBM's ibm_strasbourg and ibm_fez devices for a reduced three-site Hubbard model, enabling direct comparison between simulated and real hardware noise. While ibm_fez runs closely match exact results, discrepancies highlight the gap between modeled and physical noise. This study demonstrates both the IQPE's potential and current limitations for simulating strongly correlated systems under realistic conditions.</description>
