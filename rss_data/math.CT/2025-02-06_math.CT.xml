      <title>Growth Problems for Representations of Finite Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a conjecture for the asymptotic growth rate of the number of indecomposable summands in the tensor powers of representations of finite monoids, expressing it in terms of the (Brauer) character table of the monoid's group of units. We prove it under an additional hypothesis. We also give (exact and asymptotic) formulas for the growth rate of the length of the tensor powers when working over a good characteristic. As examples, we compute the growth rates for the full transformation monoid, the symmetric inverse monoid, and the monoid of 2 by 2 matrices. We also provide code used for our calculation.</description>

      <title>Rewriting modulo in diagrammatic algebras and application to categorification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a rewriting theory suitable for diagrammatic algebras and lay down the foundations of a systematic study of their higher structures. In this paper, we focus on the question of finding bases. As an application, we give the first proof of a basis theorem for graded $\mathfrak{gl}_2$-foams, a certain diagrammatic algebra appearing in categorification and quantum topology. Our approach is algorithmic, combining linear rewriting, higher rewriting and rewriting modulo another set of rules -- for diagrammatic algebras, the modulo rules typically capture a categorical property, such as pivotality. In the process, we give novel approaches to the foundations of these theories, including to the notion of confluence. Other important tools include termination rules that depend on contexts, rewriting modulo invertible scalars, and a practical guide to classifying branchings modulo. This article is written to be accessible to experts on diagrammatic algebras with no prior knowledge on rewriting theory, and vice-versa.</description>

      <title>On exact categories and their stable envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Klemenc's stable envelope of exact $\infty$-categories induces an equivalence between stable $\infty$-categories with a bounded heart structure and weakly idempotent complete exact $\infty$-categories. Moreover, we generalise the Gillet-Waldhausen theorem to the connective algebraic K-theory of exact $\infty$-categories and deduce a universal property of connective algebraic K-theory as an additive invariant on exact $\infty$-categories.
  A key tool is a generalisation of a theorem due to Keller which provides a sufficient condition for an exact functor to induce a fully faithful functor on stable envelopes.</description>

Abstract: C-systems were defined by Cartmell as the algebraic structures that correspond exactly to generalised algebraic theories. B-systems were defined by Voevodsky in his quest to formulate and prove an initiality conjecture for type theories. They play a crucial role in Voevodsky's construction of a syntactic C-system from a term monad. In this work, we construct an equivalence between the category of C-systems and the category of B-systems, thus proving a conjecture by Voevodsky. We construct this equivalence as the restriction of an equivalence between more general structures, called CE-systems and E-systems, respectively. To this end, we identify C-systems and B-systems as "stratified" CE-systems and E-systems, respectively; that is, systems whose contexts are built iteratively via context extension, starting from the empty context.</description>

      <title>Exact weights and path metrics for triangulated categories and the derived category of persistence modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define exact weights on a triangulated category to be nonnegative functions on objects satisfying a subadditivity condition with respect to exact triangles. Such weights induce a metric on objects in the triangulated category, which we call a path metric. Our exact weights generalize the rank functions of J.\ Chuang and A.\ Lazarev and are analogous to the exact weights for an exact category given by the first author and J.\ Scott and D.\ Stanley. We show that cohomological functors from a triangulated category to an abelian category with an additive weight induce an exact weight on the triangulated category. We prove that triangle equivalences induce an isometry for the path metrics induced by cohomological functors. In the perfectly generated or compactly generated case, we use Brown representability to express the exact weight on the triangulated category. We give three characterizations of exactness for a weight on a triangulated category and show that they are equivalent. We also define Wasserstein distances for triangulated categories. Finally, we apply our work to derived categories of persistence modules and to representations of continuous quivers of type $\mathbb{A}$.</description>

      <title>Constructing a fully homomorphic encryption scheme with the Yoneda Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper redefines the foundations of asymmetric cryptography's homomorphic cryptosystems through the application of the Yoneda Lemma. It demonstrates that widely adopted systems, including ElGamal, RSA, Benaloh, Regev's LWE, and NTRUEncrypt, are directly derived from the principles of the Yoneda Lemma. This synthesis leads to the creation of a holistic homomorphic encryption framework, the Yoneda Encryption Scheme. Within this framework, encryption is modeled using the bijective maps of the Yoneda Lemma Isomorphism, with decryption following naturally from the properties of these maps. This unification suggests a conjecture for a unified model theory framework, offering a foundation for reasoning about both homomorphic and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes. As a practical demonstration, the paper introduces the FHE scheme ACES, which supports arbitrary finite sequences of encrypted multiplications and additions without relying on conventional bootstrapping techniques for ciphertext refreshment. This highlights the practical implications of the theoretical advancements and proposes a new approach for leveraging model theory and forcing techniques in cryptography, particularly in the design of FHE schemes.</description>

      <title>Length of triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07583v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of composition series of triangulated categories. Their \emph{lengths} yield invariants for these categories. We then focus on composition series of derived categories of certain projective varieties and finite dimensional algebras. We construct composition series of different lengths, for some smooth projective rational surfaces and for certain smooth threefolds. On the other hand, we prove that for derived categories of finite dimensional representations of finite acyclic quivers (which are allowed to be wild), for nontrivial admissible subcategories of ${\rm D}^{\rm b}(\mathbb{P}^2)$ and for derived categories of some singular varieties, all composition series have the same length. If this property would also hold for the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^2$ in $10$ general points, then Krah's phantom subcategory would have infinite length. In particular, it would have an infinite length chain of thick subcategories.</description>

      <title>Dynamics, data and reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven learning is prevalent in many fields of science, mathematics and engineering. The goal of data-driven learning of dynamical systems is to interpret timeseries as a continuous observation of an underlying dynamical system. This task is not well-posed for a variety of reasons. A dynamical system may have multiple sub-systems co-existing within it. The nature of the dataset depends on the portion of the phase space being viewed, and may thus my confined to a sub-system. Secondly these sub-systems may be topologically inter-weaved, so may be inseparable computationally. Thirdly, two timeseries sampled separately from different dynamical systems may be close or even indistinguishable. So there is no unique source for the timeseries. We show how these ambiguities are circumvented if one considers dynamical systems and measurement maps collectively. This is made possible in a category theoretical framework, in which reconstruction is unique up to equivalences. Dynamical systems, observed dynamical systems, and timeseries data - each of these three collections have an extensive network of relations within them, which gives them the mathematical structure of a category. We show that the transformations preserve these relations, and thus have the mathematical property of being functors. Secondly we show that under mild conditions of consistency, reconstruction algorithms are themselves functors from the category of timeseries-data into the category of dynamical systems. Finally we present that the task of inverting the transformation of dynamics in the language of Kan extensions.</description>
