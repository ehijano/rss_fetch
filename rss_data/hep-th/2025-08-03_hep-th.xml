      <title>Total instanton restriction via multiverse interference: Noncompact gauge theories and (-1)-form symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we consider examples of decomposition (in which a local QFT is equivalent to a disjoint union of multiple independent theories, known as universes) where there is a continuous familiy of universes, rather than a finite or countably infinite collection. In particular, this allows us to consistently eliminate all instantons in a local QFT via a suitable topological gauging of the (-1)-form symmetry. In two-dimensional U(1) gauge theories, this is equivalent to changing the gauge gruop to R. This makes both locality as well as the instanton restriction explicit. We apply this to clarify the Gross-Taylor string interpretation of the decomposition of two-dimensional pure Yang-Mills. We also apply decomposition to study two-dimensional R gauge theories, such as the pure R Maxwell theory, and two-dimensional supersymmetric gauged linear sigma models whose gauge groups have factors of R. In that context, we find that analogues of the Witten effect for dyons, here rotating between universes, play a role in relating anomalies of the individual universes to (different) anomalies in the disjoint union. Finally, we discuss limits of the Tanizaki-Unsal construction, which accomplish instanton restriction by topologically gauging a Q/Z (-1)-form symmetry, and speculate in two-dimensional theories on possible interpretations of those limits in terms of the adelic solenoid.</description>

      <title>Volume as an index of a subalgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new way to understand the volume of certain subregions in the bulk of AdS spacetime by relating it to an algebraic quantity known as the index of inclusion. This index heuristically measures the relative size of a subalgebra $\mathcal{N}$ embedded within a larger algebra $\mathcal{M}$. According to subregion-subalgebra duality, bulk subregions are described by von Neumann algebras on the boundary. When a causally complete bulk subregion corresponds to the relative commutant $\mathcal{N}' \cap \mathcal{M}$ -- the set of operators in $\mathcal{M}$ that commute with $\mathcal{N}$ -- of boundary subalgebras, we propose that the exponential of the volume of the maximal volume slice of the subregion equals the index of inclusion. This ``volume-index'' relation provides a new boundary explanation for the growth of interior volume in black holes, reframing it as a change in the relative size of operator algebras. It offers a complementary perspective on complexity growth from the Heisenberg picture, and has a variety of other applications, including quantifying the relative size of algebras dual to the entanglement wedge and the causal wedge of a boundary region, as well as quantifying the violation of additivity of operator algebras in the large $N$ limit. Finally, it may offer insights into the volume growth of de Sitter space through the changes in North and South pole observer algebras in time.</description>

      <title>Entanglement spreading and emergent locality in Brownian SYK chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula and its interpretation in terms of quantum error correction (QEC) implies an emergent locality for the spread of quantum information in holographic CFTs, where information injected at a point in the boundary theory spreads within a sharp light-cone corresponding to the butterfly velocity. This emergent locality is a necessary condition for the existence of a geometric bulk dual with an RT-like formula for entanglement entropy. In this paper, we use tools from QEC to study the spread of quantum information and the emergence of a sharp light-cone in an analytically tractable model of chaotic dynamics, namely a one-dimensional Brownian SYK chain. We start with an infinite temperature state in this model and inject a qudit at time $t=0$ at some point $p$ on the chain. We then explicitly calculate the amount of information of the qudit contained in an interval of length $2\ell$ (centered around $p$) at some later time $t=T$. We find that at strong coupling, this quantity shows a sharp transition as a function of $\ell$ from near zero to near maximal correlation. The transition occurs at $\ell \sim v_B T$, with $v_B$ being the butterfly velocity. Underlying the emergence of this sharp light-cone is a non-linear generalization of the diffusion equation called the FKPP equation, which admits sharp domain wall solutions at late times and strong coupling. These domain wall solutions can be understood on physical grounds from properties of operator growth in chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>The CFT of Sen's Formulation of Chiral Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sen's action for chiral bosons in 2 dimensions describes two chiral scalars, one of which couples to the physical metric and one of which couples to a flat metric. It has a generalisation in which the flat metric is replaced by an arbitrary second metric and so can be formulated on any curved world-sheet. When the two metrics are equal, the theory reduces to a $\beta \gamma$ system, giving a non-unitary $c=2$ conformal field theory. We argue that the relation between this and the theory of two chiral bosonic scalars of the same chirality can be viewed as a \lq bosonisation'. We show that the standard vertex operators for the chiral scalars are vertex operators and line operators in the Sen formulation and derive the formulation in the Sen theory of correlation functions in the chiral scalar theory. The flat space Sen theory can be coupled to two different world-sheet metrics in such a way that one scalar couples to one metric and the other to the other metric, so obtaining the general formulation with two metrics.
  In $d=4k+2$ dimensions, the bi-metric action for a $2k$-form gauge field with self-dual field strength reduces, when the two metrics are equal, to a conformal field theory with a $BF$-type action, except that $B$ is a self-dual $d/2$-form and $F$ is a $d/2$-form field strength, $F=dP$. The self-duality of $B$ means that this is not a topological theory but instead represents two self-dual gauge fields. This has a generalisation to a democratic action for $p$-form gauge fields in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Holographic Wilson Loop One-point Functions in ABJM Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the correlation function between a circular half-BPS Wilson loop (or straight Wilson line) and a local operator in ABJM theory utilizing its M-theory description. The local operator can be a $1/3$-BPS single-trace chiral primary operator or the stress-energy tensor. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, these correlators are dual to fluctuations of a probe M2-brane in $AdS_4 \times S^7/\mathbb{Z}_k$. We derive analytic results for both cases and compare them with existing results based on supersymmetric localization in the literature. In the large-$N$ limit with $k$ finite, our holograkphic results exhibit perfect agreement with localization.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Normal Modes and Nonlinear Electrodynamics in Black Hole Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between thermodynamic phase transitions and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in charged black holes with a positive curvature constant, within the framework of $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity. Nonlinear electromagnetic fields lead to rich thermodynamic phase structures and significantly affect the QNMs of massless scalar fields. By analyzing the QNMs spectrum, we find that the transition point marking the disappearance of divergence in the QNMs slope parameter $K$ aligns with the change of the thermodynamic phase structure described by the heat capacity, within the bounds of computational uncertainty. This precise matching holds under variations of curvature parameters and charge. Furthermore, we show that larger angular quantum number $l$ diminishes this correspondence, while higher overtone number $n$ restores it beyond a threshold. These findings demonstrate that thermodynamic phase transitions of black holes carry embedded dynamical information, uncovering a fundamental link between black hole thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>

      <title>Aspects of 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ $ADE$ gauge theories from M-theory: decomposition, automorphisms, and generalised symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decomposition of 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theories with Lie algebras of type $\mathfrak{su}(N)$, $\mathfrak{so}(2N)$, and $\mathfrak{e}_{6}$, realized via M-theory geometric engineering. These theories, together with their novel decomposition structure, arise from quotienting the Bryant--Salamon spin bundle over the 3-sphere by special finite subgroups acting simultaneously on both the fiber and base. We show that these gauge theories admit both inner and outer automorphisms, enabling sequences of gauge theory breaking. In particular, outer automorphisms extend the decomposition structure to theories with $\mathfrak{so}(2N+1)$, $\mathfrak{sp}(2N)$, $\mathfrak{f}_{4}$, and $\mathfrak{g}_{2}$ gauge algebras. For these theories, including both simply-laced and non-simply-laced cases, we analyze their $p$-form symmetries, including $(-1)$-form symmetries, derive the corresponding SymTFTs, and identify the M-theoretic origin of their symmetry topological operators and defects. Finally, we demonstrate that these gauge theories exhibit modified instanton sums and higher 4-group structures, and we derive the associated topological sector directly from M-theory.</description>

      <title>Higher spin fields and the field strength multicopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the generalisation of the Weyl double copy to higher spin "multi-copies", showing how the natural linearised higher spin field strengths can be related to sums of powers of the Maxwell tensor. The tracelessness of the field strength involves the appropriate Fronsdal equations of motion for the higher spin field. We work with spacetimes admitting Kerr-Schild coordinates and give a number of examples in different dimensions. We note that the multi-copy is particularly transparent in four dimensions if one uses spinor descriptions of the fields, relating this to the Penrose transform. The higher-dimensional spinor multicopy is also explored and reveals some interesting new features arising from the little group based identification of higher spin field strengths and Maxwell tensor types. We then turn to the vector superspace formalism describing higher spin and `continuous' spin representations given by Schuster and Toro, based on symmetric tensor fields. Here the Kerr-Schild higher spin fields we have used earlier naturally package into a simple expression involving an arbitrary function, when the continuous spin scale $\rho$ is set to zero. Further, we discuss the case of an anti-de Sitter background, where there is also a vector space formalism given by Segal and we clarify this approach using a different definition of the covariant derivative. We give a general solution of Kerr-Schild type and finally we describe some of the obstacles to a continuous spin formulation.</description>

      <title>Gauge symmetry and radiatively induced terms in dimension-5 non-minimal Lorentz-violating QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive the conditions that assure gauge invariance of a non-minimal dimension-5 Lorentz-violating QED. The two and three point functions at one-loop are computed. The gauge Ward identities are checked and the conditions to assure gauge symmetry of this non-minimal framework is found to be the same of the usual QED. Induced terms are also investigated and it is shown that the non-minimal Lorentz-violating $a^{(5)}_F$-term of the fermion sector can induce radiatively a non-minimal Lorentz-violating term in the photon sector.</description>

      <title>Proper-time functional renormalization in $O(N)$ scalar models coupled to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the use of the functional Wilsonian renormalization group framework characterized by a proper time regulator and test its use in the search of the scaling solutions and the critical properties of an O(N)-invariant scalar field multiplet coupled to gravity in d=4 and d=3 dimensions. We employ the same background-fluctuation splitting and gauge fixing procedure, already adopted in a previous study based, instead, on the effective average action framework and a similar truncation of the effective action. Our main goal is to compare the results for the scaling solutions and some of the associated critical exponents. In this analysis, performed in a different framework, most of the picture previously uncovered is confirmed both at qualitative and quantitative level. There are, neverthelss, few differences both at finite N and in its large value limit, depending also on the schemes which in both frameworks are called 'improved'</description>

      <title>Teleparallel gravity from the principal bundle viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine whether the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR) can be formulated as a gauge theory in the language of connections on principal bundles. We argue in favor of using either the affine bundle with the Poincar\'e group or, equivalently, the orthonormal frame bundle with the Lorentz group as the structure group. Following the framework of Trautman--where gauge symmetries are determined using the absolute elements--we set to identify the absolute elements and gauge symmetries of TEGR. The problem of a non-dynamical teleparallel connection raises the question of whether it should be treated as an absolute element. If so, the gauge group of TEGR is potentially some undetermined subgroup of the diffeomorphism group. On the other hand, if the connection is allowed to be non-dynamical but the only absolute element is taken to be the canonical 1-form of the frame bundle, we recover the whole diffeomorphism group as the gauge group of TEGR.</description>

      <title>Free Independence and Unitary Design from Random Matrix Product Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how complex quantum systems emulate randomness is central to quantum chaos, thermalization, and information theory. In one setting, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have recently been shown to probe asymptotic freeness between Heisenberg operators: the non-commutative generalization of statistical independence. In a distinct research direction, the concept of approximate unitary designs have led to efficient constructions of unitaries that look random according to forward-in-time protocols. Bridging these two concepts, in this work we study the emergence of freeness from a random matrix product unitary (RMPU) ensemble. We prove that, with only polynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of higher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables -- precisely the observables that lead to thermal correlations in chaotic many-body systems according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The RMPU ensemble provably forms a unitary design, but, we argue, this does not account for average OTOC behavior and therefore the emergence of freeness. We further compute the ensemble's frame potential exactly to second order, showing convergence to Haar values also with polynomial deviations, indicating that freeness is also reached on-average for global observables. On the other hand, to reproduce the Haar-like OTOC value for local, traceless observables, the considered ensemble requires volume-law operator entanglement. Such correlations therefore lie beyond the paradigm of random unitary features which can be replicated efficiently. Our results highlight the need to refine previous notions of unitary designs in the context of operator dynamics, guiding us towards protocols for genuine quantum advantage while shedding light on the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Trajectories calculation with state of the art lattice QCD equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the full cosmic trajectories of the early Universe across the QCD phase diagram as the plasma cools from $T\simeq500\,$MeV to $30\,$MeV, assuming $\beta$-equilibrated matter. The trajectories are obtained by simultaneously solving baryon-number, electric-charge, and lepton-asymmetry conservation, closed by a state-of-the-art lattice-QCD equation of state: a fourth-order Taylor expansion in the chemical potentials that merges the latest $(2\!+\!1)$-flavor susceptibilities with charm-quark contributions, thus delivering a consistent $(2\!+\!1\!+\!1)$-flavor equation of state. Results are compared with an ideal quark-gluon plasma and with a hadron-resonance gas to highlight interaction effects. Two cases of primordial lepton asymmetries are analyzed: a symmetric configuration $(\ell_e=\ell_\mu=\ell_\tau=\ell/3)$ and an asymmetric one $(\ell_e=0,\;\ell_\mu=-\ell_\tau)$. Increasing $|\ell|$ systematically drives the trajectories toward larger values of $\mu_B$ and more negative $\mu_Q$. In the asymmetric case, a non-monotonic bounce develops when the $\tau$ chemical potential reaches $m_\tau$, generating a maximum in $\mu_B(T)$, the position of which depends on $\ell_\tau$. Assuming a modest $\mu_{Q}$-dependence of the lattice-QCD critical end point estimates (obtained at $\mu_{Q} = 0$), the trajectories for all lepton asymmetries explored ($|\ell|\lesssim 0.1$) lie to their left, implying that in a standard cosmological scenario the QCD transition is almost certainly a smooth crossover. Nevertheless, we estimate the magnitude of baryon and lepton asymmetries needed to obtain a cosmic trajectory closer to the QCD critical point, providing inputs for future studies of the strong-interaction epoch.</description>

      <title>Worldline Modeling of Ultra-Intense Lasers for N-photon Scattering Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modeling of present and future ultra-intense lasers demands techniques that go beyond the standard diagrammatic approach to non-perturbatively fully capture the effects of strong fields. We illustrate the first-quantized path integral representation for strong-field quantum electrodynamics as a means of accessing the laser being treated as a background field, which is treated without recourse to perturbation theory. We examine an all-multiplicity construction for $N-$photon scattering processes for complex scalars and spinors, showing compact Master Formulae for tree-level scattering. Several background fields are considering including: plane waves, impulsive PP-waves, non-null fields, and homogeneous fields (constant-crossed fields) with low-energy external photons.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected Thermodynamics of Conformal Weyl Gravity Black Holes: GUP Effects and Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of black holes in Conformal Weyl Gravity (CWG) using the Mannheim-Kazanas solution, with particular emphasis on quantum corrections that become significant near the Planck scale. Our analysis employs the Hamilton-Jacobi tunneling formalism to derive the Hawking temperature, revealing explicit contributions from the conformal parameters $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $k$ that lead to substantial deviations from Schwarzschild black hole behavior. We incorporate quantum gravitational effects through the Generalized Uncertainty Principle, demonstrating systematic suppression of thermal radiation in the near-Planckian regime. Using an exponentially corrected entropy model, we compute the complete spectrum of QC thermodynamic potentials, including internal energy, pressure, heat capacity, and free energies. Our heat capacity analysis reveals critical phase transitions separating thermodynamically stable and unstable regions, with the scale-dependent parameter $\gamma$ playing a crucial role in controlling phase structure. The Joule-Thomson expansion analysis shows distinct cooling and heating regimes with inversion points that shift systematically with CWG parameters, capturing QC phase transitions absent in general relativity. We also examine gravitational redshift in CWG geometry, finding complex radial dependence that could provide observable signatures for distinguishing conformal gravity from Einstein's theory. Our results demonstrate that CWG offers a consistent framework for studying black hole thermodynamics beyond general relativity, with quantum corrections revealing rich phase structures and potential observational consequences.</description>

      <title>Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics I: Foundation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, termed Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics (NNET), which integrates reversible dynamics governed by the Nambu bracket with irreversible dynamics driven by entropy gradients. This framework is developed axiomatically and enables the description of far-from-equilibrium systems in which entropy can transiently decrease -- a regime difficult to handle within conventional approaches such as Onsager's linear response theory, Prigogine's General Evolution Criterion (GEC), or the GENERIC framework.
  As an illustrative example, we analyze a triangular chemical reaction system. We demonstrate that, without assuming detailed balance or linearity, two geometric conserved quantities naturally emerge: one associated with cyclic symmetry in the reaction space, and another that vanishes under symmetric reaction rates. This highlights the extended descriptive power of NNET and its capacity to unify cyclic dynamics and dissipation within a covariant structure. The generalization to higher-order nonlinear systems and applications to oscillatory or spiking non-equilibrium behavior will be discussed in subsequent papers.</description>

      <title>Implication of neutron star observations to the origin of nucleon mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of neutron star observations for understanding the origin of nucleon mass using a framework that combines three complementary approaches: the equation of state based on parity doublet structure for hadronic matter below $2n_0$, the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model for quark matter above $5n_0$, and a model-independent analysis of the intermediate density region based on fundamental physical principles. By systematically exploring parameter spaces and comparing theoretical predictions with recent observational constraints, we establish constraints on the chiral invariant mass. Our results suggest that more than a half of the nucleon mass originates from sources beyond spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, challenging conventional understanding of nucleon mass generation. These constraints arise solely from fundamental physical principles and observational data, independent of specific assumptions about the nature of the quark-hadron transition, providing robust insights into the microscopic origin of hadron masses.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric figure of merit and the deconfinement phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric phenomena are traditionally associated with the interconversion of thermal and electrical energy in many-body systems. In the context of high-temperature quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, thermoelectric responses can provide insight into the evolving microscopic dynamics and the redistribution of effective degrees of freedom across the phase transition region. In this work, for the first time, we present a phenomenological study of the thermoelectric figure of merit (\( ZT \)) in hot QCD matter, with a particular focus on its behavior across the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma phases. Using model-based calculations for the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity, we analyze the temperature dependence of \( ZT \) and identify characteristic features near the QCD phase transition temperature. Our results indicate that \( ZT \) exhibits nontrivial behavior near the transition region, reflecting the changing transport properties and active degrees of freedom in the medium. This phenomenological study of the thermoelectric figure of merit provides a complementary perspective to traditional transport studies and may provide critical insights for advancing the understanding of QCD matter through the transition region.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement of Hawking-Partner modes in expanding cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates quantum entanglement generated within a one-dimensional cavity where one boundary undergoes prescribed acceleration, a setup designed to mimic aspects of Hawking radiation. We quantify quantum correlations using logarithmic negativity for bipartitions where subsystem $A$ is a given mode and subsystem $B$ the rest of the system. For initial pure states, we also consider a given mode and reconstruct its partner using the Hotta-Sch\"utzhold-Unruh formula, obtaining identical results. Besides the initial vacuum state, we also consider one-mode squeezed and two-mode squeezed states, in order to confirm if quantum entanglement can be stimulated. Moreover, we analyze its robustness against initial thermal noise. Our analysis is based on numerical simulations and does not assume any approximation beyond the validity of our numerical algorithms. Our findings reveal that the expanding cavity effectively acts as a squeezing device, with Hawking-partner pairs largely behaving as two-mode squeezed states. A significant conclusion is that, in our setting, purification of Hawking modes is predominantly a low-energy process, with high-energetic particles contributing negligibly to the partner modes. Indeed, in both small and large acceleration regimes of the boundaries, quantum entanglement decreases towards the ultraviolet modes, indicating that higher-energy particles are more challenging to entangle and hence less probable to contribute in the purification process. While the Hotta-Sch\"utzhold-Unruh formula offers notable computational efficiency, partner modes do not commute, due to the non-trivial multimode entanglement structure of the system. Hence, this pairwise description is not suitable for describing the full system.</description>

      <title>An analytic approach to the stress energy tensor in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a framework for quantum fields in curved spacetimes that possess a stress energy tensor as a connection one form on a suitable moduli space of metrics. In generic spacetimes the existence of such a tensor is thought to be a replacement for the existence of symmetries that the Minkowski theory relies on. It is shown that the local time-slice property and the implementability of local isometries is a consequence of the existence of a stress energy tensor that is a local field. We prove that the Klein-Gordon field, in an irreducible Fock representation in which the ground state is Hadamard, is an example. In this example we show that the scattering matrix for compactly supported metric perturbations exists in the Fock space and is smooth on a dense set with respect to the perturbation parameter. This generalises results by Dimock and Wald.</description>

      <title>Probing scalar field with generic extreme mass-ratio inspirals around Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The future space-based gravitational wave observatories are expected to provide unprecedented opportunities to explore intricate characteristics of black hole binaries, particularly for extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which a stellar-mass compact object slowly inspirals into a supermassive black hole. These systems are very prominent sources for testing gravity in the strong gravity fields and for probing potential deviations from general relativity, including those arising from the presence of fundamental scalar fields. In this work, we examine the impact of a scalar charge carried by the inspiraling object within the context of EMRIs. We focus on generic orbits that present both eccentricity and inclination to evaluate how these parameters affect the modifications induced by the scalar charge to the gravitational wave signal. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of orbital inclination, in particular, enhances the detectability of scalar field effects by introducing richer waveform features that deviate from the purely general relativistic case. The interplay among scalar charge, eccentricity and inclination provides a more complete sampling of the black hole spacetime, suggesting that EMRIs with such generic orbits represent compelling systems for stringently constraining or discovering new fundamental fields through future gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive regular black-hole solutions, including the Hayward metric, from four-dimensional action principles involving vector fields in addition to the metric. These black holes possess additional hair associated with the vector fields, manifesting as free integration constants that regularize the geometry. These constants can be chosen such that regular black holes of all masses are extremal. As a result, they have vanishing surface gravity and are not susceptible to mass-inflation instability. We also discover another regular black-hole metric with these properties, which constitutes a gravastar for an appropriate choice of integration constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multi-propagator angular integrals, a class of phase-space integrals relevant to processes with multiple observed final states and a test-bed for transferring loop-integral technology to phase space integrals without reversed unitarity. We present an Euler integral representation similar to Lee-Pomeransky representation and explicitly describe a recursive IBP reduction and dimensional shift relations for the general case of $n$ denominators. On the level of master integrals, applying a differential equation approach, we explicitly calculate the previously unknown angular integrals with four denominators for any number of masses to finite order in $\varepsilon$. Extending the idea of dimensional recurrence, we explore the decomposition of angular integrals into branch integrals reducing the number of scales in the master integrals from $(n+1)n/2$ to $n+1$. To showcase the potential of this method, we calculate the massless three denominator integral to establish all-order results in $\varepsilon$ including a resummation of soft logarithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An accurate characterization of the quark-gluon plasma requires understanding of how electromagnetic effects affect the processes mediated by the strong force. All the scenarios in which the plasma emerges, either in nature or in the laboratory, involve strong electromagnetic fields. The early universe, compact astrophysical objects, or ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions harbor the most intense fields we know. Researches from the Latin America region have made a substantial contribution on this subject and the \lq\lq Latin American Network on Electromagnetic Effects in Strongly Interacting Matter" aims to cluster efforts to address open questions related to these systems, boosting collaborations and interaction among its members and connecting Latin American institutions with institutions from the rest of the world. In face of the upcoming experimental programs and new facilities, our mission is to bring together experimentalists, phenomenologists and theorists to better explore the properties of strongly interacting matter in the presence of intense electromagnetic fields. This document describes succinctly the recent contributions from researchers of the Latin American region to the subject, as well as our activities and perspectives for the future.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Trans-Series in Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many observables in quantum field theory can be expressed in terms of trans-series, in which one adds to the perturbative series a typically infinite sum of exponentially small corrections, due to instantons or to renormalons. Even after Borel resummation of the series in the coupling constant, one has to sum this infinite series of small exponential corrections. It has been argued that this leads to a new divergence, which is sometimes called the divergence of the OPE. We show that, in some interesting examples in quantum field theory, the series of small exponential corrections is convergent, order by order in the coupling constant. In particular, we give numerical evidence for this convergence property in the case of the free energy of integrable asymptotically free theories, which has been intensively studied recently in the framework of resurgence. Our results indicate that, in these examples, the Borel resummed trans-series leads to a well defined function, and there are no further divergences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum gravity in 4D asymptotically flat spacetimes features spontaneous symmetry breaking due to soft radiation hair, intimately tied to the proliferation of IR divergences. A holographic description via a putative 2D CFT is expected free of such redundancies. In this series of two papers, we address this issue by initiating the study of Quantum Error Correction in Celestial CFT (CCFT). In Part I we construct a toy model with finite degrees of freedom by revisiting noncommutative geometry in Kleinian hyperk\"ahler spacetimes. The model obeys a Wick algebra that renormalizes in the radial direction and admits an isometric embedding \`a la Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill. The code subspace is composed of 2-qubit stabilizer states which are robust under soft spacetime fluctuations. Symmetries of the hyperk\"ahler space become discrete and translate into the Clifford group familiar from quantum computation. The construction is then embedded into the incidence relation of twistor space, paving the way for the CCFT regime addressed in upcoming work.</description>

Abstract: Theories described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are known to possess strictly positive energy eigenvalues and exhibit unitary time evolution if the Hamiltonian is symmetric under discrete parity and time (PT) transformation. In this work, we demonstrate how quantum quadratic gravity, a theory that generally violates unitarity when viewed as a Hermitian quantum field theory, can be complex-deformed into such a PT-symmetric theory with an action that consists of a ghost-less Hermitian free part and non-Hermitian interactions. Paying special attention to the gauge symmetry present in the theory, we quantize in the covariant operator formalism after suggesting how the framework might be extended to the pseudo-Hermitian picture. We find compelling evidence that the resulting quantum theory possesses a unitary inner product and a sensible interpretation of quantum probability, thus avoiding the ghost problem present in the Hermitian formulation of quadratic gravity.</description>

Abstract: Extracting information about a system's metastable ground state energy employing functional methods usually hinges on utilizing the late-time behavior of the Euclidean propagator, practically impeding the possibility of determining decay widths of excited states. We demonstrate that such obstacles can be surmounted by working with bounded time intervals, adapting the standard instanton formalism to compute a finite-time amplitude corresponding to excited state decay. This is achieved by projecting out the desired resonant energies utilizing carefully chosen approximations to the excited state wave functions in the false vacuum region. To carry out the calculation, we employ unconventional path integral techniques by considering the emerging amplitude as a single composite functional integral that includes fluctuations at the endpoints of the trajectories. This way, we explicitly compute the sought-after decay widths, including their leading quantum corrections, for arbitrary potentials, demonstrating accordance with traditional WKB results. While the initial starting point of weighting Euclidean propagator contributions according to their endpoints using false vacuum states has been proposed earlier, we find several flaws in the published evaluation of the relevant amplitudes. Although we show that the previous proposition of employing a sequential calculation scheme -- where the functional integral is evaluated around extremal trajectories with fixed endpoints, weighted only at a subsequent stage -- can lead to the desired goal, the novel composite approach is found to be more concise and transparent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study compact kinks in a modified Christ-Lee model where the potential is a non-analytic function at the minima. The model has two control parameters that determine the order of the potential and its overall shape. We consider cases in which the potential has a double well shape, a triple well shape, as well as cases with a false vacuum. Compact kink solutions and their internal modes are found for each of these cases. We also study the collision of such kinks and their dependence on the solitons velocity and on the potential parameters. Several interesting dynamical processes are reported, such as the formation of central oscillons for some high velocity collisions, absence of outgoing solitons in cases where the potential is given by piece-wise linear functions, and the decoupling of subkinks from the larger kink in cases with false vacuum, leading to the formation of false vacuum bubbles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the f f to f f scattering amplitudes for the a massless four-fermion interaction model in four dimensions. At first we take the simplest version with the scalar current-current interaction. The loop corrections up to the three-loop level are calculated within the spinor-helicity formalism using the Weyl spinors. We find out that there are two independent spinor structures that appear in all orders of perturbation theory that can be separated when calculating the diagrams. Our aim is to calculate the leading divergences within the dimensional regularization. To check the validity of our calculations, we use the recurrence relations that connect the leading divergences in the subsequent orders of perturbation theory. We left the derivation of these relations and further analysis of the consequences for another publication for the sake of clarity of the current presentation. At the end we briefly consider the physically more interesting case of V-A interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical linearized gravity admits a dual formulation in terms of a higher-rank tensor field. Proposing a prescription for the instanton sectors of linearized gravity and its dual, we show that they may be quantum inequivalent in even dimensions. The duality anomaly is obtained by resolving the dual graviton theories into vector-valued $p$-form electrodynamics and is controlled by the Reidemeister torsion, Ray-Singer torsion and Euler characteristic of the cotangent bundle. Under the proposed instanton prescription the duality anomaly vanishes for an odd number of spacetime dimensions as a consequence of the celebrated Cheeger-M\"uller theorem. In the presence of a gravitational $\theta$-term, the partition function is a modular form in direct analogy to Abelian S-duality for Maxwell theory.</description>

Abstract: It is known that the double-scaled SYK model (DSSYK) reduces to JT gravity with a negative cosmological constant by zooming in on the lower edge $E=-E_0$ of the spectrum. We find that the de Sitter JT gravity (i.e. JT gravity with a positive cosmological constant) is reproduced from DSSYK by taking a scaling limit around the upper edge $E=E_0$ of the spectrum. We also argue that the appearance of de Sitter JT gravity is consistent with the behavior of the classical solution of the sine dilaton gravity.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Transmutation and Anomaly Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a situation where a global symmetry of the ultraviolet (UV) theory does not act faithfully on the local infrared (IR) degrees of freedom, but instead acts effectively as a higher-form symmetry. We refer to this phenomenon as symmetry transmutation, where the UV symmetry is "transmuted" into a higher-form symmetry in the IR. Notably, unlike emergent (accidental) symmetries, which are approximate, these symmetries are exact. We illustrate the ubiquity of this phenomenon in various continuum and lattice systems and provide examples where the 't Hooft anomalies of the UV symmetry are matched by those of the new higher-form symmetry in the IR. We also show that in certain phases and for certain energies, the UV baryon-number symmetry of one-flavor QCD is transmuted into a discrete one-form global symmetry. Finally, we compare our symmetry transmutation to the well-known phenomenon of symmetry fractionalization.</description>

      <title>Cobordism Utopia: U-Dualities, Bordisms, and the Swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The U-dualities of maximally supersymmetric supergravity theories lead to celebrated non-perturbative constraints on the structure of quantum gravity. They can also lead to the presence of global symmetries since manifolds equipped with non-trivial duality bundles can carry topological charges captured by non-trivial elements of bordism groups. The recently proposed Swampland Cobordism Conjecture thus predicts the existence of new singular objects absent in the low-energy supergravity theory, which break these global symmetries.
  We investigate this expectation in two directions, involving the different choices of U-duality groups $G_U$, as well as $k$, the dimension of the closed manifold carrying the topological charge. First, we compute for all supergravity theories in dimension $3 \leq D \leq 11$ the bordism groups $\Omega_1^{\text{Spin}}(BG_U)$. Second, we treat in detail the case of $D = 8$, computing all relevant bordism groups $\Omega_k^{\text{Spin}}(BG_U)$ for $1 \leq k \leq 7$. In all cases, we identify corresponding string, M-, or F-theory backgrounds which implement the required U-duality defects. In particular, we find that in some cases there is no purely geometric background available which implements the required symmetry-breaking defect. This includes non-geometric twists as well as non-geometric strings and instantons.
  This computation involves several novel computations of the bordism groups for $G_U = \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z}) \times \mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$, which localizes at primes $p=2,3$. Whereas an amalgamated product structure greatly simplifies the calculation of purely $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ bundles, this does not extend to $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$. Rather, we leverage the appearance of product / ring structures induced from cyclic subgroups of $G_U$ which naturally act on the relevant bordism groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-loop correction to eleven-dimensional supergravity involves a term $t_8t_8R^4$, with four Riemann tensors. With a suitable UV regularization, this term is expected to reduce to a similar one-loop term present in the type IIA effective action. This has previously been verified in the NSNS sector at the 4-point level. Here we extend this result to couplings of NSNS and RR fields, which have been computed using the pure spinor formalism. In particular, we check all couplings of RR fields to the dilaton. Correcting some minor mistakes in the literature we find complete agreement. We also give a complete analysis of 4-point terms in eleven dimensions computed previously from superparticle amplitudes and present a simplified form for these.</description>

Abstract: We propose a symplectic structure for the phase space of a generic Lagrangian field theory expressed in the framework of $L_\infty$ algebras. The symplectic structure does not require explicit knowledge of the derivative content of the Lagrangian, and therefore is applicable to nonlocal models, such as string field theory, where traditional constructions are difficult to apply. We test our proposal in a number of examples ranging from general relativity to $p$-adic string theory.</description>

Abstract: Correlators of large-scale fluctuations produced during cosmic inflation are major observables of inflationary cosmology. In cosmological collider physics, many interesting correlators are generated through loop processes. However, ultraviolet divergences often appear when computing the loop correlators, and a regularization is required. In this work, K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation and dimensional regularization are used to analytically compute various correlators with a bubble loop of massive bulk propagators in de Sitter spacetime. Examples include 4-point and 2-point correlators with 1-loop bubbe exchanges of derivatively coupled massive scalars or massive spin-1 bosons.</description>

      <title>Gradient properties of $\varphi^3$ in $d=6-\varepsilon$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The renormalization group flow of the multiscalar interacting $\varphi^3$ theory in $d=6$ dimensions is known to have a gradient structure, in which suitable generalizations of the beta functions $B^{I}$ emerge as the gradient of a scalar function $A$, $\partial_I A = T_{IJ} B^J $, with a nontrivial tensor $T_{IJ}$ in the space of couplings. This has been shown directly to three loops in schemes such as $\overline{\rm MS}$ and can be argued in general by identifying $A$ with the coefficient of the topological term of the trace-anomaly in $d=6$ up to a normalization. In this paper we show that the same renormalization group has a gradient structure in $d=6-\varepsilon$. The requirement of a gradient structure is translated to linear constraints that the coefficients of the $\overline{\rm MS}$ beta functions must obey, one of which is new and pertinent only to the extension to $d \neq 6$.</description>

Abstract: It is known that the moduli space of Einstein structures in four dimensions is generally considered to be rigid so that Einstein metrics tend to be isolated modulo diffeomorphisms under infinitesimal Einstein deformations. We examine the rigidity of the Einstein structure by considering deformations of the round four-sphere. We show that any deviation from the standard metric of the round four-sphere (except for scaling) breaks the Einstein condition. This further supports the idea of rigidity. We analyze the Einstein structure of four-manifolds based on the irreducible decomposition of the self-dual structure of Einstein manifolds.</description>

Abstract: I present a review of the Dirac equation in general relativity. Although the generalization of the Dirac equation to a curved spacetime is well known, it is not usually part of the standard toolkit of techniques known to people working on classical general relativity. Recently, there has been some renewed interest in studying solutions of the Einstein--Dirac system of equations, particularly in the context of the so-called ``Dirac stars''. Motivated by this, here I present a review of the Dirac equation in general relativity, starting from Minkowski spacetime, and then considering the Lorentz group and the tetrad formalism in order to generalize this equation to the case of a curved spacetime. I also derive the form of the Dirac equation and its associated stress--energy tensor for the case of the 3+1 formalism of general relativity, which can be useful for the study of the evolution of the Dirac field in a dynamical spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the magnetoelectric conductivity for ideal nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs), with a finite but tiny mass-gap, in distinct planar-Hall set-ups. Each differing configuration results from the relative orientation of the nodal-ring's plane with respect to the plane spanned by the electric ($\mathbf E $) and magnetic ($\mathbf B$) fields. The net conductivity tensor has components comprising the Drude, anomalous-Hall, in-plane (with $\mathbf E$ and $\mathbf B$) longitudinal and transverse, and Lorentz-force-operator-induced parts. Our results feature the signatures of the inherent topology of a gapped NLSM, revealed through nonzero values of the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment. In particular, we show that both of these vector fields, arising in the momentum space, give rise to terms of comparable magnitudes in the resulting response. Our explicit theoretical expressions will help identify unique signatures of NLSMs in contemporary experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent cosmological observations have revealed growing tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, including indications of isotropic cosmic birefringence and deviations from $w = -1$ in the dark energy equation of state, as suggested by DESI and supernova measurements. In this paper, we point out that such deviations can arise even from a subdominant energy density component. We then propose a unified framework based on a dynamical axion field that simultaneously accounts for both anomalies, providing a simple and natural extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In our scenario, the axion field with $2H_0\lesssim m\lesssim 6H_0$, where $H_0$ is the current Hubble constant, induces a nonzero rotation of the CMB polarization plane and modifies the present-day dark energy equation of state. This framework accommodates recent observational data with natural parameter choices, even for a string axion with a decay constant of order $10^{17}\,$GeV.</description>

Abstract: Quantum observables of generic many-body systems exhibit a universal pattern of growth in the Krylov space of operators. This pattern becomes particularly manifest in the Lanczos basis, where the evolution superoperator assumes the tridiagonal form. According to the universal operator growth hypothesis, the nonzero elements of the superoperator, known as Lanczos coefficients, grow asymptotically linearly. We introduce and explore broad families of Lanczos coefficients that are consistent with the universal operator growth and lead to the exactly solvable dynamics. Within these families, the subleading terms of asymptotic expansion of the Lanczos sequence can be controlled and fine-tuned to produce diverse dynamical patterns. For one of the families, the Krylov complexity is computed exactly.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on modulus stabilization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In braneworld scenarios with compact extra dimensions, the modulus field typically remains undetermined without an appropriate stabilization mechanism. A common approach introduces a bulk scalar field that generates an effective potential for the modulus with a stable minimum. In this work, we explore some novel aspects of such stabilization mechanisms. We study how the bulk scalar profile influences the stabilization procedure. Following the approach of Chacko et al. [1], we analyze several representative cases using methods of singular perturbation theory, and identify a consistent relationship between the structure of the bulk potential and the emergence of a stabilized modulus. We highlight specific classes of potentials where this correspondence is particularly transparent, and outline the general conditions that any bulk potential must satisfy to support stabilization. In this context, we also examine a potential connection between geometric consistency conditions - specifically, the "brane world sum rules" - and the stabilized value of the modulus. In some scenarios where stabilization occurs, we find that these sum rules can offer additional constraints on the modulus, providing a complementary perspective on its determination. Taken together, these results offer a broader perspective on the mechanisms that govern modulus stabilization in higher-dimensional warped geometries.</description>

      <title>Strong CP Phase and Parity in the Hamiltonian Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solutions to the strong CP problem based on P or CP symmetries are typically framed using the Lagrangian formalism. In this work, we analyze the strong CP phase in QCD from the Hamiltonian perspective, focusing on the invariance of the Hamiltonian H under P (or a generalized parity operator $\mathcal{P}$). For $\mathcal{P}$ to be a physical symmetry, it must preserve the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_\theta$ associated with the $\theta$-vacuum (i.e., $\mathcal{P}: \mathcal{H}_\theta \rightarrow \mathcal{H}_\theta$). This requirement implies that the strong CP phase $\bar{\theta} = \theta + \arg \det M$ must vanish, i.e., $\theta$ must cancel the phase of the quark mass matrix $M$. Equivalently, we show that this condition follows from requiring that parity commute with the large gauge transformation operator of QCD.</description>

      <title>Stable synchronised states of coupled Tchebyscheff maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0110007</link>
      <description>arXiv:nlin/0110007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupled Tchebyscheff maps have recently been introduced to explain parameters in the standard model of particle physics, using the stochastic quantisation of Parisi and Wu. This paper studies dynamical properties of these maps, finding analytic expressions for a number of periodic states and determining their linear stability. Numerical evidence is given for nonlinear stability of these states, and also the presence of exponentially slow dynamics for some ranges of the parameter. These results indicate that a theory of particle physics based on coupled map lattices must specify strong physical arguments for any choice of initial conditions, and explain how stochastic quantisation is obtained in the many stable parameter regions.</description>
