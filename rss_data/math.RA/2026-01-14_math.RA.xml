      <title>Higher Separation Axioms for $X$-top Lattices Applications to Commutative (Semi)rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study several separation axioms for $X$-top-lattices (i.e. a lattice $L$ for which a given subset $X\subseteq L\backslash \{1\}$ admits a \emph{% Zariski-like topology}). Such spaces are $T_{0}$ and usually far away from being $T_{2}.$ We provide sufficient/necessary conditions for an $X$-top lattice so that $X$ is $T_{2},$ \emph{regular} ($T_{3}$), \emph{completely regula}r ($T_{3\frac{1}{2}}$), \emph{normal}, \emph{completely normal} or \emph{perfectly normal} ($T_{6}$). We apply our results mainly to the spectrum of prime (resp. maximal, minimal) ideals of a commutative (semi)ring. We illustrate our results with several examples/counterexamples.</description>

      <title>Quadratic codimension growth and minimal varieties of unitary algebras with superinvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an associative algebra with a superinvolution $*$ over a field of characteristic zero, and let $c_n^*(A)$, $n = 1, 2, \ldots$, denote its sequence of $*$-codimensions. It is well known that this sequence is either polynomially bounded or grows exponentially. In the polynomial case, a central problem in PI-theory is the classification of varieties ${V}$ for which $c_n^*({V}) \approx \alpha n^k$ for a given $k$. One of the main objectives of this paper is to classify minimal varieties of unitary algebras endowed with a superinvolution that exhibit quadratic codimension growth. We obtain a structural characterization, up to PI-equivalence, of all unitary algebras with quadratic codimension growth. As a consequence, we show that any unitary variety of quadratic codimension growth is generated by a direct sum of algebras generating minimal varieties.</description>

      <title>Para-differential Rota-Baxter algebras and their free objects by Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The algebraic formulation of the derivation and integration related by the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FFTC) gives rise to the notion of differential Rota-Baxter algebra. The notion has a remarkable list of categorical properties, in terms of the existence of (co)extensions of differential and Rota-Baxter operators, of the lifting of monads and comonads, and of mixed distributive laws. Conversely, using these properties as axioms leads to a class of algebraic structures called para-differential Rota-Baxter algebras.
  This paper carries out a systematic study of para-differential Rota-Baxter algebras. After their basic properties and examples from Hurwitz series and difference algebras, a Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases theory is established for para-differential Rota-Baxter algebras. Then an explicit construction of free para-differential Rota-Baxter algebras is obtained.</description>

      <title>Rota-Baxter operators of nilpotent evolution algebras with maximal nilindex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nilpotent evolution algebras of maximal nilindex admit a natural basis in which the structure matrix is strictly upper triangular. In this paper we classify Rota{Baxter operators of weights zero and one on such algebras. We prove that every Rota{Baxter operator is upper triangular with respect to a natural basis. For weight zero, a strong rigidity phenomenon occurs: the operators are diagonal up to possible perturbations supported in the last basis vector. For weight one, a richer structure appears, including both triangular and non-triangular families, with the diagonal entries governed by a rational recurrence relation. Our results provide a complete description of Rota{Baxter operators on nilpotent evolution algebras of maximal nilindex.</description>

      <title>On the structure and representations of quantum graph algebras at roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the specializations $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}^\epsilon$ at roots of unity $\epsilon$ of odd order of the graph algebras, associated to a simply-connected complex semi-simple algebraic group $G$ and a compact oriented surface $\Sigma_{g,n}^{\circ}$ with genus $g$, $n$ punctures, and one boundary component. We prove that the central localizations of $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}^\epsilon$ and of its subalgebra $\mathcal{L}_{g,n}^{u_\epsilon}$ of invariant elements under the coadjoint action of a small quantum group, are central simple algebras of PI degrees that we compute. Also, we describe their centers, and show they are integrally closed rings.</description>

      <title>Cross-Dimensional Mathematics: A Foundation For STP/STA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12920v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new mathematical structure, called the cross-dimensional mathematics (CDM), is proposed. The CDM considered in this paper consists of three parts: hyper algebra, hyper geometry, and hyper Lie group/Lie algebra. Hyper algebra proposes some new algebraic structures such as hyper group, hyper ring, and hyper module over matrices and vectors with mixed dimensions (MVMDs). They have sets of classical groups, rings, and modules as their components and cross-dimensional connections among their components. Their basic properties are investigated. Hyper geometry starts from mixed dimensional Euclidian space, and hyper vector space. Then the hyper topological vector space, hyper inner product space, and hyper manifold are constructed. They have a joined cross-dimensional geometric structure. Finally, hyper metric space, topological hyper group and hyper Lie algebra are built gradually, and finally, the corresponding hyper Lie group is introduced. All these concepts are built over MVMDs, and to reach our purpose in addition to existing semi-tensor products (STPs) and semi-tensor additions (STAs), a couple of most general STP and STA are introduced. Some existing structures/results about STPs/STAs have also been resumed and integrated into this CDM.</description>

      <title>The locally complexified-gentle algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We call an $\mathbb{R}$-algebra locally complexified-gentle if it becomes a locally gentle $\mathbb{C}$-algebra up to Morita equivalence after complexification. We use modulated quivers to introduce two types of locally complexified-gentle algebras and show that they are Morita equivalent to some semilinear clannish algebras.</description>
