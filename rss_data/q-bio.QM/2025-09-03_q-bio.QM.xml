      <description>arXiv:2509.00123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in microbial ecology is determining whether bacteria compete or cooperate in different environmental conditions. With recent advances in genome-scale metabolic models, we are now capable of simulating interactions between thousands of pairs of bacteria in thousands of different environmental settings at a scale infeasible experimentally. These approaches can generate tremendous amounts of data that can be exploited by state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to uncover the mechanisms driving interactions. Here, we present Friend or Foe, a compendium of 64 tabular environmental datasets, consisting of more than 26M shared environments for more than 10K pairs of bacteria sampled from two of the largest collections of metabolic models. The Friend or Foe datasets are curated for a wide range of machine learning tasks -- supervised, unsupervised, and generative -- to address specific questions underlying bacterial interactions. We benchmarked a selection of the most recent models for each of these tasks and our results indicate that machine learning can be successful in this application to microbial ecology. Going beyond, analyses of the Friend or Foe compendium can shed light on the predictability of bacterial interactions and highlight novel research directions into how bacteria infer and navigate their relationships.</description>

      <title>Enabling Down Syndrome Research through a Knowledge Graph-Driven Analytical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trisomy 21 results in Down syndrome, a multifaceted genetic disorder with diverse clinical phenotypes, including heart defects, immune dysfunction, neurodevelopmental differences, and early-onset dementia risk. Heterogeneity and fragmented data across studies challenge comprehensive research and translational discovery. The NIH INCLUDE (INvestigation of Co-occurring conditions across the Lifespan to Understand Down syndromE) initiative has assembled harmonized participant-level datasets, yet realizing their potential requires integrative analytical frameworks. We developed a knowledge graph-driven platform transforming nine INCLUDE studies, comprising 7,148 participants, 456 conditions, 501 phenotypes, and over 37,000 biospecimens, into a unified semantic infrastructure. Cross-resource enrichment with Monarch Initiative data expands coverage to 4,281 genes and 7,077 variants. The resulting knowledge graph contains over 1.6 million semantic associations, enabling AI-ready analysis with graph embeddings and path-based reasoning for hypothesis generation. Researchers can query the graph via SPARQL or natural language interfaces. This framework converts static data repositories into dynamic discovery environments, supporting cross-study pattern recognition, predictive modeling, and systematic exploration of genotype-phenotype relationships in Down syndrome.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Analysis of Taxis and Kinesis Properties of Colonial Protozoa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protozoan colonies undergo stimulus driven motion for purposes such as nutrient acquisition. Colonial response to a stimulus is mediated through a mechanical aggregation of the response properties of members of the colony. We develop and apply asymptotic analysis to a stochastic model for the integration of two classes of stimulus responses of the constituent cells -- taxis and kinesis. We investigate in particular the maintenance of effectiveness of taxis and kinesis in the transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms, using experimental observations of chemotaxis and aerotaxis of protozoa as a reference. Our taxis model based on a steering response of individual cells actually leads to a counterproductive drift of the colony down the stimulus gradient, together with a constructive drift up the gradient which is proportional to a measure of asymmetry of the flagellar placement. The strength of taxis drift up the stimulus gradient decreases with colony size while the counterproductive term does not, indicating a failure for colonial taxis based on a steering response of individual cells. Under a kinesis response of the cellular flagellar motion, enhancing the noise as the cell is facing away from the stimulus gradient, the colony does drift up the gradient with a speed independent of colony size, even under a completely symmetric placement of flagella.</description>

      <title>Raman Spectroscopy for the Early Detection of Huanglongbing and Citrus Canker in Plants: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Citrus crops are of immense economic and agricultural importance worldwide, but are highly vulnerable to destructive diseases such as Huanglongbing (citrus greening) and citrus canker. These diseases often remain asymptomatic in early stages, making timely diagnosis difficult and resulting in substantial yield and quality losses. Rapid, non-invasive, and accurate early detection methods are therefore essential for effective disease management and sustainable citrus production. Raman spectroscopy, with its molecular specificity, non-destructive nature, and minimal sample preparation requirements, has emerged as a promising diagnostic technology for this purpose. This review outlines recent advances in applying Raman spectroscopy for the early detection of Huanglongbing and citrus canker, with a focus on spectral biomarkers that reflect pathogen-induced physiological and biochemical alterations in citrus tissues. Comparative insights are provided between portable, in-field Raman devices and conventional laboratory-based systems, highlighting diagnostic accuracy, operational feasibility, and deployment potential. The integration of chemometric and machine learning techniques for enhanced classification and automated disease recognition is examined. By consolidating current research, this review underscores the potential of Raman spectroscopy as a field-deployable solution for precision agriculture. It discusses future challenges and opportunities for the large-scale adoption of this technology in citrus orchard monitoring.</description>

      <title>Optical Spectroscopic Imaging for Early Detection of Salinity Stress in Plants: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Salinity stress poses a significant challenge to global agriculture, necessitating efficient and scalable approaches for early detection and management. This review examines advanced optical spectroscopic imaging techniques, including fluorescence imaging, hyperspectral imaging, and thermal imaging, for their ability to detect physiological and biochemical responses in plants subjected to saline conditions. By focusing exclusively on imaging-based optical methods and excluding traditional spectroscopic techniques, the review emphasises non-invasive tools capable of delivering high sensitivity and specificity. These technologies enable real-time, high-throughput analysis, making them particularly well-suited for large-scale plant screening and breeding programs targeting salt tolerance. The integration of ground-based optical systems with aerial platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites significantly expands spatial and temporal monitoring capabilities.</description>

      <title>Exploring accuracy and uncertainty quantification in physics-informed neural networks for inferring microbial community dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have become a popular way to infer interpretable interaction parameters from noisy microbial time series, but practitioners face many tunable design choices (loss weights, regularisers, scaling, training schedules) with little guidance, and uncertainty is rarely quantified. We present a two-part study using a DeepXDE PINN for a six-species generalised Lotka-Volterra (gLV) model with a known step input and fixed, species-specific step amplitudes, under synthetic noise.
  Part A: Accuracy ablation. Starting from a broad-init baseline, we systematically vary constrained initialisation, parameter scaling, L2 regularisation with loss-weighting, split training with auxiliary observations, function constraints, adaptive collocation, hyperparameter tuning, and optimisers (Adam,L-BFGS). The largest gains come from simple parameter scaling. Hyperparameter tuning and adaptive collocation achieve competitive pairwise interaction errors.
  Part B: Uncertainty quantification. We benchmark deep ensembles and Monte Carlo (MC) dropout and report multi-replicate fits with different initial conditions. An N=10 deep ensemble yields the best single-trajectory growth-rate accuracy, while MC-dropout provides predictive bands. Overall, scaling plus either tuning or ensembles delivers robust interaction inference; our loss-weight sweep and additional regularisation settings offer practical defaults. We release code, metrics, and figures to serve as baselines for accuracy and uncertainty quantification in microbiome PINNs.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised large-scale kidney abnormality detection in drug safety assessment studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study, we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from 158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the costs and time associated with drug development.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference of yeast centromeres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chromatin folding and the spatial arrangement of chromosomes in the cell play a crucial role in DNA replication and genes expression. An improper chromatin folding could lead to malfunctions and, over time, diseases. For eukaryotes, centromeres are essential for proper chromosome segregation and folding. Despite extensive research using de novo sequencing of genomes and annotation analysis, centromere locations in yeasts remain difficult to infer and are still unknown in most species. Recently, genome-wide chromosome conformation capture coupled with next-generation sequencing (Hi-C) has become one of the leading methods to investigate chromosome structures. Some recent studies have used Hi-C data to give a point estimate of each centromere, but those approaches highly rely on a good pre-localization. Here, we present a novel approach that infers in a stochastic manner the locations of all centromeres in budding yeast based on both the experimental Hi-C map and simulated contact maps.</description>

      <title>Sleep Disorder Diagnosis Using EEG Signals and LSTM Deep Learning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diagnosing sleep disorders is an important focus in neuroscience and engineering, as these conditions involve issues such as insufficient sleep, frequent awakenings, and difficulty reaching deep sleep. Accurate detection based on brain signals, particularly electroencephalography (EEG), enables development of personalized treatments. While statistical pattern recognition was once the standard for analyzing EEG, deep learning has become the dominant approach. In this study, we analyzed a public database of 197 full night sleep recordings from participants aged 25-101 years. After preprocessing and feature extraction, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks achieved 93.3% accuracy in distinguishing healthy from disordered sleep, which improved to 95% with fusion techniques. The models were also computationally efficient, suggesting strong clinical potential for rapid and precise sleep disorder diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Why Pool When You Can Flow? Active Learning with GFlowNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scalability of pool-based active learning is limited by the computational cost of evaluating large unlabeled datasets, a challenge that is particularly acute in virtual screening for drug discovery. While active learning strategies such as Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) prioritize informative samples, it remains computationally intensive when scaled to libraries containing billions samples. In this work, we introduce BALD-GFlowNet, a generative active learning framework that circumvents this issue. Our method leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to directly sample objects in proportion to the BALD reward. By replacing traditional pool-based acquisition with generative sampling, BALD-GFlowNet achieves scalability that is independent of the size of the unlabeled pool. In our virtual screening experiment, we show that BALD-GFlowNet achieves a performance comparable to that of standard BALD baseline while generating more structurally diverse molecules, offering a promising direction for efficient and scalable molecular discovery.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trace-fossil record serves as a rich dataset to examine fossil behaviour, ecologic interactions at community level, and evolutionary trends in behaviour across geological time. Behavioural adaptations are often invoked in a variety of evolutionary hypotheses; however, few methods to quantitatively compare fossil behaviour exist. Movement paths, such as trails and trackways, are well-studied in extant-organism research where they are discretized and mathematically analyzed for behavioural strategies and trends. Here, we reference modern movement ecology research and present a methodology to discretize horizontal movement paths in the fossil record. We then demonstrate the utility of this methodology and the spatiotemporal data it collects via an analysis of the trilobite trace fossil Cruziana semiplicata and assess our results in light of three previous assertions about its recorded behaviour. Our analysis reveals the presence of three morphotypes, interpreted as three distinct behavioural variations, which persisted across multiple geographic localities and are interpreted to reflect changes in external conditions, internal states, or a combination of the two. Our research highlights the immense potential of this methodology to test behavioural hypotheses and provides an open-source groundwork for future research.</description>

      <title>Spatial trends in Ediacaran Bilaterian trails</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Savannah Hypothesis and the Cambrian Information Revolution invoke the development of spatially heterogeneous resource distribution during the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition as a key driver of infaunalization and sensory evolution of mobile bilaterians, respectively. However, difficulties in detecting historical resource distribution hinders the ability to tests these theories. If external conditions crucial to organism fitness (e.g. nutrient distribution, oxygen availability) became increasingly heterogeneous across the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition, then it follows that benthic organisms dependent on these conditions would demonstrate a similar increase in the spatial variability of their movement trajectories. To investigate Ediacaran resource distribution on the seafloor we examined the morphology of Helminthoidichnites tenuis, a simple unbranched horizontal bilaterian trail, from the Ediacara Member of Southern Australia for spatial trends. Our analysis reveals a as-yet undiscovered variability in the behaviour of the Helminthoidichnites tenuis tracemaker and confirmed heterogeneity in external conditions relevant to the tracemaker in the latest Ediacaran.</description>

      <title>Beyond Exhaustive Sampling: Efficient Rotational Matching via Ball Harmonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryo-ET allows to generate tomograms of biological samples in situ, capturing complex structures in their native context. Despite low signal-to-noise ratio in reconstructed volumes, the large number of copies of the same macromolecules makes it possible to retrieve high-resolution maps by averaging many aligned subtomograms. To keep up with technical advances in the imaging process and the resulting huge amounts of data available, there is a need for scalable, fast and robust procedures to align subtomograms. We propose a subtomogram alignment framework based on the ball harmonics expansion that combines frequency- and gradient-based optimization strategies to avoid exhaustive rotation sampling, enabling a speed-up of an order of magnitude compared to current approaches.</description>

      <title>Data-Dependent Smoothing for Protein Discovery with Walk-Jump Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models by learning to iteratively reverse the noising process. Their ability to generate high-quality samples has extended beyond high-dimensional image data to other complex domains such as proteins, where data distributions are typically sparse and unevenly spread. Importantly, the sparsity itself is uneven. Empirically, we observed that while a small fraction of samples lie in dense clusters, the majority occupy regions of varying sparsity across the data space. Existing approaches largely ignore this data-dependent variability. In this work, we introduce a Data-Dependent Smoothing Walk-Jump framework that employs kernel density estimation (KDE) as a preprocessing step to estimate the noise scale $\sigma$ for each data point, followed by training a score model with these data-dependent $\sigma$ values. By incorporating local data geometry into the denoising process, our method accounts for the heterogeneous distribution of protein data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields consistent improvements across multiple metrics, highlighting the importance of data-aware sigma prediction for generative modeling in sparse, high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Postprandial glucose collected through continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides critical information for assessing metabolic capacity and guiding dietary recommendations. Traditional approaches summarize these data into scalar measures, such as 2-hour AUC or peak glucose, potentially overlooking temporal dynamics. We propose analyzing entire CGM trajectories using multilevel functional data analysis (FDA), which accounts for the smooth, hierarchical nature of glucose responses. Applying these methods to AEGIS study participants without diabetes, we illustrate how FDA characterizes variability in postprandial responses and links dietary/patient characteristics to glucose dynamics. We further extend the r-square metric to hierarchical functional models to quantify explanatory power. Our results show that dietary effects vary across the 6-hour postprandial window-for example, fiber blunts responses after 90 minutes, while fats reduce early rises within 50 minutes. Moreover, metabolic responses differ between normoglycemic and prediabetic individuals. These findings demonstrate that functional approaches reveal temporal and stratified insights into postprandial glucose regulation that scalar methods cannot capture.</description>

      <title>A microsimulation model of behaviour change calibrated to reversal learning data</title>

Abstract: Behaviour change lies at the heart of many observable collective phenomena such as the transmission and control of infectious diseases, adoption of public health policies, and migration of animals to new habitats. Representing the process of individual behaviour change in computer simulations of these phenomena remains an open challenge. Often, computational models use phenomenological implementations with limited support from behavioural data. Without a strong connection to observable quantities, such models have limited utility for simulating observed and counterfactual scenarios of emergent phenomena because they cannot be validated or calibrated. Here, we present a simple stochastic microsimulation model of reversal learning that captures fundamental properties of individual behaviour change, namely, the capacity to learn based on accumulated reward signals, and the transient persistence of learned behaviour after rewards are removed or altered. The model has only two parameters, and we use approximate Bayesian computation to demonstrate that they are fully identifiable from empirical reversal learning time series data. Finally, we demonstrate how the model can be extended to account for the increased complexity of behavioural dynamics over longer time scales involving fluctuating stimuli. This work is a step towards the development and evaluation of fully identifiable individual-level behaviour change models that can function as validated submodels for complex simulations of collective behaviour change.</description>

      <title>BayesianFitForecast: A User-Friendly R Toolbox for Parameter Estimation and Forecasting with Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Mathematical models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are essential tools across various scientific disciplines, including biology, ecology, and healthcare informatics. They are used to simulate complex dynamic systems and inform decision-making. In this paper, we introduce BayesianFitForecast, an R toolbox specifically developed to streamline Bayesian parameter estimation and forecasting in ODE models, making it particularly relevant to health informatics and public health decision-making. The toolbox is available at https://github.com/gchowell/BayesianFitForecast/.
  Results: This toolbox enables automatic generation of Stan files, allowing users to configure models, define priors, and analyze results with minimal programming expertise. To demonstrate the versatility and robustness of BayesianFitForecast, we apply it to the analysis of the 1918 influenza pandemic in San Francisco, comparing Poisson and negative binomial error structures within the SEIR model. We also test it by fitting multiple time series of state variables using simulated data. BayesianFitForecast provides robust tools for evaluating model performance, including convergence diagnostics, posterior distributions, credible intervals, and performance metrics.
  Conclusion: By improving the accessibility of advanced Bayesian methods, this toolbox significantly broadens the application of Bayesian inference methods to dynamical systems critical for healthcare and epidemiological forecasting. A tutorial video demonstrating the toolbox's functionality is available at https://youtu.be/jnxMjz3V3n8.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Discovery of Digital Twins in Biomedical Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent technological advances have expanded the availability of high-throughput biological datasets, enabling the reliable design of digital twins of biomedical systems or patients. Such computational tools represent key reaction networks driving perturbation or drug response and can guide drug discovery and personalized therapeutics. Yet, their development still relies on laborious data integration by the human modeler, so that automated approaches are critically needed. The success of data-driven system discovery in Physics, rooted in clean datasets and well-defined governing laws, has fueled interest in applying similar techniques in Biology, which presents unique challenges. Here, we reviewed methodologies for automatically inferring digital twins from biological time series, which mostly involve symbolic or sparse regression. We evaluate algorithms according to eight biological and methodological challenges, associated to noisy/incomplete data, multiple conditions, prior knowledge integration, latent variables, high dimensionality, unobserved variable derivatives, candidate library design, and uncertainty quantification. Upon these criteria, sparse regression generally outperformed symbolic regression, particularly when using Bayesian frameworks. We further highlight the emerging role of deep learning and large language models, which enable innovative prior knowledge integration, though the reliability and consistency of such approaches must be improved. While no single method addresses all challenges, we argue that progress in learning digital twins will come from hybrid and modular frameworks combining chemical reaction network-based mechanistic grounding, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and the generative and knowledge integration capacities of deep learning. To support their development, we further propose a benchmarking framework to evaluate methods across all challenges.</description>

      <title>Quantifying structural uncertainty in chemical reaction network inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems in chemistry and biology are complex, and one often does not have comprehensive knowledge about the interactions involved. Chemical reaction network (CRN) inference aims to identify, from observing species concentrations over time, the unknown reactions between the species. Existing approaches largely focus on identifying a single, most likely CRN, without addressing uncertainty about the network structure. However, it is important to quantify structural uncertainty to have confidence in our inference and predictions. In this work, we do so by inferring an approximate posterior distribution over CRN structures. This is done by keeping a large set of suboptimal solutions found through sparse optimisation, in contrast to existing optimisation approaches which discard suboptimal solutions. We find that inducing reaction sparsity with nonconvex penalty functions results in more parsimonious CRNs compared to the popular lasso regularisation. In a real-data example where multiple CRNs have been previously suggested, our method simultaneously recovers reactions proposed from different literature. Our emphasis on network-level probabilities enables a novel, hierarchical representation of structural ambiguities in the space of CRNs. This readily translates into alternative reaction pathways suggested by the available data, thus guiding the efforts of future experimental design.</description>

      <title>Iterative Distillation for Reward-Guided Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models in Biomolecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of fine-tuning diffusion models for reward-guided generation in biomolecular design. While diffusion models have proven highly effective in modeling complex, high-dimensional data distributions, real-world applications often demand more than high-fidelity generation, requiring optimization with respect to potentially non-differentiable reward functions such as physics-based simulation or rewards based on scientific knowledge. Although RL methods have been explored to fine-tune diffusion models for such objectives, they often suffer from instability, low sample efficiency, and mode collapse due to their on-policy nature. In this work, we propose an iterative distillation-based fine-tuning framework that enables diffusion models to optimize for arbitrary reward functions. Our method casts the problem as policy distillation: it collects off-policy data during the roll-in phase, simulates reward-based soft-optimal policies during roll-out, and updates the model by minimizing the KL divergence between the simulated soft-optimal policy and the current model policy. Our off-policy formulation, combined with KL divergence minimization, enhances training stability and sample efficiency compared to existing RL-based methods. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and superior reward optimization of our approach across diverse tasks in protein, small molecule, and regulatory DNA design.</description>

      <title>Towards Comprehensive Cellular Characterisation of H&amp;E slides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cell detection, segmentation and classification are essential for analyzing tumor microenvironments (TME) on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) slides. Existing methods suffer from poor performance on understudied cell types (rare or not present in public datasets) and limited cross-domain generalization. To address these shortcomings, we introduce HistoPLUS, a state-of-the-art model for cell analysis, trained on a novel curated pan-cancer dataset of 108,722 nuclei covering 13 cell types. In external validation across 4 independent cohorts, HistoPLUS outperforms current state-of-the-art models in detection quality by 5.2% and overall F1 classification score by 23.7%, while using 5x fewer parameters. Notably, HistoPLUS unlocks the study of 7 understudied cell types and brings significant improvements on 8 of 13 cell types. Moreover, we show that HistoPLUS robustly transfers to two oncology indications unseen during training. To support broader TME biomarker research, we release the model weights and inference code at https://github.com/owkin/histoplus/.</description>

      <title>DrugReasoner: Interpretable Drug Approval Prediction with a Reasoning-augmented Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process, making early prediction of approval outcomes critical for optimizing research investments. While classical machine learning and deep learning methods have shown promise in drug approval prediction, their limited interpretability constraints their impact. Here, we present DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based large language model (LLM) built on the LLaMA architecture and fine-tuned with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to predict the likelihood of small-molecule approval. DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning against structurally similar approved and unapproved compounds, generating predictions alongside step-by-step rationales and confidence scores. DrugReasoner achieved robust performance with an AUC of 0.732 and an F1 score of 0.729 on the validation set and 0.725 and 0.718 on the test set, respectively. These results outperformed conventional baselines, including logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors and had competitive performance relative to XGBoost. On an external independent dataset, DrugReasoner outperformed both baseline and the recently developed ChemAP model, achieving an AUC of 0.728 and an F1-score of 0.774, while maintaining high precision and balanced sensitivity, demonstrating robustness in real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate that DrugReasoner not only delivers competitive predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency through its reasoning outputs, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug discovery. This study highlights the potential of reasoning-augmented LLMs as interpretable and effective tools for pharmaceutical decision-making.</description>
