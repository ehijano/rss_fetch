      <title>Categorified Spectral Sheaves and Homotopical Invariants for Noncommuting Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical spectral theory gives a complete description of a single normal operator, but it fails for noncommuting operators, where no canonical joint spectrum or simultaneous diagonalization exists. Existing approaches provide only partial solutions: joint spectra apply mainly to commuting families, noncommutative geometry emphasizes global invariants that obscure local structure, and topos-theoretic methods capture contextuality while losing higher coherence information. This paper proposes a geometric and higher-categorical reformulation of the spectral problem for noncommuting operators. Local classical spectra associated with commutative subalgebras are organized into a stack-valued object, called a spectral stack, which retains automorphism and unitary equivalence data between contexts. Noncommutativity is thereby interpreted as nontrivial descent data rather than a breakdown of spectral theory. Using homotopical and derived constructions, we define functorial invariants that measure obstructions to global spectral assembly and extend classical index-theoretic ideas. The resulting framework views noncommutative operator algebras as geometric objects equipped with a spectral atlas, providing a concise bridge between operator theory, homotopy theory, and higher geometry.</description>

      <title>Ricci flow as functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we attempt to propose a categorical framework for the Ricci flow, treating it as a sequence of functors connecting the stack of Riemannian metrics to the category of geometric decompositions via singular flow spacetimes. To rigorize the domain of the flow, we adapt the definition of differentiable stacks to the site of Banach manifolds. We demonstrate that the Ricci flow defines a stratification of this stack.</description>

      <title>Algebraic models for equivariant rational homotopy theory for discrete groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a framework which generalizes algebraic models of a homotopy theory of spaces to the genuine equivariant case for a discrete group. We explain how this applies to commutative differential graded algebra (cdga) models and complete differential graded Lie algebra models for rational spaces. We compare the cdga model to other model categories in the literature.</description>

      <title>A cartesian closed fibration of higher-order regular languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain how to construct in two different ways a cartesian closed fibration of higher-order regular languages in the sense of Salvati. In the first construction, we use fibrational techniques to derive the cartesian closed fibration from the various categories of regular languages of $\lambda$-terms associated to finite sets of ground states. In the second construction, we take advantage of the recent notion of profinite $\lambda$-calculus to define the cartesian closed fibration by a change-of-base from the fibration of clopen subsets over the category of Stone spaces, using an elegant idea coming from Hermida. We illustrate the expressive power of the cartesian closed fibration by generalizing the notion of Brzozowski derivative to higher-order regular languages, using an Isbell-like adjunction in the sense of Melli\`es and Zeilberger.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Phase Theory IV: Morphisms, Equivalences, and Categorical Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We complete the foundational architecture of Algebraic Phase Theory by developing a categorical and $2$-categorical framework for algebraic phases. Building on the structural notions introduced in Papers~I-III, we define phase morphisms, equivalence relations, and intrinsic invariants compatible with the canonical filtration and defect stratification.
  For finite, strongly admissible phases we establish strong rigidity theorems: phase morphisms are uniquely determined by their action on rigid cores, and under bounded defect, weak, strong, and Morita-type equivalence all coincide. In particular, finite strongly admissible phases admit no distinct models with the same filtered representation theory. We further show that structural boundaries are invariant under Morita-type equivalence and therefore constitute genuine categorical invariants.
  Algebraic phases, phase morphisms, and filtration-compatible natural transformations form a strict $2$-category in the strongly admissible regime. We also prove that completion defines a reflective localization of this category, with complete phases characterized as universal forced rigidifications.
  Together, these results elevate Algebraic Phase Theory from a collection of algebraic constructions to a categorical framework in which rigidity, equivalence collapse, boundary invariance, and completion arise as intrinsic consequences of phase interaction, finiteness, and admissibility.</description>

      <title>On the Cartesian closedness of [0,1]-Cat and some of its subcategories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe all left continuous triangular norms for which the category [0,1]-Cat of real-enriched categories and functors is cartesian closed. We furthermore show that the cartesian closedness of [0,1]-Cat is equivalent to the cartesian closedness of either (and thus all) of the following subcategories: the full subcategory of Cauchy complete [0,1]-categories; the subcategory of Yoneda complete [0,1]-categories and Yoneda continuous [0,1]-functors; the full subcategory of Smyth complete [0,1]-categories; and the full subcategory of finite [0,1]-categories.</description>

      <title>Limits over orbit categories of locally finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We correct an error in the paper [BLO3], and take the opportunity to examine in more detail the derived functors of inverse limits over orbit categories of (infinite) locally finite groups. The main results show how to reduce this in many cases to limits over orbit categories of finite groups, but we also look at generalizations of the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence for higher limits over orbit categories for an extension of locally finite groups.</description>
