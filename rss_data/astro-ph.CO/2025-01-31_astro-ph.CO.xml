      <title>Constraining the Effect of Baryonic Feedback on the Matter Power Spectrum with Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the age of large-scale galaxy and lensing surveys, such as DESI, Euclid, Roman and Rubin, we stand poised to usher in a transformative new phase of data-driven cosmology. To fully harness the capabilities of these surveys, it is critical to constrain the poorly understood influence of baryon feedback physics on the matter power spectrum. We investigate the use of a powerful and novel cosmological probe - fast radio bursts (FRBs) - to capture baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum, leveraging simulations from the CAMELS projects, including IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, and Astrid. We find that FRB statistics exhibit a strong correlation, independet of the subgrid model and cosmology, with quantities known to encapsulate baryonic impacts on the matter power spectrum, such as baryon spread and the halo baryon fraction. We propose an innovative method utilizing FRB observations to quantify the effects of feedback physics and enhance weak lensing measurements of $S_{8}$. We outline the necessary steps to prepare for the imminent detection of large FRB populations in the coming years, focusing on understanding the redshift evolution of FRB observables and mitigating the effects of cosmic variance.</description>

      <title>CIBER 4th flight fluctuation analysis: Pseudo-power spectrum formalism, improved source masking and validation on mocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise, unbiased measurements of extragalactic background anisotropies require careful treatment of systematic effects in fluctuation-based, broad-band intensity mapping measurements. In this paper we detail improvements in methodology for the Cosmic Infrared Background ExpeRiment (CIBER), concentrating on flat field errors and source masking errors. In order to bypass the use of field differences, which mitigate flat field errors but reduce sensitivity, we characterize and correct for the flat field on pseudo-power spectra, which includes both additive and multiplicative biases. To more effectively mask point sources at 1.1 $\mu$m and 1.8 $\mu$m, we develop a technique for predicting masking catalogs that utilizes optical and NIR photometry through random forest regression. This allows us to mask over two Vega magnitudes deeper than the completeness limits of 2MASS alone, with errors in the shot noise power remaining below $&lt;10\%$ at all masking depths considered. Through detailed simulations of CIBER observations, we validate our formalism and demonstrate unbiased recovery of the sky fluctuations on realistic mocks. We demonstrate that residual flat field errors comprise $&lt;20\%$ of the final CIBER power spectrum uncertainty with this methodology.</description>

      <title>CIBER 4th flight fluctuation analysis: Measurements of near-IR auto- and cross-power spectra on arcminute to sub-degree scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new anisotropy measurements in the near-infrared (NIR) for angular multipoles $300&lt;\ell&lt;10^5$ using imaging data at 1.1 $\mu$m and 1.8 $\mu$m from the fourth flight of the Cosmic Infrared Background ExpeRiment (CIBER). Using improved analysis methods and higher quality fourth flight data, we detect surface brightness fluctuations on scales $\ell&lt;2000$ with CIBER auto-power spectra at $\sim14\sigma$ and 18$\sigma$ for 1.1 and 1.8 $\mu$m, respectively, and at $\sim10\sigma$ in cross-power spectra. The CIBER measurements pass internal consistency tests and represent a $5-10\times$ improvement in power spectrum sensitivity on several-arcminute scales relative to that of existing studies. Through cross-correlations with tracers of diffuse galactic light (DGL), we determine that scattered DGL contributes $&lt;10\%$ to the observed fluctuation power at high confidence. On scales $\theta &gt; 5'$, the CIBER auto- and cross-power spectra exceed predictions for integrated galactic light (IGL) and integrated stellar light (ISL) by over an order of magnitude, and are inconsistent with our baseline IGL+ISL+DGL model at high significance. We cross-correlate two of the CIBER fields with 3.6 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m mosaics from the Spitzer Deep Wide-Field Survey and find similar evidence for departures from Poisson noise in Spitzer-internal power spectra and CIBER $\times$ Spitzer cross-power spectra. A multi-wavelength analysis indicates that the auto-power of the fluctuations at low-$\ell$ is bluer than the Poisson noise from IGL and ISL; however, for $1' &lt;\theta &lt; 10'$, the cross-correlation coefficient $r_{\ell}$ of nearly all band combinations decreases with increasing $\theta$, disfavoring astrophysical explanations that invoke a single correlated sky component.</description>

      <title>Testing the local void solution to the Hubble tension using baryon acoustic oscillation measurements over the last twenty years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A promising solution to the Hubble tension is a local void that is roughly 20% underdense out to 300 Mpc, as suggested by galaxy number counts in the near-infrared. Gravitationally driven outflows from this KBC void might inflate redshifts enough to solve the Hubble tension, a scenario explored in detail by Haslbauer et al. We obtain predictions for the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) observables in their best-fitting void models and a control model that assumes the homogeneous $Planck$ cosmology. We compare these models against our compilation of available BAO measurements from the past twenty years. We find that the quality and quantity of available measurements are best using the isotropically averaged distance $D_V$. Taking its ratio with the expected value in the control model yields good agreement with unity at high redshift, but a discrepancy appears that systematically grows with decreasing redshift. Assuming independent uncertainties, the 41 considered $D_V$ observations give a total $\chi^2$ of 70.5 for the control void-free model, while the void models give only $44.8 - 46.7$ depending on the density profile. This represents a reduction in overall tension from $3.0\sigma$ without a void to $1.0\sigma - 1.2\sigma$ in the void models. The $\chi^2$ differences are smaller when considering measurements of the angular BAO scale or its redshift depth, but the void-free model provides the worst fit in all cases. Overall, our results suggest that recent hints of BAO observables deviating from expectations in the homogeneous $Planck$ cosmology could indicate a local void, which was motivated by considerations unrelated to BAO data or the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Spatially-Correlated Random Fields: Extreme-Value Statistics and Clustering Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare events of large-scale spatially-correlated exponential random fields are studied. The influence of spatial correlations on clustering and non-sphericity is investigated. The size of the performed simulations permits to study beyond-$7.5$-sigma events ($1$ in $10^{13}$). As an application, this allows to resolve individual Hubble patches which fulfill the condition for primordial black hole formation. It is argued that their mass spectrum is drastically altered due to co-collapse of clustered overdensities as well as the mutual threshold-lowering through the latter. Furthermore, the corresponding non-sphericities imply possibly large changes in the initial black hole spin distribution.</description>

      <title>Mapping the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario to $f(T)$ modified gravity: Effects on structure growth rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of a rapidly sign-switching cosmological constant, interpreted as a mirror AdS-dS transition in the late universe and known as the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, has significantly improved the fit to observational data, offering a promising framework for alleviating major cosmological tensions such as the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. However, when considered within general relativity, this scenario does not predict any effects on the evolution of the matter density contrast beyond modifications to the background functions. In this work, we propose a new gravitational model in which the background dynamics predicted by the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM framework are mapped into $f(T)$ gravity, dubbed $f(T)-\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, rendering the models indistinguishable at the background level. However, in this new scenario, the sign-switching cosmological constant dynamics modify the evolution of linear matter perturbations through an effective gravitational constant, $G_{\rm eff}$. We investigate the evolution of the growth rate and derive new observational constraints for this scenario using RSD measurements. We also present new constraints in the standard $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM case, incorporating the latest Type Ia supernovae data samples available in the literature, along with BAO data from DESI. Our findings indicate that the new corrections expected at the linear perturbative level, as revealed through RSD samples, can provide significant evidence in favor of this new scenario. Additionally, this model may be an excellent candidate for resolving the current $S_8$ tension.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Baryon Density from the Effective Optical Depth of High-Redshift Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present constraints on the baryonic matter density parameter, $\Omega_b$, within the framework of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our analysis utilizes observational data on the effective optical depth from high-redshift quasars. To parameterize the photoionization rate $\Gamma_{-12}$, we employ a B\'{e}zier polynomial. Additionally, we approximate the Hubble parameter at high redshifts as $H(z)\approx 100h\Omega_m^{1/2} (1+z)^{3/2}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Confidence regions are obtained with $h=0.701\pm0.013$ and $\Omega_m = 0.315$, optimized by the Planck mission. The best-fit values are $\Omega_b =0.043^{+0.005}_{-0.006}$ and $\Omega_b = 0.045^{+0.004}_{-0.006}$, corresponding to an old data set and a new data set, respectively. And we test the non-parametric form of $\Gamma_{-12}$, obtaining $\Omega_b = 0.048^{+0.001}_{-0.003}$. These results are consistent with the findings of Planck at the 1 $\sigma$ confidence level. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of quasar datasets in constraining $\Omega_b$, eliminating the need for independent photoionization rate data. This approach provides detailed cosmic information about baryon density and the photoionization history of the intergalactic medium.</description>

      <title>On the increase in the concentration of primordial black holes in the halos of dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through numerical experiments, we have predicted that if dark matter (DM) contains even a small fraction, $f_0\sim10^{-4}$, of primordial black holes (PBHs), during the formation of the gravitationally bound halo of a dwarf galaxy, these PBHs will concentrate in a region with a radius of about 10 pc, so that their local fraction will exceed 1%. Unlike previous studies of PBH migration to the centers of galaxies, the numerical experiments conducted here take into account the early formation of a massive "dress" of DM around the PBHs and the non-stationarity of the halo during its formation. Applying our results to models of heating stellar clusters in the Eridanus II and Segue I galaxies due to dynamical friction between stars and PBHs allows us to impose constraints on the abundance of PBHs that are two orders of magnitude stricter than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Interpretability of deep-learning methods applied to large-scale structure surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning and convolutional neural networks in particular are powerful and promising tools for cosmological analysis of large-scale structure surveys. They are already providing similar performance to classical analysis methods using fixed summary statistics, are showing potential to break key degeneracies by better probe combination and will likely improve rapidly in the coming years as progress is made in the physical modelling through both software and hardware improvement. One key issue remains: unlike classical analysis, a convolutional neural network's decision process is hidden from the user as the network optimises millions of parameters with no direct physical meaning. This prevents a clear understanding of the potential limitations and biases of the analysis, making it hard to rely on as a main analysis method. In this work, we explore the behaviour of such a convolutional neural network through a novel method. Instead of trying to analyse a network a posteriori, i.e. after training has been completed, we study the impact on the constraining power of training the network and predicting parameters with degraded data where we removed part of the information. This allows us to gain an understanding of which parts and features of a large-scale structure survey are most important in the network's prediction process. We find that the network's prediction process relies on a mix of both Gaussian and non-Gaussian information, and seems to put an emphasis on structures whose scales are at the limit between linear and non-linear regimes.</description>

      <title>Quintessential Implications of the presence of AdS in the Dark Energy sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the implications of incorporating an Anti-de Sitter (AdS) vacua in the Dark Energy (DE) sector using the recent DESI BAO measurements in combination with Planck-2018 CMB, Pantheon-Plus(+SH0ES) supernovae and KiDS weak lensing data. We show that the presence of a {\it Negative Cosmological Constant} ($\Lambda &lt; 0$, nCC) together with an evolving part (modelled by the CPL parametrisation) in DE sector allows a {\it non-phantom} region for the DE in the constrained parameter space consistent with different observational data. This essentially solves the problem of {\it phantom} behaviour in the DE sector which is difficult to obtain through reasonable field theory. The implications nCC in the DE sector for different cosmological tensions are also studied. Our findings highlight the importance of the presence of AdS in the DE sector for theoretical model building, especially in the context of quantum gravity theories, e.g. string theory.</description>

      <title>Gaussian-process reconstructions and model building of quintom dark energy from latest cosmological observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we use the latest cosmological observations, including SNe, BAO, CC and RSD, to reconstruct the cosmological evolution via the Gaussian process. At the background level, we find consistency with the quintom dynamics for different data combinations and divide the characteristics of dark energy into three different categories, which are negative-energy dark energy, late-dominated dark energy and oscillating dark energy, respectively. Considering the effect of modified gravity on the growth of matter perturbations, the reconstruction results at the perturbative level show that we only need minor corrections to general relativity. Furthermore, we provide theoretical interpretation for the three different types of dynamical dark-energy behavior, in the framework of modified gravity, scalar fields, and dark-energy equation-of-state parametrizations. Finally, we show that all of these models can be unified in the framework of effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from metastable cosmic strings in the delayed scaling scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) such as NANOGrav, EPTA, PPTA, and CPTA suggest the presence of nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). While such signals could be explained by gravitational waves from a network of metastable cosmic strings (CSs), standard scenarios involving the Kibble-Zurek mechanism triggered by a thermal potential face significant challenges. Specifically, these scenarios predict a GWB spectrum inconsistent with the non-detection at higher frequencies by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) for CSs with relatively large string tension. It is also difficult to prevent the monopole forming phase transition just before the CS forming symmetry breaking, which spoils the CS network formation. In contrast, a delayed scaling scenario, where the CSs start to emit GWs at a later time due to the dilution during inflation, alleviates these issues. This scenario allows for a larger string tension while monopoles are sufficiently diluted such that the CS network safely forms. In this study, we clarify the spectrum of stochastic GWB from metastable CSs in the delayed scaling scenario, consistent with the PTA observations while satisfying the LVK constraints. Furthermore, we explore its potential signatures at frequencies accessible to other detectors such as LVK as well as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin or DECIGO and BBO. We also discuss the implications on inflation and underlying UV theories, such as the grand unified theories.</description>

      <title>Boosting galaxy clustering analyses with non-perturbative modelling of redshift-space distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Redshift-space distortions (RSD), caused by the peculiar velocities of galaxies, are a key modelling challenge in galaxy clustering analyses, limiting the scales from which cosmological information can be reliably extracted. Unlike dynamical or galaxy bias effects, RSD imprint features that are sensitive to non-linearities across all scales. Yet, no distinction between these effects is made by the state-of-the-art analytical approach - the effective field theory (EFT) - which applies the same perturbative expansion to each of them. This paper explores an alternative approach, where the non-perturbative nature of RSD is partially preserved, and compares its effectiveness against the EFT in analysing power spectrum and bispectrum multipoles from synthetic samples of luminous red galaxies, using the projected sensitivity of a Stage-IV galaxy survey. Our results demonstrate that this distinct treatment of RSD improves the robustness of model predictions for both statistics, extending the validity range of the EFT from approximately $0.2\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to $0.35\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for the one-loop power spectrum and from $0.1\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to $0.14\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for the tree-level bispectrum. This leads to a significant enhancement in the precision of cosmological parameter constraints, with uncertainties on the Hubble rate, matter density, and scalar amplitude of fluctuations reduced by $20$-$40\,\%$ for the power spectrum multipoles alone compared to the EFT, and by $25$-$50\,\%$ for joint analyses with the bispectrum. The RSD treatment proposed here may thus play a crucial role in maximising the scientific return of current and future galaxy surveys. To support this advancement, all models for the power spectrum and bispectrum used in this work are made available through an extended version of the Python package COMET.</description>

      <title>Topological Leptogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the standard lore, the baryon asymmetry of the present universe is attributed to the leptogenesis from the sterile right-handed neutrino with heavy Majorana mass decaying into the Standard Model's leptons at the very early universe -- called the Majorana fermion's leptogenesis; while the electroweak sphaleron causes baryogenesis at a later time. In this work, we propose a new mechanism, named topological leptogenesis, to explain the lepton asymmetry. Topological leptogenesis replaces some of the sterile neutrinos by introducing a new gapped topological order sector (whose low-energy exhibits topological quantum field theory with long-range entanglement) that can cancel the baryon minus lepton $({\bf B} - {\bf L})$ mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly of the Standard Model. Then the Beyond-the-Standard-Model dark matter consists of topological quantum matter, such that the gapped non-particle excitations of extended line and surface defect with fractionalization and anyon charges can decay into the Standard Model particles. In addition, gravitational leptogenesis can be regarded as an intermediate step (between Majorana particle leptogenesis and topological non-particle leptogenesis) to mediate such decaying processes from the highly entangled gapped topological order excitations.</description>

      <title>Significant increase in sensitive volume of a gravitational wave search upon including higher harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most gravitational wave searches to date have included only the quadrupole mode in their search templates. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating higher harmonics improves the search sensitive volume for detecting binary black hole mergers, challenging the conclusion of previous studies. Using the $\tt{IAS-HM}$ detection pipeline, and the simulated (injection) signals from the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) collaboration, we quantify the improvement in sensitivity due to the inclusion of higher harmonics. This improvement is significant for systems with higher mass ratios and larger total masses, with gains in sensitivity even exceeding $100\%$ at certain high masses. We also show that, due to using a marginalized detection statistic, the $\tt{IAS-HM}$ pipeline performs roughly as well as its quadrupole-mode-only counterpart even for equal mass-ratio mergers, and its sensitive volume is either better than or comparable to that of the individual LVK pipelines.</description>

      <title>Unifying Inflation, dark energy and dark matter with a scalar field and exotic fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a new approach to unify inflation and the late universe with dark energy and dark matter formulated in a model that includes a non-Riemannian metric independent measure and a scalar field with spontaneously broken scale symmetry. Here first of all inflation is possible, which is then followed by a reheating oscillating period and this leads to the formation of all kind of particles, including fermions, which as the universe expands can contribute to the dark energy and the to the dark matter of the universe. During the inflationary epoch, we find different constraints on the parameter space associated to the effective potential of the scalar field from the observational data. After reheating the scalar field retraces its trajectory in field space but now the scalar field potential can be drastically modified by the effect of the fermions. In this sense, the present dark energy with its very small value in comparison to the inflationary phase which can be adjusted by choosing appropriately the parameter space of couplings of the Riemannian and non Riemannian measures to the fermions.</description>

      <title>Deser-Woodard nonlocal gravity in the proper tetrad frame: traversable wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Deser-Woodard model of nonlocal gravity involving four auxiliary scalar fields, introduced to explain the standard cosmological background expansion history without fine-tuning issues. In particular, we propose a novel approach to simplify the complex field equations within the proper tetrad frame, thereby recasting the original system into a more tractable equivalent differential problem. We show that, by only assuming the form of the $tt$ metric component, it is possible to reconstruct the distortion function of the gravitational model through a step-by-step procedure involving the use of either analytical, perturbative, or numerical methods. We then outline a potential strategy for solving the vacuum field equations in the case of a static and spherically symmetric spacetime. Specifically, we applied our technique to find three traversable wormholes supported purely by gravity, discussing then their main geometric properties. The obtained results provide a possible pathway for determining new compact object solutions while offering a deeper understanding of nonlocal theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>A general upper bound on the light dark matter scattering rate in materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining an effective theory description of spin-1/2 dark matter (DM)-electron interactions in materials with linear response theory provides a powerful framework to model the scattering of DM, including in-medium effects, in detectors used for direct searches. Within this framework, we show that the rate of DM-induced electronic transitions in detector materials admits a theoretical upper bound under general assumptions on the underlying DM-electron coupling. In particular, our theoretical upper bound applies to models where DM couples to the electron density as well as the spin, paramagnetic and Rashba currents in materials, and arises from the Kramers-Kronig relations that constrain the analytic properties of the scattering rate. We evaluate our maximum rate formula numerically for Ar, Xe, Ge, and Si targets and find that Ge and Si detectors are closer to saturate this theoretical upper bound, but still far from saturation when DM couples to densities or currents which are different from the electron density. This motivates the exploration of a different class of materials to effectively probe such coupling forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the realization of a nonsingular bounce within the framework of Myrzakulov \( F(R,T) \) gravity. This modified gravitational theory uses a non-special connection that combines both curvature and torsion, giving rise to an effective sector that can easily satisfy the violation of the null energy condition. We suitably choose the functions that parametrize the connection in order to be able to produce simple and matter bounce scale factors at the background level. Finally, we examine the evolution of scalar perturbations through the bounce using the Mukhanov-Sasaki formalism, and we calculate the power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Magnetically-assisted vorticity production in decaying acoustic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study vorticity production in isothermal, subsonic, acoustic (nonvortical), decaying turbulence due to the presence of magnetic fields. Using three-dimensional numerical simulations, we always find that the resulting turbulent kinetic energy cascade follows the ordinary Kolmogorov phenomenology involving a constant spectral energy flux. For acoustic turbulence, the corresponding nondimensional prefactor is larger than the standard Kolmogorov constant due to an inefficiency in dissipating kinetic energy. We find that the Lorentz force can not only drive the direct production of vortical motions, but it can also facilitate the conversion of acoustic energy into vortical energy. This conversion is shown to be quadratic in the magnetic field strength and linear in the acoustic flow speed. By contrast, the direct production of vortical motions by the magnetic field is linear in the field strength. Our results suggest that magnetic fields play a crucial role in vorticity production in cosmological flows, particularly in scenarios where significant acoustic turbulence is prevalent. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the early universe, where magnetic fields may convert acoustic turbulence generated during cosmological phase transitions into vortical turbulence.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational Waves (GW) sourced by second-order primordial curvature fluctuations are among the favored models fitting the recent pulsar timing array (PTA) measurement of a stochastic GW background (SGWB). We study how spectral distortions (SDs) and anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can constrain such scalar fluctuations. Whereas COBE FIRAS data have no sufficient sensitivity to probe the PTA log-normal hypothesis, we show how future PIXIE-like experiments can detect the CMB SDs from the scalar-induced interpretation of the SGWB in PTA data. We finally show how the transformative synergy between PTA data and future CMB SD measurements is important for reconstructing primordial fluctuations at these small scales.</description>

Abstract: Despite the first detection of fast radio bursts (FRBs) being as recent as 2007, they have already been proven to be a fantastic tool as a unique cosmological probe. In this chapter, after a brief introduction to FRBs and how they are currently detected, we describe various cosmological questions and how FRB research has both aided previous studies and can continue to do so. Topics include placing constraints on cosmological parameters to understanding the distribution of baryons throughout the Universe. We conclude with some notes on the challenges to be overcome and how to best enable ongoing and future FRB-based studies of cosmology.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT discovery of GHz radio emission extending from Abell 3017 toward Abell 3016</title>

Abstract: Context: The clusters Abell 3017 and Abell 3016 are located within a large-scale filament. A prominent X-ray bridge has been detected connecting the two clusters and a potential galaxy group between them. Aims: The aim of this work is to investigate the existence of a radio bridge in the filament between Abell 3017 and Abell 3016, to explore other diffuse radio structures within this system, and to investigate the origins of these diffuse radio emission. Methods: We analyzed MeerKAT L-band data to study the morphology and spectra of the diffuse radio structures in Abell 3016-Abell 3017. X-ray imaging and spectral analysis were carried out with archival Chandra and XMM-Newton data. Additionally, correlations between radio ($I_R$) and X-ray surface brightness ($I_X$) were generated to explore the connections between thermal and non-thermal components in the diffuse radio emission. Results: We detected a faint radio bridge with an average surface brightness of $\sim 0.1~\mu\rm Jy~arcsec^{-2}$ at 1280 MHz using MeerKAT. It connects Abell 3017 with a potential galaxy group and extends towards Abell 3016, aligning with the X-ray bridge. A high X-ray temperature of $7.09 \pm 0.54$ keV detected in the bridge region suggests an interaction between Abell 3017 and the group. In Abell 3017, we identified two distinct components of diffuse radio emission: a radio mini-halo and an outer radio halo with a northern extension (N-extension hereafter). The radio surface brightness profile of Abell 3017 shows a steep inner component consistent with other mini-halos, and a faint outer component likely linked to an infalling subcluster. The $I_{\rm R}-I_{\rm X}$ diagram indicates superlinear and sublinear correlations for the mini-halo and N-extension, respectively.</description>

      <title>Massive black holes or stars first: the key is the residual cosmic electron fraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have unveiled that the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) were in place at z $\geq$ 10, a few hundred Myrs after the Big Bang. These discoveries are providing strong constraints on the seeding of BHs and the nature of the first objects in the Universe. Here, we study the impact of the freeze-out electron fractions ($f_e$) at the end of the epoch of cosmic recombination on the formation of the first structures in the Universe. At $f_e$ below the current fiducial cosmic values of $\rm \sim 10^{-4}$, the baryonic collapse is delayed due to the lack of molecular hydrogen cooling until the host halo masses are increased by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the standard case and reach the atomic cooling limit. This results in an enhanced enclosed gas mass by more than an order of magnitude and higher inflow rates of up to $0.1~M_{\odot}/{yr}$. Such conditions are conducive to the formation of massive seed BHs with $\sim 10^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$. Our results reveal a new pathway for the formation of massive BH seeds which may naturally arise from free</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmological principle asserting the large-scale uniformity of the Universe is a testable assumption of the standard cosmological model. We explore the constraints on anisotropic expansion provided by measuring directional variation in the Hubble constant, $H_0$, derived from differential zeropoint measurements of the Tully-Fisher distance estimator. We fit various models for directional variation in $H_0$ using the Tully-Fisher dataset from the all-sky Cosmicflows-4 catalog. The best-fit dipole variation has an amplitude of 0.063 $\pm$ 0.016 mag in the direction ($\ell,b$) = (142 $\pm$ 30$^{\circ}$, 52 $\pm$ 10$^{\circ}$). If this were due to anisotropic expansion it would imply a 3% variation in $H_0$, corresponding to $\Delta H_0$ = 2.10 $\pm$ 0.53 km/s/Mpc if $H_0$ = 70 km/s/Mpc, with a significance of 3.9$\sigma$. A model that includes this $H_0$ dipole is only weakly favored relative to a model with a constant $H_0$ and a bulk motion of the volume sampled by Cosmicflows-4 that is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. However, we show that with the expected Tully-Fisher data from the WALLABY and DESI surveys it should be possible to detect a 1% $H_0$ dipole anisotropy at 5.8$\sigma$ confidence and to distinguish it from the typical bulk flow predicted by $\Lambda$CDM over the volume of these surveys.</description>

      <title>Discrepancies Between JWST Observations and Simulations of Quenched Massive Galaxies at $z &gt; 3$: A Comparative Study With IllustrisTNG and ASTRID</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have uncovered an unexpectedly large population of massive quiescent galaxies at $z&gt;3$. Using the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG and ASTRID, we identify analogous galaxies and investigate their abundance, formation, quenching mechanisms, and post-quenching evolution for stellar masses $9.5 &lt; \log_{10}{(M_\star/{\rm M}_\odot)} &lt; 12$. We apply three different quenching definitions and find that both simulations significantly underestimate the comoving number density of quenched massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 3$ compared to JWST observations by up to $\sim 2$ dex. In both simulations, the high-$z$ quenched massive galaxies often host overmassive central black holes above the local $M_{BH}-M_\star$ relation, implying that AGN feedback is key in quenching galaxies in the early Universe. The typical quenching timescales for these galaxies are $\sim 200-600$ Myr. IllustrisTNG primarily employs AGN kinetic feedback, while ASTRID relies on AGN thermal feedback at $z &gt; 2.3$, which is less effective and has a longer quenching timescale. Although these simulations differ in many aspects, making a direct comparison challenging, our findings suggest the need for improved physical models of AGN feedback in galaxy formation simulations. At lower stellar masses, the quenched galaxies have denser local environments than the star-forming galaxies, suggesting that environmental quenching helps quench less massive galaxies. We also study the post-quenching evolution of the high-$z$ massive quiescent galaxies and find that many experience subsequent reactivation of star formation, evolving into primary progenitors of $z=0$ brightest cluster galaxies.</description>

Abstract: The NANOGrav 15-year data provides compelling evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background at nanohertz frequencies. The simplest model-independent approach to characterizing the frequency spectrum of this signal consists in a simple power-law fit involving two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index \gamma. In this paper, we consider the next logical step beyond this minimal spectral model, allowing for a running (i.e., logarithmic frequency dependence) of the spectral index, \gamma_run(f) = \gamma + \beta \ln(f/f_ref). We fit this running-power-law (RPL) model to the NANOGrav 15-year data and perform a Bayesian model comparison with the minimal constant-power-law (CPL) model, which results in a 95% credible interval for the parameter \beta consistent with no running, \beta \in [-0.80,2.96], and an inconclusive Bayes factor, B(RPL vs. CPL) = 0.69 +- 0.01. We thus conclude that, at present, the minimal CPL model still suffices to adequately describe the NANOGrav signal; however, future data sets may well lead to a measurement of nonzero \beta. Finally, we interpret the RPL model as a description of primordial GWs generated during cosmic inflation, which allows us to combine our results with upper limits from big-bang nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, and LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA.</description>

Abstract: It is a common belief that a theory of quantum gravity should ultimately cure curvature singularities which are inevitable within General Relativity, and plague for instance the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, usually considered as prototypes for primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates. We continue our study, initiated in a companion paper, of non-singular objects as PBHs, considering three regular non-tr (non-time-radial)-symmetric metrics, all of which are one-parameter extensions of the Schwarzschild space-time: the Simpson-Visser, Peltola-Kunstatter, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times, with the latter two motivated by loop quantum gravity. We study evaporation constraints on PBHs described by these regular metrics, deriving upper limits on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of DM in the form of PBHs. Compared to their Schwarzschild counterparts, these limits are weaker, and result in a larger asteroid mass window where all the DM can be in the form of PBHs, with the lower edge moving potentially more than an order of magnitude. Our work demonstrates as a proof-of-principle that quantum gravity-inspired space-times can simultaneously play an important role in the resolution of singularities and in the DM problem.</description>
