      <title>JointPPO: Diving Deeper into the Effectiveness of PPO in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has become the prevailing paradigm in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), it may not be suitable for scenarios in which agents can fully communicate and share observations with each other. Fully centralized methods, also know as Centralized Training with Centralized Execution (CTCE) methods, can fully utilize observations of all the agents by treating the entire system as a single agent. However, traditional CTCE methods suffer from scalability issues due to the exponential growth of the joint action space. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose JointPPO, a CTCE method that uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to directly optimize the joint policy of the multi-agent system. JointPPO decomposes the joint policy into conditional probabilities, transforming the decision-making process into a sequence generation task. A Transformer-based joint policy network is constructed, trained with a PPO loss tailored for the joint policy. JointPPO effectively handles a large joint action space and extends PPO to multi-agent setting with theoretical clarity and conciseness. Extensive experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) testbed demonstrate the superiority of JointPPO over the strong baselines. Ablation experiments and analyses are conducted to explores the factors influencing JointPPO's performance.</description>

      <title>mABC: multi-Agent Blockchain-Inspired Collaboration for root cause analysis in micro-services architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating complexity of micro-services architecture in cloud-native technologies poses significant challenges for maintaining system stability and efficiency. To conduct root cause analysis (RCA) and resolution of alert events, we propose a pioneering framework, multi-Agent Blockchain-inspired Collaboration for root cause analysis in micro-services architecture (mABC), to revolutionize the AI for IT operations (AIOps) domain, where multiple agents based on the powerful large language models (LLMs) perform blockchain-inspired voting to reach a final agreement following a standardized process for processing tasks and queries provided by Agent Workflow. Specifically, seven specialized agents derived from Agent Workflow each provide valuable insights towards root cause analysis based on their expertise and the intrinsic software knowledge of LLMs collaborating within a decentralized chain. To avoid potential instability issues in LLMs and fully leverage the transparent and egalitarian advantages inherent in a decentralized structure, mABC adopts a decision-making process inspired by blockchain governance principles while considering the contribution index and expertise index of each agent. Experimental results on the public benchmark AIOps challenge dataset and our created train-ticket dataset demonstrate superior performance in accurately identifying root causes and formulating effective solutions, compared to previous strong baselines. The ablation study further highlights the significance of each component within mABC, with Agent Workflow, multi-agent, and blockchain-inspired voting being crucial for achieving optimal performance. mABC offers a comprehensive automated root cause analysis and resolution in micro-services architecture and achieves a significant improvement in the AIOps domain compared to existing baselines</description>

      <title>RAGAR, Your Falsehood RADAR: RAG-Augmented Reasoning for Political Fact-Checking using Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The escalating challenge of misinformation, particularly in the context of political discourse, necessitates advanced solutions for fact-checking. We introduce innovative approaches to enhance the reliability and efficiency of multimodal fact-checking through the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG)- based advanced reasoning techniques. This work proposes two novel methodologies, Chain of RAG (CoRAG) and Tree of RAG (ToRAG). The approaches are designed to handle multimodal claims by reasoning the next questions that need to be answered based on previous evidence. Our approaches improve the accuracy of veracity predictions and the generation of explanations over the traditional fact-checking approach of sub-question generation with chain of thought veracity prediction. By employing multimodal LLMs adept at analyzing both text and images, this research advances the capability of automated systems in identifying and countering misinformation.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Synthetic Participatory Planning of Shared Automated Electric Mobility Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unleashing the synergies of rapidly evolving mobility technologies in a multi-stakeholder landscape presents unique challenges and opportunities for addressing urban transportation problems. This paper introduces a novel synthetic participatory method, critically leveraging large language models (LLMs) to create digital avatars representing diverse stakeholders to plan shared automated electric mobility systems (SAEMS). These calibratable agents collaboratively identify objectives, envision and evaluate SAEMS alternatives, and strategize implementation under risks and constraints. The results of a Montreal case study indicate that a structured and parameterized workflow provides outputs with high controllability and comprehensiveness on an SAEMS plan than generated using a single LLM-enabled expert agent. Consequently, the approach provides a promising avenue for cost-efficiently improving the inclusivity and interpretability of multi-objective transportation planning, suggesting a paradigm shift in how we envision and strategize for sustainable and equitable transportation systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Training beyond Zero-Sum with Correlated Equilibrium Meta-Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.09435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-player, constant-sum games are well studied in the literature, but there has been limited progress outside of this setting. We propose Joint Policy-Space Response Oracles (JPSRO), an algorithm for training agents in n-player, general-sum extensive form games, which provably converges to an equilibrium. We further suggest correlated equilibria (CE) as promising meta-solvers, and propose a novel solution concept Maximum Gini Correlated Equilibrium (MGCE), a principled and computationally efficient family of solutions for solving the correlated equilibrium selection problem. We conduct several experiments using CE meta-solvers for JPSRO and demonstrate convergence on n-player, general-sum games.</description>

      <title>Control-based Graph Embeddings with Data Augmentation for Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of unsupervised graph representation learning by harnessing the control properties of dynamical networks defined on graphs. Our approach introduces a novel framework for contrastive learning, a widely prevalent technique for unsupervised representation learning. A crucial step in contrastive learning is the creation of 'augmented' graphs from the input graphs. Though different from the original graphs, these augmented graphs retain the original graph's structural characteristics. Here, we propose a unique method for generating these augmented graphs by leveraging the control properties of networks. The core concept revolves around perturbing the original graph to create a new one while preserving the controllability properties specific to networks and graphs. Compared to the existing methods, we demonstrate that this innovative approach enhances the effectiveness of contrastive learning frameworks, leading to superior results regarding the accuracy of the classification tasks. The key innovation lies in our ability to decode the network structure using these control properties, opening new avenues for unsupervised graph representation learning.</description>
