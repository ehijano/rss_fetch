      <title>Tunable Nanostructuring for van der Waals Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) materials are becoming increasingly popular in scientific and industrial applications because of their unique mixture of record electronic, optical, and mechanical properties. However, nanostructuring of vdW materials is still in its infancy and strongly depends on the specific vdW crystal. As a result, the universal self-assembled technology of vdW materials nanostructuring opens vast technological prospects. This work demonstrates an express and universal synthesis method of vdW nanoparticles with well-defined geometry using femtosecond laser ablation and fragmentation. The disarming simplicity of the technique allows us to create nanoparticles from over 50 vdW precursor materials covering transition metal chalcogenides, MXenes, and other vdW materials. Obtained nanoparticles manifest perfectly defined crystalline structures and diverse shapes, from nanospheres to nanocubes and nanotetrahedrons. Thus, our work provides a new paradigm for vdW nanostructuring with a vast potential of tunability for size, shape, and materials specific to the particular application.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Ultrafast Spin-Valley Dynamics and Phonon-Mediated Charge Transfer in MoSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use helicity-resolved ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy to study spin-valley polarization dynamics in a vertically stacked MoSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ heterostructure. The experimental findings reveal details of interlayer charge transfer on ultrafast timescales, showing that the spin-valley polarized state of photoexcited carriers is conserved during the charge transfer and formation of interlayer excitons. Our results confirm that phonon scattering mediates the interlayer charge transfer process, while a high phonon population at elevated temperatures causes a significant decrease in spin-valley selective charge transfer. Moreover, the experimental findings demonstrate the possibility that interlayer excitons and their spin-valley polarization can be probed in the optical response of intralayer excitons. These findings pave the way for ultrafast detection, control, and manipulation of spin-valley polarized excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide-based 2D heterostructures.</description>

      <title>3D-architected gratings for polarization-sensitive, nature-inspired structural color</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural coloration, a color-generation mechanism often found in nature, arises from light-matter interactions such as diffraction, interference and scattering, with micro- and nanostructured elements. Herein, we systematically study anisotropic, 3D-architected grating structures with polarization-tunable optical properties, inspired by the vivid blue of Morpho butterfly wings. Using two-photon lithography, we fabricate multilayered gratings, varying parameters such as height (through scanning speed and laser power), periodicity, and number of layers. In transmission, significant color transitions from blue to brown were identified when varying structural parameters and incident light polarization conditions (azimuthal angle and ellipticity). Based on thin film diffraction efficiency theory in the Raman-Nath regime, optical characterization results are analytically explained, evaluating the impact of each parameter variation. Overall, these findings contribute to technological implementations of polarization-sensitive, 3D-architected gratings for structural color applications.</description>

      <title>Independent Optical Frequency Combs Powered 546 km Field Test of Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to its repeater-like rate-loss scaling, twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) has repeatedly exhibited in laboratory its superiority for secure communication over record fiber lengths. Field trials pose a new set of challenges however, which must be addressed before the technology's roll-out into real-world. Here, we verify in field the viability of using independent optical frequency combs -- installed at sites separated by a straight-line distance of 300~km -- to achieve a versatile TF-QKD setup that has no need for optical frequency dissemination and thus enables an open and network-friendly fiber configuration. Over 546 and 603 km symmetric links, we record a finite-size secure key rate (SKR) of 0.53~bit/s and an asymptotic SKR of 0.12 bit/s, respectively. Of practical importance, the setup is demonstrated to support 44~km fiber asymmetry in the 452 km link. Our work marks an important step towards incorporation of long-haul fiber links into large quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Hybrid dielectrophoretic-optical trap for microparticles in aqueous suspension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a set of microfabricated electrodes can be coupled to a commercial optical tweezers device, implementing a hybrid electro-optical trap with multiple functionalities to manipulate micro/nanoparticles in suspension. Our design allows us to simultaneously trap tens of particles in a single potential well generated in the low electric field region of the electrode arrangement, taking advantage of negative dielectrophoresis. Together with the optical tweezers, we show that the hybrid scheme allows enhanced manipulation capabilities, including controlled loading and accumulation in the dielectrophoretic trap from the optical tweezers, selectivity, and tracking of the individual trajectories of trapped particles.</description>

      <title>Low-Contrast BIC Metasurfaces with Quality Factors Exceeding 100,000</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces operating at quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs) can achieve exceptionally high radiative quality ($\textit{Q}$) factors by introducing small asymmetries into their unit cells. However, fabrication imperfections often impose major limitations on the experimentally observed $\textit{Q}$ factors. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate BIC metasurfaces with a record-high $\textit{Q}$ factor of 101,486 under normal excitation of light in the telecom wavelength range achieved by employing low-contrast silicon pairs. Our findings show that such ultrahigh-$\textit{Q}$ factors can be attained by leveraging both the high radiative $\textit{Q}$ factors of higher-order qBIC modes and reduced scattering losses in shallow-etched designs. Additionally, we demonstrate stable sub-picometer-level wavelength fluctuations in water, with a limit of detection of $10^{-5}$ for environmental refractive index changes. The proposed approach can be extended to BIC metasurfaces with many other configurations and operating wavelengths for ultrahigh-$\textit{Q}$ applications in both fundamental physics and advanced devices.</description>

      <title>Kapitza-Inspired Stabilization of Non-Foster Circuits via Time Modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With his formal analysis in 1951, the physicist Pyotr Kapitza demonstrated that an inverted pendulum with an externally vibrating base can be stable in its upper position, thus overcoming the force of gravity. Kapitza's work is an example that an originally unstable system can become stable after a minor perturbation of its properties or initial conditions is applied. Inspired by his ideas, we show how non-Foster circuits can be stabilized with the application of external \textit{electrical vibration}, i.e., time modulations. Non-Foster circuits are highly appreciated in the engineering community since their bandwidth characteristics are not limited by passive-circuits bounds. Unfortunately, non-Foster circuits are usually unstable and they must be stabilized prior to operation. Here, we focus on the study of non-Foster $L(t)C$ circuits with time-varying inductors and time-invariant negative capacitors. We find an intrinsic connection between Kapitza's inverted pendulum and non-Foster $L(t)C$ resonators. Moreover, we show how positive time-varying modulations of $L(t)&gt;0$ can overcome and stabilize non-Foster negative capacitances $C&lt;0$. These findings open up an alternative manner of stabilizing electric circuits with the use of time modulations, and lay the groundwork for application of, what we coin \textit{Vibrational Electromagnetics}, in more complex media.</description>

      <title>Isospectral reduction of the SSH3 lattice and its bulk-edge correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we propose an isospectral reduction (IR) approach for the mapping of a trimer Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH3) lattice into a simplified two-site model, whose coupling dynamics ingeniously results in a precise bulk-edge correspondence of the original lattice. The isospectrally-reduced model has inter-cell couplings with dynamic response to the eigenstate energy, allowing for the control of topological phase transition by energy. We relate the bulk property of the reduced model to the band topology of the SSH3 lattice, allowing for there distinct topological phases with different number of topological edge state pair. An acoustic SSH3 chain is fabricated for experimental demonstration. The said topological edge state pairs are measured. Our study takes a pivotal step toward the exploration of topology in multiple wave systems, opening up possibilities for advanced control of topological waves.</description>
