      <title>PriCE: Privacy-Preserving and Cost-Effective Scheduling for Parallelizing the Large Medical Image Processing Workflow over Hybrid Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Running deep neural networks for large medical images is a resource-hungry and time-consuming task with centralized computing. Outsourcing such medical image processing tasks to hybrid clouds has benefits, such as a significant reduction of execution time and monetary cost. However, due to privacy concerns, it is still challenging to process sensitive medical images over clouds, which would hinder their deployment in many real-world applications. To overcome this, we first formulate the overall optimization objectives of the privacy-preserving distributed system model, i.e., minimizing the amount of information about the private data learned by the adversaries throughout the process, reducing the maximum execution time and cost under the user budget constraint. We propose a novel privacy-preserving and cost-effective method called PriCE to solve this multi-objective optimization problem. We performed extensive simulation experiments for artifact detection tasks on medical images using an ensemble of five deep convolutional neural network inferences as the workflow task. Experimental results show that PriCE successfully splits a wide range of input gigapixel medical images with graph-coloring-based strategies, yielding desired output utility and lowering the privacy risk, makespan, and monetary cost under user's budget.</description>

      <title>Optimal market-neutral currency trading on the cryptocurrency platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research proposes a novel arbitrage approach with respect to multivariate pair trading called Optimal Trading Technique (OTT). We introduce the method to selectively form a "bucket" of fiat currencies anchored to cryptocurrency for simultaneously monitoring and exploiting trading opportunities. To handle the quantitative conflicts that arise when receiving multiple trading signals, a bi-objective convex optimization process is designed to cater to the investor's preference between profitability and risk tolerance. This process includes tunable parameters such as volatility punishment, action thresholds. During our experiments in the cryptocurrency market from 2020 to 2022 when the market was experiencing a vigorous bull-run immediately followed by a bear-run, the OTT realized an annualized profit of 15.49%. We further carried out the experiments in bull, bear, and full-cycle market conditions separately, and found that OTT is capable of achieving stable profit under various market conditions. Apart from the profitability side of the OTT, the arbitrage operation provides a new perspective of trading, which requires no external shorting and never hold intermediate cryptocurrency during the arbitrage period.</description>

      <title>PILOT: Equivariant diffusion for pocket conditioned de novo ligand generation with multi-objective guidance via importance sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of ligands that both are tailored to a given protein pocket and exhibit a range of desired chemical properties is a major challenge in structure-based drug design. Here, we propose an in-silico approach for the $\textit{de novo}$ generation of 3D ligand structures using the equivariant diffusion model PILOT, combining pocket conditioning with a large-scale pre-training and property guidance. Its multi-objective trajectory-based importance sampling strategy is designed to direct the model towards molecules that not only exhibit desired characteristics such as increased binding affinity for a given protein pocket but also maintains high synthetic accessibility. This ensures the practicality of sampled molecules, thus maximizing their potential for the drug discovery pipeline. PILOT significantly outperforms existing methods across various metrics on the common benchmark dataset CrossDocked2020. Moreover, we employ PILOT to generate novel ligands for unseen protein pockets from the Kinodata-3D dataset, which encompasses a substantial portion of the human kinome. The generated structures exhibit predicted $IC_{50}$ values indicative of potent biological activity, which highlights the potential of PILOT as a powerful tool for structure-based drug design.</description>

      <title>The Scattering Matrix-Based Characteristic Mode for Structure amidst Arbitrary Background: Theory, Benchmark and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for computing substructure characteristic modes. This method leverages electromagnetic scattering matrices and spherical wave expansion to directly decompose electromagnetic fields. Unlike conventional methods that rely on the impedance matrix generated by the method of moments (MoM), our technique simplifies the problem into a small-scale ordinary eigenvalue problem, improving numerical dynamics and computational efficiency. We have developed analytical substructure characteristic mode solutions for a scenario involving two spheres, which can serve as benchmarks for evaluating other numerical solvers. A key advantage of our method is its independence from specific MoM frameworks, allowing for the use of various numerical methods. This flexibility paves the way for substructure characteristic mode decomposition to become a universal frequency technique.</description>

      <title>Neural Persistence Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the dynamics in the topology of time-evolving point clouds, the prevalent spatiotemporal model for systems exhibiting collective behavior, such as swarms of insects and birds or particles in physics. In such systems, patterns emerge from (local) interactions among self-propelled entities. While several well-understood governing equations for motion and interaction exist, they are difficult to fit to data due to the often large number of entities and missing correspondences between the observation times, which may also not be equidistant. To evade such confounding factors, we investigate collective behavior from a \textit{topological perspective}, but instead of summarizing entire observation sequences (as in prior work), we propose learning a latent dynamical model from topological features \textit{per time point}. The latter is then used to formulate a downstream regression task to predict the parametrization of some a priori specified governing equation. We implement this idea based on a latent ODE learned from vectorized (static) persistence diagrams and show that this modeling choice is justified by a combination of recent stability results for persistent homology. Various (ablation) experiments not only demonstrate the relevance of each individual model component, but provide compelling empirical evidence that our proposed model -- \textit{neural persistence dynamics} -- substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art across a diverse set of parameter regression tasks.</description>

      <title>Finite elements for Mat\'ern-type random fields: Uncertainty in computational mechanics and design optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work highlights an approach for incorporating realistic uncertainties into scientific computing workflows based on finite elements, focusing on applications in computational mechanics and design optimization. We leverage Mat\'ern-type Gaussian random fields (GRFs) generated using the SPDE method to model aleatoric uncertainties, including environmental influences, variating material properties, and geometric ambiguities. Our focus lies on delivering practical GRF realizations that accurately capture imperfections and variations and understanding how they impact the predictions of computational models and the topology of optimized designs. We describe a numerical algorithm based on solving a generalized SPDE to sample GRFs on arbitrary meshed domains. The algorithm leverages established techniques and integrates seamlessly with the open-source finite element library MFEM and associated scientific computing workflows, like those found in industrial and national laboratory settings. Our solver scales efficiently for large-scale problems and supports various domain types, including surfaces and embedded manifolds. We showcase its versatility through biomechanics and topology optimization applications. The flexibility and efficiency of SPDE-based GRF generation empower us to run large-scale optimization problems on 2D and 3D domains, including finding optimized designs on embedded surfaces, and to generate topologies beyond the reach of conventional techniques. Moreover, these capabilities allow us to model geometric uncertainties of reconstructed submanifolds, such as the surfaces of cerebral aneurysms. In addition to offering benefits in these specific domains, the proposed techniques transcend specific applications and generalize to arbitrary forward and backward problems in uncertainty quantification involving finite elements.</description>

      <title>Data-Copilot: Bridging Billions of Data and Humans with Autonomous Workflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07209v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Industries such as finance, meteorology, and energy generate vast amounts of data daily. Efficiently managing, processing, and displaying this data requires specialized expertise and is often tedious and repetitive. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) to develop an automated workflow presents a highly promising solution. However, LLMs are not adept at handling complex numerical computations and table manipulations and are also constrained by a limited context budget. Based on this, we propose Data-Copilot, a data analysis agent that autonomously performs querying, processing, and visualization of massive data tailored to diverse human requests. The advancements are twofold: First, it is a code-centric agent that receives human requests and generates code as an intermediary to handle massive data, which is quite flexible for large-scale data processing tasks. Second, Data-Copilot involves a data exploration phase in advance, which explores how to design more universal and error-free interfaces for real-time response. Specifically, it actively explores data sources, discovers numerous common requests, and abstracts them into many universal interfaces for daily invocation. When deployed in real-time requests, Data-Copilot only needs to invoke these pre-designed interfaces, transforming raw data into visualized outputs (e.g., charts, tables) that best match the user's intent. Compared to generating code from scratch, invoking these pre-designed and compiler-validated interfaces can significantly reduce errors during real-time requests. Additionally, interface workflows are more efficient and offer greater interpretability than code. We open-sourced Data-Copilot with massive Chinese financial data, such as stocks, funds, and news, demonstrating promising application prospects.</description>

      <title>An unfitted high-order HDG method for two-fluid Stokes flow with exact NURBS geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A high-order, degree-adaptive hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method is presented for two-fluid incompressible Stokes flows, with boundaries and interfaces described using NURBS. The NURBS curves are embedded in a fixed Cartesian grid, yielding an unfitted HDG scheme capable of treating the exact geometry of the boundaries/interfaces, circumventing the need for fitted, high-order, curved meshes. The framework of the NURBS-enhanced finite element method (NEFEM) is employed for accurate quadrature along immersed NURBS and in elements cut by NURBS curves. A Nitsche's formulation is used to enforce Dirichlet conditions on embedded surfaces, yielding unknowns only on the mesh skeleton as in standard HDG, without introducing any additional degree of freedom on non-matching boundaries/interfaces. The resulting unfitted HDG-NEFEM method combines non-conforming meshes, exact NURBS geometry and high-order approximations to provide high-fidelity results on coarse meshes, independent of the geometric features of the domain. Numerical examples illustrate the optimal accuracy and robustness of the method, even in the presence of badly cut cells or faces, and its suitability to simulate microfluidic systems from CAD geometries.</description>

      <title>PDE Control Gym: A Benchmark for Data-Driven Boundary Control of Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, data-driven methods have surged in popularity, emerging as valuable tools for control theory. As such, neural network approximations of control feedback laws, system dynamics, and even Lyapunov functions have attracted growing attention. With the ascent of learning based control, the need for accurate, fast, and easy-to-use benchmarks has increased. In this work, we present the first learning-based environment for boundary control of PDEs. In our benchmark, we introduce three foundational PDE problems - a 1D transport PDE, a 1D reaction-diffusion PDE, and a 2D Navier-Stokes PDE - whose solvers are bundled in an user-friendly reinforcement learning gym. With this gym, we then present the first set of model-free, reinforcement learning algorithms for solving this series of benchmark problems, achieving stability, although at a higher cost compared to model-based PDE backstepping. With the set of benchmark environments and detailed examples, this work significantly lowers the barrier to entry for learning-based PDE control - a topic largely unexplored by the data-driven control community. The entire benchmark is available on Github along with detailed documentation and the presented reinforcement learning models are open sourced.</description>
