      <title>On boundedness of Hausdorff-type operators on Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new notion of a Hausdorff-type operator on function spaces over domains in Euclidean spaces is introduced, and a sufficient condition for the boundedness of this operator on Sobolev spaces is proved. It is shown that this condition cannot be weakened in general.</description>

      <title>Local Hardy spaces associated with ball quasi-Banach function spaces and their dual spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a ball quasi-Banach function space on $\mathbb R^{n}$ and $h_{X}(\mathbb R^{n})$ the local Hardy space associated with $X$. In this paper, under some reasonable assumptions on $X$, the infinite and finite atomic decompositions for the local Hardy space $h_{X}(\mathbb R^{n})$ are established directly, without relying on the relation between $H_{X}(\mathbb R^{n})$ and $h_{X}(\mathbb R^{n})$. Moreover, we apply the finite atomic decomposition to obtain the dual space of the local Hardy space $h_{X}(\mathbb R^{n})$. Especially, the above results can be applied to several specific ball quasi-Banach function spaces, demonstrating their wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Metric Spaces and Stochastic Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic embeddings of finite metric spaces into graph-theoretic trees have proven to be a vital tool for constructing approximation algorithms in theoretical computer science. In the present work, we build out some of the basic theory of stochastic embeddings in the infinite setting with an aim towards applications to Lipschitz free space theory. We prove that proper metric spaces stochastically embedding into $\mathbb{R}$-trees have Lipschitz free spaces isomorphic to $L^1$-spaces. We then undergo a systematic study of stochastic embeddability of Gromov hyperbolic metric spaces into $\mathbb{R}$-trees by way of stochastic embeddability of their boundaries into ultrametric spaces. The following are obtained as our main results: (1) Every snowflake of a compact, finite Nagata-dimensional metric space stochastically embeds into an ultrametric space and has Lipschitz free space isomorphic to $\ell^1$. (2) The Lipschitz free space over hyperbolic $n$-space is isomorphic to the Lipschitz free space over Euclidean $n$-space. (3) Every infinite, finitely generated hyperbolic group stochastically embeds into an $\mathbb{R}$-tree, has Lipschitz free space isomorphic to $\ell^1$, and admits a proper, uniformly Lipschitz affine action on $\ell^1$.</description>

      <title>Symmetric monoidal categories of conveniently-constructible Banach bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a continuously-normed Banach bundle $\mathcal{E}$ over a compact Hausdorff space $X$ whose space of sections is algebraically finitely-generated (f.g.) over $C(X)$ is locally trivial (and hence the section space is projective f.g over $C(X)$); this answers a question of I. Gogi{\'c}. As a preliminary we also provide sufficient conditions for a quotient bundle to be continuous phrased in terms of the Vietoris continuity of the unit-ball maps attached to the bundles. Related results include (a) the fact that the category of topologically f.g. continuous Banach bundles over $X$ form a symmetric monoidal category under the (fiber-wise-maximal) tensor product, (b) the full faithfulness of the global-section functor from topologically f.g. continuous bundles to $C(X)$-modules and (c) the consequent identification of the algebraically f.g. bundles as precisely the rigid objects in the aforementioned symmetric monoidal category.</description>

      <title>Coordinate systems in Banach spaces and lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using methods of descriptive set theory, in particular, the determinacy of infinite games of perfect information, we answer several questions from the literature regarding different notions of bases in Banach spaces and lattices. For the case of Banach lattices, our results follow from a general theorem stating that (under the assumption of projective determinacy), every order basis $(e_n)$ for a Banach lattice $X=[e_n]$ is also a $\sigma$-order basis for $X$, every $\sigma$-order basis for $X$ is a uniform basis for $X$, and every uniform basis is Schauder. Regarding Banach spaces, we address two problems concerning filter Schauder bases for Banach spaces, i.e., in which the norm convergence of partial sums is replaced by norm convergence along some appropriate filter on $\mathbb N$. We first provide an example of a Banach space admitting such a filter Schauder basis, but no ordinary Schauder basis. Secondly, we show that every filter Schauder basis with respect to an analytic filter is also a filter Schauder basis with respect to a Borel filter.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce matrix weighted Bourgain-Morrey spaces and obtain two sufficient conditions for precompact sets in matrix weighted Bourgain-Morrey spaces. We prove that the dyadic average operator is bounded on some matrix weighted Bourgain-Morrey spaces. With this result, we obtain the necessity for precompact sets in some matrix weighted Bourgain-Morrey spaces.</description>

      <title>P. Jones' interpolation theorem for noncommutative martingale Hardy spaces II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a semifinite von Neumann algebra equipped with an increasing filtration $(\mathcal{M}_n)_{n\geq 1}$ of (semifinite) von Neumann subalgebras of $\mathcal{M}$. For
  $1\leq p \leq\infty$, let $\mathcal{H}_p^c(\mathcal{M})$ denote the noncommutative column martingale Hardy space constructed from column square functions associated with the filtration $(\mathcal{M}_n)_{n\geq 1}$ and the index $p$. We prove the following real interpolation identity: if $0&lt;\theta&lt;1$ and $1/p=1-\theta$, then
  \[
  \big(\mathcal{H}_1^c(\mathcal{M}), \mathcal{H}_\infty^c(\mathcal{M})\big)_{\theta,p}=\mathcal{H}_p^c(\mathcal{M}).
  \]
  This is new even for classical martingale Hardy spaces as it is previously known only under the assumption that the filtration is regular. We also obtain analogous result for noncommutative column martingale Orlicz-Hardy spaces.</description>

      <title>A Representation Theoretic Approach to Toeplitz Quantization on Flag Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Toeplitz operators on generalized flag manifolds of compact Lie groups using a representation-theoretic point of view. We prove several basic properties of these Toeplitz operators, including an abstract formula for their matrix coefficients in terms of the decomposition of certain tensor product representations. We also show how to identify large commuting families of Toeplitz operators based on invariance of their symbols under certain subgroups. Finally, we realize the Berezin transform as a convolution with certain functions that form an approximate identity on the generalized flag manifold, which allows us to prove a Szeg\"o Limit Theorem using certain results due to Hirschman, Liang, and Wilson.</description>

      <title>Bundles of metric structures as left ultrafunctors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We pursue the study of Ultracategories initiated by Makkai and more recently Lurie by looking at properties of Ultracategories of complete metric structures, i.e. coming from continuous model theory, instead of ultracategories of models of first order theories. Our main result is that for any continuous theory $\mathbb{T}$, there is an equivalence between the category of left ultrafunctors from a compact Hausdorff space $X$ to the category of $\mathbb{T}$-models and a notion of bundle of $\mathbb{T}$-models over $X$. The notion of bundle of $\mathbb{T}$-models is new but recovers many classical notions like Bundle of Banach spaces, or (semi)-continuous field of $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras or Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Peripheral Poisson Boundary on Full Fock space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The operator space generated by peripheral eigenvectors of a unital normal completely positive map $P$ on a von Neumann algebra has a C*-algebra structure. This C*-algebra is known as the \textit{peripheral Poisson boundary} of $P$. For a separable Hilbert space $H$, consider the full fock space defined over $H$. In this paper, we study the peripheral Poisson boundary of the completely positive map, induced by left creation operators of the basis vectors of $H$, on $B(\mcal F(H))$ and explore its behavior with respect to the Poisson boundary.</description>

      <title>New characterization of weighted inequalities involving superposition of Hardy integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $1\leq p &lt;\infty$ and $0 &lt; q,r &lt; \infty$. We characterize the validity of the inequality for the composition of the Hardy operator, \begin{equation*} \bigg(\int_a^b \bigg(\int_a^x \bigg(\int_a^t f(s)ds \bigg)^q u(t) dt \bigg)^{\frac{r}{q}} w(x) dx \bigg)^{\frac{1}{r}} \leq C \bigg(\int_a^b f(x)^p v(x) dx \bigg)^{\frac{1}{p}} \end{equation*} for all non-negative measurable functions $f$ on $(a,b)$, $-\infty \leq a &lt; b \leq \infty$. We construct a more straightforward discretization method than those previously presented in the literature, and we provide some new scales of weight characterizations of this inequality in both discrete and continuous forms and we obtain previous characterizations as the special case of the parameter.</description>

      <title>Matrix Concentration Inequalities and Free Probability II. Two-sided Bounds and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first paper in this series introduced a new family of nonasymptotic matrix concentration inequalities that sharply capture the spectral properties of very general Gaussian (as well as non-Gaussian) random matrices in terms of an associated noncommutative model. These methods achieved matching upper and lower bounds for smooth spectral statistics, but only provided upper bounds for the spectral edges. Here we obtain matching lower bounds for the spectral edges, completing the theory initiated in the first paper. The resulting two-sided bounds enable the study of applications that require an exact determination of the spectral edges to leading order, which is fundamentally beyond the reach of classical matrix concentration inequalities. To illustrate their utility, we undertake a detailed study of phase transition phenomena for spectral outliers of nonhomogeneous random matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $C^2$ diffeomorphisms of a closed interval with only parabolic fixed points. We show that the maximal growth of the derivatives of the iterates of such a diffeomorphism is exactly quadratic provided it has a non quadratically tangency to the identity at a fixed point that is topologically repelling on one side. Moreover, in absence of such fixed points, the maximal growth of the derivatives of the iterates is subquadratic.</description>

Abstract: We prove the well-posedness of the differential equation $Au=f$ in the setting of a stratified group $\mathbb{G}$ when the considered second-order differential operator $A$ can be non-invariant and non-linear. Our approach follows the Campanato theory of nearness of operators, allowing one to treat equations with only bounded coefficients, without any regularity assumptions. Our analysis becomes explicit in the particular case of the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$ of any dimension and on the Euclidean case $\mathbb{R}^n$, where in the latter case our results also extend the known results by treating the unbounded domain setting.</description>

Abstract: The Hardy space $H^{p}$ of vector valued analytic functions in tube domains in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ and with values in Banach space are defined. Vector valued analytic functions in tube domains in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ with values in Hilbert space and which have vector valued tempered distributions as boundary value are proved to be in $H^{p}$ corresponding to Hilbert space if the boundary value is in $L^{p}$ with values in Hilbert space. A Poisson integral representation for such vector valued analytic functions is obtained.</description>

      <title>On a general concept of a Hausdorff-type operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A unified approach to the concept of a Hausdorff operator is proposed in such a way that a number of classical and new operators feet into the given definition. Conditions are given for the boundedness of the operators under consideration in $L^p$ and in the atomic Hardy space $H^1$, and their regularity property is investigated.
  Examples are considered. The author hopes that this approach will allow one to unify the study of a lot of extensions and analogs of the classical Hausdorff operator.</description>

      <title>Distributional Extension and Invertibility of the $k$-Plane Transform and Its Dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the distributional extension of the $k$-plane transform in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and of related operators. We parameterize the $k$-plane domain as the Cartesian product of the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal $k$-frames in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $\mathbb{R}^{d-k}$. This parameterization imposes an isotropy condition on the range of the $k$-plane transform which is analogous to the even condition on the range of the Radon transform. We use our distributional formalism to investigate the invertibility of the dual $k$-plane transform (the "backprojection" operator). We provide a systematic construction (via a completion process) to identify Banach spaces in which the backprojection operator is invertible and present some prototypical examples. These include the space of isotropic finite Radon measures and isotropic $L^p$-functions for $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$. Finally, we apply our results to study a new form of regularization for inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Volterra operator acting on Bergman spaces of Dirichlet series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since their introduction in 1997, the Hardy spaces of Dirichlet series have been broadly and deeply studied. The increasing interest sparked by these Banach spaces of Dirichlet series motivated the introduction of new such spaces, as the Bergman spaces of Dirichlet series $\mathcal{A}^p_{\mu}$ here considered, where $\mu$ is a probability measure on $(0,\infty)$. Similarly, recent lines of research have focused their attention on the study of some classical operators acting on these spaces, as it is the case of the Volterra operator $T_g$. In this work, we introduce a new family of Bloch spaces of Dirichlet series, the $\text{Bloch}_{\mu}$-spaces, and study some of its most essential properties. Using these spaces we are able to provide a sufficient condition for the Volterra operator $T_g$ to act boundedly on the Bergman spaces $\mathcal{A}^p_{\mu}$. We also establish a necessary condition for a specific choice of the probability measures $\mu$. Sufficient and necessary conditions for compactness are also proven. The membership in Schatten classes is studied as well. Eventually, a radicality result is established for Bloch spaces of Dirichlet series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of approximation of a continuous function $f$ defined on a compact metric space $X$ by elements from a sum of two algebras. We prove a de la Vall\'{e}e Poussin type theorem, which estimates the approximation error $E(f)$ from below. We also obtain a duality formula for the precise computation of $E(f)$.</description>

      <title>Essential positivity for Toeplitz operators on the Fock space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short note, we discuss essential positivity of Toeplitz operators on the Fock space, as motivated by a recent question of Per\"al\"a and Virtanen. We give a proper characterization of essential positivity in terms of limit operators. A conjectured characterization of essential positivity of Per\"al\"a and Virtanen is disproven when the assumption of radiality is dropped. Nevertheless, when the symbol of the Toeplitz operator is of vanishing mean oscillation, we show that the conjecture of Per\"al\"a and Virtanen holds true, even without radiality.</description>

      <title>The Sz\'asz inequality for matrix polynomials and functional calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sz\'asz inequality is a classical result providing a bound for polynomials with zeros in the upper half of the complex plane in terms of its low-order coefficients. Some generalisations of this result to polynomials in several variables were done by Borcea-Br\"and\'en and Knese. In this article the inequality is discussed in the context of matrix polynomials and matrix variables. As a byproduct we improve the scalar Sz\'asz inequality by relaxing the assumption of the location of zeros.</description>

      <title>Non-archimedean topological monoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09187v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say that a topological monoid $S$ is left non-archimedean (in short: l-NA) if the left action of $S$ on itself admits a proper $S$-compactification $\nu \colon S \hookrightarrow Y$ such that $Y$ is a Stone space. This provides a natural generalization of the well known concept of NA topological groups. The Stone and Pontryagin dualities play major role in achieving useful characterizations of NA monoids. We discuss universal NA monoids and show that many naturally defined topological monoids are NA. We show that many naturally defined topological monoids are NA and present universal NA monoids. Among others, we prove that the Polish monoid $C(2^{\omega},2^{\omega})$ is a universal separable metrizable l-NA monoid and the Polish monoid ${\mathbb N}^{\mathbb N}$ is universal for separable metrizable r-NA monoids.</description>

      <title>Existence and nonexistence of minimizers for classical capillarity problems in presence of nonlocal repulsion and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate, under a volume constraint and among sets contained in a Euclidean half-space, the minimization problem of an energy functional given by the sum of a capillarity perimeter, a nonlocal repulsive term and a gravitational potential energy. The capillarity perimeter assigns a constant weight to the portion of the boundary touching the boundary of the half-space. The nonlocal term is represented by a double integral of a positive kernel $g$, while the gravitational term is represented by the integral of a positive potential $G$.
  We first establish existence of volume-constrained minimizers in the small mass regime, together with several qualitative properties of minimizers. The existence result holds even for rather general choices of kernels in the nonlocal term, including attractive-repulsive ones. When the nonlocal kernel $g(x)=1/|x|^\beta$ with $\beta \in (0,2]$, we also obtain nonexistence of volume constrained minimizers in the large mass regime. Finally, we prove a generalized existence result of minimizers holding for all masses, meaning that the infimum of the problem is realized by a finite disjoint union of sets thought located at "infinite distance" one from the other.
  These results stem from an application of quantitative isoperimetric inequalities for the capillarity problem in a half-space.</description>
