      <title>Premature Ignition: Why the Single-Degenerate Channel Leads to Type Iax and Not Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are pivotal for the origins of the elements, the understanding of galactic chemical evolution, and serve as crucial cosmological distance indicators, yet their progenitor systems remain a central enigma in astrophysics. While both the growth of white dwarfs to near-Chandrasekhar mass and their explosion (the single-degenerate; SD) and mergers of two WDs leading to explosions (double-degenerate; DD) scenarios have been proposed, neither explains the observed diversity of thermonuclear transients and their properties, including the fainter Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax). Here we show, through comprehensive three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, that as accreting WDs grow towards the Chandrasekhar mass (the SD channel), premature carbon ignition at sub-Chandrasekhar densities can trigger partial deflagrations that eject substantial mass in low-energy Iax outbursts. Such a process effectively serves as a self-limiting feedback loop, which stalls further mass growth. It naturally explains why the SD channel is precluded from producing standard, normal SNe Ia, and instead predominantly yields SNe Iax. Our findings significantly reframe the SD versus DD debate, with important implications for supernova rates, galactic chemical enrichment, and cosmological measurements.</description>

      <title>Bright Dots and Coronal Plume Formation in Sunspot Penumbra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal plumes are narrow, collimated structures that are primarily viewed above the solar poles and in coronal holes in the extreme ultraviolet, but also in sunspots. Open questions remain about plume formation, including the role of small-scale transients and whether plumes embedded in different magnetic field configurations have similar formation mechanisms. We report on coordinated Solar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI), Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, and Solar Dynamics Observatory observations of the formation of a plume in sunspot penumbra in 2022 March. During this observation, Solar Orbiter was positioned near the Earth-Sun line and EUI observed at a 5 s cadence with a spatial scale of 185 km pixel$^{-1}$ in the solar corona. We observe fine-scale dots at various locations in the sunspot, but the brightest and highest density of dots is at the plume base. Space-time maps along the plume axis show parabolic and V-shaped patterns, and we conclude that some of these dots are possible signatures of magneto-acoustic shocks. Compared to other radial cuts around the sunspot, along the plume shows the longest periods (~7 minutes) and the most distinct tracks. Bright dots at the plume base are mostly circular and do not show elongations from a fixed origin, in contrast to jetlets and previously reported penumbral dots. We do not find high-speed, repeated downflows along the plume, and the plume appears to brighten coherently along its length. Our analysis suggests that jetlets and downflows are not a necessary component of this plume's formation, and that mechanisms for plume formation could be dependent on magnetic topology and the chromospheric wave field.</description>

      <title>A framework for modeling the evolution of young stellar objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring properties of young stellar objects (YSOs) is necessary for probing the pre-main-sequence evolution of stars. As YSOs exhibit complex geometry, measurement generally entails comparing observed radiation to template populations of radiative-transfer model YSO spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Due to uncertainty on the precise mechanics of star formation, the properties inferred for YSOs using these models often depend strongly on the assumed accretion history. We develop a framework for predicting observable properties of YSOs that is agnostic to the underlying accretion history, enabling comparison between theories. This framework links a set of radiative-transfer SEDs with protostellar evolutionary tracks to create models of evolving YSOs. Unlike previous works, we directly relate evolution models to observables through theoretical physical parameters rather than through intermediate, observationally derived analogues. We make flux predictions for YSOs corresponding to stars with birth masses from 0.2 to 50 $M_\odot$ during their accretion phase following isothermal-sphere, turbulent-core, and competitive accretion histories, showing that these histories may be observationally distinguished by examining the 100-$\mu$m and 3-mm fluxes of a YSO. We discuss the impact of dust models and parameter ranges on the output of radiative transfer simulations through a comparison to another SED model grid. We quantify the degree of confusion between YSO Stages and Classes across a wide range of physical scenarios; for each, we calculate confusion matrices that enable inference of the number of objects of a given Stage from an observed population. Finally, we critically examine the physical significance of various literature Stage and Class definitions.</description>

      <title>Impact of 3D macro physics and nuclear physics on the p nuclei in O-C shell mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: O-C shell mergers in massive stars are a site for producing the p nuclei by the $\gamma$ process, but 1D stellar models rely on mixing length theory, which does not match the radial velocity profiles of 3D hydrodynamic simulations. We investigate how 3D macro physics informed mixing impacts the nucleosynthesis of p nuclei. We post-process the O-shell of the $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 15~\mathrm{M}_\odot$, $Z = 0.02$ model from the NuGrid stellar data set. Applying a downturn to velocities at the boundary and increasing velocities across the shell as obtained in previous results, we find non-linear, non-monotonic increase in p-nuclei production with a spread of 0.96 dex, and find that isotopic ratios can change. Reducing C-shell ingestion rates as found in 3D simulations suppresses production, with spreads of 1.22-1.84 dex across MLT and downturn scenarios. Applying dips to the diffusion profile to mimic quenching events also suppresses production, with a 0.51 dex spread. We analyze the impact of varying all photo-disintegration rates of unstable n-deficient isotopes from Se-Po by a factor of 10 up and down. The nuclear physics variations for the MLT and downturn cases have a spread of 0.56-0.78 dex. We also provide which reaction rates are correlated with the p nuclei, and find few correlations shared between mixing scenarios. Our results demonstrate that uncertainties in mixing arising from uncertain 3D macro physics are as significant as nuclear physics and are crucial for understanding p-nuclei production during O-C shell mergers quantitatively.</description>

      <title>The magnetic and spin-down properties of slowly rotating fully convective M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of the magnetism, winds and rotation of low-mass stars are all linked. One of the most common ways to probe the magnetic properties of low-mass stars is with the Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) technique. The magnetic properties of partially convective stars has been relatively well explored with the ZDI technique, but the same is not true of fully convective stars. In this work, we analyse a sample of stars that have been mapped with ZDI. Notably, this sample contains a number of slowly rotating fully convective M dwarfs whose magnetic fields were recently reconstructed with ZDI. We find that the dipolar, quadrupolar and octupolar field strengths of the slowly rotating fully convective stars do not follow the same Rossby number scaling in the unsaturated regime as partially convective stars. Based on these field strengths, we demonstrate that previous estimates of spin-down torques for slowly rotating fully convective stars could have been underestimated by an order of magnitude or more. Additionally, we also find that fully convective and partially convective stars fall into distinct sequences when comparing their poloidal and toroidal magnetic energies.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional anisotropic solar energetic particle events observed by Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events are critical for understanding particle acceleration and transport in the heliosphere. While most SEP events involve outward streaming particles along open magnetic field lines, bidirectional events characterized by simultaneous sunward and anti-sunward particle flows offer unique insights into magnetic field topology and the interplay of multiple acceleration sources. We aim to investigate the origin and transport of energetic particles in two rare bidirectional anisotropic SEP events observed by Solar Orbiter. Both events showed two clear velocity dispersion signatures with opposite particle anisotropies during their onset phase. The sunward streaming protons, characterized by delayed release time, harder spectral index, and higher intensities, may be attributed to coronal mass ejection-driven shock acceleration, while the promptly released anti-sunward streaming protons are likely linked to flare acceleration. Notably, in both cases, small-scale flux ropes were identified in situ during the time intervals corresponding to the bidirectional particle streaming. Path lengths derived for sunward and anti-sunward injections were substantially greater than nominal values of the Parker field lines, further supporting the role of the flux rope in shaping particle trajectories. These observations demonstrate that magnetic flux rope could significantly affect magnetic connectivity to the source region and SEP propagation in the inner heliosphere, while simultaneous velocity dispersion from two distinct particle sources allows for direct constraints on the topology of the flux rope. Our results highlight the value of combining particle anisotropy, release time, source spectra, and magnetic structure diagnostics to unravel SEP transport in complex transient magnetic structures, and also present new challenges for the current SEP transport model.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive analysis of CM Draconis: eclipse timing variations driven by either a third body or stellar magnetic activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CM Draconis system is a well-studied, double-lined spectroscopic binary that is totally eclipsing and exhibits strong magnetic activity. Nearly one million photometric measurements have been collected across multiple wavelengths over more than half a century. In addition to showing frequent flare activity and apsidal motion, CM Dra also hosts a distant white dwarf and has been proposed to harbor a Jupiter-sized circumbinary companion. At only 47 light-years from Earth, it remains one of the most observationally rich and dynamically intriguing low-mass binary systems. We present a comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the system using new ground-based observations and data from 19 sectors of the \textit{TESS} mission. We derive precise fundamental parameters for both components: $M_1 = 0.2307 \pm 0.0008\,M_\odot$, $M_2 = 0.2136 \pm 0.0008\,M_\odot$, $R_1 = 0.2638 \pm 0.0011\,R_\odot$, $R_2 = 0.2458 \pm 0.0010\,R_\odot$, $L_1 = 0.0060 \pm 0.0005\,L_\odot$, and $L_2 = 0.0050 \pm 0.0004\,L_\odot$. The derived distance ($14.4 \pm 0.6$ pc) is consistent with \textit{Gaia} DR3 measurements. Eclipse timing variations (ETVs) spanning over five decades were analyzed in detail. A long-period ($\sim$56 yr) modulation was identified, which may be attributed either to the light-time effect of a possible circumbinary companion or to magnetic activity cycles. While the Bayesian Information Criterion statistically favors the model involving a light-time effect from a planetary companion, stellar activity remains a viable alternative that cannot yet be ruled out. Our results demonstrate that CM Dra is a valuable test case for studying both stellar activity and the potential presence of circumbinary companions in multiple-star systems. Continued long-term monitoring will be essential to distinguish between these competing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Implications of modern mass-loss rates for massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars lose a significant fraction of their mass through stellar winds at various stages of their lives, including on the main sequence, during the red supergiant phase, and as evolved helium-rich Wolf--Rayet stars. In stellar population synthesis, uncertainty in the mass-loss rates in these evolutionary stages limits our understanding of the formation of black holes and merging compact binaries. In the last decade, the theoretical predictions, simulation, and direct observation of wind mass-loss rates in massive stars have improved significantly, typically leading to a reduction in the predicted mass-loss rates of massive stars. In this paper we explore the astrophysical implications of an updated treatment of winds in the COMPAS population synthesis code. There is a large amount of variation in predicted mass-loss rates for massive red supergiants; some of the prescriptions we implement predict that massive red supergiants are able to lose their hydrogen envelopes through winds alone (providing a possible solution to the so-called missing red supergiant problem), while others predict much lower mass-loss rates that would not strip the hydrogen envelope. We discuss the formation of the most massive stellar-mass black holes in the Galaxy, including the high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 and the newly discovered Gaia BH3. We find that formation rates of merging binary black holes are sensitive to the mass-loss rate prescriptions, while the formation rates of merging binary neutron stars and neutron-star black hole binaries are more robust to this uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Ancient, eclipsing, tidally-locked: A blue lurker progenitor in the population of extreme-velocity star candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many extreme velocity candidate stars have been found based on \textit{Gaia} astrometry, but need spectroscopic confirmation. We select late-type hypervelocity star (HVS) candidates from the \textit{Gaia} DR3 catalog with a $1\sigma$ lower limit of the tangential velocity of 800 km\,s$^{-1}$. J1903-0023, one of the brightest targets, stands out as high priority candidate for follow-up spectroscopy using the X-shooter instrument at ESO-VLT. We determine its atmospheric parameters and abundances utilizing synthetic spectral grids and a global $\chi^2-$minimization procedure, and its stellar parameters with the help of evolutionary tracks and the spectral energy distribution. The star shows variability in its light curve and follow-up spectroscopy confirms that the star is radial-velocity variable. The spectroscopic distance of J1903-0023 is lower than that based on the parallax, indicating that the star is not a hypervelocity binary star but bound to the Galaxy. The star turned out to be of spectral type F, very similar to the extreme-velocity star J0725-2351, which we analyse in the same way as the target. Apparently, both stars are very metal poor and old halo main-sequence (sdF) stars with masses slightly below the halo turn-off mass, and share the low metallicity ([Fe/H]=-2.3,-2.6) and strong alpha enhancement ([$\alpha$/Fe]$\sim0.44$). While J0725-2351 is non-rotating ($v\sin\,i&lt;3$\,km\,s$^{-1}$), J1903-0023 is a fast rotator ($v\sin i=42.3\pm2.0$ km\,s$^{-1}$). The Gaia, and ZTF light curves show an eclipse at a 1.179 day period, similar to the rotation period of J1903-0023. We therefore conclude that J1903-0023 is a high-velocity tidally-synchronised binary most likely with a metal-poor M dwarf companion.</description>

      <title>An extremely low mass ratio contact binary NW Aps with a potential compact companion star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photometric solutions of NW Aps reveal that it is a low mass ratio ($q = 0.086$) contact binary system. Investigation of orbital period shows that its orbital period is increasing continuously at a rate of $dP/dt=+1.117(\pm0.005)\times{10^{-6}}day\cdot year^{-1}$, which may be caused by mass transfer from the less massive component to the more massive one at a rate of $\frac{dM_{2}}{dt}=-3.36(\pm0.02)\times{10^{-8}}M_\odot/year$. A cyclic variation of $P_3 = 22.9(\pm0.1)$ is also found in the O - C curve. There may be a potential compact object orbiting around NW Aps, with its minimum mass to be $M_3 = 0.436(\pm0.007)M_\odot$. However, the magnetic activity of the primary star may also account for the cyclic change. NW Aps is a stellar merger candidate with the longest orbital period among all stellar merge candidates with mass ratio $q &lt; 0.1$. It is still in a stable state since the ratio of orbital angular momentum ($J_{orb}$) to spin angular momentum ($J_{spin}$) is $\frac{J_{orb}}{J_{spin}}$ = 3.257. Both of its primary and secondary star are oversized to main sequence stars, and the surface gravity of the primary and secondary stars are significant lower than main sequence stars. The P - log g relationship is fitted with parabola for low mass ratio contact binary systems. More targets laid in the gap are needed to confirm the P - log g relationship and reveal the final evolutionary state of low mass ratio contact binary system.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal encoder-decoder neural network for forecasting solar wind speed at L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar wind, accelerated within the solar corona, sculpts the heliosphere and continuously interacts with planetary atmospheres. On Earth, high-speed solar-wind streams may lead to severe disruption of satellite operations and power grids. Accurate and reliable forecasting of the ambient solar-wind speed is therefore highly desirable. This work presents an encoder-decoder neural-network framework for simultaneously forecasting the daily averaged solar-wind speed for the subsequent four days. The encoder-decoder framework is trained with the two different modes of solar observations. The history of solar-wind observations from prior solar-rotations and EUV coronal observations up to four days prior to the current time form the input to two different encoders. The decoder is designed to output the daily averaged solar-wind speed from four days prior to the current time to four days into the future. Our model outputs the solar-wind speed with Root-Mean-Square Errors (RMSEs) of 55 km/s, 58 km/s, 58 km/s, and 58 km/s and Pearson correlations of 0.78, 0.66, 0.64 and 0.63 for one to four days in advance respectively. While the model is trained and validated on observations between 2010 - 2018, we demonstrate its robustness via application on unseen test data between 2019 - 2023, yielding RMSEs of 53 km/s and Pearson correlations 0.55 for a four-day advance prediction. Our encoder-decoder model thus produces much improved RMSE values compared to the previous works and paves the way for developing comprehensive multimodal deep learning models for operational solar wind forecasting.</description>

Abstract: The thermodynamics of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) is often described using a polytropic process. Estimating the polytopic index ($\gamma$) allows us to quantify the expansion or compression of the ICME plasma arising from changes in the plasma temperature. In this study, we estimate $\gamma$ for protons inside the magnetic clouds (MCs), their associated sheaths, and ambient solar wind for a large sample of well-observed events observed by the Wind spacecraft at 1 AU. We find that $\gamma$ shows a high ($\approx 1.6$) - low ($\approx 1.05$) - high ($\approx 1.2$) behavior inside the ambient solar wind, sheath, and MCs, respectively. We also find that the proton polytropic index is independent of small-scale density fluctuations. Furthermore, our results show that the stored energy inside MC plasma is not expended in expanding its cross-section at 1 AU. The sub-adiabatic nature of MC plasma implies external heating - possibly due to thermal conduction from the corona. We find that the heating gradient per unit mass from the corona to the protons of MC at 1 AU is $\approx 0.21$ erg cm$^{-1}$ g$^{-1}$ which is in agreement with the required proton heating budget.</description>

      <title>One year of ASPEX-SWIS operation -- Characteristic features, observations and science potential</title>

Abstract: The Aditya-L1 mission, India's first dedicated solar observatory positioned at the first Lagrange point (L1) of the Sun-Earth system, carries the Solar Wind Ion Spectrometer (SWIS) as part of the ASPEX payload suite. Even before settling into its Halo orbit, SWIS has been providing nearly continuous in-situ measurements of solar wind ion spectra. Moments of the velocity distribution functions (VDFs) have been calculated to derive key solar wind parameters such as density, bulk speed, and temperature. In this study, we assess the performance of SWIS (hereafter referred to as AL1-ASPEX-SWIS) by comparing its measurements with contemporaneous data from the Wind and DSCOVR missions. In this study, we assess the performance of SWIS (hereafter referred to as AL1-ASPEX-SWIS) by comparing its measurements with contemporaneous data from the Wind and DSCOVR missions. A detailed case study of the interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) event on August 7, 2024, is presented, where sharp changes in bulk speed, thermal speed, and number density were found to be well-aligned with independent observations-confirming the instrument's ability to capture dynamic solar wind features. Spectral analysis of kinetic fluctuations revealed a well-defined inertial range with a spectral slope consistent with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Furthermore, a 17-month statistical comparison (from January 2024 to May 2025) shows a strong correlation in bulk velocity (R2 = 0.94 with Wind), with expected variations in thermal speed and density arising from differences between instruments. These findings demonstrate the scientific value of AL1-ASPEX-SWIS for monitoring both transient solar events and long-term solar wind conditions.</description>

      <title>Structures and properties of fan-shaped jets: H$\alpha$ dark blobs and transparent regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated three fan-shaped jets observed above sunspot light bridges or nearby sunspot regions. The study aimed to explore the dynamics and physical properties of jets' features that appear as blob-like structures at the tips of the jets, which we call `dark blobs'. A transparent region is observed beneath the dark blobs, creating a visible gap between the dark blobs and the trailing body of the jets. These phenomena were studied in chromospheric and transition region imaging and spectral high-resolution co-observations from the Visible Imaging Spectrometer of the Goode Solar Telescope at the Big Bear Solar Observatory and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), together with data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We analyzed the jets' morphology and fine structure. We obtained the spatial scale and the dynamics of the dark blobs that are seen mostly in the wings of the H$\alpha$ line and have a cross-section of about $0.2^{\prime\prime}-0.3^{\prime\prime}$. The dark blobs and the transparent regions are seen bright (in emission) in the IRIS slit-jaw 1330 $\unicode{0x212B}$, 1400 $\unicode{0x212B}$, and AIA 304 $\unicode{0x212B}$ images. The IRIS Si IV 1394 $\unicode{0x212B}$ spectrum of the brightenings showed blue-shifted emission of about $16$ km s$^{-1}$ with non-thermal velocities of up to $40$ km s$^{-1}$. We also estimated the electron density of the blue-shifted brightenings to be $10^{12.1\pm0.2}$ cm$^{-3}$. Our findings likely suggest that we detect the observational signatures of shock waves that generate and/or contribute to the evolution of fan-shaped jets.</description>

      <title>Mapping ground-based coronagraphic images to Helioprojective-Cartesian coordinate system by image registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A few ground-based solar coronagraphs have been installed in western China for observing the low-layer corona in recent years. However, determining the Helioprojective Coordinates for the coronagraphic data with high precision is an important but challenging step for further research with other multi-wavelength data. In this paper, we propose an automatic coronal image registration method that combines local statistical correlation and feature point matching to achieve accurate registration between ground-based coronal green-line images and space-based 211 {\AA} images. Then, the accurate field of view information of the coronal green-line images can be derived, allowing the images to be mapped to the Helioprojective Cartesian Coordinates with an accuracy of no less than 0.1''. This method has been extensively validated using 100 days of coronal data spanning an 11-year period, demonstrating its broad applicability to ground-based coronagraphs equipped with green-line observations. It significantly enhances the scientific value of ground-based coronal data, enabling comprehensive studies of coronal transient activities and facilitating the joint analysis of data from multiple instruments. Additionally, it holds potential for future applications in improving the pointing accuracy of coronagraphs.</description>

      <title>The Small Separation A-Star Companion Population: Tentative Signatures of Enhanced Multiplicity with Primary Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present updated results from our near-infrared long-baseline interferometry (LBI) survey to constrain the multiplicity properties of intermediate-mass A-type stars within 80 pc. Previous adaptive optics surveys of A-type stars are incomplete at separations $&lt;$ 20au. Therefore, a LBI survey allows us to explore separations previously unexplored. Our sample consists of 54 A-type primaries with estimated masses between 1.44-2.93 M$_{\odot}$ and ages 10-790 Myr, which we observed with the MIRC-X and MYSTIC instruments at the CHARA Array. We use the open source software CANDID to detect two new companions, seven in total, and we performed a Bayesian demographic analysis to characterize the companion population. We find the separation distribution consistent with being flat, and we estimate a power-law fit to the mass ratio distribution with index -0.13$^{+0.92}_{-0.95}$ and a companion frequency of 0.25$^{+0.17}_{-0.11}$ over mass ratios 0.1-1.0 and projected separations 0.01-27.54au. We find a posterior probability of 0.53 and 0.04 that our results are consistent with extrapolations based on previous models of the solar-type and B-type companion population, respectively. Our results suggest that the close companion population to A-type stars is comparable to that of solar-types and that close companions to B-type stars are potentially more frequent which may be indicative of increased disk fragmentation for stars $\gtrsim$ 3M$_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Fast and Fewrious: Stochastic binary perturbations from fast compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive compact objects soften binaries. This process has been used for decades to constrain the population of such objects, particularly as a component of dark matter (DM). The effects of light compact objects, such as those in the unconstrained asteroid-mass range, have generally been neglected. In principle, low-energy perturbers can harden binaries instead of softening them, but the standard lore is that this effect vanishes when the perturber velocities are large compared to the binary's orbital velocity, as is typical for DM constituents. Here, we revisit the computation of the hardening rate induced by light perturbers. We show that although the perturbations average to zero over many encounters, many scenarios of interest for DM constraints are in the regime where the variance cannot be neglected. We show that a few fast-moving perturbers can leave stochastic perturbations in systems that are measured with great precision, and we use this framework to revisit the constraint potential of systems such as binary pulsars and the Solar System. This opens a new class of dynamical probes with potential applications to asteroid-mass DM candidates.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Modeling of Landau Damping with Deep Operator Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations excel at capturing microscale plasma physics phenomena with high accuracy, but their computational demands make them impractical for modeling large-scale space and astrophysical systems. In this context, we build a surrogate model, using Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), based upon the Vlasov-Poisson simulation data to model the dynamical evolution of plasmas, focusing on the Landau damping process - a fundamental kinetic phenomenon in space and astrophysical plasmas. The trained DeepONets are able to capture the evolution of electric field energy in both linear and nonlinear regimes under various conditions. Extensive validation highlights DeepONets' robust performance in reproducing complex plasma behaviors with high accuracy, paving the way for large-scale modeling of space and astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Quantifying alpha clustering in the ground states of 16-O and 20-Ne</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the role of multi-nucleon correlations in the structure of light nuclei is at the forefront of modern nuclear science. In this letter, we present a quantitative benchmark study of alpha-cluster correlations in the ground states of 16-O and 20-Ne. Experimental data provide direct evidence that the wave functions of the ground states of 16-O and 20-Ne are dominated by alpha-cluster correlations, in agreement with the predictions of sophisticated nuclear structure models. We also provide a new model-independent constraint for the alpha asymptotic normalization coefficient of the 16-O ground state and discuss the implications of these findings on the 12-C(alpha,gamma)16-O reaction, which is of critical importance for nuclear astrophysics.</description>

      <title>GW231123: a product of successive mergers from $\sim 10 $ stellar-mass black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GW231123 is an exceptionally massive binary black hole (BBH) merger with unusually high component spins. Such extreme properties challenge conventional stellar evolution models predicting a black hole mass gap due to pair-instability supernovae. We analyze GW231123 using population-informed priors on BH mass and spin distributions to test possible formation scenarios: first-generation stellar collapse, hierarchical (multi-generation) mergers, and primordial origin. Our analysis strongly prefers scenarios where at least one component is a higher-generation BH. Both components are favored to have high spins, which rules out scenarios in which they are both first-generation (low spin) or primordial (nearly non-spin). We conclude that GW231123 is a hierarchical merger, with components plausibly originate from the successive mergers of $\sim 6$ and $\sim 4$ first-generation BHs, respectively. This suggests that repeated mergers can be frequent and even more massive intermediate-mass black holes may be produced. Thus mechanisms that can efficiently harden the BBHs' orbits are required, e.g., gas dynamical fraction in the disks of active galactic nucleus.</description>

      <title>High-resolution Observation of Mini-Filament Eruptions Near Coronal Hole Boundary and Their Response in Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated mini-filament (MF) eruptions near coronal hole (CH) boundaries to explore their role in coronal dynamics and their potential contributions to the solar wind. Using high-resolution H$\alpha$ images from the 1.6m Goode Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory and EUV data from AIA 193 \AA~ from Solar Dynamic Observatory, we analyzed 28 MFE events over 7.5 hours of observation spanning 5 days. Three largest MF eruptions triggered distinct coronal responses: two consecutive MFEs produced a small-scale eruptive coronal ejection, while the other generated a jet-like brightening. Furthermore, the 25 smaller-scale MFEs were associated with localized brightenings in coronal bright points (CBPs). These findings suggest that MFs play a significant role in transferring mass and magnetic flux to the corona, particularly within CH regions. We found certain trend that the size of MFEs is correlated with the EUV emissions. In addition, we observed magnetic flux cancellation associated with MFEs. However, except for a few largest MFEs, quantitative analysis of magnetic field evolution is beyond the capability of the data. These results underscore the importance of MFEs in the dynamic coupling between the chromosphere and corona, highlighting their potential role in shaping heliospheric structures. Although current study covers smallest MFEs ever studied, future higher-cadence, more accurate magnetograms and multi-wavelength observations are essential to fully resolve the fine-scale dynamics of these ubiquitous solar phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive stars can have extreme effects on their environments from local to galactic scales. While O star multiplicity has been studied over a broad separation range (to the point where absolute masses of these systems have been determined and investigations into multiple system formation and interactions have been performed), studies of B star multiplicity are lacking. Using interferometry, we investigated the multiplicity of a statistically significant sample of B stars over a range of separations (~0.5-35 au, given that the average distance to our sample is 412 pc). We analysed high angular resolution interferometric data taken with VLTI/PIONIER for a sample of 32 B stars. Using parametric modelling of the closure phases and visibilities, we determined best-fitting models to each of the systems and investigated whether each source was best represented by a single star or a higher-order system. The detection limits were calculated for companions to determine whether they were significant. We then combined our findings from the interferometric data with results from a literature search to determine whether other companions were reported at different separation ranges. Within the interferometric range 72+/-8% of the B stars are resolved as multiple systems. The most common type of system is a binary system, followed by triple systems, presumably single stars and then quadruple systems. The interferometric companion fraction derived for the sample is 1.88+/-0.24. When we accounted for spectroscopic companions that have been confirmed in the literature and wide companions inferred from Gaia data in addition to the companions we found with interferometry, we obtain multiplicity and companion fractions of 0.88+/-0.06 and 2.31+/-0.27, respectively, for our sample. The number of triple systems in particular increases significantly when we account for spectroscopic companions.</description>

      <title>Rising from the Ashes II: The Bar-driven Abundance Bimodality of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Milky Way hosts at least two modes in its present day distribution of Fe and alpha-elements. The exact cause of this bimodality is disputed, but one class of explanations involves the merger between the Milky Way and a relatively massive satellite (Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus) at z~2. However, reproducing this bimodality in simulations is not straightforward, with conflicting results on the prevalence, morphology, and mechanism behind multimodality. We present a case study of a galaxy in the Illustris TNG50 simulation which undergoes sequential phases of starburst, brief quiescence, and then rejuvenation. This scenario results in a pronounced abundance bimodality after a post-processing adjustment of the [alpha/Fe] of old stars designed to mimic a higher star formation efficiency in dense gas. The high- and low-alpha sequences are separated in time by the brief quiescent period, which is not associated with a merger but by the formation of a bar followed by AGN activity. This galaxy indicates a novel scenario in which the alpha-bimodality in the Milky Way is caused by the formation of the bar via AGN-induced quenching. In addition to a stellar age gap in the Milky Way, we predict that abundance bimodalities should be more common in barred as opposed to unbarred galaxies.</description>

      <title>SpecCLIP: Aligning and Translating Spectroscopic Measurements for Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01939</link>

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization. Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance precision stellar spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of 70 $\mu$m Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). XII. Unanchored Forked Stream in the Propagating Path of a Protostellar Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Outflows are key indicators of ongoing star formation. We report the discovery of an unanchored forked stream within the propagating path of an extremely young protostellar outflow in the 70 $\mu$m-dark clump G34.74-0.12, based on ALMA 1.3 mm observations with an angular resolution of 1''.6 (~ 5000 au). This outflow originate from a 9.7 $M_{\odot}$ core, exhibits a fork-shaped stream structure in its red-shifted lobe, which is traced by CO (2-1), SiO (5-4), and H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$-2$_{0,2}$). It has a momentum of 13 $M_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$, an energy of 107 $M_{\odot}$ km$^{2}$ s$^{-2}$, and a dynamical timescale of ~10$^{4}$ yr. Significantly, the enhanced relative abundances of SiO, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH with respect to CO, along with the increased temperature at the forked point, indicate a collisional origin. The forked point does not coincide with any dust continuum core &gt; 0.1 $M_{\odot}$. Moreover, CO (2-1) emission also traces three other outflows in this region, characterized by their masses (0.40, 0.02 and 0.15 $M_{\odot}$) and momenta (5.2, 0.2, 1.8 $M_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$), as part of the ALMA Survey of 70 $\mu$m dark High-mass clumps in Early Stages (ASHES) project. All the newly discovered morphological and kinematic features associated with these extremely young protostellar outflows (with timescales of 10$^3$ - 10$^4$ years) suggest that the initial stages of star formation are more complicated than previously understood.</description>

      <title>Properties of compact objects in quadratic non-metricity gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical compact objects are studied in the context of quadratic non-metricity gravity. The solutions to the gravitational field equations, which include fluid components, are analyzed to investigate the density and pressure properties of radio pulsars. It is explicitly demonstrated that the theoretically stable models are consistent with astronomical data, due to the geometric features of the quadratic component. Furthermore, it is shown that, in contrast to the compactness limits of black holes in general relativity, the core density can significantly exceed the density at which nuclear saturation occurs, and the surface density can also surpass the value of nuclear saturation. Additionally, it is found that the radial sound speed remains below the conformal upper bound for sound velocity established by perturbative quantum chromodynamics.</description>
