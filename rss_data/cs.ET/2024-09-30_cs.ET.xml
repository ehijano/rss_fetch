      <title>Enhanced Drug Delivery via Localization-Enabled Relaying in Molecular Communication Nanonetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intra-body nanonetworks hold promise for advancing targeted drug delivery (TDD) systems through molecular communications (MC). In the baseline MC-TDD system, drug-loaded nanomachines (DgNs) are positioned near the infected tissues to deliver drug molecules directly. To mitigate the decline in drug delivery efficiency caused by diffusion, we propose an enhanced MC-TDD system with a relay network. This network employs a novel localization-enabled relaying mechanism, where a nano-controller broadcasts a localization signal. DgNs then measure the received signal strength against thresholds to determine their clusters relative to the infected tissue. Additionally, our study considers the effect of multiple absorbing DgNs on the channel impulse response (CIR), a factor overlooked in previous works. Our approach improves drug delivery efficiency by $17\%$ compared to the baseline system. Importantly, we find that optimizing CIR is crucial for enhancing drug delivery efficiency. These findings pave the way for further research into optimizing CIR-based relay selection, as well as investigating the impact of factors such as drug molecule lifespan, obstruction probabilities, and flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Hidden Vulnerabilities in Quantum Systems by Expanding Attack Vectors through Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study uncovers novel vulnerabilities within Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols that extend beyond traditional implementation flaws, such as loopholes. These newly identified vulnerabilities arise from the complex interaction between Bell Inequalities (BIs) and Hidden Variable Theories (HVTs), further exacerbated by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP). Through a combination of theoretical analysis, simulations, and quantum experiments, we reveal critical security weaknesses that challenge the core assumptions of today's quantum cryptography. While these vulnerabilities differ from known loopholes, when considered alongside them and traditional cyberattacks, they present a significant threat to the robustness of QKD and quantum integrity systems. These results provide a new perspective to rethink current quantum security frameworks to ensure the robustness of future quantum cryptographic and quantum integrity protocols.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Challenges in Network Intrusion Detection Systems: Research Insights and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has brought significant advances in cybersecurity, particularly in the area of intrusion detection systems. This improvements can be mostly attributed to the ability of machine learning algorithms to identify complex relations between features in the data and to generalize well to unseen samples. Deep neural networks in particular contributed to this progress by enabling the analysis of large amounts of training data, significantly enhancing detection performance. However, machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks: manipulations of input data designed to mislead the models into making incorrect predictions. While much attention has been given to adversarial threats in unstructured data such as text and images, their effectiveness in structured data such as network traffic has not been as thoroughly explored.
  This survey seeks to fill this gap by providing an critical review of machine learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) and a thorough analysis of their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We critically review existing NIDS research, highlighting key trends, strengths, and limitations, and we identify gaps in understanding that require further exploration. We further discuss emerging challenges and offer insights for developing more robust and resilient NIDS models. In summary, this paper aims to enhance understanding of adversarial attacks and defenses in NIDS and guide future research in improving the robustness of machine learning models in cybersecurity applications.</description>

      <title>All-to-all reconfigurability with sparse and higher-order Ising machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain-specific hardware to solve computationally hard optimization problems has generated tremendous excitement. Here, we evaluate probabilistic bit (p-bit) based Ising Machines (IM) on the 3-regular 3-Exclusive OR Satisfiability (3R3X), as a representative hard optimization problem. We first introduce a multiplexed architecture that emulates all-to-all network functionality while maintaining highly parallelized chromatic Gibbs sampling. We implement this architecture in single Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and show that running the adaptive parallel tempering algorithm demonstrates competitive algorithmic and prefactor advantages over alternative IMs by D-Wave, Toshiba, and Fujitsu. We also implement higher-order interactions that lead to better prefactors without changing algorithmic scaling for the XORSAT problem. Even though FPGA implementations of p-bits are still not quite as fast as the best possible greedy algorithms accelerated on Graphics Processing Units (GPU), scaled magnetic versions of p-bit IMs could lead to orders of magnitude improvements over the state of the art for generic optimization.</description>

      <title>On fundamental aspects of quantum extreme learning machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Extreme Learning Machines (QELMs) have emerged as a promising framework for quantum machine learning. Their appeal lies in the rich feature map induced by the dynamics of a quantum substrate - the quantum reservoir - and the efficient post-measurement training via linear regression. Here we study the expressivity of QELMs by decomposing the prediction of QELMs into a Fourier series. We show that the achievable Fourier frequencies are determined by the data encoding scheme, while Fourier coefficients depend on both the reservoir and the measurement. Notably, the expressivity of QELMs is fundamentally limited by the number of Fourier frequencies and the number of observables, while the complexity of the prediction hinges on the reservoir. As a cautionary note on scalability, we identify four sources that can lead to the exponential concentration of the observables as the system size grows (randomness, hardware noise, entanglement, and global measurements) and show how this can turn QELMs into useless input-agnostic oracles. In particular, our result on the reservoir-induced concentration strongly indicates that quantum reservoirs drawn from a highly random ensemble make QELM models unscalable. Our analysis elucidates the potential and fundamental limitations of QELMs, and lays the groundwork for systematically exploring quantum reservoir systems for other machine learning tasks.</description>
