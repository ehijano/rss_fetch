      <title>A Note on the Carath\'{e}odory Number of the Joint Numerical Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Carath\'{e}odory number of the joint numerical range of $d$ many bounded self-adjoint operators is at most $d-1$, and even at most $d-2$ if the underlying Hilbert space has dimension at least $3$. This extension of the classical convexity results for numerical ranges shows that also joint numerical ranges are significantly less non-convex than general sets.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Synthesis on Group Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harmonic synthesis describes translation invariant linear spaces of continuous complex valued functions on locally compact abelian groups. The basic result due to L. Schwartz states that such spaces on the reals are topologically generated by the exponential monomials in the space -- in other words the locally compact abelian group of the reals is synthesizable. This result does not hold for continuous functions in several real variables as it was shown by D.I. Gurevich's counterexamples. On the other hand, if two discrete abelian groups have this synthesizability property, then so does their direct sum, as well. In this paper we show that if two locally compact abelian groups have this synthesizability property and at least one of them is discrete, then their direct sum is synthesizable. In fact, more generally, we show that any extension of a synthesizable locally compact abelian group by a synthesizable discrete abelian group is synthesizable. This is an important step toward the complete characterisation of synthesizable locally compact abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Fenchel Conjugates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical concept of Fenchel conjugation is tailored to extended real-valued functions defined on linear spaces. In this paper we generalize this concept to functions defined on arbitrary sets that do not necessarily bear any structure at all. This generalization is obtained by replacing linear test functions by general nonlinear ones. Thus, we refer to it as nonlinear Fenchel conjugation. We investigate elementary properties including the Fenchel-Moreau biconjugation theorem. Whenever the domain exhibits additional structure, the restriction to a suitable subset of test functions allows further results to be derived. For example, on smooth manifolds, the restriction to smooth test functions allows us to state the Fenchel-Young theorem for the viscosity Fr\'echet subdifferential. On Lie groups, the restriction to real-valued group homomorphisms relates nonlinear Fenchel conjugation to infimal convolution and yields a notion of convexity.</description>

      <title>Hankel operators and Projective Hilbert modules on quotients of bounded symmetric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a bounded symmetric domain $\Omega$ with a finite pseudo-reflection group acting on it as a subgroup of the group of automorphisms. This gives rise to quotient domains by means of basic polynomials $\theta$ which by virtue of being proper maps map the \v Silov boundary of $\Omega$ to the \v Silov boundary of $\theta(\Omega)$. Thus, the natural measure on the \v Silov boundary of $\Omega$ can be pushed forward. This gives rise to Hardy spaces on the quotient domain.
  The study of Hankel operators on the Hardy spaces of the quotient domains is introduced. The use of the weak product space shows that an analogue of Hartman's theorem holds for the small Hankel operator. Nehari's theorem fails for the big Hankel operator and this has the consequence that when the domain $\Omega$ is the polydisc $\mathbb D^d$, the {\em Hardy space} is not a projective object in the category of all Hilbert modules over the algebra $\mathcal A (\theta(\mathbb D^d))$ of functions which are holomorphic in the quotient domain and continuous on the closure $\overline {\theta(\mathbb D^d)}$. It is not a projective object in the category of cramped Hilbert modules either. Indeed, no projective object is known in these two categories. On the other hand, every normal Hilbert module over the algebra of continuous functions on the \v Silov boundary, treated as a Hilbert module over the algebra $\mathcal A (\theta(\mathbb D^d))$, is projective.</description>

      <title>Isomorphisms between vector-valued $H_p$-spaces for $0&lt;p\le 1$ and uniqueness of unconditional structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we manage to identify Banach-valued Hardy spaces of analytic functions over the disc $\mathbb{D}$ with other classes of Hardy spaces, thus complementing the existing literature on the subject. On the other hand, we develop new techniques that allow us to prove that certain Hilbert-valued atomic lattices have a unique unconditional basis, up to normalization, equivalence and permutation. Combining both lines of action we show that that $H_p(\mathbb{D},\ell_2)$ for $0&lt;p&lt;1$ has a unique atomic lattice structure. The proof of this result relies on the validity of some new lattice estimates for non-locally convex spaces which hold an independent interest.</description>

      <title>Conditional bases with Property~(A)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Property~(A) is a week symmetry condition that plays a fundamental role in the characterization of greedy-type bases in the isometric case, i.e., when the constants involved in the study of the efficiency of the thresholding greedy algorithm in Banach spaces are sharp. In this note we build examples of Banach spaces with Schauder bases that have Property~(A) but fail to be unconditional, thus settling a long standing problem in the area. As a by-product of our work we hone our construction to produce counterexamples that solve other open questions in the isometric theory of greedy bases.</description>

      <title>Localization operators on discrete Orlicz modulation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Orlicz spaces on $ \mathbb Z^n \times \mathbb T^n $ and Orlicz modulation spaces on $\mathbb Z^n$, and present some basic properties such as inclusion relations, convolution relations, and duality of these spaces. We show that the Orlicz modulation space $M^{\Phi}(\mathbb Z^n)$ is close to the modulation space $M^{2}(\mathbb Z^n)$ for some particular Young function $\Phi$. Then, we study a class of pseudo-differential operators known as time-frequency localization operators on $\mathbb Z^n$, which depend on a symbol $\varsigma$ and two windows functions $g_1$ and $g_2$. Using appropriate classes for symbols, we study the boundedness of the localization operators on Orlicz modulation spaces on $\mathbb Z^n$. Also, we show that these operators are compact and in the Schatten--von Neumann classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the heat equation associated with the Jacobi--Cherednik operator on the real line. We establish some basic properties of the Jacobi--Cherednik heat kernel and heat semigroup. We also provide a solution to the Cauchy problem for the Jacobi--Cherednik heat operator and prove that the heat kernel is strictly positive. Then, we characterize the image of the space $L^2(\mathbb R, A_{\alpha, \beta})$ under the Jacobi--Cherednik heat semigroup as a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. As an application, we solve the modified Poisson equation and present the Jacobi--Cherednik--Markov processes.</description>

      <title>When is the Szlenk derivation of a dual unit ball another ball?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if a separable Banach space has Kalton's property $(M^\ast)$, then all $\varepsilon$-Szlenk derivations of the dual unit ball are balls, however, in the case of the dual of Baernstein's space, all those Szlenk derivations are balls having the same radius as for $\ell_2$, yet this space fails property $(M^\ast)$. By estimating the radii of enveloping balls, we show that the Szlenk derivations are not balls for Tsirelson's space and the dual of Schlumprecht's space. Using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker theorem we prove that the same is true for the duals of certain sequential Orlicz spaces.</description>

      <title>On a Santal\'o point for Nakamura-Tsuji's Laplace transform inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nakamura and Tsuji recently obtained an integral inequality involving a Laplace transform of even functions that implies, at the limit, the Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality in its functional form. Inspired by their method, based on the Fokker-Planck semi-group, we extend the inequality to non-even functions. We consider a well-chosen centering procedure by studying the infimum over translations in a double Laplace transform. This requires a new look on the existing methods and leads to several observations of independent interest on the geometry of the Laplace transform. Application to reverse hypercontractivity is also given.</description>

      <title>No-dimensional Helly's theorem in uniformly convex Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ``no-dimensional'' analogue of Helly's theorem in Banach spaces. Specifically, we obtain the following no-dimensional Helly-type results for uniformly convex Banach spaces: Helly's theorem, fractional Helly's theorem, colorful Helly's theorem, and colorful fractional Helly's theorem.
  The combinatorial part of the proofs for these Helly-type results is identical to the Euclidean case as presented in \cite{adiprasito2020theorems}. The primary difference lies in the use of a certain geometric inequality in place of the Pythagorean theorem. This inequality can be explicitly expressed in terms of the modulus of convexity of a Banach space.</description>

      <title>Risk measures on incomplete markets: a new non-solid paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The abstract theory of risk measures is well-developed for certain classes of solid subspaces of $L^{0}$. We provide an example to illustrate that this framework is insufficient to deal with the subtleties of incomplete markets. To remedy this problem, we consider risk measures on the subspace generated by a closed, absolutely convex, and bounded subset $K\subset L^{0}$, which represents the attainable securities. In this context, we introduce the equicontinuous Fatou property. Under the existence of a certain topology $\tau$ on $\mathrm{span}(K)$, interpreted as a generalized weak-star topology, we obtain an equivalence between the equicontinuous Fatou property, and lower semicontinuity with respect to $\tau$. As a corollary, we obtain tractable dual representations for such risk measures, which subsumes essentially all known results on weak-star representations of risk measures. This dual representation allows one to prove that all risk measures of this form extend, in a maximal way, to the ideal generated by $\mathrm{span}(K)$ while preserving a Fatou-like property.</description>

      <title>Singularity formed by the collision of two collapsing solitons in interaction for the 2D Keller-Segel system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the two-dimensional Keller-Segel system admits finite time blowup solutions, which is the case if the initial density has a total mass greater than $8\pi$ and a finite second moment. Several constructive examples of such solutions have been obtained, where for all of them a perturbed stationary state undergoes scale instability and collapses at a point, resulting in a $8\pi$-mass concentration. It was conjectured that singular solutions concentrating simultaneously more than one solitons could exist. We construct rigorously such a new blowup mechanism, where two stationary states are simultaneously collapsing and colliding, resulting in a $16\pi$-mass concentration at a single blowup point, and with a new blowup rate which corresponds to the formal prediction by Seki, Sugiyama and Vel\'azquez. We develop for the first time a robust framework to construct rigorously such blowup solutions involving simultaneously the non-radial collision and concentration of several solitons, which we expect to find applications to other evolution problems.</description>

We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the multiplicity-freeness property. Specifically, we establish the equivalence between the disjointness of irreducible unitary representations realized over the domain, the multiplicity-freeness of the unitary representation on the space of $L^2$ holomorphic functions, and the coisotropicity of the group action.</description>

      <title>Continual Lie algebras determined by chain complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.07431v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual Lie algebras are infinite dimensional generalizations of ordinary Lie with continuous set of roots. In this paper we establish a general relation between chain complexes and continual Lie algebras. First, by defining and appropriate product among a chain complex spaces we endow it with the structure of an exterior differential graded algebra $\mathcal C$. The natural orthogonality condition with respect to a product bring about to $\mathcal C$ the structure of a graded algebra with differential relations and compatibility conditions for elements of chain complex spaces. By considering the union of all relations for independent elements in the tree graph structure of the system, we prove the main result of this paper: a chain complex brings about the structure of a continual Lie algebra with the root space determined by parameters for the complex. This provides a new source of examples of continual Lie algebras. Finally, as an example, we consider the case of \v{C}ech-de Rham complex associated to a foliation on a smooth manifold.

      <title>On the spaces dual to combinatorial Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10710v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present quasi-Banach spaces which are closely related to the duals of combinatorial Banach spaces. More precisely, for a compact family $\mathcal{F}$ of finite subsets of $\omega$ we define a quasi-norm $\lVert \cdot \rVert^\mathcal{F}$ whose Banach envelope is the dual norm for the combinatorial space generated by $\mathcal{F}$. Such quasi-norms seem to be much easier to handle than the dual norms and yet the quasi-Banach spaces induced by them share many properties with the dual spaces. We show that the quasi-Banach spaces induced by large families (in the sense of Lopez-Abad and Todorcevic) are $\ell_1$-saturated and do not have the Schur property. In particular, this holds for the Schreier families.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Locally Compact Abelian Groups Having Spectral Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we solve a long-standing problem which goes back to Laurent Schwartz's work on mean periodic functions. Namely, we completely characterise those locally compact Abelian groups having spectral synthesis. So far a characterisation theorem was available for discrete Abelian groups only. Here we use a kind of localisation concept for the ideals of the Fourier algebra of the underlying group. We show that localisability of ideals is equivalent to synthesizability. Based on this equivalence we show that if spectral synthesis holds on each extension of it by a locally compact Abelian group consisting of compact elements, and also on any extension to a direct sum with a copy of the integers. Then, using Schwartz's result and Gurevich's counterexamples we apply the structure theory of locally compact Abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Curvature, Hodge-Dirac operators and Riesz transforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of Ricci curvature lower bound for symmetric sub-Markovian semigroups. We use this notion to investigate functional calculus of the Hodge-Dirac operator associated to the semigroup in link with the boundedness of suitable Riesz transforms. Our paper offers a unified framework that not only encapsulates existing results in some contexts but also yields new findings in others. This is demonstrated through applications in the frameworks of Riemannian manifolds, compact (quantum) groups, noncommutative tori, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup, $q$-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroups and semigroups of Schur multipliers. We also provide an $\mathrm{L}^p$-Poincar\'e inequality that is applicable to all previously discussed contexts under assumptions of boundedness of Riesz transforms and uniform exponential stability. Finally, we prove the boundedness of some Riesz transforms in some contexts as compact Lie groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boundedness of an abstract formulation of Hardy operators between Lebesgue spaces over general measure spaces is studied and, when the domain is L^1, shown to be equivalent to the existence of a Hardy inequality on the half line with general Borel measures. This is done by extending the greatest decreasing minorant construction to general measure spaces depending on a totally ordered collection of measurable sets, called an ordered core. A functional description of the greatest decreasing minorant is given, and for a large class of ordered cores, a pointwise description is provided. As an application, characterizations of Hardy inequalities for metric measure spaces are given, we note that the metric measure space is not required to admit a polar decomposition.</description>

      <title>Relative weak compactness in infinite-dimensional Fefferman-Meyer duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a Banach space such that $E'$ has the Radon-Nikod\'ym property. The aim of this work is to connect relative weak compactness in the $E$-valued martingale Hardy space $H^{1}(\mu,E)$ to a convex compactness criterion in a weaker topology, such as the topology of uniform convergence on compacts in measure. These results represent a dynamic version of the deep result of Diestel, Ruess, and Schachermayer on relative weak compactness in $L^{1}(\mu,E)$. In the reflexive case, we obtain a Kadec-Pe{\l}czy\'nski dichotomy for $H^{1}(\mu,E)$-bounded sequences, which decomposes a subsequence into a relatively weakly compact part, a pointwise weakly convexly convergent part, and a null part converging to zero uniformly on compacts in measure. As a corollary, we investigate a parameterized version of the vector-valued Koml\'os theorem without the assumption of $H^{1}(\mu,E)$-boundedness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of orbits $(T^nx)_{n\ge0}$ of the classical Ces\`aro operator $T$ for sequences $x$ in the Banach space $c$ of convergent sequences. We give new non-probabilistic proofs, based on the Katznelson-Tzafriri theorem and one of its quantified variants, of results which characterise the set of sequences $x\in c$ that lead to convergent orbits and, for sequences satisfying a simple additional condition, we provide a rate of convergence. These results are then shown, again by operator-theoretic techniques, to be optimal in different ways. Finally, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the Ces\`aro operator defined on spaces of continuous functions, establishing new and improved results in this setting, too.</description>

      <title>Nayak's theorem for compact operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an $m\times m$ complex matrix and let $\lambda _1, \lambda _2, \ldots , \lambda _m$ be the eigenvalues of $A$ arranged such that $|\lambda _1|\geq |\lambda _2|\geq \cdots \geq |\lambda _m|$ and for $n\geq 1,$ let $s^{(n)}_1\geq s^{(n)}_2\geq \cdots \geq s^{(n)}_m$ be the singular values of $A^n$. Then a famous theorem of Yamamoto (1967) states that $$\lim _{n\to \infty}(s^{(n)}_j )^{\frac{1}{n}}= |\lambda _j|, ~~\forall \,1\leq j\leq m.$$ Recently S. Nayak strengthened this result very significantly by showing that the sequence of matrices $|A^n|^{\frac{1}{n}}$ itself converges to a positive matrix $B$ whose eigenvalues are $|\lambda _1|,|\lambda _2|,$ $\ldots , |\lambda _m|.$ Here this theorem has been extended to arbitrary compact operators on infinite dimensional complex separable Hilbert spaces. The proof makes use of Nayak's theorem, Stone-Weirstrass theorem, Borel-Caratheodory theorem and some technical results of Anselone and Palmer on collectively compact operators. Simple examples show that the result does not hold for general bounded operators.</description>

      <title>Isometric rigidity of Wasserstein spaces over Euclidean spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of isometries of the quadratic Wasserstein space $\mathcal{W}_2\left(\mathbb{S}^n,\|\cdot\|\right)$ over the sphere endowed with the distance inherited from the norm of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. We prove that $\mathcal{W}_2\left(\mathbb{S}^n,\|\cdot\|\right)$ is isometrically rigid, meaning that its isometry group is isomorphic to that of $\left(\mathbb{S}^n,\|\cdot\|\right)$. This is in striking contrast to the non-rigidity of its ambient space $\mathcal{W}_2\left(\mathbb{R}^n,\|\cdot\|\right)$ but in line with the rigidity of the geodesic space $\mathcal{W}_2\left(\mathbb{S}^n,\sphericalangle\right)$. One of the key steps of the proof is the use of mean squared error functions to mimic displacement interpolation in $\mathcal{W}_2\left(\mathbb{S}^n,\|\cdot\|\right)$. A major difficulty in proving rigidity for quadratic Wasserstein spaces is that one cannot use the Wasserstein potential technique. To illustrate its general power, we use it to prove isometric rigidity of $\mathcal{W}_p\left(\mathbb{S}^1, \|\cdot\|\right)$ for $1 \leq p&lt;2.$</description>

      <title>Splitting of Tensor Products and Intermediate Factor Theorem: Continuous Version</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a discrete group. Given unital $G$-$C^*$-algebras $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, we give an abstract condition under which every $G$-subalgebra $\mathcal{C}$ of the form $\mathcal{A}\subset \mathcal{C}\subset \mathcal{A}\otimes_{\text{min}}\mathcal{B}$ is a tensor product. This generalizes the well-known splitting results in the context of $C^*$-algebras by Zacharias and Zsido. As an application, we prove a topological version of the Intermediate Factor theorem. When a product group $G=\Gamma_1\times\Gamma_2$ acts (by a product action) on the product of corresponding $\Gamma_i$-boundaries $\partial\Gamma_i$, using the abstract condition, we show that every intermediate subalgebra $C(X)\subset\mathcal{C}\subset C(X)\otimes_{\text{min}}C(\partial\Gamma_1\times \partial\Gamma_2)$ is a tensor product (under some additional assumptions on $X$). This can be considered as a topological version of the Intermediate Factor theorem. We prove that our assumptions are necessary and cannot generally be relaxed. We also introduce the notion of a uniformly rigid action for $C^*$-algebras and use it to give various classes of inclusions $\mathcal{A}\subset \mathcal{A}\otimes_{\text{min}}\mathcal{B}$ for which every invariant intermediate algebra is a tensor product.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a generalized complex (GC) Stein manifold and provide complete characterizations in three fundamental aspects. First, we extend Cartan's Theorem A and B within the framework of GC geometry. Next, we define $L$-plurisubharmonic functions and develop an associated $L^2$ theory. This leads to a characterization of GC Stein manifolds using $L$-plurisubharmonic exhaustion functions. Finally, we establish the existence of a proper GH embedding from any GC Stein manifold into $\mathbb{R}^{2n-2k} \times \mathbb{C}^{2k+1}$, where $2n$ and $k$ denote the dimension and type of the GC Stein manifold, respectively. This provides a characterization of GC Stein manifolds via GH embeddings. Several examples of GC Stein manifolds are given.</description>
