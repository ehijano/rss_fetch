      <title>Efficient Forward-Mode Algorithmic Derivatives of Geant4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have applied an operator-overloading forward-mode algorithmic differentiation tool to the Monte-Carlo particle simulation toolkit Geant4. Our differentiated version of Geant4 allows computing mean pathwise derivatives of user-defined outputs of Geant4 applications with respect to user-defined inputs. This constitutes a major step towards enabling gradient-based optimization techniques in high-energy physics, as well as other application domains of Geant4.
  This is a preliminary report on the technical aspects of applying operator-overloading AD to Geant4, as well as a first analysis of some results obtained by our differentiated Geant4 prototype. We plan to follow up with a more refined analysis.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Multiscale Modeling of Colloidal Plasmonic Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel fully atomistic multiscale classical approach to model the optical response of solvated real-size plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) is presented. The model is based on the coupling of the Frequency Dependent Fluctuating Charges and Fluctuating Dipoles ($\omega$FQF$\mu$), specifically designed to describe plasmonic substrates, and the polarizable Fluctuating Charges (FQ) classical force field to model the solvating environment. The resulting $\omega$FQF$\mu$/FQ approach accounts for the interactions between the radiation and the NP, as well as with the surrounding solvent molecules, by incorporating mutual interactions between the plasmonic substrate and solvent. $\omega$FQF$\mu$/FQ is validated against reference TD-DFTB/FQ calculations, demonstrating remarkable accuracy, particularly in reproducing plasmon resonance frequency shifts for structures below the quantum-size limit. The flexibility and reliability of the approach are also demonstrated by simulating the optical response of homogeneous and bimetallic NPs dissolved in pure solvents and solvent mixtures.</description>

      <title>Identifying Direct Bandgap Silicon Structures with High-throughput Search and Machine Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizations of silicon-based luminescent devices are restricted by the indirect-gap nature of diamond silicon. In this study, the high-throughput method is employed to expedite discoveries of direct-gap silicon crystals. The machine learning (ML) potential is utilized to construct a dataset comprising 2637 silicon allotropes, which is subsequently screened using an ML Hamiltonian model and density functional theory calculations, resulting in identification of 47 direct-gap Si structures. We calculate transition dipole moments (TDM), energies, and phonon bandstructures of these structures to validate their performance. Additionally, we recalculate bandgaps of these structures employing the HSE06 functional. 22 silicon allotropes are identified as potential photovoltaic materials. Among them, the energy per atom of Si22-Pm, which has a direct bandgap of 1.27 eV, is 0.026 eV/atom higher than diamond silicon. Si18-C2/m, which has a direct bandgap of 0.796 eV, exhibits the highest TDM among identified structures. Si16-P21/c, which has a direct bandgap of 0.907 eV, has the mass density of 2.316 g/cm3, which is the highest among identified structures and higher than that of diamond silicon. The structure Si12-P1, which possesses a direct bandgap of 1.69 eV, exhibits the highest spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) among identified structures at 32.28%, surpassing that of diamond silicon. This study offers insights into properties of silicon crystals while presenting a systematic high-throughput method for material discovery.</description>

      <title>Origin of Interstitial Doping Induced Coercive Field Reduction in Ferroelectric Hafnia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hafnia-based ferroelectrics hold promise for nonvolatile ferroelectric memory devices. However, the high coercive field required for polarization switching remains a prime obstacle to their practical applications. A notable reduction in coercive field has been achieved in ferroelectric Hf(Zr)$_{1+x}$O$_2$ films with interstitial Hf(Zr) dopants [Science 381, 558 (2023)], suggesting a less-explored strategy for coercive field optimization. Supported by density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate the $Pca2_1$ phase, with a moderate concentration of interstitial Hf dopants, serves as a minimal model to explain the experimental observations, rather than the originally assumed rhombohedral phase. Large-scale deep potential molecular dynamics simulations suggest that interstitial defects promote the polarization reversal by facilitating $Pbcn$-like mobile 180$^\circ$ domain walls. A simple pre-poling treatment could reduce the switching field to less than 1 MV/cm and enable switching on a subnanosecond timescale. High-throughput calculations reveal a negative correlation between the switching barrier and dopant size and identify a few promising interstitial dopants for coercive field reduction.</description>

      <title>Designing Superionic Conductors Using Tetrahedrally Packed Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of advanced energy storage solutions, the crystal structure of ionic conductors plays a pivotal role in facilitating ion transport. The conventional structural design principle that compounds with the body-centered cubic (BCC) anionic frameworks have high ionic conductivity is well known. We have extended the conventional design principle by uncovering that many of the anionic frameworks of Ag-ion conductors are characterized by tetrahedrally packed (TP) structures. Leveraging our findings, we have virtually screened TP framework compounds, uncovering their intrinsic potential for superior ionic conductivity through first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. Our design principle is applicable to Ag$^+$ and other mobile ions, including Li$^+$ and F$^-$. We proposed the Met2Ion method to generate ionic crystal structures using metal crystal structures as templates and demonstrated that new ionic conductors with TP frameworks can be discovered. This work paves the way for the discovery and development of next-generation energy storage materials with enhanced performance.</description>

      <title>A narrow band finite element method for the level set equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A finite element method is introduced to track interface evolution governed by the level set equation. The method solves for the level set indicator function in a narrow band around the interface. An extension procedure, which is essential for a narrow band level set method, is introduced based on a finite element $L^2$- or $H^1$-projection combined with the ghost-penalty method. This procedure is formulated as a linear variational problem in a narrow band around the surface, making it computationally efficient and suitable for rigorous error analysis. The extension method is combined with a discontinuous Galerkin space discretization and a BDF time-stepping scheme. The paper analyzes the stability and accuracy of the extension procedure and evaluates the performance of the resulting narrow band finite element method for the level set equation through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Tensor Networks for Lattice Gauge Theories beyond one dimension: a Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network methods are a class of numerical tools and algorithms to study many-body quantum systems in and out of equilibrium, based on tailored variational wave functions. They have found significant applications in simulating lattice gauge theories approaching relevant problems in high-energy physics. Compared to Monte Carlo methods, they do not suffer from the sign problem, allowing them to explore challenging regimes such as finite chemical potentials and real-time dynamics. Further development is required to tackle fundamental challenges, such as accessing continuum limits or computations of large-scale quantum chromodynamics. In this work, we review the state-of-the-art of Tensor Network methods and discuss a possible roadmap for algorithmic development and strategies to enhance their capabilities and extend their applicability to open high-energy problems. We provide tailored estimates of the theoretical and computational resource scaling for attacking large-scale lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Simulating anharmonic crystals: Lights and shadows of first-principles approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and simulating the thermodynamic and dynamical properties of materials affected by strong ionic anharmonicity is a central challenge in material science. Two powerful methodologies have emerged as frontrunners in this exploration: the Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) with its counterpart, Self-Consistent Phonons (SCP), and the Temperature-Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP). Despite their widespread use, the limitations of these methods are often overlooked, and the absence of a formal derivation for the TDEP has led to significant missteps that hamper its predictive accuracy.
  Here, the theoretical foundations of both SCHA and TDEP are revised, unveiling their profound interconnection. This work introduces formal derivation for TDEP, dispelling misconceptions about how to improve its accuracy and refining best practices. The perturbative limit of these methods uncovers that both SCHA and TDEP fall short in reproducing the lowest-order perturbative free energy. While TDEP excels in providing an exact treatment of the static susceptibility, its dynamical extension violates the perturbative regime by overcounting anharmonicity. Conversely, SCHA delivers an approximate static susceptibility but maintains correct static and dynamic response functions within the perturbative limit.
  This work introduces a corrective strategy for TDEP's dynamical extension to address these shortcomings. All the claims provided here are benchmarked against the exact (numerical) solution on a simple one-dimensional anharmonic potential.</description>

      <title>Controlling Plasmonic Catalysis via Strong Coupling with Electromagnetic Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic excitations decay within femtoseconds, leaving non-thermal (often referred to as "hot") charge carriers behind that can be injected into molecular structures to trigger chemical reactions that are otherwise out of reach -- a process known as plasmonic catalysis. In this Letter, we demonstrate that strong coupling between resonator structures and plasmonic nanoparticles can be used to control the spectral overlap between the plasmonic excitation energy and the charge injection energy into nearby molecules. Our atomistic description couples real-time density-functional theory self-consistently to Maxwell's equations via the radiation-reaction potential. Control over the resonator provides then an additional knob for non-intrusively enhancing plasmonic catalysis and dynamically reacting to deterioration of the catalyst -- a new facet of modern catalysis.</description>

      <title>`Interaction annealing' to determine effective quantized valence and orbital structure: an illustration with ferro-orbital order in WTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly correlated materials are known to display qualitatively distinct emergent behaviors at low energy. Conveniently, the superposition principle of quantum mechanics ensures that, upon absorbing quantum fluctuation, these rich low-energy behaviors can always be effectively described by dressed particles with fully quantized charge, spin, and orbitals structure. Such a powerful and simple description is, however, difficult to access through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, since in terms of bare particles the quantum fluctuation would heavily smear the quantized quantities. To address this difficulty, we propose an `interaction annealing' approach to decipher the dominant valence and orbital structure by suppressing the charge fluctuation through enhancing ionic charging energy. Applying this approach to ferroelectric semi-metal WTe${_2}$ as a demonstration, we identify a dominant ferro-orbital ordered structure with W ion in a $d^2$ spin-0 configuration. The proposed approach is straightforward to implement in standard DFT calculations to grant additional access to essential low-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics-informed super-resolution of scarce temporal dynamics data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method to increase the resolution of measurements of a physical system and subsequently predict its time evolution using thermodynamics-aware neural networks. Our method uses adversarial autoencoders, which reduce the dimensionality of the full order model to a set of latent variables that are enforced to match a prior, for example a normal distribution. Adversarial autoencoders are seen as generative models, and they can be trained to generate high-resolution samples from low-resoution inputs, meaning they can address the so-called super-resolution problem. Then, a second neural network is trained to learn the physical structure of the latent variables and predict their temporal evolution. This neural network is known as an structure-preserving neural network. It learns the metriplectic-structure of the system and applies a physical bias to ensure that the first and second principles of thermodynamics are fulfilled. The integrated trajectories are decoded to their original dimensionality, as well as to the higher dimensionality space produced by the adversarial autoencoder and they are compared to the ground truth solution. The method is tested with two examples of flow over a cylinder, where the fluid properties are varied between both examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present TriMe++, a multi-threaded software library designed for generating two-dimensional meshes for intricate geometric shapes using the Delaunay triangulation. Multi-threaded parallel computing is implemented throughout the meshing procedure, making it suitable for fast generation of large-scale meshes. Three iterative meshing algorithms are implemented: the DistMesh algorithm, the centroidal Voronoi diagram meshing, and a hybrid of the two. We compare the performance of the three meshing methods in TriMe++, and show that the hybrid method retains the advantages of the other two. The software library achieves significant parallel speedup when generating a large mesh with $10^6$ points. TriMe++ can handle complicated geometries and generates adaptive meshes of high quality.</description>
