      <title>Two-Level Priority Coding for Resilience to Arbitrary Blockage Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-reliable low-latency communication is essential in mission-critical settings, including military applications, where persistent and asymmetric link blockages caused by mobility, jamming, or adversarial attacks can disrupt delay-sensitive transmissions. This paper addresses this challenge by deploying a multilevel diversity coding (MDC) scheme that controls the received information, offers distinct reliability guarantees based on the priority of data streams, and maintains low design and operational complexity as the number of network paths increases. For two priority levels over three edge-disjoint paths, the complete capacity region is characterized, showing that superposition coding achieves the region in general, whereas network coding is required only in a specific corner case. Moreover, sufficient conditions under which a simple superposition coding scheme achieves the capacity for an arbitrary number of paths are identified. To prove these results and provide a unified analytical framework, the problem of designing high-performing MDC schemes is shown to be equivalent to the problem of designing high-performing encoding schemes over a class of broadcast networks, referred to as combination networks in the literature.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Aware DoA Detection Relying on a Single Rydberg Atomic Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A polarization-aware direction-of-arrival (DoA) detection scheme is conceived that leverages the intrinsic vector sensitivity of a single Rydberg atomic vapor cell to achieve quantum-enhanced angle resolution. Our core idea lies in the fact that the vector nature of an electromagnetic wave is uniquely determined by its orthogonal electric and magnetic field components, both of which can be retrieved by a single Rydberg atomic receiver via electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)-based spectroscopy. To be specific, in the presence of a static magnetic bias field that defines a stable quantization axis, a pair of sequential EIT measurements is carried out in the same vapor cell. Firstly, the electric-field polarization angle is extracted from the Zeeman-resolved EIT spectrum associated with an electric-dipole transition driven by the radio frequency (RF) field. Within the same experimental cycle, the RF field is then retuned to a magnetic-dipole resonance, producing Zeeman-resolved EIT peaks for decoding the RF magnetic-field orientation. This scheme exhibits a dual yet independent sensitivity on both angles, allowing for precise DoA reconstruction without the need for spatial diversity or phase referencing. Building on this foundation, we derive the quantum Fisher-information matrix (QFIM) and obtain a closed-form quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (QCRB) for the joint estimation of polarization and orientation angles. Finally, simulation results spanning various quantum parameters validate the proposed approach and identify optimal operating regimes. With appropriately chosen polarization and magnetic-field geometries, a single vapor cell is expected to achieve sub-0.1$^\circ$ angle resolution at moderate RF-field driving strengths.</description>

      <title>Blind Deconvolution of Nonstationary Graph Signals over Shift-Invariant Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate blind deconvolution of nonstationary graph signals from noisy observations, transmitted through an unknown shift-invariant channel. The deconvolution process assumes that the observer has access to the covariance structure of the original graph signals. To evaluate the effectiveness of our channel estimation and blind deconvolution method, we conduct numerical experiments using a temperature dataset in the Brest region of France.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Information Geometry: Characterization of Fr\'echet Means of Gaussian Fields in Poisson Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for distributed inference, semantic communication, and exploration in spatial networks by integrating stochastic geometry with information geometry - a direction that has not been explored in prior literature. Specifically, we study the problem of estimating and aggregating a field of Gaussian distributions indexed by a spatial Poisson point process (PPP), under both the Fisher--Rao and 2-Wasserstein geometries. We derive non-asymptotic concentration bounds and Palm deviations for the empirical Fr\'echet mean, thereby quantifying the geometric uncertainty induced by spatial randomness. Building on these results, we demonstrate applications to wireless sensor networks, where our framework provides geometry-aware aggregation methods that downweight unreliable sensors and rigorously characterize estimation error under random deployment. Further, we extend our theory to semantic communications, proposing compression protocols that guarantee semantic fidelity via distortion bounds on Fr\'echet means under PPP sampling. Finally, we introduce the \texttt{Fr\'echet-UCB} algorithm for multi-armed bandit problems with heteroscedastic Gaussian rewards. This algorithm combines upper confidence bounds with a geometry-aware penalty reflecting deviation from the evolving Fr\'echet mean, and we derive regret bounds that exploit geometric structure. Simulations validate the theoretical predictions across wireless sensor networks, semantic compression tasks, and bandit environments, highlighting scalability, robustness, and improved decision-making. Our results provide a principled mathematical foundation for geometry-aware inference, semantic communication, and exploration in distributed systems with statistical heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Analog Secure Distributed Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present secure distributed matrix multiplication (SDMM) schemes over the complex numbers with good numerical stability and small mutual information leakage by utilizing polynomial interpolation with roots of unity. Furthermore, we give constructions utilizing the real numbers by first encoding the real matrices to smaller complex matrices using a technique we call complexification. These schemes over the real numbers enjoy many of the benefits of the schemes over the complex numbers, including good numerical stability, but are computationally more efficient. To analyze the numerical stability and the mutual information leakage, we give some bounds on the condition numbers of Vandermonde matrices whose evaluation points are roots of unity.</description>

      <title>Average Achievable Rate Analysis of Cell-Free Massive MIMO in the Finite Blocklength Regime with Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17615v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acquiring perfect channel state information (CSI) introduces substantial challenges in cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems, primarily due to the large dimensionality of channel parameters, especially under ultra-reliable low-latency communication (uRLLC) constraints. Furthermore, the impact of imperfect CSI on the average achievable rate within the finite blocklength regime remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, this paper proposes a novel analytical framework that provides a closed-form expression for the average achievable rate with imperfect CSI in the Laplace domain. We demonstrate analytically that both the channel dispersion and the expected channel capacity can be expressed explicitly in terms of the Laplace transform of the large-scale fading component. Numerical simulations confirm that the derived expressions match closely with Monte Carlo simulations, verifying their accuracy. Furthermore, we theoretically show that although imperfect CSI degrades performance in the finite blocklength regime, the inherent characteristics of CF-mMIMO architecture effectively mitigates this loss.</description>

      <title>Two-Timescale Learning for Pilot-Free ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pilot-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is investigated, in which phase-modulated continuous wave (PMCW) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) waveforms are co-designed to achieve simultaneous target sensing and data transmission. To enhance effective data throughput (i.e., Goodput) in PMCW-NOMA ISAC systems, we propose a deep learning-based receiver architecture, termed two-timescale Transformer (T3former), which leverages a Transformer architecture to perform joint channel estimation and multi-user signal detection without the need for dedicated pilot signals. By treating the deterministic structure of the PMCW waveform as an implicit pilot, the proposed T3former eliminates the overhead associated with traditional pilot-based methods. The proposed T3former processes the received PMCW-NOMA signals on two distinct timescales, where a fine-grained attention mechanism captures local features across the fast-time dimension, while a coarse-grained mechanism aggregates global spatio-temporal dependencies of the slow-time dimension. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed T3former significantly outperforms traditional successive interference cancellation (SIC) receivers, which avoids inherent error propagation in SIC. Specifically, the proposed T3former achieves a substantially lower bit error rate and a higher Goodput, approaching the theoretical maximum capacity of a pilot-free system.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Detection of RIS-based Spoofing in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key feature of next-generation 6G wireless systems, allowing them to achieve high data rates and sensing accuracy. While prior research has primarily focused on addressing communication safety in ISAC systems, the equally critical issue of sensing safety remains largely under-explored. In this paper, the possibility of spoofing the sensing function of ISAC in vehicle networks is examined, whereby a malicious reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed to compromise the sensing functionality of a roadside unit (RSU). For this scenario, the requirements on the malicious RIS' phase shifts design and number of reflecting elements are analyzed. Under such spoofing, the practical estimation bias of the vehicular user (VU)'s Doppler shift and angle-of-departure (AoD) for an arbitrary time slot is analytically derived. Moreover, from the attacker's view, a Markov decision process (MDP) is formulated to optimize the RIS' phase shifts design. The goal of this MDP is to generate complete and plausible fake trajectories by incorporating the concept of spatial-temporal consistency. To defend against this sensing spoofing attack, a signal temporal logic (STL)-based neuro-symbolic attack detection framework is proposed and shown to learn interoperable formulas for identifying spoofed trajectories.</description>

      <title>Notes on Deterministic and Stochastic Approaches in Electromagnetic Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between the Number of Degrees of Freedom ($N_{\rm DoF}$) of the field in deterministic and stochastic source models within Electromagnetic Information Theory (EIT). Our findings demonstrate a fundamental connection between these two approaches. Specifically, we show that a deterministic model and a stochastic model with a spatially incoherent and homogeneous source yield not only the same $N_{\rm DoF}$ but also identical eigenvalues and basis functions for field representation. This key equivalence not only explains the effectiveness of deterministic approaches in EIT but also corroborates the use of classical electromagnetic methods within this new discipline.</description>

      <title>Rao Differential Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has recently emerged as a definition of privacy to release private estimates. DP calibrates noise to be on the order of an individuals contribution. Due to the this calibration a private estimate obscures any individual while preserving the utility of the estimate. Since the original definition, many alternate definitions have been proposed. These alternates have been proposed for various reasons including improvements on composition results, relaxations, and formalizations. Nevertheless, thus far nearly all definitions of privacy have used a divergence of densities as the basis of the definition. In this paper we take an information geometry perspective towards differential privacy. Specifically, rather than define privacy via a divergence, we define privacy via the Rao distance. We show that our proposed definition of privacy shares the interpretation of previous definitions of privacy while improving on sequential composition.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Prediction in the Fractional Fourier Domain with Adaptive Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate spectrum prediction is crucial for dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and resource allocation. However, due to the unique characteristics of spectrum data, existing methods based on the time or frequency domain often struggle to separate predictable patterns from noise. To address this, we propose the Spectral Fractional Filtering and Prediction (SFFP) framework. SFFP first employs an adaptive fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) module to transform spectrum data into a suitable fractional Fourier domain, enhancing the separability of predictable trends from noise. Subsequently, an adaptive Filter module selectively suppresses noise while preserving critical predictive features within this domain. Finally, a prediction module, leveraging a complex-valued neural network, learns and forecasts these filtered trend components. Experiments on real-world spectrum data show that the SFFP outperforms leading spectrum and general forecasting methods.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning and Matrix Completion-aided IoT Network Localization in the Outlier Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep learning and matrix completion aided approach for recovering an outlier contaminated Euclidean distance matrix D in IoT network localization. Unlike conventional localization techniques that search the solution over a whole set of matrices, the proposed technique restricts the search to the set of Euclidean distance matrices. Specifically, we express D as a function of the sensor coordinate matrix X that inherently satisfies the unique properties of D, and then jointly recover D and X using a deep neural network. To handle outliers effectively, we model them as a sparse matrix L and add a regularization term of L into the optimization problem. We then solve the problem by alternately updating X, D, and L. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique can recover the location information of sensors accurately even in the presence of outliers.</description>

Abstract: Consider the problem of distributed binary hypothesis testing with two terminals, where the decision is made at one of them (the "receiver"). We study the exponent of the error probability of the second type. Previously, an achievable exponent was derived by Shimokawa, Han, and Amari using a "quantization and binning" scheme. We propose a simple modification on the receiver's decision rule in this scheme to attain a better exponent.</description>

      <title>Capacity and IAPR Analysis for MIMO Faster-than-Nyquist Signaling with High Acceleration Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling is a non-orthogonal transmission technique offering a promising solution for future generations of communications. This paper studies the capacity of FTN signaling in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels for high acceleration factors. In our previous study [1], we found the capacity for MIMO FTN channels if the acceleration factor is larger than a certain threshold, which depends on the bandwidth of the pulse shape used. In this paper, we extend the capacity analysis to acceleration factors smaller than this mentioned threshold. In addition to capacity, we conduct peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) analysis and simulation for MIMO FTN for varying acceleration factors for both Gaussian and QPSK symbol sets. Our analysis reveals important insights about transmission power and received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) variation in FTN. As the acceleration factor approaches 0, if the transmission power is fixed, the received SNR diminishes, or if the received SNR is fixed, PAPR at the transmitter explodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noisy channels are a foundational resource for constructing cryptographic primitives such as string commitment and oblivious transfer. The noisy channel model has been extended to unfair noisy channels, where adversaries can influence the parameters of a memoryless channel. In this work, we introduce the unstructured noisy channel model as a generalization of the unfair noisy channel model to allow the adversary to manipulate the channel arbitrarily subject to certain entropic constraints. We present a string commitment protocol with established security and derive its achievable commitment rate, demonstrating the feasibility of commitment against this stronger class of adversaries. Furthermore, we show that the entropic constraints in the unstructured noisy channel model can be derived from physical assumptions such as noisy quantum storage. Our work thus connects two distinct approaches to commitment, i.e., the noisy channel and physical limitations.</description>

      <title>Making it to First: The Random Access Problem in DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Random Access Problem in DNA storage, which addresses the challenge of retrieving a specific information strand from a DNA-based storage system. In this framework, the data is represented by $k$ information strands which represent the data and are encoded into $n$ strands using a linear code. Then, each sequencing read returns one encoded strand which is chosen uniformly at random. The goal under this paradigm is to design codes that minimize the expected number of reads required to recover an arbitrary information strand. We fully solve the case when $k=2$, showing that the best possible code attains a random access expectation of $1+\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}+1}\approx 0.914\cdot 2$ for $q$ large enough. Moreover, we generalize a construction from~\cite{GMZ24}, specifically to $k=3$, for any value of $k$. Our construction uses $B_{k-1}$ sequences over $\mathbb{Z}_{q-1}$, that always exist over large finite fields. We show that for every $k\geq 4$, this generalized construction outperforms all previous constructions in terms of reducing the random access expectation.</description>

      <title>A DPI-PAC-Bayesian Framework for Generalization Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14795v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified Data Processing Inequality PAC-Bayesian framework -- abbreviated DPI-PAC-Bayesian -- for deriving generalization error bounds in the supervised learning setting. By embedding the Data Processing Inequality (DPI) into the change-of-measure technique, we obtain explicit bounds on the binary Kullback-Leibler generalization gap for both R\'enyi divergence and any $f$-divergence measured between a data-independent prior distribution and an algorithm-dependent posterior distribution. We present three bounds derived under our framework using R\'enyi, Hellinger \(p\) and Chi-Squared divergences. Additionally, our framework also demonstrates a close connection with other well-known bounds. When the prior distribution is chosen to be uniform, our bounds recover the classical Occam's Razor bound and, crucially, eliminate the extraneous \(\log(2\sqrt{n})/n\) slack present in the PAC-Bayes bound, thereby achieving tighter results. The framework thus bridges data-processing and PAC-Bayesian perspectives, providing a flexible, information-theoretic tool to construct generalization guarantees.</description>

      <title>Optimal Beamforming for Bistatic MIMO Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the beamforming optimization for sensing a point-like scatterer using a bistatic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) radar, which could be part of a joint communication and sensing system. The goal is to minimize the Cram\'er-Rao bound on the target position's estimation error, where the radar already knows an approximate position that is taken into account in the optimization. The optimization considers multiple subcarriers, and permits beamforming with more than one beam per subcarrier. We discuss the properties of optimal beamforming solutions, including the case of a known channel gain. Numerical results show that beamforming with at most one beam per subcarrier is optimal for certain parameters, but for other parameters, optimal solutions need two beams on some subcarriers. In addition, the degree of freedom which end of the bistatic radar should transmit and receive in a bidirectional radar is considered.</description>

      <title>Sliding DFT-based Signal Recovery for Modulo ADC with 1-bit Folding Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The modulo analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is a promising solution to resolve the limited dynamic range (DR) issue of conventional ADCs and achieve an enhanced digital resolution given a fixed quantization bit budget. However, a modulo ADC requires an unfolding scheme to correct the nonlinear distortion introduced by the modulo operation. This paper presents a sliding discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based method for fast signal reconstruction given the modulo ADC output sequence and a 1-bit folding information sequence. In contrast to existing DFT-based signal recovery techniques for modulo ADCs, our proposed sliding DFT method reduces the required observation time and minimizes the spectral leakage effects via proper choice of window function parameters. A mean squared error (MSE) performance guarantee is established for the proposed signal recovery algorithm. More precisely, we derive sufficient conditions for the oversampling factor ($\mathrm{OF}$) and the number of quantization bits ($b$) to obtain a specific MSE performance. Our numerical results demonstrate that modulo ADCs equipped with our proposed recovery method can outperform conventional ADCs without modulo for $\mathrm{OF} \geq 4$ and $b \geq 4$. Moreover, the proposed sliding DFT-based recovery method outperforms higher-order difference-based recovery in terms of MSE, particularly in the low-sampling-rate and low-resolution regime. The impact of spectral leakage on the MSE performance of the proposed sliding DFT recovery method is also quantified.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air DPD and Reciprocity Calibration in Massive MIMO and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-linear transceivers and non-reciprocity of downlink and uplink channels are two major challenges in the deployment of massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We consider an over-the-air (OTA) approach for digital pre-distortion (DPD) and reciprocity calibration to jointly address these issues. In particular, we consider a memory-less non-linearity model for the base station (BS) transmitters, and we propose a method to perform both linearization and reciprocity calibration based on mutual coupling OTA measurements between BS antennas. We show that, by using only the OTA-based data, we can linearize the transmitters and design the calibration to compensate for both the non-linearity and non-reciprocity of BS transceivers. This allows alleviating the requirement to have dedicated hardware modules for transceiver linearization. Moreover, the proposed reciprocity calibration method is solely based on closed-form linear transformations, achieving a significant complexity reduction over state-of-the-art reciprocity methods, which assume linear transceivers, and rely on iterative methods. Simulation results showcase the potential of our approach in terms of the calibration matrix estimation error and downlink data-rates when applying zero-forcing (ZF) precoding after using our OTA-based DPD and reciprocity calibration method.</description>

      <title>A $k^{\frac{q}{q-2}}$ Lower Bound for Odd Query Locally Decodable Codes from Bipartite Kikuchi Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A code $C \colon \{0,1\}^k \to \{0,1\}^n$ is a $q$-query locally decodable code ($q$-LDC) if one can recover any chosen bit $b_i$ of the message $b \in \{0,1\}^k$ with good confidence by querying a corrupted string $\tilde{x}$ of the codeword $x = C(b)$ in at most $q$ coordinates. For $2$ queries, the Hadamard code is a $2$-LDC of length $n = 2^k$, and this code is in fact essentially optimal. For $q \geq 3$, there is a large gap in our understanding: the best constructions achieve $n = \exp(k^{o(1)})$, while prior to the recent work of [AGKM23], the best lower bounds were $n \geq \tilde{\Omega}(k^{\frac{q}{q-2}})$ for $q$ even and $n \geq \tilde{\Omega}(k^{\frac{q+1}{q-1}})$ for $q$ odd.
  The recent work of [AGKM23] used techniques from semirandom XOR refutation to prove a lower bound of $n \geq \tilde{\Omega}(k^3)$ for $q = 3$, thus achieving the "$k^{\frac{q}{q-2}}$ bound" for an odd value of $q$. However, their proof does not extend to any odd $q \geq 5$. In this paper, we prove a $q$-LDC lower bound of $n \geq \tilde{\Omega}(k^{\frac{q}{q-2}})$ for any odd $q$. Our key technical idea is the use of an imbalanced bipartite Kikuchi graph, which gives a simpler method to analyze spectral refutations of odd arity XOR without using the standard "Cauchy-Schwarz trick", a trick that typically produces random matrices with nontrivially correlated entries and makes the analysis for odd arity XOR significantly more complicated than even arity XOR.</description>

      <title>A new measure of dependence: Integrated $R^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new measure of dependence that quantifies the degree to which a random variable $Y$ depends on a random vector $X$. This measure is zero if and only if $Y$ and $X$ are independent, and equals one if and only if $Y$ is a measurable function of $X$. We introduce a simple and interpretable estimator that is comparable in ease of computation to classical correlation coefficients such as Pearson's, Spearman's, or Chatterjee's. Building on this coefficient, we develop a model-free variable selection algorithm, feature ordering by dependence (FORD), inspired by FOCI. FORD requires no tuning parameters and is provably consistent under suitable sparsity assumptions. We demonstrate its effectiveness and improvements over FOCI through experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Modeling Probabilistic Reduction using Information Theory and Naive Discriminative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study compares probabilistic predictors based on information theory with Naive Discriminative Learning (NDL) predictors in modeling acoustic word duration, focusing on probabilistic reduction. We examine three models using the Buckeye corpus: one with NDL-derived predictors using information-theoretic formulas, one with traditional NDL predictors, and one with N-gram probabilistic predictors. Results show that the N-gram model outperforms both NDL models, challenging the assumption that NDL is more effective due to its cognitive motivation. However, incorporating information-theoretic formulas into NDL improves model performance over the traditional model. This research highlights a) the need to incorporate not only frequency and contextual predictability but also average contextual predictability, and b) the importance of combining information-theoretic metrics of predictability and information derived from discriminative learning in modeling acoustic reduction.</description>

      <title>On an entropy inequality for quadratic forms and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Frostman conditions for bivariate random variables and study discretized entropy sum-product phenomena in both independent and dependent regimes.
  In the independent setting, we show that for any non-degenerate rational quadratic form $\phi(x,y)$ and $0&lt;s&lt;1$, there exists some positive constant $\epsilon = \epsilon(\phi,s)$ such that any independent marginally $(s,C;s,C)$-Frostman random variable $(X,Y)$ satisfies
  $$\max\left\{H_n(X+Y),\,H_n(\phi(X,Y))\right\} \ge n(s+\epsilon)$$ for sufficiently large $n$. The proof introduces a novel multi-step entropy framework, combining the submodularity formula, the discretized entropy Balog-Szemer\'{e}di-Gowers theorem, and state-of-the-art results on the Falconer distance problem, to reduce general forms to a diagonal core case.
  In the dependent setting, we obtain analogous bounds for special polynomials. As an application, we derive that there exists $\epsilon=\epsilon(s)&gt;0$ such that, for any $\delta$-separated set $A\subset [0, 1]$ of cardinality $\delta^{-s}$ satisfying some non-concentration condition and any subset $G\subseteq A\times A$ with $|G|\geq \delta^\epsilon |A|^2$, the $\delta$-covering numbers satisfy $$ E_\delta(A+_GA) + E_\delta(\alpha \cdot A^{\wedge 2}+_G \beta\cdot A^{\wedge 2}) \gg_{\alpha,\beta,s} C^{-O_s(1)}\delta^{-\epsilon}|A|, $$ whenever $\delta$ is small enough.</description>

      <title>SGD Convergence under Stepsize Shrinkage in Low-Precision Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-precision training has become crucial for reducing the computational and memory costs of large-scale deep learning. However, quantizing gradients introduces magnitude shrinkage, which can change how stochastic gradient descent (SGD) converges. In this study, we explore SGD convergence under a gradient shrinkage model, where each stochastic gradient is scaled by a factor \( q_k \in (0,1] \). We show that this shrinkage affect the usual stepsize \( \mu_k \) with an effective stepsize \( \mu_k q_k \), slowing convergence when \( q_{\min} &lt; 1 \). With typical smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions, we prove that low-precision SGD still converges, but at a slower pace set by \( q_{\min} \), and with a higher steady error level due to quantization effects. We analyze theoretically how lower numerical precision slows training by treating it as gradient shrinkage within the standard SGD convergence setup.</description>

      <title>Understanding Action Effects through Instrumental Empowerment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is crucial to understand individual agent behaviors. While prior work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward signals, it is unclear how to infer agent contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted solely by analyzing the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment. Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies by assessing their decision (un)certainty and preference alignment. By analyzing action effects on policies and value functions across cooperative and competitive MARL tasks, our method identifies which agent behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices, while also revealing the extent to which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. Our proposed method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances explainability in MARL systems.</description>
