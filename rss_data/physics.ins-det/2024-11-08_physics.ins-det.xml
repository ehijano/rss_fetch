      <title>Optimizing Neon-based Gas Mixtures for Two-stage Amplification Fast-timing Micromegas Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working gas components significantly impact the performance of gaseous detectors. A fast-timing Micromegas detector with two-stage amplification is prone to notable deterioration of uniformity when scaled up. This paper presents a simulation study based on Garfield++ that aims to enhance the performance of such detectors by exploring different gas mixtures. The properties of various gas compositions and their impact on detector performance including gain uniformity and time resolution were investigated in the simulation study. The gain uniformity and single-photon time resolution of the detector were evaluated in tests using a multi-channel PICOSEC Micromegas (MM) prototype with different gas mixtures. The experimental results are consistent with the findings of the simulation. Both simulation and experimental results indicate that a higher concentration of neon improves the detector's gain uniformity, while the impact of gas mixtures on time resolution should also be considered as a critical performance indicator. The study presented in this paper offers valuable insights for improving uniformity in large-area PICOSEC MM detectors and optimizing overall performance.</description>

      <title>Recent results on the low-pressure GEM-based TPC at an Accelerator Mass Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Accelerator Mass Spectrometry technique makes it possible to measure rare long-lived isotopes such as $^{10}$Be, $^{14}$C, $^{26}$Al, $^{36}$Cl, $^{41}$Ca and $^{129}$I. The content of these isotopes can be at the level of 10$^{-15}$ of the total element content. The Accelerator Mass Spectrometer developed by Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (BINP AMS) successfully measures the concentration of $^{14}$C relative $^{12}$C. However, there is a problem of separating the $^{10}$B isobaric background from $^{10}$Be. Beryllium-10 is used to date geological objects on a time scale from 1 thousand years to 10 million years.
  To solve this problem we have proposed a new technique for ion identification based on measuring both ion track ranges and ion energies in a low-pressure Time-Projection Chamber (TPC) with Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) readout. We have developed the TPC with a dedicated thin silicon nitride window for an efficient passage of ions. To begin with, the characteristic of the low-pressure TPC were studied in isobutane at a pressure of 50 torr using alpha particle sources.
  In this work, we set up the low-pressure TPC on BINP AMS facility and successfully measured track ranges and energies of ions from samples containing $^{14}$C. At the next stage, we are going to carry out measurements with samples containing $^{10}$Be. However, using the obtained results and SRIM simulation we have already shown that the isobaric boron and beryllium ions can be separated by more than 5 sigma. This technique is proposed to be applied in AMS for dating geological objects, namely for geochronology of Cenozoic era.</description>

      <title>Towards Real Time Compton Imaging in Demanding Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compton cameras are radiation detectors that provide spatial information on the origin of the {\gamma}-ray sources based on the Compton scattering effect. Many applications require these detectors to be used at high counting rate. As such, the preprocessing of the detections as well as the imaging algorithms are required to be time-efficient in order for the data to be processed in real time. In this work, optimizations to the preprocessing of events in Compton cameras based on monolithic crystals, with special focus on event identification, were implemented using a parallelizable algorithm. Regarding imaging, an established 3D back projection algorithm was parallelized and implemented using SYCL. The parallel implementation of the algorithm was included without and with several optimizations such as the pre-computing values, discarding low impact contributions based on angle, and selecting an efficient shape of the image universe. The implementations were tested with Intel CPUs, GPUs, and NVIDIA GPUs. An outlook into the study of algorithms to reconstruct the position of interaction within Compton cameras based on monolithic crystals into segmented regions and other next steps is included.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent direct detection of neutrinos at the LHC has opened a new window on high-energy particle physics and highlighted the potential of forward physics for groundbreaking discoveries. In the last year, the physics case for forward physics has continued to grow, and there has been extensive work on defining the Forward Physics Facility and its experiments to realize this physics potential in a timely and cost-effective manner. Following a 2-page Executive Summary, we present the status of the FPF, beginning with the FPF's unique potential to shed light on dark matter, new particles, neutrino physics, QCD, and astroparticle physics. We summarize the current designs for the Facility and its experiments, FASER2, FASER$\nu$2, FORMOSA, and FLArE, and conclude by discussing international partnerships and organization, and the FPF's schedule, budget, and technical coordination.</description>

      <title>Differential absorption ozone Lidar with 4H-SiC single-photon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential absorption Lidar (DIAL) in the ultraviolet (UV) region is an effective approach for monitoring tropospheric ozone. 4H-SiC single-photon detectors (SPDs) are emergent devices for UV single-photon detection. Here, we demonstrate a 4H-SiC SPD-based ozone DIAL. We design and fabricate the 4H-SiC single-photon avalanche diode with a beveled mesa structure and optimized layer thickness. An active quenching circuit with a quenching time of 1.03 ns is developed to significantly mitigate the afterpulsing effect while enhancing the maximum count rate. After characterization, the SPD exhibits excellent performance with a photon detection efficiency of 16.6% at 266 nm, a dark count rate of 138 kcps, a maximum count rate of 13 Mcps, and an afterpulse probability of 2.7% at room temperature. Then, we apply two 4H-SiC SPDs in an ozone DIAL. The measured ozone concentrations at altitudes of 1-3.5 km agree well with the results of a commercial ozone DIAL. Our work provides an alternative solution for general UV Lidar applications.</description>

      <title>An Accessible Instrument for Measuring Soft Material Mechanical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15036v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft material research has seen significant growth in recent years, with emerging applications in robotics, electronics, and healthcare diagnostics where understanding material mechanical response is crucial for precision design. Traditional methods for measuring nonlinear mechanical properties of soft materials require specially sized samples that are extracted from their natural environment to be mounted on the testing instrument. This has been shown to compromise data accuracy and precision in various soft and biological materials. To overcome this, the Volume Controlled Cavity Expansion (VCCE) method was developed. This technique tests soft materials by controlling the formation rate of a liquid cavity inside the materials at the tip of an injection needle, and simultaneously measuring the resisting pressure which describes the material response. Despite VCCE's early successes, expansion of its application beyond academia has been hindered by cost, size, and expertise. In response to this, the first portable, bench-top instrument utilizing VCCE is presented here. This device, built with affordable, readily available components and open-source software, streamlines VCCE experimentation without sacrificing performance or precision. It is especially suitable for space-limited settings and designed for use by non-experts, promoting widespread adoption. The instrument's efficacy was demonstrated through testing Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) samples of varying stiffness. This study not only validates instrument performance, but also sets the stage for further advancements and broader applications in soft material testing. All data, along with acquisition, control, and post-processing scripts, are made available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Material Screening at Boulby Underground Laboratory with XIA UltraLo-1800 Alpha Particle Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Boulby UnderGround Screening (BUGS) facility, located at the Boulby Underground Laboratory, has significantly advanced its material screening capabilities by installing two XIA UltraLo-1800 alpha particle detectors. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of one of these detectors, operated 1,100 meters underground at the Boulby Underground Laboratory, which provides significant shielding from cosmic radiation and maintains a low ambient radon activity of 2.30 $\pm$ 0.03 Bq/m$^3$. Our evaluation focuses on energy reconstruction accuracy, background radiation rates, and operational stability. The XIA UltraLo-1800 detector demonstrates remarkable stability in energy reconstruction, with less than 0.1 MeV variation over four years. Moreover, the implementation of a graphite-filled PTFE liner in the sample tray resulted in a significant reduction in background radiation levels compared to measurements with the original stainless steel tray, achieving an average activity of 0.15 $\pm$ 0.01 $\alpha$/cm$^2$/khr. Copper sample assays, performed before and after radon exposure, demonstrated the detector's ability to accurately identify and quantify $^{210}$Po contamination. By implementing the robust cleanliness procedures and protocols described in this article, we observed a reduction in $^{210}$Po activity from 0.504 $\pm$ 0.022 mBq to 0.336 $\pm$ 0.013 mBq, highlighting the crucial role of refined cleaning methods in minimizing background for sensitive experiments. Additionally, observations of elevated background activity levels post-high-activity sample measurements illustrate the need for careful management of assay conditions and environment to maintain low background levels. These results highlight the potential of the XIA UltraLo-1800 in enhancing the precision of material assays essential for reducing background interference in rare event experiments.</description>
