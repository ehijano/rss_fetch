      <title>A Differentiable Model of Nucleic Acid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing physics-based models for molecular simulation requires fitting many unknown parameters to experimental datasets of diverse properties. Fitting such diverse data is typically carried out piecemeal, resulting in a "zoo" of disconnected but highly related models. Here, we leverage recently developed methods for computing low-variance gradient estimates with automatic differentiation to facilitate the extensible, reproducible, and transparent fitting of the physics-based DNA model oxDNA. We demonstrate simultaneous fitting to structural, mechanical, and thermodynamic data using a variety of techniques, including enhanced sampling, external forcing, cluster-move Monte Carlo schemes, and micro- and millisecond timescales, and fit oxDNA to a range of target properties, such as twist-stretch couplings and duplex melting temperatures. We also demonstrate how gradients can serve as an efficient means of sensitivity analysis through which we uncover the surprising importance of the cross-stacking interaction in oxDNA. Though grounded in oxDNA, this work provides a framework for extensible, community-driven force field development more generally that will yield rapidly improved models and subsequent physical insights for systems ranging from RNA to protein to their interactions with inorganic materials.</description>

      <title>A trade-off between hydrodynamic performance and morphological bias limits the evolution of symmetric lattice animal wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bristled and membranous insect wings have co-evolved despite apparently serving the same functionality. We emulate flight physics using an automated free-fall experiment to better understand how and why several distinct wing forms may have developed. Biomimetic two-dimensional lattice animals were laser cut from a continuous sheet of paper, and their descent in a settling tank was tracked using a camera. Data from 31 generic symmetric polyominos (1,692 experiments) reveal that morphology impacts the drag coefficient $C_D$ and hence flight efficiency. Some polyominos rapidly sediment while others remain suspended for longer. Positioning the search for an optimal shape within an evolutionary context, we relinquished control of the automated setup to a genetic algorithm. Hereditary information passes between generations in proportion to fitness and is augmented by rare mutations. High-performing morphologies are observed, but {experimental repeats do} not re-evolve the same shapes. Adaptation rates also differ if the selective pressure is reversed from suspension to sedimentation. Our data (50,086 experiments) reveal several physical sources of indeterminism in the simulated natural selection process, including fluid flow variability and morphological entropy. This provides experimental support for the idea that the lack of convergence in insect wing shape may partly reflect the competition between fitness and entropy, making it nearly impossible to achieve unique optimal forms.</description>

      <title>Aerodynamic Significance of Mass Distribution on Samara Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Samaras, a distinct category of fruit, are composed of heavier seeds and lighter wings. Diversity in morphologies and structures subtly contributes to the flight patterns of various seeds, thereby serving as a key factor in the reproductive strategies of plants. To explore the mechanisms underlying various samara flight behaviors, we proposed an effective scheme by manipulating the mass distribution on a plate to mimic various three-dimensional descent behaviors of samaras. Through this framework, we experimentally identified and characterized four distinct flight modes. The three-dimensional vortical structures were then numerically analyzed to gain insights into the samara-inspired flight behaviors. Our study demonstrates how strategic mass distribution in samaras leads to diverse flight behaviors that leverage vortices to enhance seed dispersal, offering a fresh perspective for the design of biomimetic fliers.</description>

      <title>Pheromone-Guided Navigation of Potential Mates: A Distinct Exploration Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Animals, especially insects, navigate their environments using complex strategies that integrate responses to chemical signals such as pheromones. The relative importance an insect places on foraging, finding a mate or other tasks can significantly influence its movement patterns. This study uncovers the distinct exploration strategies that emerge when these priorities vary. A new model is introduced that explicitly treats a pair of insects and their response to each other's pheromones. The strategy results in dynamics that exhibit characteristic anomalous scaling in displacement and non-Gaussian distributions of position; specifically, compressed exponential distributions for the number of encounters and the total duration of encounters. Our model not only elucidates these emergent behaviours but also provides insight into optimizing encounter frequencies. These strategies can be inverted to design pheromone-based traps for luring target species to specific areas for removal. The model is also applicable more broadly to pairs of agents that both respond to the paths traced by themselves and each other.</description>

      <title>Effect of Parametric Variation of Chordae Tendineae Structure on Simulated Atrioventricular Valve Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many approaches have been used to model chordae tendineae geometries in finite element simulations of atrioventricular heart valves. Unfortunately, current "functional" chordae tendineae geometries lack fidelity that would be helpful when informing clinical decisions. The objectives of this work are (i) to improve synthetic chordae tendineae geometry fidelity to consider branching and (ii) to define how the chordae tendineae geometry affects finite element simulations of valve closure. In this work, we develop an open-source method to construct synthetic chordae tendineae geometries in the SlicerHeart Extension of 3D Slicer. The generated geometries are then used in FEBio finite element simulations of atrioventricular valve function to evaluate how variations in chordae tendineae geometry influence valve behavior. Effects are evaluated using functional and mechanical metrics. Our findings demonstrated that altering the chordae tendineae geometry of a stereotypical mitral valve led to changes in clinically relevant valve metrics and valve mechanics. Specifically, cross sectional area had the most influence over valve closure metrics, followed by chordae tendineae density, length, radius and branches. We then used this information to showcase the flexibility of our new workflow by altering the chordae tendineae geometry of two additional geometries (mitral valve with annular dilation and tricuspid valve) to improve finite element predictions. This study presents a flexible, open-source method for generating synthetic chordae tendineae with realistic branching structures. Further, we establish relationships between the chordae tendineae geometry and valve functional/mechanical metrics. This research contribution helps enrich our open-source workflow and brings the finite element simulations closer to use in a patient-specific clinical setting.</description>

      <title>Noise-driven odd elastic waves in living chiral active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral active matter is predicted to exhibit odd elasticity, with nontraditional elastic response arising from a combination of chirality, being out of equilibrium, and the presence of nonreciprocal interactions. One of the resulting phenomena is the possible occurrence of odd elastic waves in overdamped systems, although its experimental realization still remains elusive. Here we show that in overdamped active systems, noise is required to generate persistent elastic waves. In the chiral crystalline phase of active matter, such as that found recently in populations of swimming starfish embryos, the noise arises from self-driving of active particles and their mutual collisions, a key factor that has been missing in previous studies. We identify the criterion for the occurrence of noise-driven odd elastic waves, and postulate the corresponding phase diagram for the general chiral active crystals. Our results can be used to predict the experimental conditions for achieving a transition to self-sustained elastic waves in overdamped active systems.</description>

      <title>Liquid Hopfield model: retrieval and localization in heterogeneous liquid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18853v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological mixtures, such as the cellular cytoplasm, are composed of a large number of different components. From this heterogeneity, ordered mesoscopic structures emerge, such as liquid phases with controlled composition. These structures compete with each other for the same components. This raises several questions, such as what types of interactions allow the retrieval of multiple ordered mesoscopic structures, and what are the physical limitations for the retrieval of said structures. In this work, we develop an analytically tractable model for liquids capable of retrieving states with target compositions. We name this model the liquid Hopfield model in reference to corresponding work in the theory of associative neural networks. By solving this model, we show that non-linear repulsive interactions are necessary for retrieval of target structures. We demonstrate that this is because liquid mixtures at low temperatures tend to transition to phases with few components, a phenomenon that we term localization. Taken together, our results demonstrate a trade-off between retrieval and localization phenomena in liquid mixtures.</description>

      <title>Building rigid networks with prestress and selective pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biopolymer networks from the intracellular to tissue scale display high rigidity and tensile stress while having coordinations well below the normal threshold for mechanical rigidity. The elastic filaments in these networks are often severed by enzymes in a tension-inhibited manner. The effects of such pruning on the mechanics of prestressed networks have not been studied. We show that networks pruned by a tension-inhibited method remain rigid at much lower coordinations than randomly pruned ones. These findings suggest a possible reason for the repeated evolution of tension-inhibited filament-severing proteins.</description>

      <title>Doob's Lagrangian: A Sample-Efficient Variational Approach to Transition Path Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rare event sampling in dynamical systems is a fundamental problem arising in the natural sciences, which poses significant computational challenges due to an exponentially large space of trajectories. For settings where the dynamical system of interest follows a Brownian motion with known drift, the question of conditioning the process to reach a given endpoint or desired rare event is definitively answered by Doob's h-transform. However, the naive estimation of this transform is infeasible, as it requires simulating sufficiently many forward trajectories to estimate rare event probabilities. In this work, we propose a variational formulation of Doob's h-transform as an optimization problem over trajectories between a given initial point and the desired ending point. To solve this optimization, we propose a simulation-free training objective with a model parameterization that imposes the desired boundary conditions by design. Our approach significantly reduces the search space over trajectories and avoids expensive trajectory simulation and inefficient importance sampling estimators which are required in existing methods. We demonstrate the ability of our method to find feasible transition paths on real-world molecular simulation and protein folding tasks.</description>
