      <title>"I forgot the formula:" How students can use coherence to reconstruct a (partially) forgotten equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introductory physics instruction emphasizes fluency with routine problem-solving procedures. However, even when applying these procedures, students frequently encounter challenges. This paper investigates how students navigate such moments when answering qualitative E&amp;M problems in interviews. Students frequently noted they had partially forgotten a key equation on a problem involving RC circuits. We present focal cases that show how coherence-seeking approaches were employed to overcome this problem-solving challenge. In attempts to reconstruct these equations, participants were guided by identifying and chaining qualitative dependencies and seeking coherence between qualitative and mathematical understanding of the physical system. These moments of forgetting and reconstructing equations are a useful site for studying broader physics learning goals. While prior work investigates the use of mathematical sensemaking by examining how students respond to explicit prompts, our cases illustrate how students can spontaneously use mathematical sensemaking strategies. We reflect on these cases to consider how such adaptive reasoning can be a target for instruction and assessment.</description>

      <title>Multimodal large language models and physics visual tasks: comparative analysis of performance and costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) capable of processing both text and visual inputs are increasingly being explored for uses in physics education, such as tutoring, formative assessment, and grading. This study evaluates a range of publicly available MLLMs on a set of standardized, image-based physics research-based conceptual assessments (concept inventories). We benchmark 15 models from three major providers (Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI) across 102 physics items, focusing on two main questions: (1) How well do these models perform on conceptual physics tasks involving visual representations? and (2) What are the financial costs associated with their use? The results show high variability in both performance and cost. The performance of the tested models ranges from around 76\% to as low as 21\%. We also found that expensive models do not always outperform cheaper ones and that, depending on the demands of the context, cheaper models may be sufficiently capable for some tasks. This is especially relevant in contexts where financial resources are limited or for large-scale educational implementation of MLLMs. By providing these analyses, our aim is to inform teachers, institutions, and other educational stakeholders so that they can make evidence-based decisions about the selection of models for use in AI-supported physics education.</description>

      <title>Gender Imbalance in Physics Education and Employment in Germany: Trends and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gender imbalance among German physicists persists, with fewer women in advanced degrees and research leadership roles. Although female enrollment in Physics programs increased slightly until 2022, potentially influenced by COVID-19 the long-term trend remains uncertain. Despite the rise in female Ph.D. students and foreign representation, female professors in Physics and Astronomy stagnated below 14 %, indicating significant underrepresentation. Anticipated revisions to the WissZeitVG law may impact female mainstreaming efforts, potentially leading to greater precarization of research staff. Women make up only around 20 % of employed physicists, with low visibility in the community, as seen in the representation of female physicists in prestigious awards. Addressing this imbalance requires structural interventions beyond mere encouragement and empowerment.</description>

      <title>An Accessible Planar Charged Particle Trap for Experiential Learning in Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe an inexpensive and accessible instructional setup that explores particle trapping with a planar linear ion trap. The planar trap is constructed using standard printed circuit board manufacturing and is designed to trap macroscopic charged particles in air. Trapping, shuttling, and splitting are demonstrated to students using these particles, which are visible to the naked eye. Students control trap voltages and can compare properties of particle motion with an analytic model of the trap using a computer vision program for particle tracking. Learning outcomes include understanding the design considerations for planar AC traps, mechanisms underpinning particle ejection, the physics of micromotion, and methods of data analysis using standard computer vision libraries.</description>
