      <title>Optimization and Dynamic Analysis of a Vibro-Impact Nonlinear Energy Sink with Electromagnetic Coil for Vibration Suppression and Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates a system comprising a linear oscillator (LO) equipped with a Vibro-Impact Nonlinear Energy Sink (VI-NES) and a coil. The LO's damping and stiffness coefficients are represented by ( C ) and ( k ), respectively, while a ball inside the LO moves within a cavity, colliding with the walls at both ends. The primary focus is on optimizing the cavity length (( L_c )) and the coefficient of restitution (( \kappa )) and coil parameter () using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The motion equations for the LO incorporating the VI-NES are derived, considering the electromagnetic force (( F_e )) and contact force (( F_c )). The study also explores the energy harvesting circuit, which generates electric power by connecting a load resistance to the coil, transforming mechanical energy into electrical energy. The dynamic behavior of the system is analyzed, highlighting the transition from predictable patterns to chaotic responses. Efficiency metrics are defined to measure the VI-NES's performance in absorbing and dissipating excitation energy. The optimization formulation addresses the influence of initial conditions, proposing a multi-objective approach to handle uncertainties. Validation against existing studies confirms the reliability of the proposed optimization method. The results demonstrate that optimizing both ( L_c ) and ( \kappa ) using GA effectively minimizes the amplitude response of the LO, outperforming approximate methods.</description>

      <title>Singular bifurcations in a slow-fast modified Leslie-Gower model with Holling type II functional response, weak Allee effect and a generalist predator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a predator-prey system with a generalist Leslie-Gower predator, a functional Holling type II response, and a weak Allee effect on the prey. The prey's population often grows much faster than its predator, allowing us to introduce a small time scale parameter $\varepsilon$ that relates the growth rates of both species, giving rise to a slow-fast system. Zhu and Liu (2022) show that, in the case of the weak Allee effect, Hopf singular bifurcation, slow-fast canard cycles, relaxation oscillations, etc., exist. Our main contribution lies in the rigorous analysis of a degenerate scenario organized by a (degenerate) transcritical bifurcation. The key tool employed is the blow-up method that desingularizes the degenerate singularity. In addition, we determine the criticality of the singular Hopf bifurcation using recent intrinsic techniques that do not require a local normal form. The theoretical analysis is complemented by a numerical bifurcation analysis, in which we numerically identify and analytically confirm the existence of a nearby Takens-Bogdanov point.</description>

      <title>Gibbs states and Brownian models for coexisting haze and cloud droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cloud microphysics studies include how tiny cloud droplets grow, and become rain. This is crucial for understanding cloud properties like size, lifespan, and impact on climate through radiative effects. Small, weak-updraft clouds near the haze-to-cloud transition are especially difficult to measure and understand. They are abundant but hard to capture by satellites. K\"ohler's theory explains initial droplet growth but struggles with large particle groups. Here, we present a stochastic, analytical framework building on K\"ohler's theory to account for (monodisperse) aerosols and cloud droplets interaction through competitive growth in a limited water vapor field. These interactions are modeled by sink terms while fluctuations in supersaturation affecting droplet growth are modeled by nonlinear, white noise terms. Our results identify hysteresis mechanisms in the droplet activation and deactivation processes. Our approach allows for multimodal cloud's droplet size distributions supported by lab experiments, offering a new perspective on haze-to-cloud transition and small cloud formation.</description>

      <title>Prediction Beyond the Medium Range with an Atmosphere-Ocean Model that Combines Physics-based Modeling and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential of a hybrid modeling approach that combines machine learning (ML) with conventional physics-based modeling for weather prediction beyond the medium range. It extends the work of Arcomano et al. (2022), which tested the approach for short- and medium-range weather prediction, and the work of Arcomano et al. (2023), which investigated its potential for climate modeling. The hybrid model used for the forecast experiments of the paper is based on the low-resolution, simplified parameterization atmospheric general circulation model SPEEDY. In addition to the hybridized prognostic variables of SPEEDY, the model has three purely ML-based prognostic variables: the 6h cumulative precipitation, the sea surface temperature, and the heat content of the top 300m deep layer of the ocean (a new addition compared to the model used in Arcomano et al., 2023). The model has skill in predicting the El Nino cycle and its global teleconnections with precipitation for 3-7 months depending on the season. The model captures equatorial variability of the precipitation associated with Kelvin and Rossby waves and MJO. Predictions of the precipitation in the equatorial region have skill for 15 days in the East Pacific and 11.5 days in the West Pacific. Though the model has low spatial resolution, for these tasks it has prediction skill comparable to what has been published for high-resolution, purely physics-based, conventional, operational forecast models.</description>
