      <title>Chemical Evolution of R-process Elements in Stars (CERES) II. The impact of stellar evolution and rotation on light and heavy elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are the most abundant elements throughout the universe, after hydrogen and helium. Studying these elements in low-metallicity stars can provide crucial information on the chemical composition in the early Galaxy and possible internal mixing processes that can alter the surface composition of the stars. Aims. This work aims to investigate the chemical abundance patterns for CNO elements and Li in a homogeneously analyzed sample of 52 metal-poor halo giant stars. Methods. We used high-resolution spectra with a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) to carry out a spectral synthesis to derive detailed C, N, O, and Li abundances for a sample of stars with metallicities in the range of -3.58 &lt;= [Fe/H] &lt;= -1.79 dex. Our study was based on the assumption of one-dimensional (1D) local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) atmospheres. Results. Based on carbon and nitrogen abundances, we investigated the deep mixing taking place within stars along the red giant branch (RGB). The individual abundances of carbon decrease towards the upper RGB while nitrogen shows an increasing trend, indicating that carbon has been converted into nitrogen. No signatures of ON-cycle processed material were found for the stars in our sample. We computed a set of galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models, implementing different sets of massive star yields, both with and without including the effects of stellar rotation on nucleosynthesis. We confirm that stellar rotation is necessary to explain the highest [N/Fe] and [N/O] ratios observed in unmixed halo stars. The predicted level of N enhancement varies sensibly in dependence of the specific set of yields that are adopted. For stars with stellar parameters similar to those of our sample, heavy elements such as Sr, Y, and Zr appear to have unchanged abundances despite the stellar evolution mixing processes.</description>

      <title>X-Ray, UV, and Optical Observations of Proxima Centauri's Stellar Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proxima Cen (GJ 551; dM5.5e) is one of only about a dozen fully convective stars known to have a stellar cycle, and the only one to have long-term X-ray monitoring. A previous analysis found that X-ray and mid-UV observations, particularly two epochs of data from Swift, were consistent with a well sampled 7 yr optical cycle seen in ASAS data, but not convincing by themselves. The present work incorporates several years of new ASAS-SN optical data and an additional five years of Swift XRT and UVOT observations, with Swift observations now spanning 2009 to 2021 and optical coverage from late 2000. X-ray observations by XMM-Newton and Chandra are also included. Analysis of the combined data, which includes modeling and adjustments for stellar contamination in the optical and UV, now reveals clear cyclic behavior in all three wavebands with a period of 8.0 yr. We also show that UV and X-ray intensities are anti-correlated with optical brightness variations caused by the cycle and by rotational modulation, discuss possible indications of two coronal mass ejections, and provide updated results for the previous finding of a simple correlation between X-ray cycle amplitude and Rossby number over a wide range of stellar types and ages.</description>

      <title>The grazing angle icy protoplanetary disk PDS 453</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PDS 453 is a rare highly inclined disk where the stellar photosphere is seen at grazing incidence on the disk surface. Our goal is take advantage of this geometry to constrain the structure and composition of this disk, in particular the fact that it shows a 3.1 $\mu$m water ice band in absorption that can be related uniquely to the disk. We observed the system in polarized intensity with the VLT/SPHERE instrument, as well as in polarized light and total intensity using the HST/NICMOS camera. Infrared archival photometry and a spectrum showing the water ice band are used to model the spectral energy distribution under Mie scattering theory. Based on these data, we fit a model using the radiative transfer code MCFOST to retrieve the geometry and dust and ice content of the disk. PDS 453 has the typical morphology of a highly inclined system with two reflection nebulae where the disk partially attenuates the stellar light. The upper nebula is brighter than the lower nebula and shows a curved surface brightness profile in polarized intensity, indicating a ring-like structure. With an inclination of 80{\deg} estimated from models, the line-of-sight crosses the disk surface and a combination of absorption and scattering by ice-rich dust grains produces the water ice band. PDS 453 is seen highly inclined and is composed of a mixture of silicate dust and water ice. The radial structure of the disk includes a significant jump in density and scale height at a radius of 70 au in order to produce a ring-like image. The depth of the 3.1 $\mu$m water ice band depends on the amount of water ice, until it saturates when the optical thickness along the line-of-sight becomes too large. Therefore, quantifying the exact amount of water from absorption bands in edge-on disks requires a detailed analysis of the disk structure and tailored radiative transfer modeling.</description>

      <title>Solar p-modes excitation rate along the magnetic activity cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic cycles of solar-like stars influence their internal physics. Thus, the frequency, amplitude, excitation rate, and damping of the acoustic oscillation modes (p-modes) vary with the cycle over time. We need to understand the impact of magnetic activity on p-modes in order to characterise precisely stars that will be observed by the ESA PLATO mission, to be launched late 2026 with the objective to find Earth-like planets around solar-type stars. In this work, we investigate the variation of mode excitation in the Sun during Cycles 23, 24 and the beginning of Cycle 25. To do so, we analyse data obtained since 1996 by two instruments onboard the SoHO satellite: the GOLF spectrometer and the VIRGO sunphotometer. We use a method enabling us to reach a better temporal resolution than classical methods. Combining the variations of energy for several modes l=[0-2] in three frequency bands (i.e. [1800, 2450], [2450, 3110], [3110, 3790] {\mu}Hz), our preliminary results show that more energy is associated to several modes during cycle minima, suggesting that there could be a second source of excitation other than turbulent convection that would excite several modes at a time during solar minima.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical parameters associated to 'hot' stars in Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot stars, of spectral types O-, B-, and A-, represent a small fraction of the stars observed by the Gaia satellite. Their properties and the specifications of the on-board instruments make their identification challenging. In the Gaia DR3, 12, 104,577 targets have been assigned a temperature greater than 7500 K. It represents about 2.5 percent of the stars having an effective temperature value in the Gaia DR3 astrophysical parameters table. We review the results obtained by the Apsis modules, focusing on the effective temperature, surface gravity, interstellar extinction, and V sin i parameters.</description>

      <title>The impact of periastron passage on the X-ray and optical properties of the Symbiotic System R Aquarii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-epoch Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of the symbiotic system R Aquarii (R Aqr) spanning 22 yr are analysed by means of a reflection model produced by an accretion disc. This methodology helps dissecting the contribution from different components in the X-ray spectra of R Aqr: the soft emission from the jet and extended emission, the heavily-extinguished plasma component of the boundary layer and the reflection contribution, which naturally includes the 6.4 keV Fe fluorescent line. The evolution with time of the different components is studied for epochs between 2000 Sep and 2022 Dec, and it is found that the fluxes of the boundary layer and that of the reflecting component increase as the stellar components in R Aqr approach periastron passage, a similar behaviour is exhibited by the shocked plasma produced by the precessing jet. Using publicly available optical and UV data we are able to study the evolution of the mass-accretion rate $\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc}$ and the wind accretion efficiency $\eta$ during periastron. These exhibit a small degree of variability with median values of $\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc}$=7.3$\times10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and $\eta$=7$\times10^{-3}$. We compare our estimations with predictions from a modified Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion scenario.</description>

      <title>A Compact, Coherent Representation of Stellar Surface Variation in the Spectral Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-varying inhomogeneities on stellar surfaces constitute one of the largest sources of radial velocity (RV) error for planet detection and characterization. We show that stellar variations, because they manifest on coherent, rotating surfaces, give rise to changes that are complex but useably compact and coherent in the spectral domain. Methods for disentangling stellar signals in RV measurements benefit from modeling the full domain of spectral pixels. We simulate spectra of spotted stars using starry and construct a simple spectrum projection space that is sensitive to the orientation and size of stellar surface features. Regressing measured RVs in this projection space reduces RV scatter by 60-80% while preserving planet shifts. We note that stellar surface variability signals do not manifest in spectral changes that are purely orthogonal to a Doppler shift or exclusively asymmetric in line profiles; enforcing orthogonality or focusing exclusively on asymmetric features will not make use of all the information present in the spectra. We conclude with a discussion of existing and possible implementations on real data based on the presented compact, coherent framework for stellar signal mitigation.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Contamination From Nearby Stellar Companions in Gaia DR3 Photometry</title>

Abstract: Identifying and removing binary stars from stellar samples is a crucial but complicated task. Regardless of how carefully a sample is selected, some binaries will remain and complicate interpretation of results, especially via flux contamination of survey photometry. One such sample is the data from the Gaia spacecraft, which is collecting photometry and astrometry of more than $10^{9}$ stars. To quantify the impact of binaries on Gaia photometry, we assembled a sample of known binary stars observed with adaptive optics and with accurately measured parameters, which we used to predict Gaia photometry for each stellar component. We compared the predicted photometry to the actual Gaia photometry for each system, and found that the contamination of Gaia photometry because of multiplicity decreases non-linearly from near-complete contamination ($\rho \leq 0''.15$) to no contamination (binary projected separation, or $\rho &gt; 0''.3$). We provide an analytic relation to analytically correct photometric bias in a sample of Gaia stars using the binary separation. This correction is necessary because the Gaia PSF photometry extraction does not fully remove the secondary star flux for binaries with separations with $\rho \lesssim 0''.3$. We also evaluated the utility of various Gaia quality-of-fit metrics for identifying binary stars and found that RUWE remains the best indicator for unresolved binaries, but multi-peak image fraction probes a separation regime not currently accessible to RUWE.</description>

      <title>The Role of Metallicity in the Chemical Evolution of Star-Forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interstellar chemistry in low-metallicity environments is crucial to unveil physical and chemical processes in the past Galaxy or those in high-redshift galaxies, where the metallicity was significantly lower compared to the present-day solar neighborhood. This is also important for the understanding of the diversity of the chemical evolution in various regions of our Galaxy. Nearby low-metallicity laboratories, such as the outskirts of our Galaxy, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, and the other gas-rich dwarf galaxies in the Local Group, will provide important insights for this purpose. In the last decade, there has been great progress in astrochemical studies of interstellar molecules in low-metallicity star-forming regions. Do molecular abundances simply scale with the metallicity? If not, which processes govern the chemistry in the low-metallicity interstellar medium? In this proceeding, I will discuss the role of metallicity in the chemical evolution of star-forming regions based on recent observations of interstellar molecules in low-metallicity environments.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary tracks of binary neutron star progenitors across cosmic times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of gravitational wave sources have advanced our knowledge about the formation of compact object binaries. At present, many questions about the stellar origins of binary neutron stars remain open. We explore the evolution of binary neutron star progenitors with the population synthesis code COSMIC. We identify three dominant evolutionary tracks to form neutron star binaries that merge within the age of the Universe: a scenario that includes a common envelope phase between the first neutron star and its companion, a scenario with almost equal-mass progenitors that evolve quasi-simultaneously and which features a double-core common envelope, and a scenario involving the accretion-induced collapse of an oxygen-neon white dwarf into a neutron star. We show that the distribution of time delays between stellar formation and binary neutron star merger at a given progenitor metallicity does not follow a power-law, but instead features a complex structure that reflects the progenitor properties and the relative contribution of each evolutionary track. We also explore the evolution of the merger rate density with redshift and show that the scenario involving the accretion-induced collapse could be dominant at high redshifts. These results can have important implications for the study of the chemical enrichment of galaxies in r-process elements produced in kilonovae; and of short gamma-ray bursts offsets in their host galaxies.</description>

      <title>SpectraFM: Tuning into Stellar Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models in astrophysics are often limited in scope and cannot adapt to data from new instruments or tasks. We introduce SpectraFM, a Transformer-based foundation model architecture that can be pre-trained on stellar spectra from any wavelength range and instrument. SpectraFM excels in generalization by combining flexibility with knowledge transfer from pre-training, allowing it to outperform traditional machine learning methods, especially in scenarios with limited training data. Our model is pre-trained on approximately 90k examples of synthetic spectra to predict the chemical abundances (Fe, Mg, O), temperature, and specific gravity of stars. We then fine-tune the model on real spectra to adapt it to observational data before fine-tuning it further on a restricted 100-star training set in a different wavelength range to predict iron abundance. Despite a small iron-rich training set of real spectra, transfer learning from the synthetic spectra pre-training enables the model to perform well on iron-poor stars. In contrast, a neural network trained from scratch fails at this task. We investigate the Transformer attention mechanism and find that the wavelengths receiving attention carry physical information about chemical composition. By leveraging the knowledge from pre-training and its ability to handle non-spectra inputs, SpectraFM reduces the need for large training datasets and enables cross-instrument and cross-domain research. Its adaptability makes it well-suited for tackling emerging challenges in astrophysics, like extracting insights from multi-modal datasets.</description>

      <title>Rubin ToO 2024: Envisioning the Vera C. Rubin Observatory LSST Target of Opportunity program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at Vera C. Rubin Observatory is planned to begin in the Fall of 2025. The LSST survey cadence has been designed via a community-driven process regulated by the Survey Cadence Optimization Committee (SCOC), which recommended up to 3% of the observing time to carry out Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations. Experts from the scientific community, Rubin Observatory personnel, and members of the SCOC were brought together to deliver a recommendation for the implementation of the ToO program during a workshop held in March 2024. Four main science cases were identified: gravitational wave multi-messenger astronomy, high energy neutrinos, Galactic supernovae, and small potentially hazardous asteroids possible impactors. Additional science cases were identified and briefly addressed in the documents, including lensed or poorly localized gamma-ray bursts and twilight discoveries. Trigger prioritization, automated response, and detailed strategies were discussed for each science case. This document represents the outcome of the Rubin ToO 2024 workshop, with additional contributions from members of the Rubin Science Collaborations. The implementation of the selection criteria and strategies presented in this document has been endorsed in the SCOC Phase 3 Recommendations document (PSTN-056). Although the ToO program is still to be finalized, this document serves as a baseline plan for ToO observations with the Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>No rungs attached: A distance-ladder free determination of the Hubble constant through type II supernova spectral modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ongoing discrepancy in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) estimates obtained through local distance ladder methods and early universe observations poses a significant challenge to the $\Lambda$CDM model, suggesting potential new physics. Type II supernovae (SNe II) offer a promising technique for determining $H_0$ in the local universe independently of the traditional distance ladder approach, opening up a complimentary path for testing this discrepancy. We aim to provide the first $H_0$ estimate using the tailored expanding photosphere method (EPM) applied to SNe II, made possible by recent advancements in spectral modelling that enhance its precision and efficiency. Our tailored EPM measurement utilizes a spectral emulator to interpolate between radiative transfer models calculated with TARDIS, allowing us to fit supernova spectra efficiently and derive self-consistent values for luminosity-related parameters. We apply the method on public data for ten SNe II at redshifts between 0.01 and 0.04. Our analysis demonstrates that the tailored EPM allows for $H_0$ measurements with precision comparable to the most competitive established techniques, even when applied to literature data not designed for cosmological applications. We find an independent $H_0$ value of $74.9\pm1.9$ (stat) km/s/Mpc, which is consistent with most current local measurements. Considering dominant sources of systematic effects, we conclude that our systematic uncertainty is comparable to or less than the current statistical uncertainty. This proof-of-principle study highlights the potential of the tailored EPM as a robust and precise tool for investigating the Hubble tension independently of the local distance ladder. Observations of SNe II tailored to $H_0$ estimation can make this an even more powerful tool by improving the precision and by allowing us to better understand and control systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Pre-outburst signal in the light curves of the recurrent novae RS Oph and T CrB</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-outburst signal (a decrease of the optical brightness) just before the outburst is clearly detected in the observations of the T CrB obtained before and during the 1946 outburst. A similar decrease is also visible in the light curve of RS Oph during the 2021 outburst. We suppose that this is due to formation of a thick, dense envelope around the white dwarf, and we estimate its size (1000 - 2000 km), mass (5.10$^{-8}$ - 6.10$^{-7}$ M$_\odot$) and average density (5 - 16 g cm$^{-3}$).</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Consistency and Characterizing the Confidence of Coronal Holes Detected by Active Contours without Edges (ACWE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronal Holes (CHs) are regions of open magnetic field lines, resulting in high speed solar wind. Accurate detection of CHs is vital for space weather prediction. This paper presents an intramethod ensemble for coronal hole detection based on the Active Contours Without Edges (ACWE) segmentation algorithm. The purpose of this ensemble is to develop a confidence map that defines, for all on disk regions of a Solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) image, the likelihood that each region belongs to a CH based on that region's proximity to, and homogeneity with, the core of identified CH regions. By relying on region homogeneity, and not intensity (which can vary due to various factors including line of sight changes and stray light from nearby bright regions), to define the final confidence of any given region, this ensemble is able to provide robust, consistent delineations of the CH regions. Using the metrics of global consistency error (GCE), local consistency error (LCE), intersection over union (IOU), and the structural similarity index measure (SSIM), the method is shown to be robust to different spatial resolutions maintaining a median IOU $&gt;0.75$ and minimum SSIM $&gt;0.93$ even when the segmentation process was performed on an EUV image decimated from $4096\times4096$ pixels down to $512\times512$ pixels. Furthermore, using the same metrics, the method is shown to be robust across short timescales, producing segmentation with a mean IOU of 0.826 from EUV images taken at a 1 hour cadence, and showing a smooth decay in similarity across all metrics as a function of time, indicating self-consistent segmentations even when corrections for exposure time have not been applied to the data. Finally, the accuracy of the segmentations and confidence maps are validated by considering the skewness (i.e., unipolarity) of the underlying magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Do the Earth, Jupiter and Mercury cause the sunspot cycles?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08317v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mainstream dynamo models predict that the sunspot cycle is stochastic. The official Solar Cycle Prediction Panel forecasts only the ongoing sunspot cycle because any forecast beyond one cycle is considered impossible. We analyse the sunspot data using the Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM). This method can detect many periodic signals superimposed on an arbitrary trend. The DCM detects the extremely significant 10, 11, and 11.86 years signals. Our Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) cross-check confirms that these signals are certainly real. We connect the detected signals to the Earth and Jupiter. Our deterministic DCM model predictions are longer and more accurate than the official Solar Cycle Prediction Panel forecast. The solar and planetary magnetic fields interact directly during the Flux Transfer Events (FTEs). We describe how these FTEs may cause "toroidal magnetic loops" in the Sun. If some physical mechanism amplifies the magnetic fields in these "toroidal magnetic loops", their accumulative effect may weaken the poloidal global solar dipole field, until it flips. This would give a relatively simple explanation for the sunspot cycle, the Hale's law, the sunspot pairs, the solar differential rotation and many other phenomena observed in the Sun. There are, however, three major astrophysical uncertainties. Can Cranmer and Saar (2007, Equation 2) estimate be applied to the FTEs? Can some FTE magnetic flux ropes transform into "toroidal magnetic loops"? Can some physical mechanism amplify the "toroidal magnetic loops"?</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic simulations of WD-WD mergers and the origin of RCB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of double white dwarf (DWD) mergers by performing hydrodynamic simulations using the new and improved adaptive mesh refinement code Octo-Tiger. We follow the orbital evolution of DWD systems of mass ratio q=0.7 for tens of orbits until and after the merger to investigate them as a possible origin for R Coronae Borealis (RCB) type stars. We reproduce previous results, finding that during the merger, the Helium WD donor star is tidally disrupted within 20-80 minutes since the beginning of the simulation onto the accretor Carbon-Oxygen WD, creating a high temperature shell around the accretor. We investigate the possible Helium burning in this shell and the merged object's general structure. Specifically, we are interested in the amount of Oxygen-16 dredged-up to the hot shell and the amount of Oxygen-18 produced. This is critical as the discovery of very low Oxygen-16 to Oxygen-18 ratios in RCB stars pointed out the merger scenario as a favorable explanation for their origin. A small amount of hydrogen in the donor may help keep the Oxygen-16 to Oxygen-18 ratios within observational bounds, even if moderate dredge-up from the accretor occurs. In addition, we perform a resolution study to reconcile the difference found in the amount of Oxygen-16 dredge-up between smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and grid-based simulations.</description>

      <title>Studying geometry of the ultraluminous X-ray pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 using X-ray and optical polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovery of pulsations from a number of ULXs proved that accretion onto neutron stars can produce luminosities exceeding the Eddington limit by several orders of magnitude. The conditions necessary to achieve such high luminosities as well as the exact geometry of the accretion flow in the neutron star vicinity are, however, a matter of debate. The pulse phase-resolved polarization measurements that became possible with the launch of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) can be used to determine the pulsar geometry and its orientation relative to the orbital plane. They provide an avenue to test different theoretical models of ULX pulsars. In this paper we present the results of three IXPE observations of the first Galactic ULX pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 during its 2023 outburst. We find strong variations in the polarization characteristics with the pulsar phase. The average polarization degree increases from about 5% to 15% as the flux dropped by a factor of three in the course of the outburst. The polarization angle (PA) as a function of the pulsar phase shows two peaks in the first two observations, but changes to a characteristic sawtooth pattern in the remaining data set. This is not consistent with a simple rotating vector model. Assuming the existence of an additional constant polarized component, we were able to fit the three observations with a common rotating vector model and obtain constraints on the pulsar geometry. In particular, we find the pulsar angular momentum inclination with respect to the line of sight of 15-40 deg, the magnetic obliquity of 60-80 deg, and the pulsar spin position angle of -50 deg, which significantly differs from the constant component PA of about 10 deg. Combining these X-ray measurements with the optical PA, we find evidence for at least a 30 deg misalignment between the pulsar angular momentum and the binary orbital axis.</description>

      <title>Formation of Sub-Chandrasekhar Mass Black Holes and Red Stragglers via Hawking Stars in Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Presently, primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass window from $10^{-16}$ M$_\odot$ to $10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ are a popular dark matter candidate. If they exist, some stars would capture them upon formation, and they would slowly accrete the star over gigayears. Such Hawking stars -- stars with a central PBH -- provide a novel channel for the formation of both sub-Chandrasekhar mass black holes as well as red straggler stars. Here we report on stellar evolution models that extend our previous work to Hawking stars with masses between 0.5 and 1.4 M$_\odot$. We explore three accretion schemes, and find that a wide range of PBHs in the asteroid-mass window can robustly accrete stars as small as 1 M$_\odot$ within the age of the Universe. This mechanism of producing sub-solar mass black holes is highly dependent on the assumed accretion physics and stellar metallicity. Lower-metallicity stars are generally accreted more rapidly, suggesting that it may be more likely for sub-Chandrasekhar mass Hawking stars formed in the early universe, such as those in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies, to transmute their star into a sub-Chandrasekhar mass black hole within a Hubble time. We present a stellar population synthesis of a Draco II-like UFD galaxy containing Hawking stars and show that the number of red stragglers they produce can qualitatively match the observed population \mb{for black hole seed masses around 10$^{-11}$ M$_\odot$ and under the assumption that they accrete with high radiative efficiency}.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Binary Planets within Star Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop analytical tools and perform three-body simulations to investigate the orbital evolution and dynamical stability of binary planets within star clusters. Our analytical results show that the orbital stability of a planetary-mass binary against passing stars is mainly related to its orbital period. Critical flybys, defined as stellar encounters with energy kicks comparable to the binary binding energy, can efficiently produce a wide range of semimajor axes ($a$) and eccentricities ($e$) from a dominant population of primordially tight JuMBOs. The critical flyby criterion we derived offers an improvement over the commonly used tidal radius criterion, particularly in high-speed stellar encounters. Applying our results to the recently discovered Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), our simulations suggest that to match the observed $\sim$9% wide binary fraction, an initial semimajor axis of $a_0 \sim$ 10-20 au and a density-weighted residence time of $\chi \gtrsim 10^4$ Myr pc$^{-3}$ are favored. These results imply that the JWST JuMBOs probably formed as tight binaries near the cluster core.</description>

      <title>Planet Migration in Windy Discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accretion of protoplanetary discs (PPDs) could be driven by MHD disc winds rather than turbulent viscosity. With a dynamical prescription for angular momentum transport induced by disc winds, we perform 2D simulations of PPDs to systematically investigate the rate and direction of planet migration in a windy disc. We find that the the strength of disc winds influences the corotation region similarly to the "desaturation" effect of viscosity. The magnitude and direction of torque depend sensitively on the hierarchy between the radial advection timescale across the horseshoe due to disc wind $\tau_{\rm dw}$, the horsehoe libration timescale $\tau_{\rm lib}$ and U-turn timescale $\tau_{\rm U-turn}$. Initially, as wind strength increases and the advection timescale shortens, a non-linear horseshoe drag emerges when $\tau_{\rm dw} \lesssim \tau_{\rm lib}$, which tends to drive strong outward migration. Subsequently, the drag becomes linear and planets typically still migrate inward when $\tau_{\rm dw} \lesssim \tau_{\rm U-turn} \sim \tau_{\rm lib}h$, where $h$ is the disc aspect ratio. For a planet with mass ratio of $\sim 10^{-5}$, the zone of outward migration sandwiched between inner and outer inward migration zones corresponds to $\sim $ 10-100 au in a PPD with accretion rates between $10^{-8}$ and $10^{-7}$ $M_\odot \text{yr}^{-1}$.</description>
