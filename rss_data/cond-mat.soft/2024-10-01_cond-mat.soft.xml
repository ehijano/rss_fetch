      <title>Plate theory for metric-constrained actuation of liquid crystal elastomer sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) marry the large deformation response of a cross-linked polymer network with the nematic order of liquid crystals pendent to the network. Of particular interest is the actuation of LCE sheets where the nematic order, modeled by a unit vector called the director, is specified heterogeneously in the plane of the sheet. Heating such a sheet leads to a large spontaneous deformation, coupled to the director design through a metric constraint that is now well-established by the literature. Here we go beyond the metric constraint and identify the full plate theory that underlies this phenomenon. Starting from a widely used bulk model for LCEs, we derive a plate theory for the pure bending deformations of patterned LCE sheets in the limit that the sheet thickness tends to zero using the framework of $\Gamma$-convergence. Specifically, after dividing the bulk energy by the cube of the thickness to set a bending scale, we show that all limiting midplane deformations with bounded energy at this scale satisfy the aforementioned metric constraint. We then identify the energy of our plate theory as an ansatz-free lower bound of the limit of the scaled bulk energy, and construct a recovery sequence that achieves this plate energy for all smooth enough midplane deformations. We conclude by applying our plate theory to a variety of examples.</description>

      <title>Coacervation drives morphological diversity of mRNA encapsulating nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial arrangement of components within an mRNA encapsulating nanoparticle has consequences for its thermal stability, which is a key parameter for therapeutic utility. The mesostructure of mRNA nanoparticles formed with cationic polymers have several distinct putative structures: here, we develop a field theoretic simulation model to compute the phase diagram for amphiphilic block copolymers that balance coacervation and hydrophobicity as driving forces for assembly. We predict several distinct morphologies for the mesostructure of these nanoparticles, depending on salt conditions and hydrophobicity. We compare our predictions with cryogenic-electron microscopy images of mRNA encapsulated by charge altering releasable transporters. In addition, we provide a GPU-accelerated, open-source codebase for general purpose field theoretic simulations, which we anticipate will be a useful tool for the community.</description>

      <title>Domain Growth Kinetics in Active Binary Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) in symmetric and asymmetric active binary mixtures. We start with the coarse-grained run-and-tumble bacterial model that provides evolution equations for the density fields $\rho_i(\vec r, t)$. Next, we study the phase separation dynamics by solving the evolution equations using the Euler discretization technique. We characterize the morphology of domains by calculating the equal-time correlation function $C(r, t)$ and the structure factor $S(k, t)$, both of which show dynamical scaling. The form of the scaling functions depends on the mixture composition and the relative activity of the species, $\Delta$. For $k\rightarrow\infty$, $S(k, t)$ follows Porod's law: $S(k, t)\sim k^{-(d+1)}$ and the average domain size $L(t)$ shows a diffusive growth as $L(t)\sim t^{1/3}$ for all mixtures.</description>

      <title>Molecular origin of slippery behaviour in tethered liquid layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slippery covalently attached liquid surfaces (SCALS) are a family of nanothin polymer layers with remarkably low static droplet friction, characterised by a low contact angle hysteresis (CAH$&lt; 5 \deg$), which makes them ideally suited to self-cleaning, water harvesting, and anti-fouling applications.
  Recently, a Goldilocks zone of lowest CAH has been identified for polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) SCALS of intermediate thickness (3.5 nm), yet, molecular-level insights are missing to reveal the underlying physical mechanism of this elusive, slippery optimum.
  In this work, the agreement between coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and atomic force microscopy data shows that nanoscale defects, as well as deformation for thicker layers, are key to explaining the existence of this `just right' regime. At low thickness values, insufficient substrate coverage gives rise to chemical patchiness; at large thickness values, two features appear: 1) a waviness forms on the surface of the liquid layer due to a previously overlooked lateral microphase separation occurring in polydisperse brushes, and 2) layer deformation due to the contact line is larger than in thinner layers. The most pronounced slippery behaviour occurs for smooth PDMS layers that do not exhibit nanoscale waviness. The converging insights from molecular simulations, experiments, and a contact angle hysteresis theory provide design guidelines for tethered polymer layers with ultra-low contact angle hysteresis.</description>

      <title>Response of Worm-like Chains to Traveling-Wave Active Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simplified theory for semiflexible flagella under the action of a traveling-wave perturbation that emulates the organized active forces generated by molecular motors, capable of inducing beating patterns to the filament. By modeling the flagellum as a worm-like chain (WLC), we explore the interplay (competition) between the externally applied perturbation and the intrinsic bending rigidity of the filament. Our analysis aims to understand how this interplay can lead to a selection of conformations with the spatiotemporal behavior resembling the beating dynamics of axonemes such as those in sperm tails, in Chlamydomonas cilia, or eukaryotic flagella in general. Through a systematic analysis of the WLC's response to traveling-wave perturbations, we try to identify the key parameters that mostly influence the flagellar motion and shape its beating-like profiles.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a hump in the cubic dielectric response of glycerol: a MD study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a direct determination of the cubic dielectric spectra of a realistic polar molecule, glycerol, from molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. From the liquid state to the mildly supercooled regime, we observed the emergence and growth of a hump in the cubic modulus, traditionally associated with collective effects in the dynamics. Its evolution follows that of dynamical correlations probed by the four-point susceptibility and its apparition at high temperature coincides with the onset of super-activation. We show that, for this system, the shape of cubic spectra is only weakly affected by dipolar cross-correlations. The good agreement with experimental observations, despite the difference in temperature range, demonstrates the relevance of this approach to help get an insight into the intricate effects probed by non-linear dielectric spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Growth of Stress-Responsive Bacteria in 3D Colonies under Confining Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study three-dimensional colonies of nonmotile stress-responsive bacteria growing under confining isotropic pressure in a nutrient-rich environment. We develop a novel simulation method to demonstrate how imposing an external pressure leads to a denser aggregate and strengthens the mechanical interactions between bacteria. Unlike rigid confinements that prevent bacterial growth, confining pressure acts as a soft constraint and allows colony expansion with a nearly linear long-term population growth and colony size. Enhancing the mechanosensitivity reduces instantaneous bacterial growth rates and the overall colony size, though its impact is modest compared to pressure for our studied set of biologically relevant parameter values. The doubling time grows exponentially at low mechanosensitivity or pressure in our bacterial growth model. We provide an analytical estimate of the doubling time and develop a population dynamics model consistent with our simulations. Our findings align with previous experimental results for E. coli colonies under pressure. Understanding the growth dynamics of stress-responsive bacteria under mechanical stresses provides insight into their adaptive response to varying environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Rigidity condition for gluing two bar-joint rigid graphs embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How does one determine if a collection of bars joined by freely rotating hinges cannot be deformed without changing the length of any of the bars? In other words, how does one determine if a bar-joint graph is rigid? This question has been definitively answered using combinatorial rigidity theory in two dimensions via the Geiringer-Laman Theorem. However, it has not yet been answered using combinatorial rigidity theory in higher dimensions, given known counterexamples to the trivial dimensional extension of the Geiringer-Laman Theorem. To work towards a combinatorial approach in dimensions beyond two, we present a theorem for gluing two rigid bar-joint graphs together that remain rigid. When there are no overlapping vertices between the two graphs, the theorem reduces to Tay's theorem used to identify rigidity in body-bar graphs. When there are overlapping vertices, we rely on the notion of pinned rigid graphs to identify and constrain rigid motions. This theorem provides a basis for an algorithm for recursively constructing rigid clusters that can be readily adapted for computational purposes. By leveraging Henneberg-type operations to grow a rigid (or minimally rigid) graph and treating simplices-where every vertex connects to every other vertex-as fundamental units, our approach offers a scalable solution with computational complexity comparable to traditional methods. Thus, we provide a combinatorial blueprint for algorithms in multi-dimensional rigidity theory as applied to bar-joint graphs.</description>

      <title>Normal viscosity and Viscous resuspension of non-Brownian suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.03718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Normal stresses in sheared suspensions of non-Brownian particles are obtained from numerical simulations in the viscous regime. The stresses are determined in homogeneous shear of non-buoyant particles and by analyzing shear-induced resuspension of buoyant particles in the framework of the suspension balance model (SBM). The consistency of both approaches indicates that the SBM describes the steady state properly. The results are in agreement with some earlier empirical expressions of the normal viscosity coefficients in limited ranges of particle volume fractions, but they appear to overestimate the stresses in the semi-dilute regime (solid fraction in the range 25-35\%). New expressions are proposed for. We show that these discrepancies can be due to inertial effects which appear at rather low particle Reynolds number. The results also highlight that the normal stress anisotropy depends on the volume fraction.</description>

      <title>Central role of filler-polymer interplay in nonlinear reinforcement of elastomeric nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoparticles can greatly enhance the mechanical response of elastomeric polymers essential to a wide range of applications, yet their precise molecular mechanisms of high-strain reinforcement remain largely unresolved. Here we show, based on molecular dynamics simulations, that high-strain reinforcement emerges from an interplay between granular nanoparticulate compressive behavior in the normal direction and polymer incompressibility. This feedback loop, which is initiated by a mismatch in the Poisson ratios of nanofiller and polymer, invokes a contribution from the polymer's bulk modulus to the elongational stress, while the tendency of the polymer to contract in the normal direction maintains a near-jammed filler state. This effect persists even once the direct filler elongational contribution becomes dissipative after the 'Payne effect' yield. These results indicate that direct particle-particle contact effects, even in the absence of potential augmenting mechanisms such as glassy polymer bridges, can drive the mechanical reinforcement effects typical of experimental systems.</description>

      <title>Theory for the Anomalous Phase Behavior of Inertial Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast to equilibrium systems, inertia can profoundly impact the phase behavior of active systems. This has been made particularly evident in recent years, with motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) exhibiting several intriguing dependencies on translational inertia. Here we report extensive simulations characterizing the phase behavior of inertial active matter and develop a mechanical theory for the complete phase diagram without appealing to equilibrium notions. Our theory qualitatively captures all aspects of liquid-gas coexistence, including the critical value of inertia above which MIPS ceases. Notably, our findings highlight that particle softness, and not inertia, is responsible for the MIPS reentrance effect at the center of a proposed active refrigeration cycle.</description>
