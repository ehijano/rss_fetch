      <title>Differential equations driven by Besov-Orlicz paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the article, the rough path theory is extended to cover paths from the exponential Besov-Orlicz space \[B^\alpha_{\Phi_\beta,q}\quad\mbox{ for }\quad \alpha\in (1/3,1/2],\,\quad \Phi_\beta(x) \sim \mathrm{e}^{x^\beta}-1\quad\mbox{with}\quad \beta\in (0,\infty), \quad\mbox{and}\quad q\in (0,\infty],\] and the extension is used to treat nonlinear differential equations driven by such paths. The exponential Besov-Orlicz-type spaces, rough paths, and controlled rough paths are defined and analyzed, a sewing lemma for such paths is given, and the existence and uniqueness of the solution to differential equations driven by these paths is proved. The results cover equations driven by paths of continuous local martingales with Lipschitz continuous quadratic variation (e.g.\ the Wiener process) or by paths of fractionally filtered Hermite processes in the $n$\textsuperscript{th} Wiener chaos with Hurst parameter $H\in (1/3,1/2]$ (e.g.\ the fractional Brownian motion).</description>

      <title>On support sets of the critical Liouville Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fractal properties of support sets of the critical Liouville Quantum Gravity (cLQG) associated with the Gaussian Free Field in planar domains. Specifically, we completely characterize the gauge functions $\phi$ (subject to mild monotonicity conditions) for which the cLQG admits a support set of finite $\phi$-Hausdorff measure. As a corollary, we settle the conjecture that the cLQG is supported on a set of vanishing Hausdorff dimension. Our proofs are based on the fact that the cLQG describes the near-critical level sets of Discrete Gaussian Free Field.</description>

      <title>Concentration bounds for stochastic systems with singular kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note is concerned with weakly interacting stochastic particle systems with possibly singular pairwise interactions. In this setting, we observe a connection between entropic propagation of chaos and exponential concentration bounds for the empirical measure of the system. In particular, we establish a variational upper bound for the probability of a certain rare event, and then use this upper bound to show that "controlled" entropic propagation of chaos implies an exponential concentration bound for the empirical measure. This connection allows us to infer concentration bounds for a class of singular stochastic systems through a simple adaptation of the arguments developed in Jabin and Wang (2018).</description>

      <title>Second-order differential operators, stochastic differential equations and Brownian motions on embedded manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We specify the conditions when a manifold M embedded in an inner product space E is an invariant manifold of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) on E, linking it with the notion of second-order differential operators on M. When M is given a Riemannian metric, we derive a simple formula for the Laplace-Beltrami operator in terms of the gradient and Hessian on E and construct the Riemannian Brownian motions on M as solutions of conservative Stratonovich and Ito SDEs on E. We derive explicitly the SDE for Brownian motions on several important manifolds in applications, including left-invariant matrix Lie groups using embedded coordinates. Numerically, we propose three simulation schemes to solve SDEs on manifolds. In addition to the stochastic projection method, to simulate Riemannian Brownian motions, we construct a second-order tangent retraction of the Levi-Civita connection using a given E-tubular retraction. We also propose the retractive Euler-Maruyama method to solve a SDE, taking into account the second-order term of a tangent retraction. We provide software to implement the methods in the paper, including Brownian motions of the manifolds discussed. We verify numerically that on several compact Riemannian manifolds, the long-term limit of Brownian simulation converges to the uniform distributions, suggesting a method to sample Riemannian uniform distributions</description>

      <title>Which exceptional low-dimensional projections of a Gaussian point cloud can be found in polynomial time?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $d$-dimensional standard Gaussian vectors $\boldsymbol{x}_1,\dots, \boldsymbol{x}_n$, we consider the set of all empirical distributions of its $m$-dimensional projections, for $m$ a fixed constant. Diaconis and Freedman (1984) proved that, if $n/d\to \infty$, all such distributions converge to the standard Gaussian distribution. In contrast, we study the proportional asymptotics, whereby $n,d\to \infty$ with $n/d\to \alpha \in (0, \infty)$. In this case, the projection of the data points along a typical random subspace is again Gaussian, but the set $\mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ of all probability distributions that are asymptotically feasible as $m$-dimensional projections contains non-Gaussian distributions corresponding to exceptional subspaces.
  Non-rigorous methods from statistical physics yield an indirect characterization of $\mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ in terms of a generalized Parisi formula. Motivated by the goal of putting this formula on a rigorous basis, and to understand whether these projections can be found efficiently, we study the subset $\mathscr{F}^{\rm alg}_{m,\alpha}\subseteq \mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ of distributions that can be realized by a class of iterative algorithms. We prove that this set is characterized by a certain stochastic optimal control problem, and obtain a dual characterization of this problem in terms of a variational principle that extends Parisi's formula.
  As a byproduct, we obtain computationally achievable values for a class of random optimization problems including `generalized spherical perceptron' models.</description>

      <title>Collapse of the Gibbs measure for the dynamical $\Phi^3_2$-models on the infinite volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\Phi^3_2$-measure in the infinite volume limit. This is the invariant measure for several stochastic partial differential equations including the parabolic and hyperbolic $\Phi^3_2$-models. In the large torus limit, we observe a concentration phenomenon of the $\Phi^3_2$-measure around zero, which is the single minimizer of the corresponding Hamiltonian for any fixed torus size. From our sharp estimates for the partition function, we obtain a triviality result for the $\Phi^3_2$-measure on infinite volume: the ensemble collapses onto a delta function on the zero field.</description>

      <title>The Phase Transition of the Voter Model on Dynamic Scale-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The voter model is a classical interacting particle system explaining consensus formation on a social network. Real social networks feature not only a heterogeneous degree distribution but also connections changing over time. We study the voter model on a rank one scale-free network evolving in time by each vertex \emph{updating} (refreshing its edge neighbourhood) at any rate $\kappa=\kappa(N)$.
  We find the dynamic giant component phase transition in the consensus time of the voter model: when $\kappa\ll \tfrac{1}{N}$, the subcritical graph parameters are slower by a factor of $\tfrac{N}{\log N}$. Conversely, when $\kappa \gg 1$ the effect of the giant is removed completely and so for either graph parameter case we see consensus time on the same order as in the static supercritical case (up to polylogarithmic corrections). The intermediate dynamic speeds produce consensus time for subcritical network parameters longer not by the previous factor $\tfrac{N}{\log N}$, but by the factor $\tfrac{1}{\kappa}$.</description>

      <title>Higher order approximation of nonlinear SPDEs with additive space-time white noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider strong approximations of $1+1$-dimensional stochastic PDEs driven by additive space-time white noise. It has been long proposed (Davie-Gaines '01, Jentzen-Kloeden '08), as well as observed in simulations, that approximation schemes based on samples from the stochastic convolution, rather than from increments of the underlying Wiener processes, should achieve significantly higher convergence rates with respect to the temporal timestep. The present paper proves this. For a large class of nonlinearities, with possibly superlinear growth, a temporal rate of (almost) $1$ is proved, a major improvement on the rate $1/4$ that is known to be optimal for schemes based on Wiener increments. The spatial rate remains (almost) $1/2$ as it is standard in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new model of textures, obtained as realizations of a new class of fractional Brownian fields. These fields, called weighted tensorized fractional Brownian fields, are obtained by a relaxation of the tensor-product structure that appears in the definition of fractional Brownian sheets. Statistical properties such as self-similarity, stationarity of rectangular increments and regularity properties are obtained. An operator scaling extension is defined and we provide simulations of the fields using their spectral representation.</description>

Abstract: The paper focuses on the Vasicek model driven by a tempered fractional Brownian motion. We derive the asymptotic distributions of the least-squares estimators (based on continuous-time observations) for the unknown drift parameters. This work continues the investigation by Mishura and Ralchenko (Fractal and Fractional, 8(2:79), 2024), where these estimators were introduced and their strong consistency was proved.</description>

      <title>Refined Horton-Strahler numbers I: a discrete bijection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Horton-Strahler number of a rooted tree $T$ is the height of the tallest complete binary tree that can be homeomorphically embedded in $T$. The number of full binary trees with $n$ internal vertices and Horton-Strahler number $s$ is known to be the same as the number of Dyck paths of length $2n$ whose height $h$ satisfies $\lfloor \log_2(1+h)\rfloor=s$.
  In this paper, we present a new bijective proof of the above result, that in fact strengthens and refines it as follows. We introduce a sequence of trees $(\tau_i,i \ge 0)$ which "interpolates" the complete binary trees, in the sense that $\tau_{2^h-1}$ is the complete binary tree of height $h$ for all $h \ge 0$, and $\tau_{i+1}$ strictly contains $\tau_i$ for all $i \ge 0$. Defining $\mathcal{S}(T)$ to be the largest $i$ for which $\tau_i$ can be homeomorphically embedded in $T$, we then show that the number of full binary trees $T$ with $n$ internal vertices and with $\mathcal{S}(T)=h$ is the same as the number of Dyck paths of length $2n$ with height $h$. (We call $\mathcal{S}(T)$ the refined Horton-Strahler number of $T$.)
  Our proof is bijective and relies on a recursive decomposition of binary trees (resp. Dyck paths) into subtrees with strictly smaller refined Horton-Strahler number (resp. subpaths with strictly smaller height). In a subsequent paper, we will show that the bijection has a continuum analogue, which transforms a Brownian continuum random tree into a Brownian excursion and under which (a continuous analogue of) the refined Horton-Strahler number of the tree becomes the height of the excursion.</description>

      <title>Particle Filter Optimization: A Bayesian Approach for Global Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel global optimization algorithm called Particle Filter Optimization (PFO), designed for a class of stochastic problems. PFO leverages the Bayesian inference framework of Particle Filters (PF) by integrating the optimization problem into the PF estimation process. In this context, the objective function replaces the measurement, and a customized transitional prior is developed to function as state dynamics. This dynamic replaces classic acquisition function and grants the PF a local optimization capability, facilitating its transformation towards global optimization. In PFO, the particles serve as agents in the optimization problem. Given the noisy nature of measured outputs, the Unscented Transform (UT) is utilized to estimate the true mean, thereby reducing the impact of erroneous information on particle transitions and weight updates. The algorithm is designed to minimize the introduction of unnecessary parameters and adheres to theoretically validated PF procedures, resulting in a robust heuristic algorithm supported by rigorous theoretical foundations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the famous Mack's model which gives an estimate for the mean square error of prediction of the chain ladder claims reserves. We introduce a stochastic differential equation driven by a Brownian motion to model accumulated total claims amount for the chain ladder method. Within this continuous-time framework, we propose a bootstrap technique for estimating the distribution of claims reserves. It turns out that our approach leads to inherently capturing asymmetry and non-negativity, eliminating the necessity for additional assumptions. We conclude with a case study and comparative analysis against alternative methodologies based on Mack's model.</description>

      <title>Entangled states are typically incomparable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a bipartite quantum system, where Alice and Bob jointly possess a pure state $|\psi\rangle$. Using local quantum operations on their respective subsystems, and unlimited classical communication, Alice and Bob may be able to transform $|\psi\rangle$ into another state $|\phi\rangle$. Famously, Nielsen's theorem [Phys. Rev. Lett., 1999] provides a necessary and sufficient algebraic criterion for such a transformation to be possible (namely, the local spectrum of $|\phi\rangle$ should majorise the local spectrum of $|\psi\rangle$).
  In the paper where Nielsen proved this theorem, he conjectured that in the limit of large dimensionality, for almost all pairs of states $|\psi\rangle, |\phi\rangle$ (according to the natural unitary invariant measure) such a transformation is not possible. That is to say, typical pairs of quantum states $|\psi\rangle, |\phi\rangle$ are entangled in fundamentally different ways, that cannot be converted to each other via local operations and classical communication.
  Via Nielsen's theorem, this conjecture can be equivalently stated as a conjecture about majorisation of spectra of random matrices from the so-called trace-normalised complex Wishart-Laguerre ensemble. Concretely, let $X$ and $Y$ be independent $n \times m$ random matrices whose entries are i.i.d. standard complex Gaussians; then Nielsen's conjecture says that the probability that the spectrum of $X X^\dagger / \operatorname{tr}(X X^\dagger)$ majorises the spectrum of $Y Y^\dagger / \operatorname{tr}(Y Y^\dagger)$ tends to zero as both $n$ and $m$ grow large. We prove this conjecture, and we also confirm some related predictions of Cunden, Facchi, Florio and Gramegna [J. Phys. A., 2020; Phys. Rev. A., 2021].</description>

      <title>Normalizing Flows for Conformal Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) algorithms estimate the uncertainty of a prediction model by calibrating its outputs on labeled data. The same calibration scheme usually applies to any model and data without modifications. The obtained prediction intervals are valid by construction but could be inefficient, i.e. unnecessarily big, if the prediction errors are not uniformly distributed over the input space.
  We present a general scheme to localize the intervals by training the calibration process. The standard prediction error is replaced by an optimized distance metric that depends explicitly on the object attributes. Learning the optimal metric is equivalent to training a Normalizing Flow that acts on the joint distribution of the errors and the inputs. Unlike the Error Re-weighting CP algorithm of Papadopoulos et al. (2008), the framework allows estimating the gap between nominal and empirical conditional validity. The approach is compatible with existing locally-adaptive CP strategies based on re-weighting the calibration samples and applies to any point-prediction model without retraining.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a group synchronization problem with multiple frequencies which involves observing pairwise relative measurements of group elements on multiple frequency channels, corrupted by Gaussian noise. We study the computational phase transition in the problem of detecting whether a structured signal is present in such observations by analyzing low-degree polynomial algorithms. We show that, assuming the low-degree conjecture, in synchronization models over arbitrary finite groups as well as over the circle group $SO(2)$, a simple spectral algorithm is optimal among algorithms of runtime $\exp(\tilde{\Omega}(n^{1/3}))$ for detection from an observation including a constant number of frequencies. Combined with an upper bound for the statistical threshold shown in Perry et al., our results indicate the presence of a statistical-to-computational gap in such models with a sufficiently large number of frequencies.</description>

Abstract: The box-ball systems are integrable cellular automata whose long-time behavior is characterized by soliton solutions, with rich connections to other integrable systems such as the Korteweg-de Vries equation. In this paper, we consider a multicolor box-ball system with two types of random initial configurations and obtain sharp scaling limits of the soliton lengths as the system size tends to infinity. We obtain a sharp scaling limit of soliton lengths that turns out to be more delicate than that in the single color case established in [Levine, Lyu, Pike '20]. A large part of our analysis is devoted to studying the associated carrier process, which is a multi-dimensional Markov chain on the orthant, whose excursions and running maxima are closely related to soliton lengths. We establish the sharp scaling of its ruin probabilities, Skorokhod decomposition, strong law of large numbers, and weak diffusive scaling limit to a semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion with explicit parameters. We also establish and utilize complementary descriptions of the soliton lengths and numbers in terms of modified Greene-Kleitman invariants for the box-ball systems and associated circular exclusion processes.</description>

      <title>Lacunary wavelet series on Cantor sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.03733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a multifractal analysis of lacunary wavelet series on Cantor sets. Byintroducing a desynchronization between the scales of the wavelets and the scales of the steps of the construction of the Cantor set, we obtain random processes that donot satisfy multifractal formalisms based on the Legendre transform and on the large deviation of wavelet leaders. Subsequently, we show how the computation of the leader large deviation spectra of "lacunarized" versions of such wavelet series can detect the failure in the multifractal formalism using only numerical quantities.</description>

      <title>Weak limits of entropy regularized Optimal Transport; potentials, plans and divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work deals with the asymptotic distribution of both potentials and couplings of entropic regularized optimal transport for compactly supported probabilities in $\R^d$. We first provide the central limit theorem of the Sinkhorn potentials -- the solutions of the dual problem -- as a Gaussian process in $\Cs$. Then we obtain the weak limits of the couplings -- the solutions of the primal problem -- evaluated on integrable functions, proving a conjecture of \cite{ChaosDecom}. In both cases, their limit is a real Gaussian random variable. Finally we consider the weak limit of the entropic Sinkhorn divergence under both assumptions $H_0:\ {\rm P}={\rm Q}$ or $H_1:\ {\rm P}\neq{\rm Q}$. Under $H_0$ the limit is a quadratic form applied to a Gaussian process in a Sobolev space, while under $H_1$, the limit is Gaussian. We provide also a different characterisation of the limit under $H_0$ in terms of an infinite sum of an i.i.d. sequence of standard Gaussian random variables. Such results enable statistical inference based on entropic regularized optimal transport.</description>

      <title>Sharp metastability transition for two-dimensional bootstrap percolation with symmetric isotropic threshold rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional critical bootstrap percolation models. We establish that a class of these models including all isotropic threshold rules with a convex symmetric neighbourhood, undergoes a sharp metastability transition. This extends previous instances proved for several specific rules. The paper supersedes a draft by Alexander Holroyd and the first author from 2012. While it served a role in the subsequent development of bootstrap percolation universality, we have chosen to adopt a more contemporary viewpoint in its present form.</description>

      <title>Poisson-Dirichlet scaling limits of Kemp's supertrees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the Gromov--Hausdorff--Prokhorov scaling limits and local limits of Kemp's $d$-dimensional binary trees and other models of supertrees. The limits exhibit a root vertex with infinite degree and are constructed by rescaling infinitely many independent stable trees or other spaces according to a function of a two-parameter Poisson--Dirichlet process and gluing them together at their roots. We discuss universality aspects of random spaces constructed in this fashion and sketch a phase diagram.</description>

      <title>On the extreme order statistics for stationary Gaussian sequences subject to random missing observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{X}=\{X_{n}\}_{n\geq 1}$ be a sequence of stationary Gaussian variables and suppose that only some of the random variables from $\mathbf{X}$ can be observed. In this paper, by studying the limiting properties of multidimensional exceedance point processes for $\mathbf{X}$, we derived the joint limit distribution of extreme order statistics for the Gaussian sequence $\mathbf{X}$ and its observed ones. The joint limit distribution of the locations and heights of the maxima for the Gaussian sequence $\mathbf{X}$ and its observed ones are also obtained.</description>

      <title>On the area between a L\'evy process with secondary jump inputs and its reflected version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stochastic properties of the area under some function of the difference between (i) a spectrally positive L\'evy process $W_t^x$ that jumps to a level $x&gt;0$ whenever it hits zero, and (ii) its reflected version $W_t$. Remarkably, even though the analysis of each of these processes is challenging, we succeed in attaining explicit expressions for their difference. The main result concerns the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the integral $A_x$ of (a function of) the distance between $W_t^x$ and $W_t$ until $W_t^x$ hits zero. This result is extended in a number of directions, including the area between $A_x$ and $A_y$ and a Gaussian limit theorem. We conclude the paper with an inventory problem for which our results are particularly useful.</description>

      <title>Intertwinings for Continuum Particle Systems: an Algebraic Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the algebraic approach to duality, more precisely to intertwinings, within the context of particle systems in general spaces, focusing on the $\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$ current algebra. We introduce raising, lowering, and neutral operators indexed by test functions and we use them to construct unitary operators, which act as self-intertwiners for some Markov processes having the Pascal process's law as a reversible measure. We show that such unitaries relate to generalized Meixner polynomials. Our primary results are continuum counterparts of results in the discrete setting obtained by Carinci, Franceschini, Giardin\`a, Groenevelt, and Redig (2019).</description>

      <title>A Breiman's theorem for conditional dependent random vector and its applications to risk theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a Breiman's theorem for conditional dependent random vector, where one component has a regularly-varying-tailed distribution with the index $\alpha\ge0$ and its slowly varying function satisfies a relaxed condition, while the other component is non-negative and its tail distribution is lighter than the former. This result substantially extends and improves Theorem 2.1 of Yang and Wang (Extremes,\ 2013). %with a lower moment condition requirement for many occasions. We also provide some concrete examples and some interesting properties of conditional dependent random vector. Further, we apply the above Breiman's theorem to risk theory, and obtain two asymptotic estimates of the finite-time ruin probability and the infinite-time ruin probability of a discrete-time risk model, in which the corresponding net loss and random discount are conditionally dependent.</description>

      <title>Cauchy-Born Rule from Microscopic Models with Non-convex Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.13564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gradient field models on an integer lattice with non-convex interactions. These models emerge in distinct branches of physics and mathematics under various names. In particular, as zero-mass lattice (Euclidean) quantum field theory, models of random interfaces, and as mass-string models of nonlinear elasticity.Our attention is mostly devoted to the latter with random vector valued fields as displacements for atoms of crystal structures,where our aim is to prove the strict convexity of the free energy as a function of affine deformations for low enough temperatures and small enough deformations. This claim can be interpreted as a form of verification of the Cauchy-Born rule at small non-vanishing temperatures for a class of these models. We also show that the scaling limit of the Laplace transform of the corresponding Gibbs measure (under a proper rescaling) corresponds to the Gaussian gradient field with a particular covariance.
  The proofs are based on a multi-scale (renormalisation group analysis) techniques needed in view of strong correlations of studied gradient fields. To cover sufficiently wide class of models, we extend these techniques from the standard case with rotationally symmetric nearest neighbour interaction to a more general situation with finite range interactions without any symmetry. Our presentation is entirely self-contained covering the details of the needed renormalisation group methods.</description>

Abstract: We show that there is a PDE formulation in terms of Fokker-Planck equations for weak optimal transport problems. The main novelty is that we introduce a minimization problem involving Fokker-Planck equations in the extended sense of measure-valued solutions and prove that it is equal to the associated weak transport problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interacting particle systems in a finite volume in equilibrium are often described by a grand canonical ensemble induced by the corresponding Hamiltonian, i.e. a finite volume Gibbs measure. However, in practice, directly measuring this Hamiltonian is not possible, as such, methods need to be developed to calculate the Hamiltonian potentials from measurable data. In this work we give an expansion of the chemical potential in terms of the correlation functions of such a system in the thermodynamic limit. This is a justification of a formal approach of Nettleton and Green from the 50's.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the effect of adding geometrically smoothed momentum to the randomized Kaczmarz algorithm, which is an instance of stochastic gradient descent on a linear least squares loss function. We prove a result about the expected error in the direction of singular vectors of the matrix defining the least squares loss. We present several numerical examples illustrating the utility of our result and pose several questions.</description>

      <title>An SEIR network epidemic model with manual and digital contact tracing allowing delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13392v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an SEIR epidemic model on a network also allowing random contacts, where recovered individuals could either recover naturally or be diagnosed. Upon diagnosis, manual contact tracing is triggered such that each infected network contact is reported, tested and isolated with some probability and after a random delay. Additionally, digital tracing (based on a tracing app) is triggered if the diagnosed individual is an app-user, and then all of its app-using infectees are immediately notified and isolated. The early phase of the epidemic with manual and/or digital tracing is approximated by different multi-type branching processes, and three respective reproduction numbers are derived. The effectiveness of both contact tracing mechanisms is numerically quantified through the reduction of the reproduction number. This shows that app-using fraction plays an essential role in the overall effectiveness of contact tracing. The relative effectiveness of manual tracing compared to digital tracing increases if: more of the transmission occurs on the network, when the tracing delay is shortened, and when the network degree distribution is heavy-tailed. For realistic values, the combined tracing case can reduce $R_0$ by $20-30\%$, so other preventive measures are needed to reduce the reproduction number down to $1.2-1.4$ for contact tracing to make it successful in avoiding big outbreaks.</description>
