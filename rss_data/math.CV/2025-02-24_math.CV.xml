      <title>A uniformization theorem for the Bergman metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a bounded domain in $\mathbb{C}^n$. Suppose the holomorphic sectional curvature of its Bergman metric equals a negative constant $\tau$. We show that $D$ is biholomorphic to a domain $\Omega$ equal to the unit ball in $\mathbb{C}^n$ less a relatively closed set of measure zero, and that all $L^2$-holomorphic functions on $\Omega$ extend to $L^2$-holomorphic functions on the ball. Consequently, $\tau$ must equal the holomorphic sectional curvature of the unit ball. This generalizes a classical theorem of Lu. Some applications of the theorem, especially in extending classical work of Wong and Rosay, are also presented.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic automorphisms of Markov-type surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every complex surface of Markov-type, i.e.\ the variety given by $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + Exyz - Ax - By - Cz - D = 0$, has the symplectic density property and the Hamiltonian density property. We prove a singular symplectic/Hamiltonian version of the Anders{\'e}n--Lempert theorem for normal reduced affine complex varieties and apply it to describe the holomorphic symplectic automorphisms of a complex surface of Markov-type. To this end, we also investigate the germs of vector fields in isolated singularities of type $A_k$ and $D_k$. Moreover, we show that any injective self-map of the set of ordered Markov triples can be realized by a holomorphic symplectic automorphism.</description>

      <title>On quaternionic analysis and a certain generalized fractal-fractional $\psi$-Fueter operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduce a fractional-fractal $\psi$-Fueter operator in the quaternionic context inspired in the concepts of proportional fractional derivative and Hausdorff derivative of a function with respect to a fractal measure. Moreover, we establish the corresponding Stokes and Borel-Pompeiu formulas associated to this generalized fractional-fractal $\psi$-Fueter operator.</description>

      <title>Global branching of solutions to ODEs and integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a natural generalisation of the Painlev\'e property and use it to identify the known integrable cases of the Lane-Emden equation with a real positive index. We classify certain first-order ordinary differential equations with this property and find necessary conditions for a large family of second-order equations. We consider ODEs such that, given any simply connected domain $\Omega$ not containing fixed singularities of the equation, the Riemann surface of any solution obtained by analytic continuation along curves in $\Omega$ has a finite number of sheets over $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Control of the half-heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate null-controllable initial states of the half heat equation controlled from a sub-arc $\omega$ of the unit circle. We also study the projection on positive frequencies of the half-heat equation. For this projected half-heat equation, we obtain necessary as well as sufficient conditions for an initial condition to be null-controllable. These conditions, which are almost sharp, are expressed in term of projections on positive frequencies of functions supported on $\omega$. From these results, and with the help of classical results on sum of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic functions, we also treat the (unprojected) half-heat equation. Surprisingly, without using our conditions on null-controllable states, we are able to show that the space of null-controllable functions does not depend on time by using a result of separation of singularities for holomorphic functions.</description>

      <title>Quasi-invariance for SLE welding measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large class of Jordan curves on the Riemann sphere can be encoded by circle homeomorphisms via conformal welding, among which we consider the welding homeomorphism of the random SLE loops and the Weil-Petersson class of quasicircles. It is known from the work of Carfagnini and Wang (arXiv:2311.00209) that the Onsager-Machlup action functional of SLE loop measures - the Loewner energy - coincides with the K\"ahler potential of the unique right-invariant K\"ahler metric on the group of Weil-Petersson circle homeomorphisms. This identity suggests that the group structure given by the composition shall play a prominent role in the law of SLE welding, which is so far little understood.
  In this paper, we show a Cameron-Martin type result for random weldings arising from Gaussian multiplicative chaos, especially the SLE welding measures, with respect to the natural group action by Weil-Petersson circle homeomorphisms. More precisely, we show that these welding measures are quasi-invariant when pre- or post-composing the random welding by a fixed Weil-Petersson circle homeomorphism. Our proof is based on the characterization of the composition action in terms of Hilbert-Schmidt operators on the Cameron-Martin space of the log-correlated Gaussian field and the description of the SLE welding as the welding of two independent Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) disks.</description>

      <title>Local regularity of the Bergman projection on a class of pseudoconvex domains of finite type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6532</link>
      <description>arXiv:1406.6532v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to prove that if a pseudoconvex domains $\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n$ satisfies Bell-Ligocka's Condition R and admits a ``good" dilation, then the Bergman projection has local $L^p$-Sobolev and H\"older estimates. The good dilation structure is phrased in terms of uniform $L^2$ pseudolocal estimates for the Bergman projection on a family of anisotropic scalings. We conclude the paper by showing that $h$-extendible domains satisfy our hypotheses.</description>
