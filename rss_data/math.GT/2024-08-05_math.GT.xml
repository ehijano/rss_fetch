      <title>The Giroux Correspondence in dimension 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an earlier paper, the authors proved the Giroux Correspondence for tight contact $3$-manifolds via convex Heegaard surfaces. Simultaneously, Breen, Honda and Huang gave an all-dimensions proof of the Giroux Correspondence by generalising convex surface theory to higher dimensions. This paper uses a key result about relations of bypasses to complete the $3$-dimensional proof for arbitrary (not necessarily tight) contact 3-manifolds. This presentation features low-dimensional techniques and further clarifies the relationship between contact manifolds and their Heegaard splittings.</description>

      <title>On the Burde--de Rham theorem for finitely presented pro-$p$ groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Burde--de Rham theorem for finitely presented pro-$p$ groups under the assumption that the total degrees of all relators are $0$. We also give some concrete examples including higher-dimensional cases under Iwasawa theoretic conditions, and consider some cohomological interpretations.</description>

      <title>On Watanabe's theta graph diffeomorphism in the 4-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watanabe's theta graph diffeomorphism, constructed using Watanabe's clasper surgery construction which turns trivalent graphs in 4-manifolds into parameterized families of diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds, is a diffeomorphism of $S^4$ representing a potentially nontrivial smooth mapping class of $S^4$. The "(1,2)-subgroup" of the smooth mapping class group of $S^4$ is the subgroup represented by diffeomorphisms which are pseudoisotopic to the identity via a Cerf family with only index 1 and 2 critical points. This author and Hartman showed that this subgroup is either trivial or has order 2 and explicitly identified a diffeomorphism that would represent the nontrivial element if this subgroup is nontrivial. Here we show that the theta graph diffeomorphism is isotopic to this one possibly nontrivial element of the (1,2)-subgroup. To prove this relation we develop a diagrammatic calculus for working in the smooth mapping class group of $S^4$.</description>

      <title>A group-theoretic framework for low-dimensional topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A correspondence, by way of Heegaard splittings, between closed oriented 3-manifolds and pairs of surjections from a surface group to a free group has been studied by Stallings, Jaco, and Hempel. This correspondence, by way of trisections, was recently extended by Abrams, Gay, and Kirby to the case of smooth, closed, connected, oriented 4-manifolds. We unify these perspectives and generalize this correspondence to the case of links in closed oriented 3-manifolds and links of knotted surfaces in smooth, closed, connected, oriented 4-manifolds. The algebraic manifestations of these four subfields of low-dimensional topology (3-manifolds, 4-manifolds, knot theory, and knotted surface theory) are all strikingly similar, and this correspondence perhaps elucidates some unique character of low-dimensional topology.</description>

      <title>Marked length spectrum rigidity from rigidity on subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for studying length spectrum rigidity problems based on a combination of ideas from dynamical systems and geometric group theory. This allows us to compare the marked length spectrum of metrics and distance-like functions coming from various geometric origins. Using our new perspective, we provide concise proofs of well-known length spectrum rigidity results and are able to extend classical results to a variety of new settings. Our methods rely on studying Manhattan curves and a coarse geometric analogue of Teichm\"uller space equipped with a symmetrized version of the Thurston metric.</description>

      <title>Constructing Lagrangians from triple grid diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Links in $S^3$ can be encoded by grid diagrams; a grid diagram is a collection of points on a toroidal grid such that each row and column of the grid contains exactly two points. Grid diagrams can be reinterpreted as front projections of Legendrian links in the standard contact 3-sphere. In this paper, we define and investigate triple grid diagrams, a generalization to toroidal diagrams consisting of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal grid lines. In certain cases, a triple grid diagram determines a closed Lagrangian surface in $\mathbb{CP}^2$. Specifically, each triple grid diagram determines three grid diagrams (row-column, column-diagonal and diagonal-row) and thus three Legendrian links, which we think of collectively as a Legendrian link in a disjoint union of three standard contact 3-spheres. We show that a triple grid diagram naturally determines a Lagrangian cap in the complement of three Darboux balls in $\mathbb{CP}^2$, whose negative boundary is precisely this Legendrian link. When these Legendrians are maximal Legendrian unlinks, the Lagrangian cap can be filled by Lagrangian slice disks to obtain a closed Lagrangian surface in $\mathbb{CP}^2$. We construct families of examples of triple grid diagrams and discuss potential applications to obstructing Lagrangian fillings.</description>

      <title>Obstruction Complexes in Grid Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19747v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Manolescu-Sarkar constructed a stable homotopy type for link Floer homology, which uses grid homology and accounts for all domains that do not pass through a specific square. In doing so, they produced an obstruction chain complex of the grid diagram with that square removed. We define the obstruction chain complex of the full grid, without the square removed, and compute its homology. Though this homology is too complicated to immediately extend the Manolescu-Sarkar construction, we give results about the existence of sign assignments in grid homology.</description>

      <title>Compact and finite-type support in the homology of big mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any infinite-type surface $S$, a natural question is whether the homology of its mapping class group contains any non-trivial classes that are supported on (i) a compact subsurface or (ii) a finite-type subsurface. Our purpose here is to study this question, in particular giving an almost-complete answer when the genus of $S$ is positive (including infinite) and a partial answer when the genus of $S$ is zero. Our methods involve the notion of shiftable subsurfaces as well as homological stability for mapping class groups of finite-type surfaces.</description>

      <title>Local structure of homogeneous $ANR$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10205v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate to what extend finite-dimensional homogeneous locally compact $ANR$-spaces have common properties with Euclidean manifolds. Specially, the local structure of homogeneous $ANR$-spaces is described. Using that description, we provide a positive solution of the problem whether every finite-dimensional homogeneous metric $ANR$-compactum $X$ is dimensionally full-valued, i.e. $\dim X\times Y=\dim X+\dim Y$ for any metric compactum $Y$.</description>
