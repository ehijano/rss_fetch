      <title>Nonvolatile Magnonics in Bilayer Magnetic Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonvolatile control of spin order or spin excitations offers a promising avenue for advancing spintronics; however, practical implementation remains challenging. In this letter, we propose a general framework to realize electrical control of magnons in 2D magnetic insulators. We demonstrate that in bilayer ferromagnetic insulators with strong spin-layer coupling, electric field Ez can effectively manipulate the spin exchange interactions between the layers, enabling nonvolatile control of the corresponding magnons. Notably, in this bilayer, Ez can induce nonzero Berry curvature and orbital moments of magnons, the chirality of which are coupled to the direction of Ez. This coupling facilitates Ez manipulate the corresponding magnon valley and orbital Hall currents. Furthermore, such bilayers can be easily engineered, as demonstrated by our density-functional-theory calculations on Janus bilayer Cr-based ferromagnets. Our work provides an important step toward realizing nonvolatile magnonics and paves a promising way for future magnetoelectric coupling devices.</description>

      <title>From Landau two-fluid model to de Sitter Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04392v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The condensed matter analogs are useful for consideration of the phenomena related to the quantum vacuum. This is because in condensed matter we know physics both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet limits, while in particle physics and gravity the physics at trans-Planckian scale is unknown. One of the corner stones of the connections between the non-relativistic condensed matter and the modern relativistic theories is the two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid helium. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the de Sitter state of the expansion of the Universe bear some features of the multi-fluid system. There are actually three components: the quantum vacuum, the gravitational component and relativistic matter. The expanding de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter component and the gravitational component. The latter behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter and represents the dark matter. In equilibrium and in the absence of the conventional matter the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is similar to the superfluid and normal components in superfluids, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. If one assumes that in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter, one obtains that both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. We also consider the other problems through the prism of condensed matter physics, including the black holes and Planck constant.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the temperature-dependent spin-polarized electron transport in iron via spin-wave Doppler shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An electric current flowing in a ferromagnetic metal carries spin angular momentum, i.e. it is spin-polarized. Here, we measure the spin-wave Doppler shift induced by the transfer of angular momentum from the diffusive spin-polarized electric current onto coherent spin waves in epitaxial MgO/Fe/MgO thin films. We follow this Doppler shift as function of the temperature and determine that the degree of spin-polarization of the current increases from 77$\%$ to 86$\%$ when cooling the device from 303K down to 10K. Interpreting these measurements within the two-current model, we separate the contributions from electron-surface, electron-phonon and electron-magnon scatterings to the spin-dependent resistivity of Fe.</description>
