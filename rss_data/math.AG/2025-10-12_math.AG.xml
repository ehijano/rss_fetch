      <title>Wild Stacky Curves and Rings of Mod p Modular Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend work of Voight and the second author to compute the log canonical ring of a wild stacky curve over a field of characteristic $p &gt; 0$, which allows us to compute rings of mod $p$ modular forms of level $\Gamma_{0}(N)$. Our approach also reveals that in characteristics $2$ and $3$, there are infinitely many levels $N$ for which there are weight $2$ modular forms of level $\Gamma_{0}(N)$ that do not lift to characteristic $0$.</description>

      <title>Bigraded Lie algebras and nilpotent fundamental groups of smooth complex algebraic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth complex algebraic variety. Assume that the fundamental group $\pi_1(X,x)$ is torsion-free nilpotent. We show that if the betti number $b_1(X)$ is less than or equal to $3$, then $\pi_1(X,x)$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Z}^2$, $\mathbb{Z}^3$, a lattice in the Heisenberg group $H_3(\mathbb{R})$ or $\mathbb{R}\times H_3(\mathbb{R})$. Moreover we show that $\pi_1(X,x)$ is abelian or $2$-step nilpotent if the rank of $\pi_1(X,x)$ is less than or equal to seven. We prove the main theorems by using the bigraded structures of mixed Hodge structures on nilpotent Lie algebras. In particular, if the rank of $\pi_1(X,x)$ is less than or equal to six, then we show that $\pi_1(X,x)$ is a lattice in an abelian Lie group $\mathbb{R}^n$ or a $(2k+1)$-dimensional Heisenberg group $H_{2k+1}(\mathbb{R})$ or a product group $\mathbb{R}^m\times H_{2l+1}(\mathbb{R})$ or $H_3(\mathbb{R})\times H_3(\mathbb{R})$ for some $n=1,2,3,4,5,6$, $k=1,2$ or $(m,l)=(1,3),(2,3),(3,3),(1,5)$. Our main result supports a conjecture of nilpotent (quasi-) K\"ahler group provided by Aguilar and Campana.</description>

      <title>Linear sections of Grassmannians and resonance of vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work revolves around the question of whether a given resonance variety is associated with a vector bundle. We show the existence of a family of natural morphisms on a stratification of the resonance variety to a suitable family of a Quot scheme and provide some applications in the curve case. The existence of this family of morphisms represents an obstruction to affirmatively answering the main question. In addition, we study the resonance of restricted universal rank-two quotient bundles over transversal linear sections of the Grassmann varieties $\operatorname{Gr}_2(\mathbb{C}^n)$, with a special attention to low-dimensional Grassmannians. These bundles are among the most natural to consider in this context. The analysis for $\operatorname{Gr}_2(\mathbb{C}^6)$ shows that any resonance variety in $\mathbb{P}^5$ consisting of fourteen disjoint lines is the resonance of some bundle which appeared in the work of Mukai.</description>

      <title>Quantum Adams operations in quasimap K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define quantum deformations of Adams operations in $K$-theory, in the framework of quasimap quantum $K$-theory. They provide $K$-theoretic analogs of the quantum Steenrod operations from equivariant symplectic Gromov--Witten theory. We verify the compatibility of these operations with the Kahler and equivariant $q$-difference module structures, provide sample computations via $\mathbb{Z}/k$-equivariant localization, and identify them with $p$-curvature operators of the Kahler $q$-difference connections as studied in Koroteev-Smirnov. We also formulate and verify a $K$-theoretic quantum Hikita conjecture at roots of unity, and propose an indirect algebro-geometric definition of quantum Steenrod operations</description>

      <title>Intersection cohomology without spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey three settings in which dimensions of intersection cohomology groups of algebraic varieties provide deep combinatorial and representation-theoretic information, and computations of the groups themselves have been made using combinatorial sheaves on finite posets. These settings are (1) intersection cohomology of Schubert varieties, the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and their realizations via moment graph sheaves and Soergel bimodules; (2) intersection cohomology of toric varieties, the associated g-polynomials of convex polytopes, and their realization via the theory of intersection cohomology of fans; and (3) intersection cohomology of arrangement Schubert varieties, the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of matroids, and their realization via intersection cohomology of matroids. In all three settings these constructions are valid in more general situations where the variety does not exist, leading to "intersection cohomology without spaces." We give parallel presentations of these three stories, highlighting applications to KLS-polynomials.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we determine the motive of the classifying torsor of an algebraic torus. As a result, we give an exact sequence describing the degree 4 cohomological invariants of algebraic tori. Using results by Blinstein and Merkurjev, this provides a formula for the degree 4 unramified cohomology group of an algebraic torus, via a flasque resolution.</description>

      <title>On a sequence of singular ball quotient surfaces on the line $K^2=9\chi-18$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from computer experiments with the fundamental group of the Cartwright--Steger surface, we construct an infinite tower $(X_n)_{n\ge 1}$ of normal projective surfaces obtained by successive $\mathbb Z/3$-Galois covers $X_{n}\to X_{n-1}$. For $n&gt;1$, their minimal resolutions $\widetilde{X}_n$ lie on the line $K^2 = 9\chi - 18$ (equivalently $c_1^2 = 3c_2 - 72$), which is parallel to the Bogomolov--Miyaoka--Yau line $K^2 = 9\chi$ of ball quotients. We compute the fundamental groups for the first cases, showing that $\pi_1(\widetilde{X}_n)=1$ for $n=1,\ldots,5$. Motivated by the geometry of the construction, we conjecture that all $\widetilde{X}_n$ are simply connected.</description>

Abstract: We prove the motivic classes in the motivic cohomology groups of Picard modular surfaces with non-trivial coefficients constructed in a paper of Loeffler\textendash Skinner\textendash Zerbes are in the motivic cohomology groups of the interior motives. Then we establish a relation between the motivic classes and non-critical values of the motivic $L$-functions associated to cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GU}(2,1)$, thus deducing non-triviality of the motivic classes and providing evidence for Beilinson's conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stability conditions on the derived category of a finite connected acyclic quiver. We prove that, for any stability condition on the derived category, its heart can be obtained from an algebraic heart by a rotation of phases. Consequently, we establish the connectedness of the space of stability conditions. Furthermore, we prove that every stability condition $\sigma$ admits a full $\sigma$-exceptional collection.</description>

      <title>An algebraic approach to Latin squares of prime power order by local permutation polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every Latin square of prime power order $q$ is uniquely described by a local permutation polynomial (LPP) in the polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}_q[x,y]$. Despite this equivalence, one may find in the literature only some preliminary results on the relationship among Latin squares and LPPs. This paper delves into this topic by showing how the coefficients of any LPP are identified with the zeros of an algebraic set over $\mathbb{F}_q$. This allows for an algebraic description of all Latin squares of order $q$ by means of a unique polynomial in $\mathbb{F}_q[x,y]$, whose coefficients satisfy the constraints defined by the algebraic set under consideration. In order to make much easier the construction of this polynomial, we also deal with the natural translation to LPPs of both notions of reduced and isotopic Latin squares. Our algebraic approach is readily adapted to identify both types of Latin squares. All of the above is constructively illustrated for $q\in\{4,5\}$. We finish our study with the natural translation to LPPs of both notions of complete mappings and orthomorphisms of quasigroups, showing their relationship with transversals and isotopisms of Latin squares.</description>

Abstract: We present a general classification algorithm for reflexive simplices, which allows us to determine all reflexive simplices in dimensions five and six. In terms of algebraic geometry this means that we classify the Gorenstein fake weighted projective spaces in dimensions five and six. As a byproduct of our methods, we obtain explicit formulae for the Picard group and the Gorenstein index of any fake weighted projective space.</description>

      <title>Global logarithmic deformation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07949v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical problem in algebraic geometry is to construct smooth algebraic varieties with prescribed properties. In the approach via smoothings, one first constructs a degenerate scheme with the prescribed properties, and then shows the existence of a smooth variety degenerating to this scheme. Logarithmic geometry has given important new impulses to the second step of this approach, which we explore in this book. Degenerations, in particular in the context of mirror symmetry, often enjoy similar formal properties as smooth morphisms once considered from the logarithmic perspective. Logarithmic deformation theory has therefore become an effective tool for the construction of smoothings and the transfer of properties between smooth nearby fibers and the singular special fiber.
  The strongest existence result for deformations in classical algebraic geometry is the Bogomolov--Tian--Todorov theorem for Calabi--Yau varieties. A logarithmic variant, once established, constructs log smooth deformations. However, the logarithmic Bogomolov--Tian--Todorov theorem has resisted efforts to its proof for a while. Finally, a method to prove it was discovered in 2019 by Chan, Leung, and Ma.
  In this book, we explore this new approach to the logarithmic Bogomolov--Tian--Todorov theorem. We prove several variants of the abstract unobstructedness theorem, some of which are new and stronger than previously known results. We investigate its application to the global deformation theory of log smooth and mildly log singular spaces, obtaining unobstructedness results for log Calabi--Yau spaces, some log Fano spaces, and line bundles. Special care is taken to allow sufficiently mild log singularities, including all log singularities that appear in the Gross--Siebert construction of toric log Calabi--Yau mirror pairs.</description>

Abstract: Positive geometries were introduced by Arkani-Hamed--Bai--Lam as a method of computing scattering amplitudes in theoretical physics. We show that a positive geometry from a polytope admits a log resolution of singularities to another positive geometry. Our result states that the regions in a wonderful compactification of a hyperplane arrangement complement, which we call wondertopes, are positive geometries. A familiar wondertope is the curvy associahedron, which tiles the moduli space of pointed stable rational curves. Thus our work generalizes the known positive geometry structure on this moduli space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sequence is difference algebraic (or D-algebraic) if finitely many shifts of its general term satisfy a polynomial relationship; that is, they are the coordinates of a generic point on an affine hypersurface. The corresponding equations are denoted algebraic difference equations (ADEs). We propose a formal definition of D-algebraicity for sequences and investigate algorithms for their closure properties. We show that subsequences of D-algebraic sequences, indexed by arithmetic progressions, satisfy ADEs of the same orders as the original sequences. Additionally, we discuss the special difference-algebraic nature of holonomic and $C^2$-finite sequences.</description>

      <title>Maximum number of points of intersection of a non-degenerate Hermitian variety and a cubic hypersurface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edoukou, Ling and Xing in 2010, conjectured that in \mathbb{P}^n(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}), n \geq 3, the maximum number of common points of a non-degenerate Hermitian variety \mathcal{U}_n and a hypersurface of degree d is achieved only when the hypersurface is a union of d distinct hyperplanes meeting in a common linear space \Pi_{n-2} of codimension 2 such that \Pi_{n-2} \cap \mathcal{U}_n is a non-degenerate Hermitian variety. Furthermore, these d hyperplanes are tangent to \mathcal{U}_n if n is odd and non-tangent if n is even. In this paper, we show that the conjecture is true for d = 3 and q \geq 7.</description>

      <title>$\pi_1$ of trigonal loci of strata of abelian differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate locally closed subspaces of projectivized strata of abelian differentials which classify trigonal curves with canonical divisor a multiple of a trigonal divisor. We describe their orbifold structure using linear systems on Segre-Hirzebruch surfaces and obtain results for their orbifold fundamental groups.
  Most notable among these orbifolds is the connected component $\mathbf P\mathcal H^{ev}_4(6)$, the projectivisation of the space $\mathcal H^{ev}_4(6)$ of abelian differentials on non-hyperelliptic genus $4$ curves with a single zero of multiplicity 6 providing an even spin structure. Its orbifold fundamental group is identified with the quotient of the Artin group of type $E_8$ by its maximal central subgroup.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture of Pappas and Rapoport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19771v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Pappas and Rapoport about the existence of ''canonical'' integral models of Shimura varieties of Hodge type with quasi-parahoric level structure at a prime $p$. For these integral models, we moreover show uniformization of isogeny classes by integral local Shimura varieties, and prove a conjecture of Kisin and Pappas on local model diagrams.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbb{C})$-character stacks and Langlands duality over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03234v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the mixed Poincar\'e polynomial of generic $\mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbb{C})$-character stacks with coefficients in some local systems arising from the conjugacy classes of $\mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ which have non-connected stabiliser. We give a conjectural formula that we prove to be true under the Euler specialisation. We then prove that this conjectured formula interpolates the structure coefficients of the two based rings$ \left(\mathcal{C}(\mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)),Loc(\mathrm{PGL}_n),*\right)$ and $\left(\mathcal{C}(\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)), CS(\mathrm{SL}_n),\cdot\right) $ where for a group $H$, $\mathcal{C}(H)$ denotes the space of complex valued class functions on $H$, $Loc(\mathrm{PGL}_n)$ denotes the basis of characteristic functions of intermediate extensions of equivariant local systems on conjugacy classes of $\mathrm{PGL}_n$ and $CS(\mathrm{SL}_n)$ the basis of characteristic functions of Lusztig's character-sheaves on $\mathrm{SL}_n$. Our result reminds us of a non-abelian Fourier transform.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian polynomials and matroids over triangular hyperfields 1: Topological aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02907v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lorentzian polynomials serve as a bridge between continuous and discrete convexity, connecting analysis and combinatorics. In this article, we study the topology of the space $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ of Lorentzian polynomials on $J$ modulo $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$, which is nonempty if and only if $J$ is the set of bases of a polymatroid. We prove that $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ is a manifold with boundary of dimension equal to the Tutte rank of $J$, and more precisely, that it is homeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball with the Dressian of $J$ removed from its boundary. Furthermore, we show that $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ is homeomorphic to the thin Schubert cell $\textrm{Gr}_J(\mathbb{T}_q)$ of $J$ over the triangular hyperfield $\mathbb{T}_q$, introduced by Viro in the context of tropical geometry and Maslov dequantization, for any $q&gt;0$. This identification enables us to apply the representation theory of polymatroids developed in a companion paper, as well as earlier work by the first and fourth authors on foundations of matroids, to give a simple explicit description of $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ up to homeomorphism in several key cases. Our results show that $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ always admits a compactification homeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball. They can also be used to answer a question of Br\"and\'en in the negative by showing that the closure of $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ within the space of all polynomials modulo $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$ is not homeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball in general. In addition, we introduce the Hausdorff compactification of the space of rescaling classes of Lorentzian polynomials and show that the Chow quotient of a complex Grassmannian maps naturally to this compactification. This provides a geometric framework that connects the asymptotic structure of the space of Lorentzian polynomials with classical constructions in algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Potent categorical representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and motivate -- based on ongoing joint work with Germ\'an Stefanich -- the notion of potent categorical representations of a complex reductive group $G$, specifically a conjectural Langlands correspondence identifying potent categorical representations of $G$ and its Langlands dual $\check G$. We emphasize the symplectic nature of potent categorical representations in their simultaneous dependence on parameters in maximal tori for $G$ and $\check G$, specifically how their conjectural Langlands correspondence fits within a 2-categorical Fourier transform. Our key tool to make various ideas precise is higher sheaf theory and its microlocalization, specifically a theory of ind-coherent sheaves of categories on stacks. The constructions are inspired by the physics of 3d mirror symmetry and S-duality on the one hand, and the theory of double affine Hecke algebras on the other. We also highlight further conjectures related to ongoing programs in and around geometric representation theory.</description>
