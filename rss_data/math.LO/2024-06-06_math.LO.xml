      <title>Stationary tower free homogeneously Suslin scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\lambda$ be a limit of Woodin cardinals. It was shown by the second author that the pointclass of ${&lt;\lambda}$-homogeneously Suslin sets has the scale property. We give a new proof of this fact, which avoids the use of stationary tower forcing.</description>

      <title>Approximation properties of torsion classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarify some results of Bagaria and Magidor \cite{MR3152715} about the relationship between large cardinals and torsion classes of abelian groups, and prove that (1) the Maximum Deconstructibility principle introduced in \cite{Cox_MaxDecon} requires large cardinals; it sits, implication-wise, between Vop\v{e}nka's Principle and the existence of an $\omega_1$-strongly compact cardinal. (2) While deconstructibility of a class of modules always implies the precovering property by \cite{MR2822215}, the concepts are (consistently) non-equivalent, even for classes of abelian groups closed under extensions, homomorphic images, and colimits.</description>

      <title>Unification with Simple Variable Restrictions and Admissibility of $\Pi_{2}$-rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method to recognize admissibility of $\Pi_{2}$-rules, relating this problem to a specific instance of the unification problem with linear constants restriction, called here "unification with simple variable restriction". It is shown that for logical systems enjoying an appropriate algebraic semantics and a finite approximation of left uniform interpolation, this unification with simple variable restriction can be reduced to standard unification. As a corollary, we obtain the decidability of admissibility of $\Pi_{2}$-rules for many logical systems.</description>

      <title>Existentially closed models and locally zero-dimensional toposes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of an existentially closed model is generalised to a property of geometric morphisms between toposes. We show that important properties of existentially closed models extend to existentially closed geometric morphisms, such as the fact that every model admits a homomorphism to an existentially closed one. Other properties do not generalise: classically, there are two equivalent definitions of an existentially closed model, but this equivalence breaks down for the generalised notion. We study the interaction of these two conditions on the topos-theoretic level, and characterise the classifying topos of the e.c. geometric morphisms when the conditions coincide.</description>

      <title>Continuous Edge Chromatic Numbers of Abelian Group Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any generating set $S$ of $\Gamma=\mathbb {Z}^n$, the continuous edge chromatic number of the Schreier graph of the Bernoulli shift action $G=F(S,2^\Gamma)$ is $\chi'_c(G)=\chi'(G)+1$. In particular, for the standard generating set, the continuous edge chromatic number of $F(2^{\mathbb {Z}^n})$ is $2n+1$.</description>

      <title>Cohen Generic Structures with Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $\mathscr{L}^-\subseteq \mathscr{L}$ are languages where $\mathscr{L} \setminus\mathscr{L}^-$ is relational. Additionally, let $\mathbf{K}$ be a strong $\textrm{Fra\"iss\'e}$ class in $\mathscr{L}$. We consider the partial ordering, under substructure, of those elements in $\mathbf{K}$ whose reduct to $\mathscr{L}^-$ are substructures of a fixed $\mathscr{L}^-$-structure $\mathcal{M}^-$. In this paper, we establish that, under general conditions, this partial order satisfies the $|\mathcal{M}^-|$-chain condition.
  Furthermore, under these conditions, we demonstrate that any generic for such a partial order satisfies the theory of the \Fraisse\ limit of $\mathbf{K}$, provided $\mathcal{M}^-$ satisfies the theory of$\textrm{Fra\"iss\'e}$ limit of its age.
  We also provide general conditions that guarantee all such generics to be rigid, as well as conditions ensuring that these generics possess large automorphism groups.</description>

      <title>Approximation theorems throughout Reverse Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reverse Mathematics (RM for short) is a program in the foundations of mathematics where the aim is to find the minimal axioms needed to prove a given theorem of ordinary mathematics. Generally, the minimal axioms are equivalent to the theorem at hand, assuming a weak logical system called the base theory. Moreover, many (most?) theorems are either provable in the base theory or equivalent to one of four logical systems, together called the Big Five. For instance, the Weierstrass approximation theorem, i.e. that a continuous function can be approximated uniformly by a sequence of polynomials, has been classified in RM as being equivalent to weak Koenig's lemma, the second Big Five system. In this paper, we study approximation theorems for discontinuous functions via Bernstein polynomials from the literature. We obtain (many) equivalences between the latter and weak Koenig's lemma. We also show that slight variations of these approximation theorems fall far outside of the Big Five but fit in the recently developed RM of new 'big' systems, namely the uncountability of R, the enumeration principle for countable sets, the pigeon-hole principle for measure, and the Baire category theorem. In conclusion, one equivalence in second-order RM, namely for the Weierstrass approximation theorem, gives rise to many equivalences in higher-order RM, and we hope the case study in this paper can serve as a kind of template.</description>

      <title>On some Fraisse limits with free amalgamation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07616v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first part of this work the notion of stable Kim-forking is discussed and some context on this matter is given. In the second part a general way of building some examples of NSOP1 theories as the limit of some Fraisse class satisfying stronger conditions is given. These limits will satisfy existence, that Kim-independence coincide with algebraic independence, and that forking independence is obtained by forcing base monotonicity on Kim-forking over arbitrary sets. These theories also come with a stationary independence relation. This study is based on the results of Baudisch, Ramsey, Chernikov and Kruckman.</description>

      <title>Base-extension Semantics for S5 Modal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a proof-theoretic semantics -- in particular, a base-extension semantics -- for multi-agent S5 modal logic (and hence also for the usual unindexed S5). Following the inferentialist interpretation of logic, this gives us a semantics in which validity is based on proof rather than truth. In base-extension semantics, the validity of formulae is generated by provability in a `base' of atomic rules and an inductive definition of the validity of the connectives. Base-extension semantics for many interesting logics has been explored by several authors and, in particular, a base-extension semantics for the modal logics K, KT, K4, and S4 has been developed by the present authors. Here, we give a base-extension semantics for multi-agent S5 with $\square_a$, for an agent a, as our primary operators, framed as the knowledge operator K_a. Similarly to Kripke semantics, we make use of relational structure between bases, allowing us to establish a correspondence between certain bases and worlds. We use this to establish the appropriate soundness and completeness results. We conclude by discussing how this semantics can be extended to Dynamic Epistemic Logics (DEL) starting with Public Announcement Logic (PAL).</description>

      <title>Cardinality and Representation of Stone Relation Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous work has axiomatised the cardinality operation in relation algebras, which counts the number of edges of an unweighted graph. We generalise the cardinality axioms to Stone relation algebras, which model weighted graphs, and study the relationships between various axioms for cardinality. This results in simpler cardinality axioms also for relation algebras. We give sufficient conditions for the representability of Stone relation algebras and for Stone relation algebras to be relation algebras.</description>

      <title>Complete Game Logic with Sabotage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Game Logic with sabotage ($\mathsf{GL_s}$) is introduced as a simple and natural extension of Parikh's game logic with a single additional primitive, which allows players to lay traps for the opponent. $\mathsf{GL_s}$ can be used to model infinite sabotage games, in which players can change the rules during game play. In contrast to game logic, which is strictly less expressive, $\mathsf{GL_s}$ is exactly as expressive as the modal $\mu$-calculus. This reveals a close connection between the entangled nested recursion inherent in modal fixpoint logics and adversarial dynamic rule changes characteristic for sabotage games. A natural Hilbert-style proof calculus for $\mathsf{GL_s}$ is presented and proved complete using syntactic equiexpressiveness reductions. The completeness of a simple extension of Parikh's calculus for game logic follows.</description>

      <title>Decidability of Quasi-Dense Modal Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decidability of axiomatic extensions of the modal logic K with modal reduction principles, i.e. axioms of the form $\Diamond^{k} p \rightarrow \Diamond^{n} p$, has remained a long-standing open problem. In this paper, we make significant progress toward solving this problem and show that decidability holds for a large subclass of these logics, namely, for 'quasi-dense logics.' Such logics are extensions of K with with modal reduction axioms such that $0 &lt; k &lt; n$ (dubbed 'quasi-density axioms'). To prove decidability, we define novel proof systems for quasi-dense logics consisting of disjunctive existential rules, which are first-order formulae typically used to specify ontologies in the context of database theory. We show that such proof systems can be used to generate proofs and models of modal formulae, and provide an intricate model-theoretic argument showing that such generated models can be encoded as finite objects called 'templates.' By enumerating templates of bound size, we obtain an EXPSPACE decision procedure as a consequence.</description>
