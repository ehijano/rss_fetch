      <title>Effects of stimulation frequencies on energy efficiency of a muscle fiber during contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contradictory experimental reports on the relationship between efficiency and stimulation frequency have hindered mechanistic understanding in converting neural activity into mechanical work during muscle contraction. To resolve this issue, we develop a biophysical model integrating calcium-mediated excitation with a detailed cross-bridge cycle to enable single-fiber simulations. Our model demonstrates that shortening velocity is the primary determinant of cross-bridge efficiency: efficiency peaks at an optimal velocity and declines at higher or lower velocities, while frequency exerts secondary influence. Critically, the velocity yielding peak efficiency remains consistent across frequencies, with a slight upward shift at higher frequencies. Elevated inorganic phosphate ([Pi]) appears to amplify the efficiency disparity between high- and low-frequency regimes in our analysis. Our work suggests that stimulation frequency modulates efficiency predominantly through its regulation of shortening velocity, which primarily governs the kinetics of the myosin power stroke. This work may help clarify neural control of muscle energetics, and provide a quantitative foundation for studying muscle function in physiological and pathological contexts.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian non-equilibrium modeling of experimental cell-motion trajectories reveals dependence of propulsion-force correlations on solvent viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell motility underlies many biological processes, including cancer metastasis, bacterial infection, and evolutionary adaptation. We introduce a non-equilibrium single-cell motility model inspired by the generalized Langevin equation, which accounts for hydrodynamic friction and correlated propulsion force. From video microscopy of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii algae and Salmonella typhimurium bacteria we extract the propulsion-force dynamics on the single-cell level, which we find to exhibit multi-exponential correlations, not captured by literature non-equilibrium cell-motility models. Based on our data-driven model, we predict the effective cell diffusivities beyond experimentally resolved timescales and demonstrate a diffusivity maximum at intermediate solvent viscosity for both cell types. This means that cells adapt their propulsion-force characteristics according to the solvent viscosity. In addition, our model predicts the power output of single cells, which is on the order of aW for the salmonella and fW for the algae.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised sleep-like intra- and inter-layer plasticity categorizes and improves energy efficiency in a multilayer spiking network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sleep is thought to support memory consolidation and the recovery of optimal energetic regime by reorganizing synaptic connectivity, yet how plasticity across hierarchical brain circuits contributes to abstraction and energy efficiency remains unclear. Here we study a spiking multi-layer network alternating wake-like and deep-sleep-like states, with state-dependent dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity in a biologically inspired thalamo-cortical framework. During wakefulness, the model learns from few perceived examples, while during deep sleep it undergoes spontaneous replay driven by slow oscillations. Plasticity enabled not only within intra-layer connections, but also in inter-layer pathways, is critical for memory consolidation and energetic downshift. Compared to restricted plasticity, full inter-layer plasticity yields higher post-sleep visual classification accuracy and promotes the emergence of sharper class-specific associations. Furthermore, we introduce a biophysically grounded estimator of metabolic power expressing network energy consumption in ATP units, partitioned into baseline, synaptic maintenance, action potential, and transmission costs. We find that inter-layer plasticity in sleep leads to a larger reduction in firing rates, synaptic strength and synaptic activity, corresponding to a substantially larger decrease in power consumption. This work suggests promising elements to be integrated in neuromorphic/energy-efficient AI learning systems, supported by brain state-specific apical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Chain-Length-Dependent Partitioning of 1-Alkanols in Raft-Like Lipid Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although 1-alkanols are widely used as anesthetics and membrane-active agents, the molecular basis of their chain-length-dependent cutoff behavior remains unclear. Here, we perform extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the partitioning of 1-alkanols with varying chain lengths in a raft-like lipid bilayer composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and cholesterol (Chol), which exhibits coexistence of liquid-ordered ($l_o$) and liquid-disordered ($l_d$) domains. We observe pronounced lateral heterogeneity in alkanol distribution, membrane thickness, number density, and lateral pressure profiles across coexisting phases. A distinct cutoff chain length, $n_{cutoff}=12$, is identified: alkanols with $n&lt;n_{cutoff}$ preferentially partition into DOPC-rich $l_d$ domains, whereas alkanols with $n \ge n_{cutoff}$ preferentially localize within DPPC- and cholesterol-rich $l_o$ domains. This chain-length-dependent redistribution is accompanied by systematic reductions in the lateral pressure profile, membrane compressibility, and bending rigidity of the bilayer. The results provide a detailed molecular characterization of how alkanol chain length modulates membrane structure and mechanical response in laterally heterogeneous lipid membranes.</description>

      <title>Programming Nonlinear Interfacial Mechanics of Synthetic Cells: Lipid Geometry and DNA Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft interfaces formed by lipid membranes are fundamental to living cells, synthetic cells, and membrane-based soft materials. However, a quantitative framework linking molecular organization with nonlinear interfacial mechanics remains elusive. Here, we establish an analytical framework that captures the nonlinear elastic response of lipid-membrane-coated synthetic cells under micropipette aspiration. Incorporating both area stretching and curvature bending enables the model to quantitatively reproduce the complete pressure-displacement response within the small-deformation regime. This approach reduces interfacial mechanics to two parameters: the in-plane area-stretching modulus and an out-of-plane bending-related term.
  Using this unified framework, we experimentally demonstrate that nonlinear interfacial mechanics can be programmed by altering the molecular geometry and effective dimensionality of adsorbed elements. The lipid molecular shape and curvature-dependent packing regulate in-plane stiffness, while DNA nanostructures, the other adsorbed element, introduce an orthogonal control axis via dimensionality: isolated motifs primarily enhance area stretching, whereas three-dimensional network architectures markedly reinforce bending resistance. Together, these results establish a general molecular design principle for programming interfacial mechanics and provide a quantitative foundation for engineering mechanically tunable synthetic cells and soft interfaces.</description>

      <title>Active topological strings in renewing nematopolar fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active matter often simultaneously exhibits different kinds of orientational order and, in many cases of biological interest, undergoes continuous material renewal. In renewing nematopolar fluids we find stable topological strings, structures consisting of two nematic point defects connected by a defect line in the polar field. We identify the mechanism underlying string stabilization and unveil how string length is determined. In the presence of active stress, we observe active-string chaos. Our work identifies continuous material renewal as a generic mechanism underlying the stabilization of topological defect structures in systems with mixed order parameters. It could be used for orchestrating living matter during development and other biological processes.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous epicuticular charging affects droplet dynamics on living leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How water droplets move and slide on leaves influences plant ecophysiological and abiotic interactions, as well as the design of advanced bio-inspired wetting materials. Despite cross-disciplinary relevance, current descriptions of the in situ dynamics of droplets on living leaves focus almost exclusively on surface structure and chemistry, treating the leaf as a static, electrically neutral substrate. Here, three decades after the mechanistic discovery of the Lotus effect, we show that a yet 'hidden' force due to instantaneous electrical phenomena affect the dynamic droplet motion on living leaves. Using high-speed motion tracking and precision charge measurements, we show that droplets sliding on the pristine epicuticular wax layer on superhydrophobic Colocasia esculenta leaves strongly charge affecting its dynamics, previously observed only on synthetic (highly electronegative fluorinated) surfaces. Droplets accumulate charges of Qp,D1 = -0.02 to -0.15 nC per 30 uL droplet on pristine leaves. However, we specifically demonstrate the crucial role of the epicuticular wax layer plasticity: by a structural modification that decreases its roughness amplitude, the same leaves gain an impressive 30-40 fold enhancement in charge transfer (reaching Qt,D1 = -2.8 to -5.2 nC) slowing the droplet by half due to an estimated electrostatic force of 11 uN dominating the resistive forces. The charge accumulation is surface-history-dependent and charge quantities per droplet are surprisingly similar or even exceeding those recently reported from artificial surfaces. Our findings prove that electrostatic charging is a fundamental component of droplet-leaf interactions, opening new research directions from charge-affected leaf ecology to sustainable materials for droplet-based energy harvesting by tuning surface treatments and, moreover,...</description>

      <title>Probing the statistics of sequence-dependent DNA conformations in solution using SAXS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SAXS studies of four 60 base-pair DNA duplexes with sequences closely related to part of the GAGE6 (G-antigen 6) promoter have been performed to study the role of DNA conformations in solution and their potential relationship to DNA-protein binding. We show that the SAXS data can be analysed using a simple polymer model which nevertheless quantitatively describes the average persistence length and torsional rigidity of the DNA double helix to determine the statistical distribution of local conformations of the DNA in solution to a high accuracy. Although the SAXS data is averaged over time and all spatial orientations of the molecules, for sequences which have some asymmetry in the data we show that the conformations can be oriented with respect to the sequence. This allows specific features detected by the analysis to be precisely related to the DNA sequence, opening up new opportunities for SAXS to investigate the properties of DNA in solution. The biological implications of these results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Scaling the glassy dynamics of active particles: Tunable fragility and reentrance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the influence of activity on dense amorphous assemblies is crucial for biological processes such as wound healing, embryogenesis, or cancer progression. Here, we study the effect of self-propulsion forces of amplitude $f_0$ and persistence time $\tau_p$ in dense assemblies of soft repulsive particles by simulating a model particle system that interpolates between particulate active matter and biological tissues. We identify the fluid and glass phases of the three-dimensional phase diagram obtained by varying $f_0$, $\tau_p$, and the packing fraction $\phi$. The morphology of the phase diagram directly accounts for a non-monotonic evolution of the relaxation time with $\tau_p$, which is a direct consequence of the crossover in the dominant relaxation mechanism, from glassy to jamming. A second major consequence is the evolution of the glassy dynamics from sub-Arrhenius to super-Arrhenius. We show that this tunable glass fragility extends to active systems analogous observations reported for passive particles. This analogy allows us to apply a dynamic scaling analysis proposed for the passive case, in order to account for our results for active systems. Finally, we discuss similarities and differences between our results and recent findings in the context of computational models of biological tissues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embryonic healing in epithelial tissues is distinct from adult wound healing, as it lacks inflammatory responses or immune cell recruitments, making it ideal to test models of wound healing driven primarily by epithelial dynamics. Many models have been developed to describe this process, ranging from simple mechanistic models to more elaborate multiscale simulations. We review different classes of physical models, from discrete to continuum models, and how they address key questions about the mechanics, signaling, and coordination of cells during wound closure. We highlight tensions between model complexity and interpretability and discuss recent efforts to bridge gaps across scales. Finally, we identify directions for hybrid modeling and model-experiment integration that could push forward our understanding of epithelial repair in development and disease.</description>

      <title>Crossing the Functional Desert: Cascade-Driven Assembly and Feasibility Transitions in Early Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of life poses a problem of combinatorial feasibility: How can temporally supported functional organization arise in exponentially branching assembly spaces when unguided exploration behaves as a memoryless random walk? We show that nonlinear threshold-cascade dynamics in connected interaction networks provide a minimal, substrate-agnostic mechanism that can soften this obstruction. Below a critical connectivity threshold, cascades die out locally and structured input-output response mappings remain sparse and transient-a "functional desert" in which accumulation is dynamically unsupported. Near the critical percolation threshold, system-spanning cascades emerge, enabling discriminative functional responses. We illustrate this transition using a minimal toy model and generalize the argument to arbitrary networked systems. Also near criticality, cascades introduce finite-timescale structural and functional coherence, directional bias, and weak dynamical path-dependence into otherwise memoryless exploration, allowing biased accumulation. This connectivity-driven transition-functional percolation-requires only generic ingredients: interacting units, nonlinear thresholds, influence transmission, and non-zero coherence times. The mechanism does not explain specific biochemical pathways, but it identifies a necessary dynamical regime in which structured functional organization can emerge and be temporarily supported, providing a physical foundation for how combinatorial feasibility barriers can be crossed through network dynamics alone.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS): A Unified Spectral Topology Framework for Stability in Turbulence, AI, and Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex dynamical systems frequently encounter a recurrent structural instability: the collapse of the spectral gap, driving the system toward a low-dimensional "Zero-Mode Attractor" (e.g., spectral pile-up or over-smoothing). Building upon recent global well-posedness estimates [Hou, arXiv:2601.00638], this work generalizes the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information System (MNCIS) framework. We postulate that global stability requires an active topological operator - Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) - functioning as a state-dependent high-pass filter that penalizes entropy accumulation at spectral boundaries. We validate this unified framework via three implementations: (1) Hydrodynamics: In 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence ($N=256^3$), ASNC acts as a global-enstrophy adaptive sub-grid scale (SGS) model, stabilizing the inviscid limit and preserving the Kolmogorov $-5/3$ inertial range without artificial hyper-viscosity. Crucially, we verify that the operator remains dormant ($\gamma \approx 0$) during the linear growth phase of physical instabilities, functioning strictly as a conditional topological clamp. (2) Artificial Intelligence: Addressing Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we implement ASNC as a parameter-free topological constraint. Unlike baselines (e.g., DeepGCNs) relying on dense residual connections, our framework enables the training of ultra-deep 64-layer networks without residual connections, maintaining perfectly stationary feature variance ($\sigma^2 \equiv 1.0$) on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark. (3) Biological Physics: In reaction-diffusion morphogenesis, it stabilizes Turing patterns against diffusive washout in high-entropy regimes. Our results suggest that the MNCIS framework provides a base-independent topological condition for distinguishing viable complex systems from those collapsing into thermal equilibrium.</description>
