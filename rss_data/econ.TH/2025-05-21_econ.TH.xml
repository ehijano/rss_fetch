      <title>Trial and Return Option Strategy in Omnichannel Retailing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the dynamics of customer behavior with trial and return options in omnichannel retailing, where retailers face challenges in integrating physical and online stores. Recently, major retailers have begun offering customers the option of trying eligible items for a set period and returning unwanted products free of charge. However, existing research has not fully explored the temporal dynamics of customer return behaviors. This study investigates how temporal dynamics affect customer return behaviors and decision-making during trial periods. Using a theoretical game structure framework, this study explores customer decision patterns regarding store visits, product trials, and returns, while examining the strategic role of store clerks in encouraging product trials. The findings suggest that retailers can maximize profit through trial and return options when product fit probability is low, emphasizing the importance of maintaining complementary physical and online channels. We also found that store clerks play a critical role in encouraging customers to try misfit products. The results further reveal that return cost coverage policies may not significantly impact customer behavior or retailer profit.</description>

      <title>Optimal classification with endogenous behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I consider the problem of classifying individual behavior in a simple setting of outcome performativity where the behavior the algorithm seeks to classify is itself dependent on the algorithm. I show in this context that the most accurate classifier is either a threshold or a negative threshold rule. A threshold rule offers the "good" classification to those individuals more likely to have engaged in a desirable behavior, while a negative threshold rule offers the "good" outcome to those less likely to have engaged in the desirable behavior. While seemingly pathological, I show that a negative threshold rule can maximize classification accuracy when behavior is endogenous. I provide an example of such a classifier and extend the analysis to more general algorithm objectives. A key takeaway is that when behavior is endogenous to classification, optimal classification can negatively correlate with signal information. This may yield negative downstream effects on groups in terms of the aggregate behavior induced by an algorithm.</description>
