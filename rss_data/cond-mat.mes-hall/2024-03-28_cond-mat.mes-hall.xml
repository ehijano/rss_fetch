      <title>Chirality-Induced Magnet-Free Spin Generation in a Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical generation and transduction of polarized electron spins in semiconductors are of central interest in spintronics and quantum information science. While spin generation in semiconductors has been frequently realized via electrical injection from a ferromagnet, there are significant advantages in nonmagnetic pathways of creating spin polarization. One such pathway exploits the interplay of electron spin with chirality in electronic structures or real space. Here, utilizing chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), we demonstrate efficient creation of spin accumulation in n-doped GaAs via electric current injection from a normal metal (Au) electrode through a self-assembled monolayer of chiral molecules ({\alpha}-helix L-polyalanine, AHPA-L). The resulting spin polarization is detected as a Hanle effect in the n-GaAs, which is found to obey a distinct universal scaling with temperature and bias current consistent with chirality-induced spin accumulation. The experiment constitutes a definitive observation of CISS in a fully nonmagnetic device structure and demonstration of its ability to generate spin accumulation in a conventional semiconductor. The results thus place key constraints on the physical mechanism of CISS and present a new scheme for magnet-free semiconductor spintronics.</description>

      <title>Anyon braiding and telegraph noise in a graphene interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for anyons, quasiparticles with fractional charge and exotic exchange statistics, has inspired decades of condensed matter research. Quantum Hall interferometers enable direct observation of the anyon braiding phase via discrete interference phase jumps when the quasiparticle number changes. Here, we observe the universal anyonic braiding phase in both the $\nu = 1/3$ and $4/3$ fractional quantum Hall states by probing three-state random telegraph noise (RTN) in real-time. We find that the observed RTN stems from anyon quasiparticle number $n$ fluctuations and reconstruct three Aharonov-Bohm oscillation signals phase shifted by $2\pi/3$, corresponding to the three possible interference branches from braiding around $n$ (mod 3) anyons. Hence, we fully characterize the anyon exchange statistics using new methods that can readily extend to non-abelian states.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable multiplex setup for high throughput electrical characterisation at cryogenic temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a reconfigurable multiplex (MUX) setup that increases the throughput of electrical characterisation at cryogenic temperature. The setup separates the MUX circuitry from quantum device under test (qDUT), allowing qDUT chips to be exchanged easily and MUX chips to be reused. To interface with different types of qDUTs, board-level designs are incorporated to allow interconnects flexibly routed into different topology. MUXs are built based on a multiple level selective gating (MLSG) scheme, where the number of multiplexed output channels (interconnects) is exponentially dependent on the number of control lines. In the prototype setup presented in this paper, with 14 out of 44 existing wires from room temperature, 4 MUXs at cryogenic temperature can supply in total 128 interconnects to interface with qDUTs. We validate the MUX setup operation and assess the various limits existed by measuring k$\Omega$ resistors made of $\mu$m-size graphene ribbons. We further demonstrate the setup by performing charge transport measurement on 128 nm-size graphene quantum devices in a single cooling down.</description>

      <title>A generic reduction theory for Fermi sea topology in metallic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermi sea can host exotic quantum topology, which determines the conductance quantization in metals and is characterized by the Euler characteristic $\chi_F$. Here, we propose a generic reduction theory for the Fermi sea topology in $d$-dimensional metallic systems, showing that $\chi_F$ can be identified by the feature of reduced critical points on Fermi surfaces, with theoretical simplicity and observational intuitiveness. We also reveal a striking connection between the Fermi sea topology and the gapped band topology, in which $\chi_F$ exactly equals to the topological invariant of the gapped topological phases by using an ingenious mapping. This nontrivial result provides a potential method to probe $\chi_F$ through $\mathbb{Z}$-classified topological superconductors and further paves the way for studying the Fermi sea topology via the gapped topological systems. Our work promotes a deep understanding and simple detection for $\chi_F$, which shall facilitate the discovery of other novel physical effects caused by the Fermi sea topology in the future.</description>

      <title>Influence of disorder at Insulator-Metal interface on spin transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by experimental work showing enhancement of spin transport between Yttrium Iron Garnet and Platinum by a thin antiferromagnetic insulator between them, we consider spin transport through the interface of a non-magnetic metal and compensated antiferromagnetically ordered insulator and focus on the significance of the interface itself. The spin transport is carried by spin-polarized electrons in the metal and by magnons in the insulator. We compute the spin current in the presence of a spin accumulation in the metal, cause by the spin Hall effect, and a thermal gradient using Fermi's Golden Rule in the presence of interfacial disorder. For a perfectly clean interface, the in-plane momentum is conserved by the electron-magnon scattering events that govern the spin transport through the interface. We calculate how disorder-induced broadening of scattering matrix elements with respect to the in-plane momentum influences the spin current. As a general result, we observe that for many experimental setups, specifically for high temperatures, one should expect a rather small effect of interface disorder on the measured spin current, while for small temperatures there is a significant reduction of a spin current with increasing disorder.</description>

      <title>Transport effects of twist-angle disorder in mesoscopic twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene is a tunable material with remarkably flat energy bands near the Fermi level, leading to fascinating transport properties and correlated states at low temperatures. However, grown pristine samples of this material tend to break up into landscapes of twist-angle domains, strongly influencing the physical properties of each individual sample. This poses a significant problem to the interpretation and comparison between measurements obtained from different samples. In this work, we study numerically the effects of twist-angle disorder on quantum electron transport in mesoscopic samples of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. We find a significant property of twist-angle disorder that distinguishes it from onsite-energy disorder: it leads to an asymmetric broadening of the energy-resolved conductance. The magnitude of the twist-angle variation has a strong effect on conductance, while the number of twist-angle domains is of much lesser significance. We further establish a relationship between the asymmetric broadening and the asymmetric density of states of twisted bilayer graphene at angles smaller than the first magic angle. Our results show that the qualitative differences between the types of disorder in the energy-resolved conductance of twisted bilayer graphene samples can be used to characterize them at temperatures above the critical temperatures of the correlated phases, enabling systematic experimental studies of the effects of the different types of disorders also on the other properties such as the competition of the different types of correlated states appearing at lower temperatures.</description>

      <title>Robustness of type-II Dirac cones in biphenylene-based structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic properties of one- and two-dimensional biphenylene-based systems, such as nanoribbons and bilayers, are studied within a unified approach. Besides the bilayer with direct (AA) stacking, we present two additional symmetric stackings for bilayer biphenylene that we denote by AB, by analogy with bilayer graphene, and AX, which can be derived by a small translation (slip) from the AA bilayer, with distinct band structures. We combine first-principles calculations with a tight-binding model to provide a realistic effective description of these structures. Our approach provides a global framework to characterize and analyze the robustness of the type-II Dirac cone within these structures, captures the variations caused by different stackings, and highlights important symmetries inherent in the biphenylene nanoribbon Dirac cones and edge states.</description>

      <title>pyMSER -- An open-source library for automatic equilibration detection in molecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated molecular simulations are used extensively for predicting material properties. Typically, these simulations exhibit two regimes: a dynamic equilibration part, followed by a steady state. For extracting observable properties, the simulations must first reach a steady state so that thermodynamic averages can be taken. However, as equilibration depends on simulation conditions, predicting the optimal number of simulation steps a priori is impossible. Here, we demonstrate the application of the Marginal Standard Error Rule (MSER) for automatically identifying the optimal truncation point in Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. This novel automatic procedure determines the point in which steady state is reached, ensuring that figures-of-merits are extracted in an objective, accurate, and reproducible fashion. In the case of GCMC simulations of gas adsorption in metal-organic frameworks, we find that this methodology reduces the computational cost by up to 90%. As MSER statistics are independent of the simulation method that creates the data, this library is, in principle, applicable to any time series analysis in which equilibration truncation is required. The open-source Python implementation of our method, pyMSER, is publicly available for reuse and validation at https://github.com/IBM/pymser.</description>

      <title>Transport properties through alternating borophene and graphene superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic transport properties of two junctions (BGB, GBG) made of borophene (B) and graphene (G) are studied. Using the transfer matrix method with Chebyshev polynomials, we have studied single and multiple barriers in a superlattice configuration. We showed that a single barrier exhibits remarkable tilted transport properties, with perfect transmission observed for both junctions under normal incidence. We found that robust superlattice transmission is maintained for multiple barriers, particularly in the BGB junction. It turns out that by varying the incident energy, many gaps appear in the transmission probability. The number, width, and position of these transmission gaps can be manipulated by adjusting the number of cells, incident angle, and barrier characteristics. For diffuse transport, we observed significant variations in conductance and the Fano factor, highlighting the sensitivity of these junctions to the physical parameters. We showed different behaviors between BGB and GBG junctions, particularly with respect to the response of conductance and Fano factor when barrier height varies. For ballistic transport, we have seen that the minimum conductivity is related to the maximum Fano factor, demonstrating their control under specific conditions of the physical parameters. Analysis of the length ratio (geometric factor) revealed some remarkable patterns, where conductivity and the Fano factor converged to certain values as the ratio approached infinity.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of non-Hermitian skin effect and extended states in one-dimensional nonreciprocal lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices with staggered onsite modulations and nonreciprocal hopping up to the next-nearest-neighboring (NNN) sites. Due to the NNN nonreciprocity, the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in the system under open boundary conditions (OBC) can be energy-dependent, and there will be NHSE edges in the eigenenergy spectrum, which separates the eigenstates localized at the opposite ends of the lattice. We find that the interplay between the nonreciprocal hopping and onsite modulations can reverse the direction of the skin effect and modify the position of the NHSE edge. Moreover, by tuning the system parameters, some of the eigenstates under OBC will become fully extended with the corresponding eigenenergies being imaginary under both open and periodic boundary conditions. Thus, the extended states can coexist with the NHSH in the same system. The NHSE can even be completely dissolved with all the eigenstates being extended when the modulation is imaginary. Our work unveils the intricate interplay between onsite modulations and nonreciprocal hopping in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic interaction between chiral currents and surface waves in topological superfluids: a pathway to detect Majorana fermions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive experimental efforts over the past two decades, the quest for Majorana fermions in superconductors remains inconclusive. We propose an experimental method that can conclusively confirm, or rule out, the existence of these quasiparticles: Firstly, we shift focus from superconductors, whose very topological nature is disputed, to the unambiguous topological superfluid $^3$He. Secondly, we identify the interaction between surface waves and the chiral Majorana current in the bulk of a topological superfluid of varying density. The proposed experiment provides a path towards the detection of the Majorana fermion, an 80-year-old theoretical prediction. It is realistically achievable based on the advent of microscopic superfluid resonators coupled to optical cavities. The proposal may open the door to experiments ranging from simulations of exotic cosmological particles to topological acoustics and fault tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Giant High-order Nonlinear and Nonreciprocal Electrical Transports Induced by Valley Flipping in Bernal Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electrical transport properties of the mini-valley polarized state proposed recently in slightly doped Bernal Bilayer Graphene (BLG) in large electric displacement fields. By minimizing the Hartree-Fock energy functional, we first confirm the appearance of mini-valley polarized phase. At the low carrier doping regime, the 1-pocket state will be stabilized where only one of the trigonal-wrapping-induced Fermi pockets near the atomic-valley center is filled. Then we study the electrical transport of the 1-pocket state by solving the Boltzmann equation. We find that the valley polarization could be easily flopped by an in-plane electrical field, which will lead to hysteresis loop in the direct current (DC) $I-V$ curves. Such irreversible current responses in the DC limit will directly induce strong nonlinear and nonreciprocal alternating current (AC) responses, which has been already observed in the recent experiments on BLG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons in van der Waals heterostructures based on atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides are considered as potential candidates for the formation of a superfluid state in two-dimensional systems. A number of studies reported observations of ultrafast nondiffusive propagation of excitons in van der Waals heterostructures, which was considered by their authors as possible evidence of collective effects in excitonic systems. In this paper, after a brief analysis of exciton propagation regimes in two-dimensional semiconductors, an alternative model of ultrafast exciton transport is proposed, based on the formation of waveguide modes in van der Waals heterostructures and the radiation transfer by these modes.</description>

      <title>Anyonic statistics and slow quasiparticle dynamics in a graphene fractional quantum Hall interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anyons are two dimensional particles with fractional exchange statistics that emerge as elementary excitations of fractional quantum Hall phases. Experimentally, anyonic statistics manifest directly in the edge-state Fabry-P\'erot interferometer geometry, where the presence of $N_{qp}$ localized anyons in the interferometer bulk contributes a phase $N_{qp} \theta_a$ to the observed interference pattern, where $\theta_a$ is twice the statistical exchange phase. Here, we report a measurement of $\theta_a$ in a monolayer graphene Fabry-P\'erot interferometer at $\nu$ = 1/3. We find a preponderance of phase slips with magnitudes $\Delta \theta \approx 2 \pi / 3$, confirming the result of past experiments in GaAs quantum wells and consistent with expectations for the tunneling of Abelian anyons into the interferometer bulk. In contrast to prior work, however, single anyon tunneling events manifest as instantaneous and irreversible phase slips, indicative of quasiparticle equilibration times exceeding 20 minutes in some cases. We use the discrepancy between the quasiparticle equilibration rate and our measurement speed to vary the interferometer area and $N_{qp}$ independently, allowing us to precisely determine the interferometer phase and monitor the entry and exit of individual anyons to the interferometer loop in the time domain. Besides providing a replication of previous interferometric measurements sensitive to $\theta_a$ in GaAs, our results bring anyon dynamics into the experimental regime and suggest that the average `topological charge' of a mesoscopic quantum Hall device can be held constant over hour long timescales.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected flatness in chiral moir\'e heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of delicate correlated phases in twisted heterostructures of graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides suggests an inherent resilience of moir\'e flat bands against certain types of disorder. We investigate the robustness of moir\'e flat bands in the chiral limit of the Bistrizer-MacDonald model, applicable to both platforms in certain limits. We show a drastic difference between the protection of the first magic angle and higher magic angles to chiral symmetric disorder such as random higher moir\'e potential harmonics arising, for instance, from lattice relaxation. We find that the first magic angle is topologically protected by a topological index theorem, similar to the protection of the zeroth Landau level of Dirac fermions, whose flatness withstands any chiral symmetric perturbation such as non-uniform magnetic fields. Focusing on the first magic angle of twisted bilayer graphene, our analysis reveals a hidden non-local constant of motion that permits the decomposition of the non-abelian gauge field induced by inter-layer tunnelings into two decoupled abelian ones, underscoring a topological mechanism for band flatness. Through numerical simulations, we further show the strikingly different robustness of flat bands across protected (first) and unprotected (higher) magic angles in the presence of various types of disorder and identify the scattering processes that are enhanced or suppressed in the chiral limit. Interestingly, we find that the suppression of disorder broadening persists away from the chiral limit and is further accentuated by isolating a single sublattice polarized flat band in energy. Our analysis suggests the Berry curvature hotspot at the top of the K and K' valence band in the transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers is essential for the stability of its moir\'e flat bands and their correlated states.</description>

      <title>(2+1)D topological phases with RT symmetry: many-body invariant, classification, and higher order edge modes</title>

Abstract: It is common in condensed matter systems for reflection ($R$) and time-reversal ($T$) symmetry to both be broken while the combination $RT$ is preserved. In this paper we study invariants that arise due to $RT$ symmetry. We consider many-body systems of interacting fermions with fermionic symmetry groups $G_f = \mathbb{Z}_2^f \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$, $U(1)^f \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$, and $U(1)^f \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$. We show that (2+1)D invertible fermionic topological phases with these symmetries have a $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_8$, $\mathbb{Z}^2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$, and $\mathbb{Z}^2 \times \mathbb{Z}_4$ classification, respectively, which we compute using the framework of $G$-crossed braided tensor categories. We provide a many-body $RT$ invariant in terms of a tripartite entanglement measure, and which we show can be understood using an edge conformal field theory computation in terms of vertex states. For $G_f = U(1)^f \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$, which applies to charged fermions in a magnetic field, the non-trivial value of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant requires strong interactions. For symmetry-preserving boundaries, the phases are distinguished by zero modes at the intersection of the reflection axis and the boundary. Additional invariants arise in the presence of translation or rotation symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental developments in van der Waals heterostructures, we investigate the emergent magnetism in Mott insulator - semimetal moir\'e superlattices by deriving effective spin models and exploring their phase diagram by Monte Carlo simulations. Our analysis indicates that the stacking-dependent interlayer Kondo interaction can give rise to different types of magnetic order, forming domains within the moir\'e unit cell. In particular, we find that the AB (AA) stacking regions tend to order (anti)ferromagnetically for an extended range of parameters. The remaining parts of the moir\'e unit cell form ferromagnetic chains that are coupled antiferromagnetically. We show that the decay length of the Kondo interaction can control the extent of these phases. Our results highlight the importance of stacking-dependent interlayer exchange and the rich magnetic spin textures that can be obtained in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: To build a large scale quantum circuit comprising millions of cryogenic qubits will require an efficient way to supply large numbers of classic control signals. Given the limited number of direct connections allowed from room temperature, multiple level of signal multiplexing becomes essential. The stacking of hardware to accomplish this task is highly dependent on the lowest level implementation of control electronics, of which an open question is the feasibility of mK integration. Such integration is preferred for signal transmission and wire interconnection, provided it is not limited by the large power dissipation involved. Novel cryogenic electronics that prioritises power efficiency has to be developed to meet the tight thermal budget. In this paper, we present a power efficient approach to implement charge-locking array.</description>

      <title>First Landau Level Physics in Second Moir\'e Band of $2.1^\circ$ Twisted Bilayer MoTe${}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent experimental discovery of the fractional quantum spin Hall effect in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ at a twist angle of 2.1 degrees highlights the unique properties of its second moir\'e band. Inspired by this finding, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical investigation of the half-filled second moir\'e band at this angle, utilizing an effective continuum model. Our analysis reveals that the band not only exhibits characteristics akin to the first Landau level, $K=\int_\mathrm{BZ}\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{k}\:\mathrm{tr}\:\eta(\mathbf{k}) \approx 3$, but also that its projected Coulomb interaction strikingly mirrors the Haldane pseudopotentials of the first Landau level. They together strongly indicate the potential emergence of a non-Abelian fractional quantum anomalous Hall state at the half-filling under the Coulomb interactions. By performing exact diagonalization calculations, we validate this hypothesis and construct a global phase diagram around this non-Abelian fractional quantum anomalous Hall states. We also introduce a novel metric of 1LL-ness of a band, which quantitatively measures the alignment of the projected Coulomb interaction with the Haldane pseudopotentials in Landau levels. This metric is then compared with the global phase diagram including the non-Abelian fractional quantum anomalous Hall state, revealing its utility in predicting the parameter region of the 1LL-ness. Finally, we discuss the potential implications on experiments.</description>

Abstract: Excitons, or bound electron-hole pairs, play a crucial role in the optical response of monolayer, 2H-phase transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). They hold significant promise for the development of novel quantum opto-electronic devices due to their large binding energies and strong spin-orbit coupling. Among the monolayer TMDs, MoTe2 stands out because of its bandgap in the near-infrared (NIR) regime. Here, we report the experimental observation of NIR Rydberg excitons and conduction band-split charged excitons, in high-quality, boron nitride (BN)-encapsulated monolayer MoTe2 devices, probed by photoluminescence and electroluminescence spectroscopy. By employing a graphite bottom gate, we successfully modulate the emission intensity of various excitonic species. Additionally, our device fabrication process within an argon-filled glove box ensures clean TMD/metal electrode interfaces, enabling the construction of p-n junctions near the electrodes. Our work significantly advances our understanding of excitons in monolayer TMDs and contributes to the application of MoTe2 in NIR quantum opto-electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Convolutional network learning of self-consistent electron density via grid-projected atomic fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-consistent field (SCF) generation of the three-dimensional (3D) electron density distribution ($\rho$) represents a fundamental aspect of density functional theory (DFT) and related first-principles calculations, and how one can shorten or bypass the SCF loop represents a critical question from both practical and fundamental standpoints. Herein, a machine learning strategy DeepSCF is presented in which the map between the SCF $\rho$ and the initial guess density ($\rho_0$) constructed by the summation of neutral atomic densities is learned using 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). High accuracy and transferability of DeepSCF are achieved by expanding the input features to include atomic fingerprints beyond $\rho_0$ and encoding them on a 3D grid. The prediction of the residual density ($\delta\rho$) rather than $\rho$ itself is targeted, and, since $\delta\rho$ corresponds to chemical bonding information, a dataset of small-sized organic molecules featuring diverse bonding characters is adopted. After enhancing the fidelity of the method by subjecting the atomic geometries in the dataset to random strains and rotations, the effectiveness of DeepSCF is finally demonstrated using a complex large carbon nanotube-based DNA sequencer model. This work evidences that the nearsightedness in electronic structures can be optimally represented via the local connectivity in CNNs.</description>

      <title>Impact of a $MoS_2$ monolayer on the nanoscale thermoelastic response of silicon heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the thermoelastic response of a nanostructure is crucial for the choice of materials and interfaces in electronic devices with improved and tailored transport properties, at the length scales of the present technology. Here we show how the deposition of a $MoS_2$ monolayer can strongly modify the nanoscale thermoelastic dynamics of silicon substrates close to their interface. We achieve this result by creating a transient grating with extreme ultraviolet light, using ultrashort free-electron laser pulses, whose $\approx$84 nm period is comparable to the size of elements typically used in nanodevices, such as electric contacts and nanowires. The thermoelastic response, featured by coherent acoustic waves and an incoherent relaxation, is tangibly modified by the presence of monolayer $MoS_2$. Namely, we observed a major reduction of the amplitude of the surface mode, which is almost suppressed, while the longitudinal mode is basically unperturbed, aside from a faster decay of the acoustic modulations. We interpret this behavior as a selective modification of the surface elasticity and we discuss the conditions to observe such effect, which might be of immediate relevance for the design of Si-based nanoscale devices.</description>

      <title>Origin of multiple Lifshitz transitions in the Weyl semi-metal RhSi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known from density functional theory (DFT) calculations that RhSi has a multifold degenerate Dirac point at the Fermi energy, with the dominant states in the low-energy region displaying mostly Rh $d$ character. Using DFT+U, we calculate the band structure by considering an effective local interaction on the Rh $d$ states, with a realistic effective Hubbard $U_\textrm{eff}=2.5$ eV derived from a constrained random-phase approximation calculation, and find the emergence of a double hump structure close to the Fermi energy.By further deriving a low-energy tight-binding model from our first-principles results, we show that the double hump is a direct consequence of a competition between the Rh $d$-Rh $d$ and Rh $d$-Si $p$ interactions, which differ in their momentum dependence. As a consequence, through an artificial tuning of the energy level of the Si $p$ orbitals this hump structure can be suppressed due to the effectively reduced Rh $d$ -Si $p$ interaction.This peculiar low-energy electronic structure additionally results in that a small hole/electron doping ($\sim$ 0.1 $\%$) can tune the Fermi surface topology, going from closed to open Fermi surfaces, which has dramatic consequences for the thermal transport.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework for the rational approximation of optical response functions in resonant photonic systems. The framework is based on the AAA algorithm and further allows to solve the underlying nonlinear eigenproblems and to efficiently model sensitivities. An adaptive sampling strategy exploits the predominance of resonances in the physical response. We investigate a chiral metasurface and show that the chiroptical response on parameter variations can be accurately modeled in the vicinity of the relevant resonance frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting diode effects have recently attracted much attention for their potential applications in superconducting logic circuits. Several mechanisms such as magneto-chiral effects, finite momentum Cooper pairing, asymmetric edge currents have been proposed to give rise to a supercurrent diode effect in different materials. In this work, we establish the presence of a large intrinsic Josephson diode effect in a type-II Dirac semimetal $1T-PtTe_2$ facilitated by its helical spin-momentum locking and distinguish it from other extrinsic effects. The magnitude of the Josephson diode effect is shown to be directly correlated to the large second-harmonic component of the supercurrent that is induced by the significant contribution of the topological spin-momentum locked states that promote coherent Andreev processes in the junction. We denote such junctions, where the relative phase between the two harmonics corresponding to charge transfers of $2e$ and $4e$ can be tuned by a magnetic field, as second order ${\phi}_0$-junctions. The direct correspondence between the second harmonic supercurrent component and the diode effect in $1T-PtTe_2$ junctions makes topological semimetals with high transparency an ideal platform to study and implement the Josephson diode effect, while also enabling further research on higher order supercurrent transport in Josephson junctions.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic quantum oscillations (MQO) of Hall coefficient are measured in rare-earth tritelluride TmTe$_{3}$ and shown to be much stronger and persist to higher temperature than the Shubnikov oscillations. It is general for MQO in strongly anisotropic metals, and the combined measurements of Hall and diagonal magnetoresistance provide useful informations about the electronic structure. The ratio of their MQO amplitudes depends linearly on magnetic field, and its slope gives a simple and accurate measurement tool of the electron mean free time and its temperature dependence.</description>

Abstract: Electron spins in silicon quantum dot platform provide great potential for quantum information processing due to excellent physical properties and modern fabrication technologies. Spin-based quantum bit (qubit) operations are intensively studied to realize universal logic gates with a high fidelity, fast gating operations, and basic programmability. Although recent experimental achievements can be considered as remarkable results for utilizing quantum computation, more advanced quantum information protocols should be demonstrated with a large number of qubit system to enable programmability of silicon devices. Here, we computationally explore entanglement-based quantum information protocols in electrically defined five silicon quantum dot system. To this end, device simulations are employed to demonstrate $1$-qubit gate and $2$-qubit gate operations. Additionally, we discuss the implementations of three applications: the generation of magic states, entanglement swapping, and quantum teleportation in our silicon device. All the results will secure the scalability of quantum information processing with electron spin qubits in silicon quantum dot system.</description>

Abstract: Systems with dipole moment conservation have been of recent interest, as they realize both novel quantum dynamics and exotic ground state phases. In this work, we study some generic properties of 1-D and 2-D dipole-conserving fermionic models at integer fillings. We find that a dipolar symmetry-breaking phase can result in a mean-field band insulator whose topological indices can strongly affect the low-energy physics of the dipolar Goldstone modes. We study the 2-D topological phase transition of the mean-field ground states in the presence of the Goldstone modes. The critical theory resembles the 2+1d quantum electrodynamics coupled to massless Dirac fermions with some crucial differences and shows a novel quantum critical point featuring a nontrivial dynamical exponent. We also discuss the analogous case of 1-D dipole-conserving models and the role of topological invariants.</description>

Abstract: In time-reversal symmetry-broken Weyl semimetals, Weyl points act as monopoles and antimonopoles of the Berry curvature, with a monopole-antimonopole pair producing a net zero Berry flux. The two-dimensional (2D) planes that separate a monopole-antimonopole pair of Weyl points carry quantized Berry flux. In this work, we introduce a class of symmetry-protected Weyl semimetals which host monopole-antimonopole pairs of Weyl points that generate a quantized dipolar Berry flux. Consequently, topologically distinct 2D planes coexist in the Brillouin zone, carrying either quantized monopolar or dipolar flux. We construct a topological invariant -- the staggered Chern number -- to measure the quantized dipolar flux and employ it to topologically distinguish between various Weyl points. Finally, through a minimal two-band model, we investigate physical signatures of bulk topology, including surface Fermi arcs, zero-energy hinge states, and response to insertion of a $\pi$-flux vortex.</description>

      <title>Engineering flat bands in twisted-bilayer graphene away from the magic angle with chiral optical cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) is a recently discovered two-dimensional superlattice structure which exhibits strongly-correlated quantum many-body physics, including strange metallic behavior and unconventional superconductivity. Most of TBG exotic properties are connected to the emergence of a pair of isolated and topological flat electronic bands at the so-called magic angle, $\theta \approx 1.05^{\circ}$, which are nevertheless very fragile. In this work, we show that, by employing chiral optical cavities, the topological flat bands can be stabilized away from the magic angle in an interval of approximately $0.8^{\circ}&lt;\theta&lt;1.3^{\circ}$. As highlighted by a simplified theoretical model, time reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB), induced by the chiral nature of the cavity, plays a fundamental role in flattening the isolated bands and gapping out the rest of the spectrum. Additionally, TRSB suppresses the Berry curvature and induces a topological phase transition, with a gap closing at the $\Gamma$ point, towards a band structure with two isolated flat bands with Chern number equal to $0$. The efficiency of the cavity is discussed as a function of the twisting angle, the light-matter coupling and the optical cavity characteristic frequency. Our results demonstrate the possibility of engineering flat bands in TBG using optical devices, extending the onset of strongly-correlated topological electronic phases in moir\'e superlattices to a wider range in the twisting angle.</description>

      <title>Light Emission and Conductance Fluctuations in Electrically Driven and Plasmonically Enhanced Molecular Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrically connected and plasmonically enhanced molecular junctions combine the optical functionalities of high field confinement and enhancement (cavity function), and of high radiative efficiency (antenna function) with the electrical functionalities of molecular transport. Such combined optical and electrical probes have proven useful for the fundamental understanding of metal-molecule contacts and contribute to the development of nanoscale optoelectronic devices including ultrafast electronics and nanosensors. Here, we employ a self-assembled metal-molecule-metal junction with a nanoparticle bridge to investigate correlated fluctuations in conductance and tunneling-induced light emission at room temperature. Despite the presence of hundreds of molecules in the junction, the electrical conductance and light emission are both highly sensitive to atomic-scale fluctuations -- a phenomenology reminiscent of picocavities observed in Raman scattering and of luminescence blinking from photo-excited plasmonic junctions. Discrete steps in conductance associated with fluctuating emission intensities through the multiple plasmonic modes of the junction are consistent with a finite number of randomly localized, point-like sources dominating the optoelectronic response. Contrasting with these microscopic fluctuations, the overall plasmonic and electronic functionalities of our devices feature long-term survival at room temperature and under an electrical bias of a few volts, allowing for measurements over several months.</description>

      <title>Topology of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ nanosheets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02792v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the quantum spin-Hall edge channels of two-dimensional colloidal nanocrystals of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ were observed directly. Motivated by this development, we reconsider the four-band effective model which has been traditionally employed in the past to describe thin nanosheets of this material. Derived from a three-dimensional $\boldsymbol{k} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{p}$ model, it physically describes the top and bottom electronic surface states at the $\Gamma$ point that become gapped due to the material's small thickness. However, we find that the four-band model for the surface states alone, as derived directly from the three-dimensional theory, is inadequate for the description of thin films of a few quintuple layers and even yields an incorrect topological invariant within a significant range of thicknesses. To address this limitation we propose an eight-band model which, in addition to the surface states, also incorporates the set of bulk states closest to the Fermi level. We find that the eight-band model not only captures most of the experimental observations, but also agrees with previous first-principles calculations of the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ invariant in thin films of varying thickness. The band inversion around the $\Gamma$ point, which endows the surface-like bands with topology, is shown to be enabled by the presence of the additional bulk-like states without requiring any reparametrization of the resulting effective Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we show that a magnon spin capacitor can be realized at a junction between two exchange coupled ferromagnets. In this junction, the buildup of magnon spin over the junction is coupled to the difference in magnon chemical potential, realizing the magnon spin analogue of an electrical capacitor. The relation between magnon spin and magnon chemical potential difference directly follows from considering the magnon density-density interaction between the two ferromagnets. We analyse the junction in detail by considering spin injection and detection from normal metal leads, the tunneling current across the junction and magnon decay within the ferromagnet, showing that such a structure realizes a magnon spin capacitor in series with a spin resistor. Choosing yttrium iron garnet as the ferromagnet, we numerically calculate the capacitance, which ranges from picofarad to microfarad, depending on the area of the junction. We therefore conclude that the magnon spin capacitor could directly be of use in applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene is the best studied physical platform featuring moire potential induced narrow bands with non-trivial topology and strong electronic correlations. Despite their significance, the Chern insulating states observed at a finite magnetic field -- and extrapolating to a band filling, $s$, at zero field -- remain poorly understood. Unraveling their nature is among the most important open problems in the province of moir\'e materials. Here we present the first comprehensive study of interacting electrons in finite magnetic field while varying the electron density, twist angle and heterostrain. Within a panoply of correlated Chern phases emerging at a range of twist angles, we uncover a unified description for the ubiquitous sequence of states with the Chern number $t$ for $(s,t)=\pm (0,4), \pm(1,3),\pm(2,2)$ and $\pm(3,1)$. We also find correlated Chern insulators at unconventional sequences with $s+t\neq \pm 4$, as well as with fractional $s$, and elucidate their nature.</description>

      <title>Large Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Spin-Orbit Proximitized Rhombohedral Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a robust topological phenomenon featuring quantized Hall resistance at zero magnetic field. We report the QAHE in a rhombohedral pentalayer graphene/monolayer WS2 heterostructure. Distinct from other experimentally confirmed QAHE systems, this system has neither magnetic element nor moir\'e superlattice effect. The QAH states emerge at charge neutrality and feature Chern numbers C = +-5 at temperatures up to about 1.5 K. This large QAHE arises from the synergy of the electron correlation in intrinsic flat bands of pentalayer graphene, the gate-tuning effect, and the proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit-coupling. Our experiment demonstrates the potential of crystalline two-dimensional materials for intertwined electron correlation and band topology physics, and may enable a route for engineering chiral Majorana edge states.</description>

      <title>Terahertz detection with graphene FETs: photothermoelectric and resistive self-mixing contributions to the detector response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Field-effect transistors coupled to integrated antennas (TeraFETs) are photodetectors being actively developed for the THz frequency range ($\sim$ 100 GHz - 10 THz). Among them, Graphene TeraFETs (G-TeraFETs) have demonstrated distinctive photoresponse features compared to those made from elementary semiconductors. For instance, previous studies have shown that G-TeraFETs exhibit a THz response that comprises two components: the resistive self-mixing (RSM) and photothermoelectric effect (PTE). The RSM and PTE arise from carrier density oscillations and carrier heating, respectively. In this work, we confirm that the photoresponse can be considered a combination of RSM and PTE, with PTE being the dominant rectification mechanism at higher frequencies. For our CVD G-TeraFETs with asymmetric antenna coupling, the PTE response dominates over the RSM at frequencies above 100 GHz. We find that relative contribution of RSM and PTE to the photoresponse is strongly frequency dependent. Electromagnetic wave simulations show that this behavior is due to the relative change in the total dissipated power between the gated and ungated channel regions of the G-TeraFET as the frequency increases. The simulations also indicate that the channel length over which the PTE contributes to the photoresponse below the gate electrode is approximately the same as the electronic cooling length. Finally, we identify a PTE contribution that can be attributed to the contact doping effect in graphene close to the metal contacts. Our detectors achieve a minimum optical noise-equivalent power of 101 (114) pW/$\sqrt{Hz}$ for asymmetric (symmetric) THz antenna coupling conditions at 400 GHz. This work demonstrates how the PTE response can be used to optimize the THz responsivity of G-TeraFETs.</description>

      <title>Tensorial properties via the neuroevolution potential framework: Fast simulation of infrared and Raman spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared and Raman spectroscopy are widely used for the characterization of gases, liquids, and solids, as the spectra contain a wealth of information concerning in particular the dynamics of these systems. Atomic scale simulations can be used to predict such spectra but are often severely limited due to high computational cost or the need for strong approximations that limit application range and reliability. Here, we introduce a machine learning (ML) accelerated approach that addresses these shortcomings and provides a significant performance boost in terms of data and computational efficiency compared to earlier ML schemes. To this end, we generalize the neuroevolution potential approach to enable the prediction of rank one and two tensors to obtain the tensorial neuroevolution potential (TNEP) scheme. We apply the resulting framework to construct models for the dipole moment, polarizability, and susceptibility of molecules, liquids, and solids, and show that our approach compares favorably with several ML models from the literature with respect to accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the TNEP approach to the prediction of infrared and Raman spectra of liquid water, a molecule (PTAF-), and a prototypical perovskite with strong anharmonicity (BaZrO3). The TNEP approach is implemented in the free and open source software package GPUMD, which makes this methodology readily available to the scientific community.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically consider bilayers of two dimensional (2D) electron gases as in semiconductor quantum wells, and investigate possible spontaneous symmetry breaking transitions at low carrier densities driven by interlayer Coulomb interactions. We use a self-consistent technique implementing mean field truncations of the interacting four-fermion terms, and find a U(1) layer symmetry breaking transition at low carrier densities where the individual layer identities are lost leading to an effective pseudospin XY ferromagnet in the 2D plane. Our results validate earlier theoretical works using simpler restricted Hartree-Fock techniques, and establish the pseudospin XY ferromagnet as a possible low-density symmetry broken phase of 2D bilayers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, an associative memory operation by a virtual oscillator network, consisting of a single spintronic oscillator, was examined to solve issues in conventional, real oscillators-based neural networks such as inhomogeneities between the oscillators. However, the spintronic oscillator still carries issues dissipating large amount of energy because it is driven by electric current. Here, we propose to use a single ferromagnet manipulated by voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect as a fundamental element in a virtual neural network, which will contribute to significantly reducing the Joule heating caused by electric current. Instead of the oscillation in oscillator networks, magnetization relaxation dynamics were used for the associative memory operation. The associative memory operation for alphabet patterns is successfully demonstrated by giving correspondences between the colors in a pattern recognition task and the sign of a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy coefficient, which could be either positive or negative via the VCMA effect.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the impacts of an imaginary transverse field on the dynamics of magnetic domain walls in a quantum Ising chain. We show that an imaginary field plays a similar role as a real transverse field in forming a low-lying Wannier-Stark ladder. However, analytical and numerical calculations of the time evolutions in both systems show that the corresponding Bloch oscillations exhibit totally different patterns for the same initial states. These findings reveal the nontrivial effect of non-Hermiticity on quantum spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity induced by spin-orbit coupling, perpendicular magnetic field and superlattice potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological superconductors support Majorana modes, which are quasiparticles that are their own antiparticles and which obey non-Abelian statistics in which successive exchanges of particles do not always commute. Here we investigate whether a two-dimensional superconductor with ordinary s-wave pairing can be rendered topological by the application of a strong magnetic field. To address this, we obtain the self-consistent solutions to the mean field Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, which are a large set of nonlinearly coupled equations, for electrons moving on a lattice. We find that the topological "quantum Hall superconductivity" is facilitated by a combination of spin-orbit coupling, which locks an electron's spin to its momentum as it moves through a material, and a coupling to an external periodic potential which gives a dispersion to the Landau levels and also distorts the Abrikosov lattice. We find that, for a range of parameters, the Landau levels broadened by the external periodic potential support topological superconductivity, which is typically accompanied by a lattice of "giant" $h/e$ vortices as opposed to the familiar lattice of $h/2e$ Abrikosov vortices. In the presence of a periodic potential, we find it necessary to use an ansatz for the pairing potential of the form $\Delta(\vec{r})e^{i2\vec{Q}\cdot\vec{r}}$ where $\Delta(\vec{r})$ has a periodicity commensurate with the periodic potential. However, despite this form of the pairing potential, the current in the ground state is zero. In the region of ordinary superconductivity, we typically find a lattice of dimers of $h/2e$ vortices. Our work suggests a realistic proposal for achieving topological superconductivity, as well as a helical order parameter and unusual Abrikosov lattices.</description>

Abstract: We explore the possibilities for spin-singlet superconductivity in newly discovered altermagnets. Investigating $d$-wave altermagnets, we show that finite-momentum superconductivity can easily emerge in altermagnets even though they have no net magnetization, when the superconducting order parameter also has $d$-wave symmetry with nodes coinciding with the altermagnet nodes. Additionally, we find a rich phase diagram when both altermagnetism and an external magnetic field are considered, including superconductivity appearing at high magnetic fields from a parent zero-field normal state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic qubit controllers (QCs) are the key to build large-scale superconducting quantum processors. However, developing scalable QCs is challenging because the cooling power of a dilution refrigerator is too small (~10 $\mu$W at ~10 mK) to operate conventional logic families, such as complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor logic and superconducting single-flux-quantum logic, near qubits. Here we report on a scalable QC using an ultra-low-power superconductor logic family, namely adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) logic. The AQFP-based QC, referred to as the AQFP-multiplexed QC (AQFP-mux QC), produces multi-tone microwave signals for qubit control with an extremely small power dissipation of 81.8 pW per qubit. Furthermore, the AQFP-mux QC adopts microwave multiplexing to reduce the number of coaxial cables for operating the entire system. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate an AQFP-mux QC chip that produces microwave signals at two output ports through microwave multiplexing and demultiplexing. Experimental results show an output power of approximately $-$80 dBm and on/off ratio of ~40 dB at each output port. Basic mixing operation is also demonstrated by observing sideband signals.</description>

Abstract: We present a superconducting circuit device that provides active, on-demand, tunable dissipation on a target mode of the electromagnetic field. Our device is based on a tunable "dissipator" that can be made lossy when tuned into resonance with a broadband filter mode. When driven parametrically, this dissipator induces loss on any mode coupled to it with energy detuning equal to the drive frequency. We demonstrate the use of this device to reset a superconducting qubit's readout cavity after a measurement, removing photons with a characteristic rate above $50\ \mu\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We also demonstrate that the dissipation can be driven constantly to simultaneously damp and cool the cavity, effectively eliminating thermal photon fluctuations as a relevant decoherence channel. Our results demonstrate the utility of our device as a modular tool for environmental engineering and entropy removal in circuit QED.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental observations of opposite Chern numbers in $R$-type twisted MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ homobilayers, we perform large-scale density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations with machine learning force fields to investigate moir\'e band topology from large to small twist angles in both materials. We find that the Chern numbers of the moir\'e frontier bands change sign as a function of twist angle, and this change is driven by the competition between moir\'{e} ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity. Our large-scale calculations, enabled by machine learning methods, reveal crucial insights into interactions across different scales in twisted bilayer systems. The interplay between atomic-level relaxation effects and moir\'e-scale electrostatic potential variation opens new avenues for the design of intertwined topological and correlated states, including the possibility of mimicking higher Landau-level physics in the absence of a magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the well-known $(k\uparrow, -k\downarrow)$ Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction, when considered in real space, is equivalent to an infinite-range Penson-Kolb pairing mechanism coexisting with an attractive Hubbard term. Driven by this discovery and aiming at exploring the conduction properties, we investigate the dynamics of fermionic particles confined in a ring-shaped lattice. We assume that fermions are simultaneously influenced by the pairing interaction and by an Aharonov-Bohm electromagnetic phase, which is incorporated into the model in a highly non-trivial manner. Remarkably, the aforementioned model shows Richardson integrability for both integer and half-integer values of the applied magnetic flux $\Phi/\Phi_0$, thus permitting the exact solution of a genuine many-body problem. We discuss the ground state properties of both two-particle and many-particle systems, drawing comparisons with results from the attractive Hubbard model. Our approach combines exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group techniques, and numerical solution of the Richardson equations. This comprehensive analysis allows us to study various key metrics, including the system's conductivity as a function of the interaction strength. In this way, the BCS-BEC transition is investigated in a continuous manner, thus permitting to shed light on fundamental aspects of superconducting pairing. Our findings can be experimentally tested in a condensed matter context or, with greater level of control, using atomtronics platforms.</description>
