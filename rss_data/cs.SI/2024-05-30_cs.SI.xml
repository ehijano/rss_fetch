      <title>Sublinear Cuts are the Exception in BDF-GIRGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of geometry has proven instrumental in the efforts towards more realistic models for real-world networks. In Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRGs), Euclidean Geometry induces clustering of the vertices, which is widely observed in networks in the wild. Euclidean Geometry in multiple dimensions however restricts proximity of vertices to those cases where vertices are close in each coordinate. We introduce a large class of GIRG extensions, called BDF-GIRGs, which capture arbitrary hierarchies of the coordinates within the distance function of the vertex feature space. These distance functions have the potential to allow more realistic modeling of the complex formation of social ties in real-world networks, where similarities between people lead to connections. Here, similarity with respect to certain features, such as familial kinship or a shared workplace, suffices for the formation of ties. It is known that - while many key properties of GIRGs, such as log-log average distance and sparsity, are independent of the distance function - the Euclidean metric induces small separators, i.e. sublinear cuts of the unique giant component in GIRGs, whereas no such sublinear separators exist under the component-wise minimum distance. Building on work of Lengler and Todorovi\'{c}, we give a complete classification for the existence of small separators in BDF-GIRGs. We further show that BDF-GIRGs all fulfill a stochastic triangle inequality and thus also exhibit clustering.</description>

      <title>Improving global awareness of linkset predictions using Cross-Attentive Modulation tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of multiple link prediction or graph generation techniques rely on the attention mechanism or on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which consist in leveraging node-level information exchanges in order to form proper link predictions. Such node-level interactions do not process nodes as an ordered sequence, which would imply some kind of natural ordering of the nodes: they are said to be permutation invariant mechanisms. They are well suited for graph problems, but struggle at providing a global orchestration of the predicted links, which can result in a loss of performance. Some typical issues can be the difficulty to ensure high-level properties such as global connectedness, fixed diameter or to avoid information bottleneck effects such as oversmoothing and oversquashing, which respectively consist in abundant smoothing in dense areas leading to a loss of information and a tendency to exclude isolated nodes from the message passing scheme, and often result in irrelevant, unbalanced link predictions. To tackle this problem, we hereby present Cross-Attentive Modulation (CAM) tokens, which introduce cross-attentive units used to condition node and edge-level modulations in order to enable context-aware computations that improve the global consistency of the prediction links. We will implement it on a few permutation invariant architectures, and showcase benchmarks that prove the merits of our work.</description>

      <title>Network Analytics for Anti-Money Laundering -- A Systematic Literature Review and Experimental Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Money laundering presents a pervasive challenge, burdening society by financing illegal activities. To more effectively combat and detect money laundering, the use of network information is increasingly being explored, exploiting that money laundering necessarily involves interconnected parties. This has lead to a surge in literature on network analytics (NA) for anti-money laundering (AML). The literature, however, is fragmented and a comprehensive overview of existing work is missing. This results in limited understanding of the methods that may be applied and their comparative detection power. Therefore, this paper presents an extensive and systematic review of the literature. We identify and analyse 97 papers in the Web of Science and Scopus databases, resulting in a taxonomy of approaches following the fraud analytics framework of Bockel-Rickermann et al.. Moreover, this paper presents a comprehensive experimental framework to evaluate and compare the performance of prominent NA methods in a uniform setup. The framework is applied on the publicly available Elliptic data set and implements manual feature engineering, random walk-based methods, and deep learning GNNs. We conclude from the results that network analytics increases the predictive power of the AML model with graph neural networks giving the best results. An open source implementation of the experimental framework is provided to facilitate researchers and practitioners to extend upon these results and experiment on proprietary data. As such, we aim to promote a standardised approach towards the analysis and evaluation of network analytics for AML.</description>

      <title>An approximation for return time distributions of random walks on sparse networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an approximation for the first return time distribution of random walks on undirected networks. We combine a message-passing solution with a mean-field approximation, to account for the short- and long-term behaviours respectively. We test this approximation on several classes of large graphs and find excellent agreement between our approximations and the true distributions. While the statistical properties of a random walk will depend on the structure of the network, the observed agreement between our approximations and numerical calculations implies that while local structure is clearly very influential, global structure is only important in a relatively superficial way, namely through the total number of edges.</description>

      <title>Pre-train and Refine: Towards Higher Efficiency in K-Agnostic Community Detection without Quality Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection (CD) is a classic graph inference task that partitions nodes of a graph into densely connected groups. While many CD methods have been proposed with either impressive quality or efficiency, balancing the two aspects remains a challenge. This study explores the potential of deep graph learning to achieve a better trade-off between the quality and efficiency of K-agnostic CD, where the number of communities K is unknown. We propose PRoCD (Pre-training &amp; Refinement fOr Community Detection), a simple yet effective method that reformulates K-agnostic CD as the binary node pair classification. PRoCD follows a pre-training &amp; refinement paradigm inspired by recent advances in pre-training techniques. We first conduct the offline pre-training of PRoCD on small synthetic graphs covering various topology properties. Based on the inductive inference across graphs, we then generalize the pre-trained model (with frozen parameters) to large real graphs and use the derived CD results as the initialization of an existing efficient CD method (e.g., InfoMap) to further refine the quality of CD results. In addition to benefiting from the transfer ability regarding quality, the online generalization and refinement can also help achieve high inference efficiency, since there is no time-consuming model optimization. Experiments on public datasets with various scales demonstrate that PRoCD can ensure higher efficiency in K-agnostic CD without significant quality degradation.</description>
