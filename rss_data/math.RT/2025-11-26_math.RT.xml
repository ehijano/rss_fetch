      <title>The Parabolic K-motivic Hecke Category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study the parabolic K-motivic Hecke category of a (possibly disconnected) Kac-Moody group. Our main result is a combinatorial description via singular K-theory Soergel bimodules which arise from the equivariant algebraic K-theory of parabolic Bott-Samelson resolutions. In the spherical affine case, the K-motivic Hecke category serves as one side of a conjectural quantum K-theoretic derived Satake equivalence, addressing a conjecture of Cautis-Kamnitzer.</description>

      <title>A recognition theorem for permutation modules over $p$-groups extending Weiss' Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group with normal subgroup $N$, and $R$ a complete discrete valuation ring in mixed characteristic. We characterize permutation $RG$-modules in terms of modules for $RN$ and $R[G/N]$. The result generalizes both the seminal detection theorem for permutation modules due to Weiss, who characterizes those permutation $RG$-modules that are $RN$-free when $R$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb{Z}_p$, and a more recent result of MacQuarrie and Zalesskii, who prove a characterization of permutation modules when $N$ has order $p$ and $R = \mathbb{Z}_p$.</description>

      <title>On the geometric approach to the discrete series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harish-Chandra classified discrete series representations of real semisimple Lie groups by describing their characters as tempered distributions with an explicit formula on the elliptic set. His approach was inspired by Weyl's proof of the character formula for irreducible representations of compact Lie groups. Hecht, Mili\v{c}i\'{c}, Schmid and Wolf gave an alternative construction using the localization theory of Beilinson and Bernstein: the discrete series are the global sections of standard Harish-Chandra sheaves on the flag variety attached to the closed orbits of the complexification of a maximal compact subgroup. Their approach was inspired by the Borel-Weil theorem. In this paper, we give an explicit correspondence between these parametrizations. First, for a nilpotent radical $\mathfrak{n}$ of any Borel subalgebra, we establish a geometric formula for the $\mathfrak{n}$-homology of a module over the universal enveloping algebra of a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, in terms of its localization on the flag variety of $\mathfrak{g}$. Then we give applications of the formula to the discrete series. First, we give a geometric proof of Schmid's result describing the $\mathfrak{n}$-homology of discrete series representations for the nilpotent radical $\mathfrak{n}$ attached to a Borel subalgebra containing the Lie algebra of a maximal torus. Using Osborne's formula, this gives the formula for the character on the elliptic set, and leads to the matching of Harish-Chandra's parameters for discrete series representations with the geometric parameters. This gives an alternative approach to the study of the discrete series. As an example, we deduce Blattner's conjecture on the multiplicities of K-types of the discrete series from the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem for the maximal compact subgroup.</description>

      <title>Quantum wreath products and Schur--Weyl duality II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the conjecture of Ginzburg, Guay, Opdam, and Rouquier regarding constructing highest weight covers of the Hecke algebra, in type D. Departing from existing Cherednik-algebra techniques, our new theory is based on an interplay between a natural generalization of dual Specht modules, and a Grothendieck spectral sequence for finite-dimensional algebras that admit (inverse) Schur functors. While the main result is regarding type $D_{2m} = G(2,2,2m)$, partial results are proved along the way for complex reflection groups $G(d,d,dm)$ and $G(m,1,d)$. Our framework should extend to all Weyl groups and general $G(m,r,n)$. A key ingredient in our methods is a unifying construction of modules over quantum wreath products, in terms of parabolic inductions on tensor products of the ``wreath modules'' introduced in the article. This construction simultaneously recovers (and hence provides a more transparent realization of) important families of modules in the literature, including simple modules over the Ariki-Koike algebra, (anti)spherical modules and the Kashiwara-Miwa-Stern modules over the affine Hecke algebra, as well as the Specht and simple modules over the Hu algebra.</description>

      <title>The Balmer spectrum and tensor telescope conjecture for noetherian path algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a commutative noetherian ring $R$ and a finite acyclic quiver $Q$, we study the tensor triangulated category $\mathcal{D}(RQ)$ endowed with the vertexwise tensor product. We find a description of the internal hom functor and show that the category is not rigid. We compute its Balmer spectrum and, despite the non-rigidity, we get a classification of all the thick tensor-ideals and a stratification result. After introducing the notion of tensor-t-structure, we give a classification of the compactly generated ones and prove the tensor telescope conjecture.</description>

      <title>Designs on the Tautological bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the framework of a generalized design, which represents any linear operator as a finite sum of local linear maps attached to finitely many points, thereby abstracting the core of design theory without employing integration. We then construct such a design on the space of sections of the tautological bundle over the complex projective line. By using the irreducible decomposition of this space as an SU(2)-representation, we show that the projection onto its lowest-dimensional summand can be realized as a finite sum of these local maps. Our construction relies on invariant theory for the binary icosahedral group and an analysis of fixed-point subspaces in symmetric tensor representations.</description>

      <title>Character Identities Between Affine and Virasoro Vertex Operator Algebra Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The affine vertex operator algebras for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and the Virasoro minimal models are related by Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction and by the Goddard-Kent-Olive coset construction. In this work, we propose another connection based on certain character identities between these vertex operator algebras and their modules. This relates the simple affine vertex operator algebras $L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at admissible levels $k=-2+q/p$ to the rational $(q,3p)$-minimal models $L_\mathrm{Vir}(c_{q,3p},0)$, and also extends to the nonadmissible levels with $q=1$.
  Several special cases are particularly interesting. In the nonadmissible case $q=1$, the character identities extend to certain abelian intertwining algebras, specifically $\mathcal{V}^{(p)}$ and the doublet $\mathcal{A}^{(3p)}$. Specialising further to $p=2$, where $\mathcal{V}^{(2)}$ is the simple small $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal algebra of central charge $c=-9$, this recovers, via the 4d/2d-correspondence, a known identity between the Schur indices of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $(3,2)$ Argyres-Douglas theory.
  In the boundary admissible case $q=2$, in a similar vein, we obtain an identity between the Schur indices of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Argyres-Douglas theories of types $(A_1,D_{2n+1})$ and $(A_1,A_{6n})$.
  On the other hand, for integral levels, $p=1$, where both involved vertex operator algebras are strongly rational, our character identity induces a Galois conjugation between the representation categories $\mathrm{Rep}(L_{-2+q}(\mathfrak{sl}_2))$ and $\mathrm{Rep}(L_\mathrm{Vir}(c_{q,3},0))$. We conjecture that the characters are related by the action of certain Hecke operators.
  Finally, we also sketch how to extend the results of this paper to relaxed highest-weight and Whittaker modules.</description>

      <title>Hochschild cohomology of Beilinson algebras of graded down-up algebras with weights ($n,m$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A=A(\alpha, \beta)$ be a graded down-up algebra with weights $({\rm deg}\, x, {\rm deg}\, y)=(n,m)$ and $\beta \neq 0$, and $\nabla A$ the Beilinson algebra of $A$. Note that $A$ is a $3$-dimensional cubic AS-regular algebra. Assume that $\gcd(n, m)=1$ and $m \geq n$. If $n=1$ and $m=1$, then a description of the Hochschild cohomology group of $\nabla A$ was already known by Belmans. If $n=1$ and $m \geq 2$, then the dimensional formula of the Hochschild cohomology group of $\nabla A$ was given by the first author and Ueyama. In this paper, we give the dimensional formula of the Hochschild cohomology group of $\nabla A$ for the case that $n \geq 2$ and $m \geq 2$. As a byproduct of this dimensional formula, we prove that, for $m&gt;n&gt;1$, the derived category of a non-commutative projective scheme associated to $A$ is not equivalent to the derived category of any smooth projective surface. Moreover, we give the ring structure on the Hochschild cohomology group with the Yoneda product for the case that $m\geq n\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>On the $C^*$-algebras of linear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We verify the conjecture on continuous-trace subquotients for $C^*$-algebras of nilpotent linear dynamical systems, where by linear dynamical system we mean a continuous action of the additive group of real numbers by linear maps on a finite-dimensional real vector space. In addition, we show that the dimension of the ambient vector space can be recovered from the corresponding $C^*$-algebra and, if the action is nilpotent of degree two, the corresponding group is $C^*$-rigid within the class of 1-connected nilpotent Lie groups with coadjoint orbits of dimension $\le 2$.</description>

      <title>Based cluster algebras of infinite rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend based cluster algebras from the finite rank case to the infinite rank case. By extending (quantum) cluster algebras whose initial seeds are associated with signed words (arising from double Bott--Samelson cells), we recover infinite rank cluster algebras arising from representations of (shifted) quantum affine algebras.
  As a main application, we show that the fundamental variables of the cluster algebras arising from double Bott--Samelson cells can be computed via a braid group action when the Cartan matrix is of finite type. We also obtain the equality A=U for the associated infinite rank (quantum) cluster algebras. Additionally, several conjectures regarding quantum virtual Grothendieck rings due to Jang--Lee--Oh and Oh--Park follow as consequences. Finally, we show that the cluster algebras arising from representations of shifted quantum affine algebras, discovered by Geiss--Hernandez--Leclerc, admit natural quantizations.</description>
