      <title>Biological Multi-Layer and Single Cell Network-Based Multiomics Models - a Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in single cell sequencing and multi-omics techniques have significantly improved our understanding of biological phenomena and our capacity to model them. Despite combined capture of data modalities showing similar progress, notably single cell transcriptomics and proteomics, simultaneous multi-omics level probing still remains challenging. As an alternative to combined capture of biological data, in this review, we explore current and upcoming methods for post-hoc network inference and integration with an emphasis on single cell transcriptomics and proteomics. By examining various approaches, from probabilistic models to graph-based algorithms, we outline the challenges and potential strategies for effectively combining biological data types while simultaneously highlighting the importance of model validation. With this review, we aim to inform readers of the breadth of tools currently available for the purpose-specific generation of heterogeneous multi-layer networks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Inference of Asynchronous Boolean Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Associations between phenotype and genomic and epigenomic markers are often derived by correlation. Systems Biology aims to make more robust connections and uncover broader insights by modeling the cellular mechanisms that produce a phenotype. The question of choosing the modeling methodology is of central importance. A model that does not capture biological reality closely enough will not explain the system's behavior. At the same time, highly detailed models suffer from computational limitations and are likely to overfit the data. Boolean networks strike a balance between complexity and descriptiveness and thus have received increasing interest. We previously described an algorithm for fitting Boolean networks to high-throughout experimental data that finds the optimal network with respect to the information in a given dataset. In this work, we describe a simple extension that enables the modeling of asynchronous dynamics, i.e. different reaction times for different network nodes. In addition, we present a new method for pseudo-time assignment for single-cell RNA sequencing data that is derived from the modeling procedure. Our approach greatly simplifies the construction of Boolean network models for time-series datasets, where asynchronicity often occurs. We demonstrate our methodology by integrating real data from transcriptomics experiments. These results significantly expand the applicability of the Boolean network model to experimental data.</description>
