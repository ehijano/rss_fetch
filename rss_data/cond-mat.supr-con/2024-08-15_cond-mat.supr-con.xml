      <title>Perfect superconducting diode effect in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate intrinsic superconducting diode effect in the unconventional superconducting state of $d$-wave altermagnets. We find large diode efficiencies in the wide-reaching finite-momentum pairing regimes of the phase diagram. Remarkably, even perfect diode efficiency of 100% can be obtained in the presence of an external magnetic field. We attribute the largest efficiencies to competition between multiple zero-momentum (BCS) and finite-momentum superconducting states, which is connected to a topological nodal-to-nodeless transition in altermagnets with magnetic field, making our results applicable to a wide range of altermagnets.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Josephson junction and inductor models in Keysight ADS that feature an auxiliary flux port, and facilitate the expression of flux quantization conditions in simulation of superconducting microwave circuits. We present several examples that illustrate our methodology for constructing flux-quantizing circuits, including dc- and rf-SQUIDs, tunable couplers, and parametric amplifiers using SNAIL and rf-SQUID arrays. We perform DC, S-parameter, and harmonic balance simulations to validate our models and methods against theory and published experimental results.</description>

      <title>Coupling between electrons and charge density wave fluctuation and its possible role in superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In most of charge density wave (CDW) systems of different material classes, ranging from traditional correlated systems in low-dimension to recent topological systems with Kagome lattice, superconductivity emerges when the system is driven toward the quantum critical point (QCP) of CDW via external parameters of doping and pressure. Despite this rather universal trend, the essential hinge between CDW and superconductivity has not been established yet. Here, the evidence of coupling between electron and CDW fluctuation is reported, based on a temperature- and intercalation-dependent kink in the angle-resolved photoemission spectra of 2H-PdxTaSe2. Kinks are observed only when the system is in the CDW phase, regardless of whether a long- or short-range order is established. Notably, the coupling strength is enhanced upon long-range CDW suppression, albeit the coupling energy scale is reduced. Interestingly, estimation of the superconducting critical temperature by incorporating the observed coupling characteristics into McMillan's equation yields result closely resembling the known values of the superconducting dome. Our results thus highlight a compelling possibility that this new coupling mediates Cooper pairs, which provides new insights on the competing relationship not only for CDW, but also for other competing orders.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional superconductivity in a thick exfoliated kagome film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of two-dimensional superconductivity (2D SC) in exfoliated kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ with a thickness far thicker than the atomic limit. By examining the critical current and upper critical magnetic fields ($H_{c2}$) of 40-60 nm thick films in the superconducting state, we identify a pronounced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition behavior, i.e. a drastic decrease of the superfluid stiffness near the transition, and a cusp-like feature of the angular dependent $H_{c2}$, both of which serve as direct evidence of 2D SC. In addition, an exceeding of the Pauli paramagnetic limit of the in-plane $H_{c2}$ is consistent with the 2D SC nature. The observed 2D SC occurs in thick films with the highest superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and the lowest charge density wave transition temperature $T_{\rm {CDW}}$, which suggests that the charge density wave states are interrelated with the superconducting states. Our findings impose constraints in understanding the enhancement of SC in kagome superconductors, and illuminate pathways for achieving novel 2D superconducting states in more stable and much thicker systems.</description>

      <title>Spin and orbital Edelstein effect in spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductors without inversion symmetry can exhibit a non-zero magnetization when a supercurrent is present, leading to non-dissipative magnetoelectric effects. Here, we focus on understanding the relation between the spin and orbital properties of these effects in conventional spin-singlet noncentrosymmetric superconductors with orbital Rashba coupling, particularly for multiorbital electronic systems with coupled spin and orbital moments. We investigate how atomic spin-orbit coupling influences the magnitude and direction of the spin and orbital Edelstein effect. Our findings indicate that the correlation between spin and orbital moments induced by supercurrents is generally not determined by the sign of atomic spin-orbit coupling, but rather by the number of bands at the Fermi level and the orbital characteristics of those bands with respect to the mirror parity. We investigate the character of the spin and orbital Edelstein effect by examining its dependence in momentum space and the role of avoiding crossings in determining the induced magnetization. The outcomes demonstrate that the sign change of the orbital Edelstein effect near avoiding crossing bands remains robust despite modifications to the atomic spin-orbit amplitude. Furthermore, we observe that the spin Edelstein effect is typically one order of magnitude smaller than the orbital Edelstein effect, but can be significantly enhanced in certain scenarios with increased atomic spin-orbit coupling. These results indicate that by manipulating the orbital degrees of freedom in noncentrosymmetric materials, the relationship between the spin and orbital Edelstein moments can be effectively controlled.</description>

      <title>Dual relaxation oscillations in a Josephson junction array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report relaxation oscillations in a one-dimensional array of Josephson junctions. The oscillations are circuit-dual to those ordinarily observed in single junctions. The dual circuit quantitatively accounts for temporal dynamics of the array, including the dependence on biasing conditions. Injection locking the oscillations results in well-developed current plateaux. A thermal model explains the relaxation step of the oscillations.</description>

      <title>Photon Frequency Conversion in High-$Q$ Superconducting Resonators: Axion Electrodynamics, QED &amp; Nonlinear Meissner Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-Q superconducting resonators have been proposed and developed as detectors of light-by-light scattering mediated by the hypothesized axion or virtual electron-positron pairs in quantum electrodynamics - the Euler-Heisenberg (EH) interaction. Photon frequency and mode conversion is central to the scheme for detecting such rare events. Superconducting resonators are nonlinear devices. The Meissner screening currents that confine the electromagnetic fields to the vacuum region of a superconducting RF cavity are nonlinear functions of the EM field at the vacuum-superconducting interface, and as a result can generate source currents and frequency conversion of microwave photons in the cavity. In this report we consider photon frequency and mode conversion in superconducting resonators with high quality factors from Meissner currents in single and dual cavity setups proposed for axion and QED searches based on light-by-light scattering. In a single cavity with two pump modes photon frequency conversion by the Meissner screening current dominates photon generation by the EH interaction for cavities with $Q \lesssim 10^{12}$. The Meissner currents also generate background photons that limits the operation of the resonator for axion detection in three-mode, single cavity setups. We also consider the leakage of photons from pump modes into the signal mode for both axion and EH mediated light-by-light scattering. Photon frequency conversion by the EH interaction can compete with Meissner and leakage radiation in \emph{ultra-high-Q} cavities that are beyond current state of the art. Meissner radiation and leakage backgrounds can be suppressed in dual cavity setups with appropriate choices for pump and spectator modes, as well as the single-cavity setup proposed for heterodyne detection of galactic axion dark matter.</description>

      <title>High-T$_C$ superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ based on the bilayer two-orbital t-J model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16564v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently discovered high-T$_C$ superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has sparked renewed interest in the unconventional superconductivity. Here we study superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, using the renormalized mean-field theory. Our results reveal a robust $s^\pm-$wave pairing driven by the inter-layer $d_{z^2}$ magnetic coupling, which exhibits a transition temperature within the same order of magnitude as the experimentally observed $T_c \sim 80$ K. We establish a comprehensive superconducting phase diagram in the doping plane. Notably, the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure is found situated roughly in the optimal doping regime of the phase diagram. When the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes close to half-filling, $d-$wave and $d+is$ pairing can emerge from the system. We discuss the interplay between Fermi surface topology and different pairing symmetries. The stability of the $s^\pm-$wave pairing against Hund's coupling and other magnetic exchange couplings is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity (SC) was experimentally observed for the first time in antimony polyhydride. The diamond anvil cell combined with laser heating system was used to synthesize the antimony polyhydride sample at high pressure and high temperature conditions. In-situ high pressure transport measurements as function of temperature with applied magnet are performed to study the SC properties. It was found that the antimony polyhydride samples show superconducting transition with critical temperature $T_c = 116^\circ$K at 184 GPa. The investigation of SC at magnetic field revealed that the superconducting coherent length ~40 angstroms based on Ginzburg Landau (GL) equation. Antimony polyhydride superconductor has the second highest Tc in addition to sulfur hydride among the polyhydrides of elements from main group IIIA to VIIA in periodic table.</description>

      <title>Surface density of states and tunneling spectroscopy of a spin-3/2 superconductor with Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces of superconducting states arise from point or line nodes by breaking time-reversal symmetry. Because line and point nodes often accompany topologically protected zero-energy surface Andreev bound states (ASBSs) and thereby lead to a characteristic zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP) in tunneling spectroscopy, we investigate how these properties change when the line and point nodes deform into BFSs. In this paper, we consider spin-quintet $J_{\rm pair}=2$ pairing states of spin-3/2 electrons with BFSs and calculate the surface density of states and the charge conductance. Comparing the obtained results with the cases of spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing states having the same symmetry, we find that the ZBCP associated with point and/or line nodes is blunted or split in accordance with the appearance of the BFSs. On the other hand, when the spin-singlet $d$-wave state has point nodes but does not have SABS on the surface, we obtain a nonzero small electron conductivity at zero bias through the zero-energy states on the BFSs.</description>

      <title>Anomalous impurity effect in the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCu2Si2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations of contradictory impurity effect in the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCu2Si2 at ambient pressure have hindered the identification of its pairing symmetry. Here we perform theoretical analyses with both intraband and interband impurity scatterings for the nodeless $s^\pm$-wave pairing, and report an anomalous nonmonotonic variation of its $T_c$ suppression with the scattering strength. Our results reproduce the prominent reduction of $T_c$ in good agreement with earlier experiments by atomic substitution and explains as well its robustness against electron irradiation. We ascribe the latter to the screening of the interband impurity potential in the strong scattering or unitary region. This resolves the seeming contradiction in different experimental probes and provides an important support to the nodeless $s^\pm$-wave scenario in CeCu2Si2 at ambient pressure. Our theory may be extended to other narrow band systems such as twisted bilayer graphene and the recently discovered bilayer or trilayer nickelate superconductors, and provide a useful way to distinguish different paring candidates thereof.</description>

      <title>A Stress Induced Source of Phonon Bursts and Quasiparticle Poisoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of superconducting qubits is degraded by a poorly characterized set of energy sources breaking the Cooper pairs responsible for superconductivity, creating a condition often called ``quasiparticle poisoning". Both superconducting qubits and low threshold dark matter calorimeters have observed excess bursts of quasiparticles or phonons that decrease in rate with time. Here, we show that a silicon crystal glued to its holder exhibits a rate of low-energy phonon events that is more than two orders of magnitude larger than in a functionally identical crystal suspended from its holder in a low-stress state. The excess phonon event rate in the glued crystal decreases with time since cooldown, consistent with a source of phonon bursts which contributes to quasiparticle poisoning in quantum circuits and the low-energy events observed in cryogenic calorimeters. We argue that relaxation of thermally induced stress between the glue and crystal is the source of these events.</description>

      <title>Engineering Phase Competition Between Stripe Order and Superconductivity in La$_{1.88}$Sr$_{0.12}$CuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity often couples to other electronic orders in a cooperative or competing fashion. Identifying external stimuli that tune between these two limits is of fundamental interest. Here, we show that strain perpendicular to the copper-oxide planes couples directly to the competing interaction between charge stripe order and superconductivity in La$_{1.88}$Sr$_{0.12}$CuO$_4$ (LSCO). Compressive $c$-axis pressure amplifies stripe order within the superconducting state, while having no impact on the normal state. By contrast, strain dramatically diminishes the magnetic field enhancement of stripe order in the superconducting state. These results suggest that $c$-axis strain acts as tuning parameter of the competing interaction between charge stripe order and superconductivity. This interpretation implies a uniaxial pressure-induced ground state in which the competition between charge order and superconductivity is reduced.</description>

      <title>Josephson oscillations of two weakly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A numerical experiment based on a particle number-conserving quantum field theory is performed for two initially independent Bose-Einstein condensates that are coherently coupled at two temperatures. The present model illustrates ab initio that the initial phase of each of the two condensates doesn't remain random at the Boltzmann equilibrium, but is distributed around integer multiple values of $2\pi$ from the interference and thermalization of forward and backward propagating matter waves. The thermalization inside the atomic vapors can be understood as an intrinsic measurement process that defines a temperature for the two condensates and projects the quantum states to an average wave field with zero (relative) phases. Following this approach, focus is put on the original thought experiment of Anderson on whether a Josephson current between two initially separated Bose-Einstein condensates occurs in a deterministic way or not, depending on the initial phase distribution.</description>
