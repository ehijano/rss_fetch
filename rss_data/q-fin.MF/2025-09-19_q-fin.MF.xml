      <title>Unbiased Rough Integrators and No Free Lunch in Rough-Path-Based Market Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Built to generalise classical stochastic calculus, rough path theory provides a natural and pathwise framework to model continuous non-semimartingale assets. This paper investigates the ultimate capacity of this framework to support frictionless continuous No-Free-Lunch markets \`a la Kreps-Yan. We establish a ``Rough Kreps-Yan" theorem, which links our No Controlled Free Lunch (NCFL) condition to the unbiasedness of the driver of the price process as a rough integrator. The central work of this paper is a complete classification of these unbiased rough integrators with respect to different classes of controlled paths as integrands. As the set of admissible trading strategies is enlarged to include Markovian-type and signature-type portfolios, the only admissible random rough paths must be infinitesimally close to the It\^o rough path lift of a standard Brownian motion, up to a time change. In particular, Gaussianity is no longer a model assumption, but rather a no-arbitrage market consequence. Notably, simple strategies do not appear in the theory, and if they are then reintroduced, the rough noise is further enforced to be the It\^o rough path of Brownian motion itself. Ultimately, this implies that continuous frictionless markets based on rough path theory are inevitably constrained to the semimartingale paradigm, providing a definitive answer on the limits of this approach. Our framework covers $\alpha-$H\"older continuous rough paths for $\alpha&gt;0$ arbitrarily small.</description>

      <title>The Additive Bachelier model with an application to the oil option market in the Covid period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In April 2020, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange temporarily switched the pricing formula for West Texas Intermediate oil market options from the Black model to the Bachelier model. In this context, we introduce an Additive Bachelier model that provides a simple closed-form solution and a good description of the Implied volatility surface. This new Additive model exhibits several notable mathematical and financial properties. It ensures the no-arbitrage condition, a critical requirement in highly volatile markets, while also enabling a parsimonious synthesis of the volatility surface. The model features only three parameters, each one with a clear financial interpretation: the volatility term structure, vol-of-vol, and a parameter for modelling skew. The proposed model supports efficient pricing of path-dependent exotic options via Monte Carlo simulation, using a straightforward and computationally efficient approach. Its calibration process can follow a cascade calibration: first, it accurately replicates the term structures of forwards and At-The-Money volatilities observed in the market; second, it fits the smile of the volatility surface. Overall this model provides a robust and parsimonious description of the oil option market during the exceptionally volatile first period of the Covid-19 pandemic.</description>

      <title>Robust Utility Optimization via a GAN Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust utility optimization enables an investor to deal with market uncertainty in a structured way, with the goal of maximizing the worst-case outcome. In this work, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) approach to (approximately) solve robust utility optimization problems in general and realistic settings. In particular, we model both the investor and the market by neural networks (NN) and train them in a mini-max zero-sum game. This approach is applicable for any continuous utility function and in realistic market settings with trading costs, where only observable information of the market can be used. A large empirical study shows the versatile usability of our method. Whenever an optimal reference strategy is available, our method performs on par with it and in the (many) settings without known optimal strategy, our method outperforms all other reference strategies. Moreover, we can conclude from our study that the trained path-dependent strategies do not outperform Markovian ones. Lastly, we uncover that our generative approach for learning optimal, (non-) robust investments under trading costs generates universally applicable alternatives to well known asymptotic strategies of idealized settings.</description>

      <title>A deep solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first deep-learning solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs) and their fully-coupled forward-backward variants. The method trains a neural network to approximate the two solution fields in a single stage, avoiding the use of nested time-stepping cycles that limit classical algorithms. For the decoupled case we prove a non-asymptotic error bound composed of an a posteriori residual plus the familiar square root dependence on the time step. Numerical experiments confirm this rate and reveal two key properties: \emph{scalability}, in the sense that accuracy remains stable from low dimension up to 500 spatial variables while GPU batching keeps wall-clock time nearly constant; and \emph{generality}, since the same method handles coupled systems whose forward dynamics depend on the backward solution. These results open practical access to a family of high-dimensional, path-dependent problems in stochastic control and quantitative finance.</description>
