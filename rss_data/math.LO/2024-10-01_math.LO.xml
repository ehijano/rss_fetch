      <title>Countable Ordered Groups and Weihrauch Reducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper continues to study the connection between reverse mathematics and Weihrauch reducibility. In particular, we study the problems formed from Maltsev's theorem on the order types of countable ordered groups. Solomon showed that the theorem is equivalent to $\mathsf{\Pi_1^1}$-$\mathsf{CA_0}$, the strongest of the big five subsystems of second order arithmetic. We show that the strength of the theorem comes from having a dense linear order without endpoints in its order type. Then, we show that for the related Weihrauch problem to be strong enough to be equivalent to $\mathsf{\hat{WF}}$ (the analog problem of $\mathsf{\Pi_1^1}$-$\mathsf{CA_0}$), an order-preserving function is necessary in the output. Without the order-preserving function, the problems are very much to the side compared to analog problems of the big five.</description>

      <title>A Walk on the Wild Side: Notions of maximality in first-order theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the classification of complete first-order theories, many dividing lines have been defined in order to understand the complexity and the behavior of some classes of theories. In this paper, using the concept of patterns of consistency and inconsistency, we describe a general framework to study dividing lines and we introduce a notion of maximal complexity by requesting the presence of all the exhibitable patterns of definable sets. Weakening this notion, we define new properties (Positive Maximality and the $PM_k$ hierarchy) and prove some results about them. In particular, we show that $PM_{k+1}$ theories are not $k$-dependent.</description>

      <title>Superabelian logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to provide an axiomatic definition of the unbound Lukasiewicz logic and its infinitary version and show their connection to Lukasiewicz logic. We are going to achieve this goal using tools of abstract algebraic logic and theory of lattice ordered groups. We will start by axiomatically introducing Abelian logic $Ab$ and its pointed version $pAb$. We will show that $pAb$ is finitely strongly complete with respect to $R_{-1},R_0,R_1$. Later we will present the extension $Lu$ of $pAb$, which will be finitely strongly complete w.r.t. $R_{-1}$. We will also discuss infinitary version of $Lu$, which will play counterpart of infinitary Lukasiewicz logic. In the rest of the article, we will discuss several other semilinear logics with strong finite completeness property w.r.t some combination of chains $R_{-1},R_0$ and $R_1$. Specifically, we will focus on the logic $Lu^*$, which can be seen as a dual version of the logic $Lu$.</description>

      <title>Model Theory of Local Real Closed SV-Rings of Finite Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note begins the model-theoretic study of local real closed SV-rings of finite rank; to this end, a structure theorem for reduced local SV-rings of finite rank is given and branching ideals in local real closed rings of finite rank are analysed. The class of local real closed SV-rings of rank $ n \in \mathbb{N}^{\geq 2} $ is elementary in the language of rings $ \mathscr{L} := \{ +, -, \cdot, 0, 1 \} $ and its $ \mathscr{L} $-theory $ T_n $ has a model companion $ T_{n,1} $; models of $ T_{n,1} $ are $ n $-fold fibre products $ (((V_1 \times_{\textbf{k}} V_2) \times_{\textbf{k}}V_3) \dots \times_{\textbf{k}} V_{n-1})\times_{\textbf{k}} V_{n} $ of non-trivial real closed valuation rings $ V_i $ with isomorphic residue field $\mathbf{k}$. The $ \mathscr{L} $-theory $ T_{n,1} $ is complete, decidable, and NIP. After enriching $ \mathscr{L} $ with a predicate for the maximal ideal, models of $ T_n $ have prime extensions in models of $ T_{n,1} $, and $ T_{n,1} $ is the model completion of $ T_n $ in this enriched language. A quantifier elimination result for $ T_{n,1} $ is also given. The class of those local real closed SV-rings of rank $ n\in \mathbb{N}^{\geq 2} $ which are $ n $-fold fibre products $ (((V_1 \times_{W} V_2) \times_{W}V_3) \dots \times_{W} V_{n-1})\times_{W} V_{n} $ of non-trivial real closed valuation rings $ V_i $ along surjective morphisms $ V_i \twoheadrightarrow W $ onto a non-trivial domain $ W $ is elementary in the language of rings, and its $ \mathscr{L} $-theory $ T_{n,2} $ is also complete, decidable, and NIP; after enriching $ \mathscr{L} $ with predicates for the maximal ideal and the unique branching ideal, $ T_{n,2} $ is model complete.</description>

      <title>Omission of Intervals: Deducing covering properties of subsets of the real line from their combinatorial structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method that we call \emph{omission of intervals}, for establishing topological properties of subsets of the real line based on their combinatorial structure. Using this method, we obtain conceptual proofs of the fundamental theorems in this realm, and new results that were hitherto inaccessible.</description>

      <title>The Borel complexity of the space of left-orderings, low-dimensional topology, and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop new tools to analyze the complexity of the conjugacy equivalence relation $E_\mathsf{lo}(G)$, whenever $G$ is a left-orderable group. Our methods are used to demonstrate non-smoothness of $E_\mathsf{lo}(G)$ for certain groups $G$ of dynamical origin, such as certain amalgams constructed from Thompson's group $F$. We also initiate a systematic analysis of $E_\mathsf{lo}(\pi_1(M))$, where $M$ is a $3$-manifold. We prove that if $M$ is not prime, then $E_\mathsf{lo}(\pi_1(M))$ is a universal countable Borel equivalence relation, and show that in certain cases the complexity of $E_\mathsf{lo}(\pi_1(M))$ is bounded below by the complexity of the conjugacy equivalence relation arising from the fundamental group of each of the JSJ pieces of $M$. We also prove that if $M$ is the complement of a nontrivial knot in $S^3$ then $E_\mathsf{lo}(\pi_1(M))$ is not smooth, and show how determining smoothness of $E_\mathsf{lo}(\pi_1(M))$ for all knot manifolds $M$ is related to the L-space conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an elementary class of linearly ordered groups, called growth order groups, encompassing certain groups under composition of formal series (e.g. transseries) as well as certain groups $\mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{M}}$ of infinitely large germs at infinity of unary functions definable in an o-minimal structure $\mathcal{M}$. We study the algebraic structure of growth order groups and give methods for constructing examples. We show that if $\mathcal{M}$ expands the real ordered field and germs in $\mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{M}}$ are levelled in the sense of Marker &amp; Miller, then $\mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{M}}$ is a growth order group.</description>

      <title>Permutation Models of Second Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: G\"unter Asser (1981) introduced second-order permutation models. In this way, the Fraenkel-Mostowski-Specker method for defining models of ZFA was transferred to a new application area. To investigate the strength of second-order principles of choice in second-order predicate logic (PLII) with Henkin interpretation (HPL), we have extended the Fraenkel-Mostowski-Specker-Asser method. Here we discuss many details, including some useful references. Finally, we address a question raised by Stephen Mackereth.</description>

      <title>Borel sets of Rado graphs and Ramsey's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.00266v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The well-known Galvin-Prikry Theorem states that Borel subsets of the Baire space are Ramsey: Given any Borel subset $\mathcal{X}\subseteq [\omega]^{\omega}$, where $[\omega]^{\omega}$ is endowed with the metric topology, each infinite subset $X\subseteq \omega$ contains an infinite subset $Y\subseteq X$ such that $[Y]^{\omega}$ is either contained in $\mathcal{X}$ or disjoint from $\mathcal{X}$. Kechris, Pestov, and Todorcevic point out in their seminal 2005 paper the dearth of similar results for homogeneous structures. Such results are a necessary step to the larger goal of finding a correspondence between structures with infinite dimensional Ramsey properties and topological dynamics, extending their correspondence between the Ramsey property and extreme amenability. In this article, we prove an analogue of the Galvin-Prikry theorem for the Rado graph. Any such infinite dimensional Ramsey theorem is subject to constraints following from the 2006 work of Laflamme, Sauer, and Vuksanovic. The proof uses techniques developed for the author's work on the Ramsey theory of the Henson graphs as well as some new methods for fusion sequences, used to bypass the lack of a certain amalgamation property enjoyed by the Baire space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By following the same construction pattern which Martin Davis proposed in a 1968 paper of his, we have obtained six quaternary quartic Diophantine equations that candidate as `rule-them-all' equations: proving that one of them has only a finite number of integer solutions would suffice to ensure that each recursively enumerable set admits a finite-fold polynomial Diophantine representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a version of Shelah's Categoricity Conjecture for arbitrary deconstructible classes of modules. Moreover, we show that if $\mathcal{A}$ is a deconstructible class of modules that fits in an abstract elementary class $(\mathcal{A},\preceq)$ such that (1) $\mathcal{A}$ is closed under direct summands and (2) $\preceq$ refines direct summands, then $\mathcal{A}$ is closed under arbitrary direct limits. In an Appendix, we prove that the assumption (2) is not needed in some models of ZFC.</description>

      <title>On the first-order theories of quaternions and octonions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be the language of rings. We provide an axiomatization of the $L$-theories of quaternions and octonions and we characterize the models of mentioned theories: they coincide, up to isomorphism, to quaternion and octonion algebras over a real closed field, respectively. We prove these theories are complete, model complete and they do not have quantifier elimination. Then, we focus on the class of ordered polynomials. Over $\mathbb{H}$ and $\mathbb{O}$ these polynomials are of special interest in hypercomplex analysis since they are slice regular. We deduce some fundamental properties of the zero loci of ordered polynomials from completeness and we prove the failure of quantifier elimination for the fragment of ordered formulas.</description>
