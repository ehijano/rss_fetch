      <title>Direct imaging of a topological nematic phase in a spin-compensated magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density waves conventionally describe the periodic modulation of charge or spin, yet the spatial modulation of electronic topology has remained elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a Berry-curvature density wave in the noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3NiN with compensated spins. Using high-precision Sagnac Kerr microscopy, we directly image micrometer-scale modulations of the Berry curvature. These topological ripples exhibit orientations unpinned to the crystal lattice, forming a nematic phase that spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry. We attribute this instability to field-induced spatial variations of the spin texture driven by competing magnetic interactions. This discovery unveils a new class of collective order in spin-compensated magnets arising from the geometric phase of the wavefunction itself and offering a tunable degree of freedom for topological spintronics based on antiferromagnets and altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Microwave Imaging of Edge Conductivity in Graphene at Charge Neutrality and Quantum Hall States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report local conductivity imaging of edge states in monolayer graphene by millikelvin microwave impedance microscopy (MIM). At the charge-neutrality point, as the magnetic field increases, the local conductivity at the edge drops to zero more slowly than in the bulk. This behavior is consistent with the calculated spatial profile of the charge gap in the canted antiferromagnetic phase. For comparison, we also perform microwave imaging of integer quantum Hall states away from neutrality, which host dissipationless chiral edge channels. The evolution of the edge signal as a function of the bulk gap is fundamentally different between the Landau level filling factor $\nu = 0$ and $|\nu| \ge 1$ integer quantum Hall states, which can be qualitatively explained by numerical simulations and theoretical analysis. Our results provide a comprehensive microscopic picture of the edge and bulk states as the Fermi level moves across the unique Landau-level spectrum of graphene.</description>

      <title>Observation of Room-temperature Charge Density Wave Correlations via Coherent Phonon Spectroscopy in Sn-doped Kagome Superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity measurements to track the evolution of charge density wave (CDW) correlations in Sn-doped Kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$. By extracting the coherent phonon spectrum, we evidence robust signatures of CDW correlations at temperature and doping ranges far beyond the phase boundary of long-range CDW order. Remarkably, we unveil short-range CDW correlations survive up to room temperature in $x = 0.32$ Sn-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, supported by synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements. We point out the introduction of quenched disorder by Sn doping can pin the CDW and form static short-range CDW, which can explain the observed persistent CDW signatures. Our results thus corroborate the ubiquity and robustness of CDW correlations in Sn-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and provide new insights on the role of disorders on the CDW correlations in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family.</description>

      <title>Optical and Hall conductivity of the two dimensional Hubbard model: effective theory description, sign-problem-free Monte Carlo simulation and applications to the cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact formulas for the optical conductivity and the Hall conductivity of the two dimensional Hubbard model are derived in terms of an effective theory description of the local moment fluctuation in the system. In this framework, the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the electromagnetic response of such a strongly correlated electron system becomes sign-problem-free in many physically relevant cases. In particular, it is sign-problem-free when we assume the widely used Millis-Monien-Pines form for the phenomenological susceptibility in the effective action of the fluctuating local moment, even though these local moments are now subjected to Landau damping as a result of their coupling to the itinerant quasiparticle on the fermi surface. This is true more generally when a $\varphi^{4}$ term is included in the effective action and is thus not restricted to the Gaussian limit. Here we demonstrate the power of this framework by studying the effect of thermal fluctuation of the local moment on the optical conductivity $\sigma^{xx}(\omega)$ and the Hall conductivity $\sigma^{xy}(\omega)$ of the cuprate superconductors. Both $\sigma^{xx}(\omega)$ and $\sigma^{xy}(\omega)$ calculated are found to exhibit a two-component structure, with a Drude component at low energy and a mid-infrared component at higher energy. Depending on the relative importance of the hole pocket and the electron pocket on the reconstructed fermi surface and the coupling strength to the local moment, the Drude component in $\mathrm{Im}\sigma^{xy}(\omega)$ can be either positive or negative.(full-length abstract can be found in the main text.)</description>

      <title>Machine-learning force-field models for dynamical simulations of metallic magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent advances in machine learning (ML) force-field methods for Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) simulations of itinerant electron magnets, focusing on scalability and transferability. Built on the principle of locality, a deep neural network model is developed to efficiently and accurately predict the electron-mediated forces governing spin dynamics. Symmetry-aware descriptors constructed through a group-theoretical approach ensure rigorous incorporation of both lattice and spin-rotation symmetries. The framework is demonstrated using the prototypical s-d exchange model widely employed in spintronics. ML-enabled large-scale simulations reveal novel nonequilibrium phenomena, including anomalous coarsening of tetrahedral spin order on the triangular lattice and the freezing of phase separation dynamics in lightly hole-doped, strong-coupling square-lattice systems. These results establish ML force-field frameworks as scalable, accurate, and versatile tools for modeling nonequilibrium spin dynamics in itinerant magnets.</description>

      <title>T-linear specific heat in pressurized and magnetized Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu2(BO3)2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pressurized Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu2(BO3)2 has been found to host a plaquette-singlet phase and an antiferromagnetic phase that break different symmetries spontaneously.The recent experiment showed that their transition is of a first order nature, which seems against the pursuit of exotic and deconfined degrees of freedom in this famous frustrated quantum magnet. We found a new direction in this study. By applying a magnetic field to the material, we discover that SrCu2(BO3)2 exhibits a universal and metallic T-linear specific heat behavior in a large magnetitic field range close to the pressure of zero-field first order transition between plaquette-singlet and antiferromagnetic phases. Such an unexpected gapless response from an electronically gapped Mott insulator could be attributed to magnetized Dirac spinons liberated by the combined effect of magnetic field and pressure, consistently seen from our quantum many-body thermal tensor network computation of the Shastry-Sutherland model under magnetic field. Such a robust and universal T-linear specific heat phase points out the richness of the phase diagram of the material expanded by the axes of pressure and magnetic field and is calling for new theoretical frameworks to its full explanation.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Discovery of Paired Wigner Crystals in Artificial Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e systems have emerged as an exciting tunable platform for engineering and probing quantum matter. A large number of exotic states have been observed, stimulating intense efforts in experiment, theory, and simulation. Utilizing a neural-network-based quantum Monte Carlo approach, we discover a new ground state of the two-dimensional electron gas in a honeycomb moire potential at a filling factor of $\nu_m =1/4$ (one electron every four moir\'e minima). In this state, two opposite-spin electrons pair to form a singlet-like valence bond state which restores local $C_6$ symmetry in hexagonal molecules each spanning $6$ moir\'e minima. These molecules of pairs then form a molecular Wigner crystal, leaving one quarter of the moir\'e minima mostly depleted. The formation of such a paired Wigner crystal, absent any confining potential or attractive interaction to facilitate "pre-assembling" the molecule, provides a fascinating case of collective phenomena in strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, and opportunities to engineer exotic properties.</description>

      <title>Extended Mean-Field Theory for the 2D Hubbard Model in Degenerate Dilute Electron Gases: Fluctuations, Superconducting Dome, and Interaction Mechanisms in Strontium Titanate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strontium titanate ($\mathrm{SrTiO_3, STO}$) dome-shaped superconducting transition temperature as a function of chemical potential, consistent with STO experiments, and shows that tunable s-wave and d-wave symmetries are modulated by doping. Superconducting fluctuations validate the mean-field approximation at low temperatures but destroy pairing at higher temperatures. The charge-density-wave order competes with superconductivity, enhances the effective electron mass inversely with the chemical potential, and increases with the interaction strength $U$ and the temperature $T$. SDW order is rare and fragile, while an additional magnetic term induces subtle band splitting. These findings suggest e-e contributions to STO's transport anomalies and provide criteria to distinguish e-e from e-ph origins, offering insights for engineering higher $T_c$ in dilute systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of Robust and Coherent Non-Abelian Hadron Dynamics on Noisy Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real-time evolution of strongly interacting matter remains a frontier of fundamental physics, as classical simulations are hampered by exponential Hilbert space growth and entanglement-driven bottlenecks in tensor networks. This study reports the quantum simulation of hadron dynamics within a $(1+1)$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory using a 156-qubit IBM superconducting processor. Leveraging a hardware-efficient Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) encoding, we simulate the dynamics of the physical degrees of freedom on a $60$-site lattice in the weak-coupling regime, as a crucial step toward the continuum limit. We successfully observe the light-cone propagation of a confined meson and internal oscillations indicative of early-time hadronic breathing modes. Notably, these high-fidelity results were obtained directly from the quantum data via a differential measurement protocol, together with measurement error mitigation, demonstrating a robust pathway for large-scale simulations even on noisy hardware. To validate the results, we benchmarked the quantum algorithm and outcome from the quantum processor against state-of-the-art approximated classical algorithms using CPU -- based on tensor network methods and Pauli propagation method, respectively. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative comparison demonstrating that as the system approaches the weak-coupling or the continuum limit, the quantum processor maintains a consistent structural robustness where classical tensor networks and Pauli propagation methods encounter an onset of exponential complexity or symmetry violations as an artifact of approximation in the algorithm. These results establish a scalable pathway for simulating non-Abelian dynamics on near-term quantum hardware and mark a critical step toward achieving a practical quantum advantage in high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon coupling revealed by charge density fluctuations in cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) governs lattice dynamics, charge transport, and collective electronic phases in quantum materials. In several families of unconventional superconductors, including transition-metal dichalcogenides and kagome metals, growing evidence points to a cooperative role of EPC and dynamic charge-density fluctuations (CDF) in stabilizing superconductivity. However, how the EPC strength evolves across phase diagrams and relates to superconducting properties in strongly correlated systems remains an open question. Here we investigate the interplay between phonons and the CDF recently identified in cuprate superconductors. Using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we track the dispersion and intensity of bond-stretching phonons in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ over wide ranges of doping, temperature, and momentum. We find that both the phonon softening at the CDF wave vector and the EPC strength, extracted from a pronounced phonon intensity anomaly, are maximized near $p = 0.19$, where superconducting properties are optimal and CDF intensity is strongest. These results identify dynamic charge-density fluctuations, rather than quasi-static charge density waves, as the dominant source of phonon renormalization in cuprates, and establish a direct correlation between EPC strength and the superconducting dome. More broadly, our measurements highlight EPC as a doping-dependent property of correlated materials, shaped by the electronic environment in which lattice vibrations are embedded.</description>

      <title>Correlated phases of moat-band excitons in two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional systems of interacting excitons with a moat dispersion, for which the ground-state energy manifold presents a ring of discrete or continuously degenerate minima around a single point in momentum space. At low densities and for an idealized, perfectly degenerate moat, we show that the excitons undergo statistical transmutation and stabilize a chiral spin liquid. At higher densities, the moat dispersion favors Bose-Einstein condensation into states occupying multiple momenta, leading to inhomogeneous condensate phases and potentially supersolidity. We discuss the impact of band-structure warping present in realistic systems and argue that it generically stabilizes Bose-condensed phases over the chiral spin liquid, and analyze the superfluid response of the former which is unconventional due to the moat band. We also demonstrate that a proper renormalization of the exciton-exciton interaction is essential for describing these phases, and show that even purely repulsive interactions can favor inhomogeneous condensates. To further explore inhomogeneous condensate phases, we employ a Gross-Pitaevskii framework with a pseudopotential approximation and map out the resulting phase diagram. We show that the presence of degenerate dispersion minima can drive supersolidity already at weak coupling, in contrast to systems with a standard parabolic dispersion. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of real excitonic systems and argue that moat-band-induced supersolidity can be within experimental reach for realistic values of the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of a lattice fermion model with symmetric mass generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase structure of a model containing two flavors of massless staggered fermions interacting through two independent four-fermion couplings, UI and UB, formulated on a three-dimensional Euclidean space-time lattice. At UB = 0, this model is known to exhibit a direct second-order quantum phase transition between a massless fermion (MF) phase and a phase in which fermions acquire masses through the mechanism commonly referred to as symmetric mass generation (SMG). We demonstrate that introducing a small nonzero value of UB qualitatively alters this structure: the single exotic transition at UB = 0 splits into two distinct, conventional transitions, separated by an intermediate phase in which fermion masses arise through the standard mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). The first of these is a Gross-Neveu transition separating the MF phase from the SSB-induced massive phase, while the second is a three-dimensional XY transition between the SSB phase and the SMG phase. Using the fermion-bag Monte Carlo method, we verify that the critical exponents associated with both transitions are consistent with the literature, thereby yielding a quantitative characterization of the resulting phase structure of the model.</description>

Abstract: The search for spin liquids, magnetic phases which lie outside the Landau paradigm, remains one of the central challenges for modern condensed matter physics. Here, motivated by NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$, we use numerical simulation to explore the phases which arise in a minimal model of a spin-1 pyrochlore magnet, once quadrupole moments are taken into account. We identify seven distinct Coulombic spin liquid phases, including one with nematic correlations. Through quantitative comparison with inelastic neutron scattering, we show that this nematic spin liquid provides a compelling scenario for both the spin liquid observed in NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$, and its spin glass transition, without the need to invoke disorder. These results highlight the great wealth of unconventional phases which arise for magnetic ions capable of supporting both dipole and quadrupole moments.</description>

Abstract: We report ultrahigh magnetic field Faraday rotation results on the chiral helimagnet Cu2OSeO3, the first Mott insulator showing skyrmion lattice phases and a linear magnetoelectric effect. Between 180 and 300 T, we find signatures of a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of magnons, which can be described as a canted XY ferrimagnet. Due to the magnetoelectric coupling, the transverse magnetic order of the indivual Cu2+ spins is accompanied by a characteristic dome-like electric polarization which is crucial for the observation of the condensate via the Faraday rotation effect.</description>

      <title>Exact description of fermionic reservoirs via purified damped ancillary fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for the modeling of fermionic reservoirs using a new class of ancillary damped fermions, dubbed purified pseudofermions, which exhibit unusual free correlations. We show that this key feature, when combined with existing efficient decomposition algorithms for the reservoir correlation functions, enables the development of an easily implementable and accurate scheme for constructing effective models of fermionic reservoirs. We numerically demonstrate the validity, accuracy, efficiency and potential use of our method by studying the particle transport of spinless fermions in a one-dimensional chain. Beyond its utility as a quantum impurity solver, our method holds promise for addressing a wide range of problems involving extended systems in fields like quantum transport, quantum thermodynamics, thermal engines and nonequilibrium phase transitions.</description>

      <title>The role of stacking and strain in mean-field magnetic moments of multilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rhombohedral or ABC stacked multilayer graphene hosts a correlated magnetic ground state at charge neutrality, making it one of the simplest systems to investigate strong electronic correlations. We investigate this ground state in multilayer graphene structures using the Hubbard model in a distance dependent Slater-Koster tight binding framework. We show that by using a universal Hubbard-$U$ term, we can accurately capture the spin polarization predicted by hybrid density functional theory calculations for both hexagonal (ABA) and rhombohedral (ABC) stackings. Using this $U$ value, we calculate the magnetic moments of 3-8 layers of ABC and ABA graphene multilayers. We demonstrate that the structure and magnitude of these magnetic moments are robust when heterostructures are built from varying numbers of ABC and ABA multilayers. By applying different types of mechanical distortions, we study the behaviour of the magnetism in graphene systems under uniaxial strain and pressure. Our results establish a computationally efficient framework to investigate correlation-driven magnetism across arbitrary stacking configurations of graphite polytypes.</description>

      <title>High-order coupling as a driver for Mott insulating behavior in Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a simple holographic model incorporating higher-order coupling terms for electron self-interactions. It can exhibit typical behavior of a Mott insulator, including a metal-insulator transition and a decrease in DC conductivity with the increase of charge density. In the analysis of AC conductivity, a soft gap is generally observed. Notably, when the DC conductivity approaches zero, the AC conductivity reveals a multi-peak structure, which can be attributed to the Mott and charge-transfer gaps observed experimentally in transition metals. With the increase of DC conductivity, the multi-peak structure gradually reverts to soft-gap behavior or even metallic conductivity. The accuracy of the numerical result is guaranteed by $\sigma(\omega\to 0)=\sigma_{DC}$ and sum rules.</description>

      <title>Interplay between antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation and electron-phonon coupling and the origin of the peak-dip-hump structure in the anti-nodal spectrum of high-$T_{c}$ cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling is believed to be responsible for many spectral anomalies in the cuprate superconductors. In particular, the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode of the oxygen ion in the $CuO_{2}$ plane has been proposed to be responsible for the dramatic peak-dip-hump(PDH) structure in the anti-nodal spectrum. The recent observation of the exceptional flat quasiparticle dispersion in the anti-nodal region and the sudden suppression of the PDH structure around the pseudogap end point cast doubts on such a scenario. Instead, a scenario involving the coupling to the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation seems to resolve both puzzles naturally. Here we present a systematic study on the interplay between antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation and electron-phonon coupling in the cuprate superconductors. We show that the coupling strength to the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode is strongly suppressed by the vertex correction caused by the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the $\mathbf{q}\rightarrow 0$ limit as a result of the destructive interference between electron-phonon coupling at electron momentum differ by the antiferromagnetic wave vector. Counterintuitively, we find that the same vertex correction enhances the phonon contribution to the PDH structure. We also find that while the coupling to either the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation or the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode can generate a PDH structure in the anti-nodal spectrum with similar phenomenologies, the sudden suppression of such a structure around the pseudogap end point should be mainly attributed to the dramatic change in the nature of the spin fluctuation at such a critical doping. We suggest to take the PDH structure in the anti-nodal spectrum as a spectral signature for the emergence of fluctuating local moment in the pseudogap phase and the entrance of a doped Mott insulating state.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent quasiparticle lifetimes in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate many-body effects on the spin-split electron bands in altermagnets by computing the electron self-energy arising from interactions with magnons, phonons, and hybridized magnon-phonon modes. These interactions lead to band broadening, which can obscure the intrinsic spin-splitting in spectroscopic measurements. We consider a $d$-wave Lieb lattice altermagnet as a representative example. Our results reveal that the spin-splitting remains spectroscopically resolvable and provide theoretical estimates of lifetime effects relevant for experimental detection. For electron-magnon coupling, we find a distinct difference between spectral function broadening for up and down spins close to the Fermi surface, which is not present in the case of electron-phonon coupling. We relate it to the spin splitting of the magnon modes in altermagnets. The results, including magneto-elastic coupling, are very similar to the pure magnon case. This provides insights into quasiparticle dynamics in altermagnets and contributes to the broader understanding of many-body interactions in spin-split systems. By including the temperature dependence of the self-energies, we also quantify how thermal fluctuations influence the broadening of the electronic states.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets are metals with a momentum-dependent spin splitting of electron bands due to a specific crystal structure that is invariant under time reversal only in combination with rotations and reflections, or lacks time reversal altogether. The developed phenomenological approach allows one to obtain a spectrum of electron bands in an altermagnet corresponding to an antiferromagnet with the same symmetry. There are considered collinear antiferromagnets, weak ferromagnetic antiferromagnets, and ferrimagnetic structures. It is shown that only a weak ferromagnetic antiferromagnet has a nonzero Berry curvature.</description>

      <title>Correlated topological band structures of the kagome altermagnets Mn$_3X$ ($X=$ Sn, Ge, Ga)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay of topological band structures and electronic correlations may lead to novel quantum phenomena with potential applications. First-principles calculations are critical for guiding experimental discoveries and interpretations, but often fail if electronic correlations cannot be properly treated. Here we show that this issue occurs also in the kagome altermagnets Mn$_3X$ ($X=$ Sn, Ge, Ga), which were believed to exhibit large anomalous Hall effect due to topological band structures with Weyl nodes near the Fermi energy. Our systematic investigations reveal critical importance of beyond-DFT treatments on three key aspects of their magnetic, electronic, and topological properties: (1) establishment of noncollinear altermagnetic orders, (2) weakly renormalized band structures in excellent agreement with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiment, and (3) sensitive tuning of the Weyl nodes. Our work provides a unified basis for understanding topological properties of the Mn$_3X$ family, which challenges previous experimental interpretations based on DFT band structures and predicts potentially higher anomalous Hall conductivity in Mn$_3$Ga under electron doping. This underscores the importance of a correlation-aware framework beyond DFT in understanding topological magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Expediting quantum state transfer through the long-range extended XY model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Going beyond short-range interactions, we explore the role of long-range interactions in the extended XY model for transferring quantum states through evolution. In particular, employing a spin-1/2 chain with interactions decaying as a power law, we demonstrate that long-range (LR) interactions significantly enhance the efficiency of a quantum state transfer (QST) protocol, improving the achievable fidelity, mitigating its slow decline as compared with the nearest-neighbor setting, associated with increasing system-size. Our study identifies the LR regime as providing an optimal balance between interaction range and transfer efficiency, outperforming the protocol with the short-range interacting model. Our detailed analysis reveals the impact of system parameters, such as anisotropy, magnetic field strength, and coordination number, on QST dynamics. Specifically, we find that intermediate coordination numbers lead to a faster and more reliable state transfer, while extreme values diminish performance. Furthermore, we exhibit that the presence of LR interactions considerably reduces the minimum time required to achieve fidelity beyond the classical limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of non-stabilizerness, or magic, in a multi-particle quantum walk by analyzing the time evolution of the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy $M_2$. Our study considers both single- and two-particle quantum walks in the framework of the XXZ Heisenberg model with varying interaction strengths. We demonstrate that the spread of magic follows the light-cone structure dictated by the system's dynamics, with distinct behaviors emerging in the easy-plane ($\Delta &lt; 1$) and easy-axis ($\Delta &gt; 1$) regimes. For $\Delta &lt; 1$, magic generation is primarily governed by single-particle dynamics, while for $\Delta &gt; 1$, doublon propagation dominates, resulting in a significantly slower growth of $M_2$. Furthermore, the magic exhibits logarithmic growth in time for both one and two-particle dynamics. Additionally, by examining the Pauli spectrum, we show that the statistical distribution of level spacings exhibits Poissonian behavior, independent of interaction strength or particle number. Our results shed light on the role of interactions on magic generation in a many-body system.</description>

      <title>TasVisAn and InsPy -- Python Packages for Triple-Axis Spectrometer Data Visualization, Analysis, Instrument Resolution Calculation, and Convolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental data collected from a triple-axis spectrometer (TAS) are typically analysed by considering the instrument resolution, as the resolution of a TAS instrument is often complex and significantly influences the measured results. Two Python packages, TasVisAn and InsPy, have been developed to visualize and analyse data from TAS instruments - particularly from the cold-neutron TAS Sika and the thermal-neutron TAS Taipan at the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering. TasVisAn offers a range of functions, including data importing, reduction, plotting, contour mapping, convolution fitting, and more, for data collected on TAS instruments, especially on Sika and Taipan. It also supports data reduction of the current trendy multi-analyser and multiplexing TAS instruments, including the multiplexing mode of Sika. Besides, it includes scan simulation and batch file validation tools for both Taipan and Sika, assisting users in designing and planning experiments in advance. InsPy is a general-purpose Python package designed to calculate the four-dimensional (4D) instrument resolution in momentum-energy space for any TAS instrument. Combined with InsPy, TasVisAn supports both instrument resolution calculation and resolution-convoluted data fitting. Its flexible external data import feature further allows TasVisAn to be adapted for the visualization and convolution analysis of inelastic neutron scattering data across various TAS instruments.</description>

      <title>Topological Magneto-optical Kerr Effect without Spin-orbit Coupling in Spin-compensated Antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), the differential reflection of oppositely circularly polarized light, has traditionally been associated with relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which links a particle's spin with its orbital motion. In ferromagnets, large MOKE signals arise from the combination of magnetization and SOC, while in certain coplanar antiferromagnets, SOC-induced Berry curvature enables MOKE despite zero net magnetization. Theoretically, large MOKE can also arise in a broader class of magnetic materials with compensated spins, without relying on SOC - for example, in systems exhibiting real-space scalar spin chirality. The experimental verification has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate such a SOC- and magnetization-free MOKE in the noncoplanar antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2. Using a Sagnac interferometer microscope, we image domains of scalar spin chirality and their reversal. Our findings establish experimentally a new mechanism for generating large MOKE signals and position chiral spin textures in compensated magnets as a compelling platform for ultrafast, stray-field-immune opto-spintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic molecules are a class of compounds that is also investigated in view of their magnetocaloric properties. The isothermal entropy change and the adiabatic temperature change are key figures of merit for magnetocaloric performance. Here, we investigate spin systems of realistic molecular structures comprising four spins. In view of potentially large spin quantum numbers as for gadolinium we model these spin systems by a combination of Heisenberg and dipolar spin-spin interactions. It turns out that a tetrahedral structure with ferromagnetic exchange interactions yields the best figures of merit.</description>

Abstract: We analyze Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models using the doubling method for orthogonal polynomial sequences. This approach yields the analytical spectrum and exact eigenstates of the models. We demonstrate that the standard SSH model is associated with the doubling of Chebyshev polynomials. Extending this technique to the doubling of other finite sequences enables the construction of Hamiltonians for inhomogeneous SSH models which are exactly solvable. We detail the specific cases associated with Krawtchouk and $q$-Racah polynomials. This work highlights the utility of polynomial-doubling techniques in obtaining exact solutions for physical models.</description>

      <title>Nodal Superconductivity of UTe$_2$ Probed by Field-Angle-Resolved Specific Heat on a Crystal with $T_{\rm c}=2.1$ K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Field-angle-resolved specific-heat measurements were performed on a clean single crystal of a spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ with $T_{\rm c}=2.1$ K and a low residual electronic specific heat. At low temperatures, the specific heat exhibits a linear dependence on the magnetic field when the field is applied precisely along the $b$ axis, in stark contrast to its rapid increase at low fields for other orientations. This pronounced anisotropy suggests the presence of nodal quasiparticle excitations with the Fermi velocity predominantly aligned along the $b$ axis. Considering the characteristic field-angle dependences of both the specific heat and the upper critical field, these observations are broadly compatible with theoretical models that assume a superconducting gap structure featuring either point nodes consistent with $B_{\rm 2u}$ symmetry, allowed in the infinitely strong spin-orbit coupling scheme, or line nodes confined to flat regions of the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surface, consistent with $^3B_{\rm 3u}$ symmetry in the finite spin-orbit classification scheme. These results yield crucial hints for resolving the pairing symmetry of UTe$_2$, paving the way for a deeper understanding of its spin-triplet superconductivity.</description>
