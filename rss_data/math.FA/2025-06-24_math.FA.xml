      <title>Some Fixed Point Theorems in $(\alpha,\beta)$- Metric Spaces with applications to Fredholm integral and non-linear differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we presented a new type of metric space called $(\alpha,\beta)$-metric space along with some novel contraction mappings named $(\alpha,\beta)$-contraction and weak $(\alpha,\beta)$-contraction mapping. We established some fixed point theorem for these newly introduced contractive mappings. Our results extended some fixed point results in the existing literature. We also provide an example which holds for the weak $(\alpha,\beta)$-contraction. Furthermore, we proved Kannan's fixed point theorem and Reich's fixed point theorem in the setting of $(\alpha,\beta)$-metric spaces. At the end, as applications the Fredholm integral and non-linear differential equations are solved in order to validate the theoretically obtained conclusions</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavelet systems on the generalized Vilenkin groups are considered. An algorithmic method for the construction of orthogonal wavelet bases is presented. These bases consist of compactly supported test functions (i.e. functions whose Fourier transform is also compactly supported).</description>

      <title>Characterization of Higher-Order Sobolev Spaces on the Sphere via Generalized Averaging of Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new characterization of higher-order Sobolev spaces on the sphere. Building on the approach of Barcel\'o et al. (2020), we refine the square function they introduced for this purpose. In particular, we provide a detailed analysis of the weight function and the averaging range in its definition. Our results demonstrate that averaging can be performed using a weight function from a broad class, and that the averaging domain can be restricted to a local coordinate patch on the sphere.</description>

      <title>On differentiation with respect to filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short article contains the construction of a construction that generalizes the concept of the derivative of a function of one variable, using the theory of filters. The paper presents a new concept, demonstrates that it really generalizes the previously known concept of the derivative. Properties and differentiation rules are obtained similar to the classical rules of differentiation of the derivative. The advantages of the new concept over the classical derivative are shown. Rules for calculating the derivative by a filter are obtained similar to the classical rules of differentiation.</description>

      <title>Stability results of the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as property and the generalized AHSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as property for operators (BPBp for short). To this end, we investigate the generalized approximate hyperplane series property (generalized AHSP for short) for a pair $(X,Y)$ of Banach spaces, which characterizes when $(\ell_1(X),Y)$ has the BPBp. We prove the following results. For $L$ a locally compact Hausdorff space and $\mathcal{A}$ a unital uniform algebra, if either $(X, \mathcal{C}_0(L,Y))$ or $(X, \mathcal{A}^Y)$ has the BPBp, then so does $(X,Y)$. Furthermore, if $X$ is finite-dimensional and the pair $(X, Y)$ has the generalized AHSP, then the pair $(X, Z)$ also has the generalized AHSP, where $Z$ is one of the spaces $\mathcal{C}(K, Y)$, $\mathcal{C}_0(L, Y)$, $\mathcal{C}_b(\Omega, Y)$, or $\mathcal{A}^Y$, with $K$ a compact Hausdorff space, $\Omega$ a completely regular space, and $\mathcal{A}$ a uniform algebra.</description>

      <title>Convergence of C-Class Enriched Hardy-Rogers Contractions in some Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The applicability of classical Banach contraction mapping principle in solving diverse problems caught the attention of several researchers in various fields of science and engineering. Since its introduction, many extensions and generalizations of this principle continue to emerge in different directions. Some are seen in form of common fixed point using commuting mappings, A-contractions, rational-type contractions, enriched contractions amongst others. In this paper, C-class function is used to generalizing enriched Hargy-Rogers contractions. Convergence of unique fixed point and common fixed points of these general class of mappings were established using some related iterative schemes. Results obtained are generalizations of some recently announced related results in literature.</description>

      <title>The ball fixed point property in spaces of continuous functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Banach space $X$ has the ball fixed point property (BFPP) if for every closed ball $B$ and for every nonexpansive mapping $T\colon B\to B$, there is a fixed point. We study the BFPP for $C(K)$-spaces. Our goal is to determine topological properties over $K$ that may determine the failure or fulfillment of the BFPP for the space of continuous functions $C(K)$. We prove that the class of compact spaces $K$ for which the BFPP holds lies between the class of extremally disconnected compact spaces and the class of compact $F$-spaces. We give a family of examples of $F$-spaces $K$ for which the BFPP fails. As a result, we prove that for every cardinal $\kappa$, $\kappa$-order completeness or $\kappa$-hyperconvexity of $C(K)$ are not enough for the BFPP and we obtain that $\ell_\infty/c_0 = C(\mathbb{N}^*)$ fails BFPP under the Continuum Hypothesis. The space $C([0,+\infty)^*)$ is also analyzed. It is left as an open problem whether all compact spaces for which the BFPP holds are in fact the extremally disconnected compact sets.</description>

      <title>Proper cocycles, measure equivalence and $L_p$-Fourier multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new transference method for completely bounded $L_p$-Fourier multipliers via proper cocycles arising from probability measure-preserving group actions. This method extends earlier results by Haagerup and Jolissaint, which were limited to the case $p = \infty$. Based on this approach, we present a new and simple proof of the main result in [Hong-Wang-Wang, Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 2024] regarding the pointwise convergence of noncommutative Fourier series on amenable groups, refining the associated estimate for maximal inequalities. In addition, this framework yields a transference principle for $L_p$-Fourier multipliers from lattices in linear Lie groups to their ambient groups, establishing a noncommutative analogue of Jodeit's theorem. As a further application, we construct a natural analogue of the Hilbert transform on $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>The Lifting Property for Frame Multipliers and Toeplitz Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frame multipliers are an abstract version of Toeplitz operators in frame theory and consist of a composition of a multiplication operator with the analysis and synthesis operators. Whereas the boundedness properties of frame multipliers on Banach spaces associated to a frame, so-called coorbit spaces, are well understood, their invertibility is much more difficult. We show that frame multipliers with a positive symbol are Banach space isomorphisms between the corresponding coorbit spaces. The results resemble the lifting theorems in the theory of Besov spaces and modulation spaces. Indeed, the application of the abstract lifting theorem to Gabor frames yields a new lifting theorem between modulation spaces. A second application to Fock spaces yields isomorphisms between weighted Fock spaces.
  The main techniques are the theory of localized frames and existence of inverse-closed matrix algebras.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability of Property $(UW_E)$ under commuting finite rank perturbation in terms of spectrum induced by consistent in invertibility for operators and a variant of upper semi-Weyl spectrum. Also we discuss the stability of Property $(UW_{E})$ under direct sum $T\oplus S$ and tensor product $T\otimes S$ for Hilbert space operators $T$ and $S$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In connection to the Fuglede conjecture, and to Fuglede's original work \cite{Fug74}, we study one-parameter unitary groups associated to self-adjoint extensions of the differential operator $Df=\frac1{2\pi i}f'$ on a union of finite intervals. We present a formula for such unitary groups and we use it to discover some geometric properties of such sets in $\br$ which admit orthogonal bases of exponential functions (also called spectral sets).</description>

      <title>A Selection of Distributions and Their Fourier Transforms with Applications in Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note presents a rigorous introduction to a selection of distributions along with their Fourier transforms, which are commonly encountered in signal processing and, in particular, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In contrast to many textbooks on the principles of MRI, which place more emphasis on the signal processing aspect, this note will take a more mathematical approach. In particular, we will make explicit the underlying topological space of interest and clarify the exact sense in which these distributions and their Fourier transforms are defined. Key results presented in this note involve the Poisson summation formula and the Fourier transform of a Gaussian function via an ordinary differential equation (ODE) argument, etc. Although the readers are expected to have prior exposure to functional analysis and distribution theory, this note is intended to be self-contained.</description>

      <title>Spectra and invariant subspaces of compressed shifts on nearly invariant subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the spectral properties and invariant subspaces of compressed shifts on model spaces are well understood, their behaviour on nearly $S^*$-invariant subspaces, a natural generalization with weaker structural constraints, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we completely characterize the point spectrum, whole spectrum and invariant subspace structure for such compressed shifts by unitary equivalence, using the Frostman shift, Crofoot transform, and Sz.-Nagy--Foias theory. Our results reveal how the relaxation of $S^*$-invariance impacts spectral structure and invariant subspaces, bridging a gap between classical model space theory and broader function-theoretic settings.</description>

      <title>A Greedy Version of the Frame Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frame algorithm uses a simple recursive formula to approximate an unknown vector from its frame coefficients. This note introduces an adaptive version of the frame algorithm that maximizes the error reduction between steps in terms of an equivalent norm. This greedy version of the frame algorithm is proven to achieve the same guaranteed convergence rate as the traditional frame algorithm, yet, unlike its classical counterpart, does not require knowledge of the frame bounds. The robustness of the greedy frame algorithm with respect to noisy measurements is also established. Two numerical examples are included to demonstrate the benefit of the greedy algorithm in applications.</description>

      <title>On the Jordan-Chevalley-Dunford decomposition of operators in type $I$ Murray-von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, for $n \ge 3$, the mapping on $M_n(\mathbb{C})$ which sends a matrix to its diagonalizable part in its Jordan-Chevalley decomposition, is {\bf norm-unbounded} on any neighbourhood of the zero matrix. Let $X$ be a Stonean space, and $\mathcal{N}(X)$ denote the $*$-algebra of (unbounded) normal functions on $X$, containing $C(X)$ as a $*$-subalgebra. We show that every element of $M_n\big(\mathcal{N}(X)\big)$ has a unique Jordan-Chevalley decomposition. Furthermore, when $n \ge 3$ and $X$ has infinitely many points, using the unboundedness of the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition, we show that there is an element of $M_n\big(C(X)\big)$ whose diagonalizable and nilpotent parts are not bounded, that is, do not lie in $M_n\big(C(X)\big)$. Using these results in the context of a type $I$ finite von Neumann algebra $\mathscr{N}$, we prove a canonical Jordan-Chevalley-Dunford decomposition for densely-defined closed operators affiliated with $\mathscr{N}$, expressing each such operator as the strong-sum of a unique commuting pair consisting of (what we call) a $\mathfrak{u}$-scalar-type affiliated operator and an $\mathfrak{m}$-quasinilpotent affiliated operator. The functorial nature of Murray-von Neumann algebras, coupled with the above observations, indicates that considering unbounded affiliated operators is both necessary and natural in the quest for a Jordan-Chevalley-Dunford decomposition for bounded operators in type $II_1$ von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $m,n$ be positive integers. For all $m\times n$ complex matrices $A, C$ and an $n\times m$ matrix $B$, we define a generalized commutator as $ABC-CBA$. We estimated the Frobenius norm of it, and finally got the inequality, which is a generalization of the B\"{o}ttcher-Wenzel inequality. If $n=1$ or $m=1$, then the Frobenius norm of $ABC-CBA$ can be estimated with a tighter upper bound.</description>

Abstract: This is an introduction to the analysis of nonlinear evolution equations on manifolds with conical singularities via maximal regularity techniques. We address the specific difficulties due to the singularities, in particular the choice of extensions of the conic Laplacian that guarantee the existence of a bounded $H_\infty$-calculus. We introduce the relevant technical tools and survey, as main examples, applications to the porous medium equation, the fractional porous medium equation, the Yamabe flow, and the Cahn-Hilliard equation.</description>

Abstract: We remove the local boundedness for $\mathscr{E}_{\alpha}$-subharmonicity in the framework of (not necessarily strongly local) regular symmetric Dirichlet form $(\mathscr{E},D(\mathscr{E}))$ with $\alpha\geq0$ and establish the stochastic characterization for $\mathscr{E}$-subharmonic functions without assuming the local boundedness.</description>

      <title>An operator system approach to self-testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for self-testing, in which bipartite correlations are described by states on the commuting tensor product of a pair of operator systems. We propose a definition of a local isometry between bipartite quantum systems in the commuting operator model, and define self-testing and abstract self-testing in the latter generality. We show that self-tests are in the general case always abstract self-tests and that, in some cases, the converse is also true. We apply our framework in a variety of instances, including to correlations with quantum inputs and outputs, quantum commuting correlations for the CHSH game, synchronous correlations, contextuality scenarios, quantum colourings and Schur quantum channels.</description>

      <title>Measures of Systems of Oscillators and Properties of Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Properties of trajectories of systems of harmonic oscillators equipped with a point, absolutely continuous or singular measure are considered in this paper. Linear flow of an infinite system of oscillators on an infinite dimensional tori in the phase space are studied. It was shown in [28] that for infinite-dimensional linear flows of a countable system of oscillators there is a new type of trajectories that is not periodic and has no transitive projection on any 4-dimensional symplectic subspace. A trajectory with this property is absent in the finite-dimensional case, it is not typical for a countably system of oscillators and it is typical for a continual one. We show that any point of a non-degenerated invariant torus is non-wandering point of the flow of a countable system of harmonic oscillators. But a point of a non-degenerated invariant torus of a flow of continual system of harmonic oscillator with absolutely continuous measure is wandering point. For the continual system of oscillators with a singular measure we obtain sufficient conditions on measure and torus for absence of transitive trajectory and non-wandering points.</description>

      <title>Fractional Volterra-type operator induced by radial weight acting on Hardy space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a radial doubling weight $\mu$ on the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ of the complex plane and its odd moments $\mu_{2n+1}=\int_0^1 s^{2n+1}\mu(s)\, ds$, we consider the fractional derivative
  $$
  D^\mu(f)(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{\widehat{f}(n)}{\mu_{2n+1}}z^n,
  $$
  of a function $ f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\widehat{f}(n)z^n$ analytic in $\mathbb{D}$. We also consider the fractional integral operator $I^\mu(f)(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \mu_{2n+1}\widehat{f}(n)z^n$, and the fractional Volterra-type operator
  $$
  V_{\mu,g}(f)(z)= I^\mu(f\cdot D^\mu(g))(z),\quad f\in\mathcal{H}(\mathbb{D}),
  $$
  for any fixed $g\in\mathcal{H}(\mathbb{D})$. We prove that $V_{\mu,g}$ is bounded (compact) on a Hardy space $H^p$, $0&lt;p&lt;\infty$, if and only if $g$ belongs to $\text{BMOA}$ ($\text{VMOA}$). Moreover, if $\int_0^1 \frac{\left(\int_r^1 \mu(s)\, ds\right)^p}{(1-r)^2}\,dr=+\infty$, we prove that $V_{\mu,g}$ belongs to the Schatten class $S_p(H^2)$ if and only if $g=0$. On the other hand, if $\frac{\left(\int_r^1 \mu(s)\, ds\right)^p}{(1-r)^2}$ is a radial doubling weight it is proved that $V_{\mu,g} \in S_p(H^2)$ if and only if $g$ belongs to the Besov space $B_p$. En route, we obtain descriptions of $H^p$, $\text{BMOA}$, $\text{VMOA}$ and $B_p$ in terms of the fractional derivative $D^\mu$.</description>

      <title>A stochastic model for the diffusion of competing opinions with trend-following, opposition, and indifference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a stochastic model for the diffusion of competing opinions in a population composed of three types of agents: trend-followers, opposers, and indifferent individuals. The decision dynamics are driven by reinforcement mechanisms, modulated by a latent trend process, allowing us to capture realistic features such as amplification, resistance, and randomness in opinion formation. We derive explicit formulas for the finite-time moments of the opinion count vector and establish a set of strong asymptotic results, including laws of large numbers, central limit theorems, laws of the iterated logarithm, and almost sure convergence of empirical distributions. In particular, we show how early fluctuations can persist or vanish depending on the balance between reinforcement and opposition. Our analysis relies on martingale techniques and offers closed-form expressions for key quantities, providing both theoretical insights and tools for simulations or applications in social dynamics, marketing, or information diffusion.</description>

      <title>Complete left tail asymptotic for branching processes in random environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the complete left tail asymptotic for the density of the {\it martingale limit} of the classical Galton-Watson process has been derived. The derivation is based on the properties of a special function (whose inverse Fourier transform is the density) satisfying a Poincar\'e-type functional equation. However, the corresponding special function does not satisfy the Poincar\'e-type functional equation for the processes in random environments. This makes it impossible to apply the developed asymptotic methods. In this instance, even computing the special function and the density becomes extremely challenging. We propose a method that extracts the terms of the asymptotic series from another limit distribution {\it ratios of probabilities of rare events}. The generating functions for this limit distribution satisfy the generalized Schr\"oder-type functional equations that greatly simplify the calculations. As in the classical case of constant environments, the obtained series converges everywhere. Possible interesting connections with exotic fractal measures that Robert Strichartz considers are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an introduction to advanced linear algebra, with emphasis on geometric aspects, and with some applications included too. We first review basic linear algebra, notably with the spectral theorem in its general form, and with the theory of the resultant and discriminant. Then we discuss the Jordan form and its basic applications to physics, and other advanced decomposition results for the matrices. We then go into positivity topics, involving matrices and bilinear forms, and with a look into curved space-time, and discrete Laplacians. Finally, we discuss the various groups of matrices, with a look at reflection groups, Lie groups, spin matrices, and random matrices.</description>

      <title>On the metric of the jet bundle and similarity of Cowen-Douglas operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of Cowen-Douglas operators not only involves traditional operator-theoretic tools but also concepts and results from complex geometry on holomorphic vector bundles. We make use of the ratio of the metric matrices first considered by Clark and Misra and a model theorem by Agler to describe the similarity of backward shift operators on analytic function spaces whose multiplier algebras are the space of bounded analytic functions. It is well-known that, in general, it becomes much more complicated to formulate a sufficient condition for similarity than a necessary one. We also give a sufficient condition for a Cowen-Douglas operator to be similar to the backward shift operator on the Dirichlet space with weights by introducing a condition on the jet bundle of a holomorphic vector bundle. Note that the multiplier algebras of these spaces do not coincide with the space of bounded, analytic functions as in other analytic functions spaces, requiring a different approach. The results by M\"{u}ller on operator models related to Dirichlet shifts and by Kidane and Trent on the corona problem for the multiplier algebras of weighted Dirichlet spaces are indispensable tools in attaining this similarity result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schauder bases are fundamental tools for analyzing the structure of Banach spaces. In this work, we show that Besselian Schauder frames (BSF) play a similar role in certain contexts. Specifically, we extend several well-known results of Karlin and James to Banach spaces with BSF, particularly to those with unconditional Schauder frames (USF). We prove that many classical Banach spaces do not admit BSF, and in particular, do not admit USF.
  Before establishing these results, we construct an explicit Schauder frame for every Banach space with a finite dimensional decomposition. In particular, Szarek's Banach space has a Schauder frame, which famously lacks a Schauder basis. This finding provides strong motivation for extending classical Schauder basis theory to the framework of Schauder frames.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22972v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Bansah and Sehba studied in [3] the boundedness of a family of Hilbert-type integral operators, where they characterized the $L^{p}-L^{q}$ boundedness of the operators for $1\leq p\leq q\leq \infty$. In this paper, we deal with the corresponding discrete Hilbert-type operators acting on the weighted sequence spaces. We establish some sufficient and necessary conditions for the $l^{p}-l^{q}$ boundedness of the operators for $1\leq p\leq q\leq \infty$. We find out that the conditions of the boundedness of discrete Hilbert-type operators are different from those of the boundedness of Hilbert-type integral operators. Also, for some special cases, we obtain sharp norm estimates for discrete Hilbert-type operators. Finally, it is pointed out that certain extensions of the theorems given in [3] can be established by using our different arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of a Levi operator is an operator abstraction of the Levy property of a norm or, more generally of the Levi topology on a locally solid vector lattice. Various aspects of Levi operators have been studied recently by several authors. The present paper is devoted to Levi operators from a normed lattice to a vector lattice. It is proved that every finite rank operator is a Levi operator. An example is given showing that the sum of a positive rank one operator and a positive compact Levi operator need not to be a Levi operator. We prove that every quasi Levi operator is continuous. It is shown that the set of Levi operators on the space of convergent sequences is not complete in the operator norm. Several results concerning the domination problem for Levi operators and the relations between Levi operators and KB-spaces are established.</description>

      <title>On the non-frame property of Gabor systems with Hermite generators and the frame set conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The frame set conjecture for Hermite functions formulated in [Gr\"ochenig, J. Fourier Anal. Appl., 20(4):865-895, 2014] states that the Gabor frame set for these generators is the largest possible, that is, the time-frequency shifts of the Hermite functions associated with sampling rates $\alpha$ and modulation rates $\beta$ that avoid all known obstructions lead to Gabor frames for $L^{2}(\mathbb{R})$. By results in [Seip and Wallst\'en, J. Reine Angew. Math., 429:107-113, 1992] and [Lemvig, Monatsh. Math., 182(4):899-912, 2017], it is known that the conjecture is true for the Gaussian, the $0$th order Hermite functions, and false for Hermite functions of order $2,3,6,7,10,11,\dots$, respectively. In this paper we disprove the remaining cases except for the $1$st order Hermite function.</description>

      <title>Bishop-Phelps Type Scalarization for Vector Optimization in Real Topological-Linear Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10026v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that scalarization techniques (e.g., in the sense of Gerstewitz; Kasimbeyli; Pascoletti and Serafini; Zaffaroni) are useful for generating (weakly, properly) efficient solutions of vector optimization problems. One recognized approach is the conic scalarization method in vector optimization in real normed spaces proposed by Kasimbeyli (2010, SIAM J Optim 20), which is based on augmented dual cones and Bishop-Phelps type (norm-linear) scalarizing functions. In this paper, we present new results on cone separation in real topological-linear spaces by using Bishop-Phelps type separating cones / separating seminorm-linear functions. Moreover, we study some extensions of known scalarization results in vector optimization (in the sense of Eichfelder; Gerstewitz; Jahn; Kasimbeyli; Pascoletti and Serafini). On this basis, we propose a Bishop-Phelps type scalarization method for vector optimization problems in real topological-linear spaces, which is based on Bishop-Phelps type cone representing and cone monotone scalarizing functions (e.g., Gerstewitz scalarizing functions or seminorm-linear scalarizing functions). Thus, our method also extends Kasimbeyli's conic scalarization method from real normed spaces to real topological-linear spaces. Within this framework, we derive new Bishop-Phelps type scalarization results for the concepts of weak efficiency and different types of proper efficiency.</description>

We show ultracontractivity, hypercontractivity, and the spectral gap inequality of the heat semigroups on ${\rm Aut}^+(B)$. Furthermore, we obtain the sharpness of the Sobolev embedding property and the Hausdorff-Young inequality of ${\rm Aut}^+(B)$.</description>

Abstract: We prove a simple inequality for a sum of squares of norms of two vectors in an inner product space. Next, using this inequality we derive the so--called "reverse uncertainty relation" and analyze its properties.</description>
