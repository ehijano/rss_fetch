      <title>KPZ fixed point convergence of the ASEP and stochastic six-vertex models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic six-vertex (S6V) model and asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) under general initial conditions which are bounded below lines of arbitrary slope at $\pm\infty$. We show under Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling of time, space, and fluctuations that the height functions of these models converge to the KPZ fixed point. Previously, our results were known in the case of ASEP (for a particular direction in the rarefaction fan) via a comparison approach arXiv:2008.06584.</description>

      <title>Weak error estimates of Galerkin approximations for the stochastic Burgers equation driven by additive trace-class noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish weak convergence rates for spectral Galerkin approximations of the stochastic viscous Burgers equation driven by additive trace-class noise. Our results complement the known results regarding strong convergence; we obtain essential weak convergence rate 2. As expected, this is twice the known strong rate. The main ingredients of the proof are novel regularity results on the solutions of the associated Kolmogorov equations.</description>

      <title>Matrix Chaos Inequalities and Chaos of Combinatorial Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix concentration inequalities and their recently discovered sharp counterparts provide powerful tools to bound the spectrum of random matrices whose entries are linear functions of independent random variables. However, in many applications in theoretical computer science and in other areas one encounters more general random matrix models, called matrix chaoses, whose entries are polynomials of independent random variables. Such models have often been studied on a case-by-case basis using ad-hoc methods that can yield suboptimal dimensional factors.
  In this paper we provide general matrix concentration inequalities for matrix chaoses, which enable the treatment of such models in a systematic manner. These inequalities are expressed in terms of flattenings of the coefficients of the matrix chaos. We further identify a special family of matrix chaoses of combinatorial type for which the flattening parameters can be computed mechanically by a simple rule. This allows us to provide a unified treatment of and improved bounds for matrix chaoses that arise in a variety of applications, including graph matrices, Khatri-Rao matrices, and matrices that arise in average case analysis of the sum-of-squares hierarchy.</description>

      <title>A generalized coupling approach for the weak approximation of stochastic functional differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study functional type weak approximation of weak solutions of stochastic functional differential equations by means of the Euler--Maruyama scheme. Under mild assumptions on the coefficients, we provide a quantitative error estimate for the weak approximation in terms of the L\'evy--Prokhorov metric of probability laws on the path space. The weak error estimate obtained in this paper is sharp in the topological and quantitative senses in some special cases. We apply our main result to ten concrete examples appearing in a wide range of science and obtain a weak error estimate for each model. The proof of the main result is based on the so-called generalized coupling of probability measures.</description>

      <title>Gaussian and Bootstrap Approximation for Matching-based Average Treatment Effect Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish Gaussian approximation bounds for covariate and rank-matching-based Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimators. By analyzing these estimators through the lens of stabilization theory, we employ the Malliavin-Stein method to derive our results. Our bounds precisely quantify the impact of key problem parameters, including the number of matches and treatment balance, on the accuracy of the Gaussian approximation. Additionally, we develop multiplier bootstrap procedures to estimate the limiting distribution in a fully data-driven manner, and we leverage the derived Gaussian approximation results to further obtain bootstrap approximation bounds. Our work not only introduces a novel theoretical framework for commonly used ATE estimators, but also provides data-driven methods for constructing non-asymptotically valid confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Universality, Low-Degree Polynomials, and Max-Cut in Sparse Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universality, namely distributional invariance, is a well-known property for many random structures. For example it is known to hold for a broad range of variational problems with random input. Much less is known about the universality of the performance of specific algorithms for solving such variational problems. Namely, do algorithms tuned to specific variational tasks produce the same asymptotic answer regardless of the underlying distribution?
  In this paper we show that the answer is yes for a class of models, which includes spin glass models and constraint satisfaction problems on sparse graphs, provided that an algorithm can be coded as a low-degree polynomial (LDP). We illustrate this specifically for the case of the Max-Cut problem in sparse Erd\"os-R\'enyi graph $\mathbb{G}(n, d/n)$. We use the fact that the Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm, which is an effective algorithm for finding near-ground state of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, is well approximated by an LDP. We then establish our main universality result: the performance of the LDP based algorithms exhibiting certain connectivity property, is the same in the mean-field (SK) and in the random graph $\mathbb{G}(n, d/n)$ setting, up to an appropriate rescaling. The main technical challenge which we address in this paper is showing that the output of the LDP algorithm on $\mathbb{G}(n, d/n)$ is truly discrete, namely it is close to the set of points in the binary cube.</description>

      <title>Rational symmetric functions from the Izergin-Korepin 19-vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the Izergin-Korepin 19-vertex model in the quadrant, we introduce two families of rational multivariate functions $F_S$ and $G_S$; these are in direct analogy with functions introduced by Borodin in the context of the higher-spin 6-vertex model in the quadrant.
  We prove that $F_S(x_1,\dots,x_N;z)$ and $G_S(y_1,\dots,y_M;z)$ are symmetric functions in their alphabets $(x_1,\dots,x_N)$ and $(y_1,\dots,y_M)$, and pair together to yield a Cauchy identity. Both properties are consequences of the Yang-Baxter equation of the model.
  We show that, in an appropriate limit of the spectral parameters $z$, $F_S$ tends to a stable symmetric function denoted $H_S$. This leads to a simplified version of the Cauchy identity with a fully factorized kernel, and suggests self-duality of the functions $H_S$.
  We obtain a symmetrization formula for the function $F_S(x_1,\dots,x_N;z)$, which exhibits its symmetry in $(x_1,\dots,x_N)$. In contrast to the 6-vertex model, where $F^{6{\rm V}}_S(x_1,\dots,x_N;z)$ is cast as a sum over the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_N$, the symmetrization formula in the 19-vertex model is over a larger set of objects that we define; we call these objects 2-permutations.
  As a byproduct of the proof of our symmetrization formula, we obtain explicit formulas for the monodromy matrix elements of the 19-vertex model in a basis that renders them totally spatially symmetric.</description>

      <title>Unified Stochastic Framework for Neural Network Quantization and Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization and pruning are two essential techniques for compressing neural networks, yet they are often treated independently, with limited theoretical analysis connecting them. This paper introduces a unified framework for post-training quantization and pruning using stochastic path-following algorithms. Our approach builds on the Stochastic Path Following Quantization (SPFQ) method, extending its applicability to pruning and low-bit quantization, including challenging 1-bit regimes. By incorporating a scaling parameter and generalizing the stochastic operator, the proposed method achieves robust error correction and yields rigorous theoretical error bounds for both quantization and pruning as well as their combination.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Appointment Scheduling in the Presence of Patient Unpunctuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the optimal appointment scheduling problem that incorporates patients' unpunctual behavior, where the unpunctuality is assumed to be time dependent, but additive. Our goal is to develop an optimal scheduling method for a large patient system to maximize expected net revenue. Methods for deriving optimal appointment schedules for large-scale systems often run into computational bottlenecks due to mixed-integer programming or robust optimization formulations and computationally complex search methods. In this work, we model the system as a single-server queueing system, where patients arrive unpunctually and follow the FIFO service discipline to see the doctor (i.e., get into service). Using the heavy traffic fluid approximation, we develop a deterministic control problem, referred to as the fluid control problem (FCP), which serves as an asymptotic upper bound for the original queueing control problem (QCP). Using the optimal solution of the FCP, we establish an asymptotically optimal scheduling policy on a fluid scale. We further investigate the convergence rate of the QCP under the proposed policy. The FCP, due to the incorporation of unpunctuality, is difficult to solve analytically. We thus propose a time-discretized numerical scheme to approximately solve the FCP. The discretized FCP takes the form of a quadratic program with linear constraints. We examine the behavior of these schedules under different unpunctuality assumptions and test the performance of the schedules on real data in a simulation study. Interestingly, the optimal schedules can involve block booking of patients, even if the unpunctuality distributions are continuous.</description>

      <title>Spectral Property of Magnetic Quantum Walk on Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and investigate a model of magnetic quantum walk on a general hypercube. We first construct a set of unitary involutions associated with a magnetic potential $\nu$ by using quantum Bernoulli noises. And then, with these unitary involutions as the magnetic shift operators, we define the evolution operator $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ for the model, where $\nu$ is the magnetic potential. We examine the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of the evolution operator $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ and obtain their representations in terms of the coin operator system of the model. We show that the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ are completely independent of the magnetic potential $\nu$ although $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ itself is dependent of the magnetic potential $\nu$. Our work might suggest that a quantum walk perturbed by a magnetic field can have spectral stability with respect to the magnetic potential.</description>

      <title>Gaussian entropic optimal transport: Schr\"odinger bridges and the Sinkhorn algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport problems are regularized versions of optimal transport problems. These models play an increasingly important role in machine learning and generative modelling. For finite spaces, these problems are commonly solved using Sinkhorn algorithm (a.k.a. iterative proportional fitting procedure). However, in more general settings the Sinkhorn iterations are based on nonlinear conditional/conjugate transformations and exact finite-dimensional solutions cannot be computed. This article presents a finite-dimensional recursive formulation of the iterative proportional fitting procedure for general Gaussian multivariate models. As expected, this recursive formulation is closely related to the celebrated Kalman filter and related Riccati matrix difference equations, and it yields algorithms that can be implemented in practical settings without further approximations. We extend this filtering methodology to develop a refined and self-contained convergence analysis of Gaussian Sinkhorn algorithms, including closed form expressions of entropic transport maps and Schr\"odinger bridges.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Mean-Variance Asset Allocation in General Incomplete Markets A Nonlocal BSDE-based Feedback Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies dynamic mean-variance (MV) asset allocation problems in general incomplete markets. Besides of the conventional MV objective on portfolio's terminal wealth, our framework can accommodate running MV objectives with general (non-exponential) discounting factors while in general, any time-dependent preferences. We attempt the problem with a game-theoretic framework while decompose the equilibrium control policies into two parts: the first part is a myopic strategy characterized by a linear Volterra integral equation of the second kind and the second part reveals the hedging demand governed by a system of nonlocal backward stochastic differential equations. We manage to establish the well-posedness of the solutions to the two aforementioned equations in tailored Bananch spaces by the fixed-point theorem. It allows us to devise a numerical scheme for solving for the equilibrium control policy with guarantee and to conclude that the dynamic (equilibrium) mean-variance policy in general settings is well-defined. Our probabilistic approach allows us to consider a board range of stochastic factor models, such as the Chan--Karolyi--Longstaff--Sanders (CKLS) model. For which, we verify all technical assumptions and provide a sound numerical scheme. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate our framework.</description>

      <title>Double Spending Analysis of Nakamoto Consensus for Time-Varying Mining Rates with Ruin Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical guarantees for double spending probabilities for the Nakamoto consensus under the $k$-deep confirmation rule have been extensively studied for zero/bounded network delays and fixed mining rates. In this paper, we introduce a ruin-theoretical model of double spending for Nakamoto consensus under the $k$-deep confirmation rule when the honest mining rate is allowed to be an arbitrary function of time including the block delivery periods, i.e., time periods during which mined blocks are being delivered to all other participants of the network. Time-varying mining rates are considered to capture the intrinsic characteristics of the peer to peer network delays as well as dynamic participation of miners such as the gap game and switching between different cryptocurrencies. Ruin theory is leveraged to obtain the double spend probabilities and numerical examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical method.</description>

      <title>Probability Bracket Notation, Wick-Matsubara Relation, Density Operators, and Microscopic Probability Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.1295</link>
      <description>arXiv:0909.1295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the Dirac vector bracket notation (VBN), we proposed the probability bracket notation (PBN) in our previous paper. We mentioned that under the special Wick rotation (imaginary time), a stationary Schrodinger equation in the Hilbert space transforms into the master equation of a microscopic probabilistic process (MPP) in the probability space. In this article, we first study the MPP of the system of a single particle, we show that the energy expectation of the MPP eventually approaches the lowest energy level in its initial condition and its von Neumann entropy finally vanishes. Then we explore the MPP for the quantum system of identical particles in the Fock space, we recover the expected occupation number of particles and the grand partition function in quantum statistics by connecting time with temperature (the Wick-Matsubara relation). We also reproduce the internal energy of an ideal gas in thermodynamics by using the relation. To address the entropy issue and relate the PBN with research topics of statistics in the literature, we express the density operators and the von Neumann entropy in the probability space by using the PBN. The Wick-Matsubara relation plus the PBN might provide a new way of microscopic probability modeling.</description>

      <title>Temporal increments of the KPZ equation with general initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.00666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Cole-Hopf solution of the (1+1)-dimensional KPZ equation $\mathcal{H}^f(t,x)$ started with initial data $f$. In this article, we study the sample path properties of the KPZ temporal process $\mathcal{H}_t^f := \mathcal{H}^f(t,0)$. We show that for a very large class of initial data which includes any deterministic continuous initial data that grows slower than parabola ($f(x) \ll 1 + x^2$) as well as narrow wedge and stationary initial data, temporal increments of $\mathcal{H}_t^f$ are well approximated by increments of a fractional Brownian motion of Hurst parameter $\frac14$. As a consequence, we obtain several sample path properties of KPZ temporal properties including variation of the temporal process, law of iterated logarithms, modulus of continuity and Hausdorff dimensions of the set of points with exceptionally large increments.</description>

      <title>Short- and long-time path tightness of the continuum directed random polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the point-to-point continuum directed random polymer ($\mathsf{CDRP}$) model that arises as a scaling limit from $1+1$ dimensional directed polymers in the intermediate disorder regime. We show that the annealed law of a point-to-point $\mathsf{CDRP}$ of length $t$ converges to the Brownian bridge under diffusive scaling when $t \downarrow 0$. In case that $t$ is large, we show that the transversal fluctuations of point-to-point $\mathsf{CDRP}$ are governed by the $2/3$ exponent. More precisely, as $t$ tends to infinity, we prove tightness of the annealed path measures of point-to-point $\mathsf{CDRP}$ of length $t$ upon scaling the length by $t$ and fluctuations of paths by $t^{2/3}$. The $2/3$ exponent is tight such that the one-point distribution of the rescaled paths converges to the geodesics of the directed landscape. This point-wise convergence can be enhanced to process-level modulo a conjecture. Our short and long-time tightness results also extend to point-to-line $\mathsf{CDRP}$. In the course of proving our main results, we establish quantitative versions of quenched modulus of continuity estimates for long-time $\mathsf{CDRP}$ which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Stein's method for distributions modelling competing and complementary risk problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Competing and Complementary risk (CCR) problems are often modelled using a class of distributions of the maximum, or minimum, of a random number of i.i.d. random variables; we call this class the CCR class of distributions. While the CCR distributions generally do not have an easy-to-calculate density or probability mass function, two special cases, namely the Poisson-exponential and the exponential geometric distributions, can easily be calculated. Hence, it is of interest to approximate CCR distributions with these simpler distributions. In this paper, we develop Stein's method for the CCR class of distributions to provide a general comparison approach to bound the distance between two CCR distributions and contrast this approach to bounds obtained using a Lindeberg argument. We detail the comparison of Poisson-exponential and exponential-geometric distributions.</description>

      <title>Maximum Principle for Control System driven by Mixed Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the optimal control problem for systems driven by mixed fractional Brownian motion (including a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H&gt;1/2$ and the standard Brownian motion). By using Malliavin calculus and introducing a disturbance control region, we obtain a modified maximum principle. Through martingale representation theorem, we obtain the adjoint backward stochastic differential equation in a natural way. Furthermore, corresponding to [1], a significant result is that the necessary condition is simplified by only containing one equality. As an application, the linear quadratic case is investigated to illustrate the main results.</description>

      <title>Estimating Potential Demand and Customers' Perception of Service Value in a Two-station Service System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The potential demand in the market and customers' perception of service value are crucial factors in pricing strategies, resource allocation, and other operational decisions. However, this information is typically private and not readily accessible. In this paper, we analyze a service system operating across two stations, each with its own customer flow. Customers arriving at the system are informed of the waiting times at both stations and can choose to either join the local station, switch to the other station, or balk. Our objective is to estimate the arrival rates at each station and customers' perceived service value based on the observed workloads at both stations. A significant challenge arises from the inability to observe balking customers and the lack of distinction between local arrivals and customers switching from the other station, as the switching cost is unknown. To address this issue, we employ maximum likelihood estimation and validate the effectiveness of the estimator through a series of simulations.</description>
