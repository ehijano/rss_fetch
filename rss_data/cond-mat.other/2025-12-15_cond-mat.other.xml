      <title>Coherence and Interaction in confined room-temperature polariton condensates with Frenkel excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02509</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.02509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong light-matter coupling of a microcavity mode to tightly bound Frenkel excitons in organic materials emerged as a versatile, room-temperature compatible platform to study nonlinear many-particle physics and bosonic condensation. However, various aspects of the optical response of Frenkel excitons in this regime remained largely unexplored. Here, we utilize a hemispheric optical cavity filled with the fluorescent protein mCherry to address two important questions in the field of room-temperature polariton condensates. First, combining the high quality factor of the microcavity with a well-defined mode structure allows us to provide a definite answer whether temporal coherence in such systems can become competitive with their low-temperature counterparts. We observe highly monochromatic and coherent light beams emitted from the condensate, characterized by a coherence time greater than 150$\,$ps, which exceeds the polariton lifetime by two orders of magnitude. Second, the high quality of our device allows to sensibly trace the emission energy of the condensate, and thus to establish a fundamental picture which quantitatively explains the core nonlinear processes yielding the characteristic density-dependent blueshift. We find that the energy shift of Frenkel exciton-polaritons is largely dominated by the reduction of the Rabi-splitting due to phase space filling effects, which is influenced by the redistribution of polaritons in the system. While our finding of highly coherent condensation at ambient conditions addresses the suitability of organic polaritonics regarding their utilization as highly coherent room temperature polariton lasers, shedding light on the non-linearity is of great benefit towards implementing non-linear devices, optical switches, and lattices based on exciton-polaritons at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Universal and non-universal facets of quantum critical phenomena unveiled along the Schmidt decomposition theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the spin magnitude $S$ on the quantum Gr\"uneisen parameter $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_q$ right at critical points (CPs) for the 1D Ising model under a transverse magnetic field. Our findings are fourfold: $\textit{i)}$ for higher $S$, $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_q$ is increased, but remains finite, reflecting the enhancement of the Hilbert space dimensionality; $\textit{ii)}$ the Schmidt decomposition theorem recovers the extensivity of the nonadditive $q$-entropy $S_q$ only for a $\textit{special}$ value of the entropic index $q$; $\textit{iii)}$ the universality class in the frame of $S_q$ depends only on the symmetry of the system; $\textit{iv)}$ we propose an experimental setup to explore finite size effects in connection with the Hilbert space occupation at CPs. Our findings unveil both universal and non-universal aspects of quantum criticality in terms of $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_q$ and $S_q$.</description>

      <title>Geometry Induced Localization and Multifractality in Spiral quasiperiodic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a quasiperiodic Aubry Andre lattice arranged along a spiral curve. In this setup, the changing angle of the spiral naturally stretches and compresses the distances between neighboring sites, which in turn modulates the hopping amplitudes.
  The onsite potential itself remains the familiar AA form, but this geometry induced variation in the hopping dramatically changes how the system behaves both in its energy spectrum and in how its states localize.Using inverse participation ratios together with a full multifractal analysis, we find that curvature makes the system localize much more easily, even at relatively small quasiperiodic strengths. It also produces clear windows where the eigenstates become strongly multifractal. This shows that quasiperiodicity and geometry do not act independently rather, they reinforce one another in shaping the wavefunctions. Overall, we observe a smooth evolution of the states from extended, to multifractal, and finally to strongly localized. Our results pave the way for creating tunable quasiperiodic and geometry-driven localization effects in photonic waveguide arrays, ultracold atoms, mechanical metamaterials, and nanoscale platforms.</description>

      <title>Phonon-confinement theory of thermal conductivity in ultrathin silicon films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently not understood at the atomic level. Recent numerical studies have highlighted the presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity as a function of thickness for ultrathin films at a thickness about 1-2 nm, which cannot be described by existing theories. We develop a theoretical description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for heat transfer at the nanoscale. In particular, due to the strong redistribution of phonon momentum states in reciprocal space (with a transition from a spherical Debye surface to a different homotopy group $\mathbb{Z}$ at strong confinement), the low-energy phonon density of states no longer follows Debye's law but rather a cubic law with frequency, which then crosses over to Debye's law at a crossover frequency proportional to the average speed of sound of the material and inversely proportional to the film thickness. Concomitantly, this implies that the phonon population becomes dominated by low-energy phonons as confinement increases, which then leads to a higher thermal conductivity under extreme confinement. The theory is able to reproduce the thermal conductivity minimum in recent molecular simulations data for ultrathin silicon and provides useful guidelines so as to tune the minimum position based on the mechanical properties of the material.</description>
