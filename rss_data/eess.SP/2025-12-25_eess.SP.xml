      <title>Learning-Enabled Elastic Network Topology for Distributed ISAC Service Provisioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional mobile networks, including both localized cell-centric and cooperative cell-free networks (CCN/CFN), are built upon rigid network topologies. However, neither architecture is adequate to flexibly support distributed integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) services, due to the increasing difficulty of aligning spatiotemporally distributed heterogeneous service demands with available radio resources. In this paper, we propose an elastic network topology (ENT) for distributed ISAC service provisioning, where multiple co-existing localized CCNs can be dynamically aggregated into CFNs with expanded boundaries for federated network operation. This topology elastically orchestrates localized CCN and federated CFN boundaries to balance signaling overhead and distributed resource utilization, thereby enabling efficient ISAC service provisioning. A two-phase operation protocol is then developed. In Phase I, each CCN autonomously classifies ISAC services as either local or federated and partitions its resources into dedicated and shared segments. In Phase II, each CCN employs its dedicated resources for local ISAC services, while the aggregated CFN consolidates shared resources from its constituent CCNs to cooperatively deliver federated services. Furthermore, we design a utility-to-signaling ratio (USR) to quantify the tradeoff between sensing/communication utility and signaling overhead. Consequently, a USR maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the network topology (i.e., service classification and CCN aggregation) and the allocation of dedicated and shared resources. However, this problem is challenging due to its distributed optimization nature and the absence of complete channel state information. To address this problem efficiently, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework with centralized training and decentralized execution.</description>

      <title>Balancing Decentralized Trust and Physical Evidence: A Blockchain-Physical Layer Co-Design for Real-Time 3D Prioritization in Disaster Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During disaster response, making rapid and well-informed decisions about which areas require immediate attention can save lives. However, current coordination models often struggle with unreliable data, intentional misinformation, and the breakdown of critical communication infrastructure. A decentralized, vote-based blockchain model offers a compelling substrate for achieving this real-time, trusted coordination. This article explores a blockchain-driven approach to rapidly update a dynamic 3D crisis map based on inputs from users and local sensors. Each node submits a timestamped and geotagged vote to a public ledger, enabling agencies to visualize needs as they emerge. However, ensuring the physical authenticity of these claims demands more than cryptography alone. We propose a dual-layer architecture where mobile UAV verifiers perform physical-layer attestation and issue independent location flags to the blockchain. This dual-signature mechanism fuses immutable digital records with sensory-grounded trust. We analyze core technical and human centric challenges, ranging from spoofing and vote ambiguity to verifier compromise and connectivity loss, and outline layered mitigation strategies and future research directions. As a concrete instantiation, we present a UAV mapping scheme leveraging modulated retro-reflector (MRR) sensors and 3D-aware LoS placement to maximize verifiability under urban occlusion, offering a path toward resilient, trust-anchored crisis coordination.</description>

      <title>Towards City-Scale Quantum Timing: Wireless Synchronization via Quantum Hubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel wireless quantum synchronization framework tailored for city-scale deployment using entangled photon pairs and passive corner cube retroreflector (CCR) arrays. A centralized quantum hub emits entangled photons, directing one toward a target device and the other toward a local reference unit. The target, equipped with a planar CCR array, reflects the incoming photon without active circuitry, enabling secure round-trip quantum measurements for sub-nanosecond synchronization and localization. We develop a comprehensive analytical model that captures key physical-layer phenomena, including Gaussian beam spread, spatial misalignment, atmospheric turbulence, and probabilistic photon generation. A closed-form expression is derived for the single-photon detection probability under Gamma-Gamma fading, and its distribution is used to model photon arrival events and synchronization error. Moreover, we analyze the impact of background photons, SPAD detector jitter, and quantum generation randomness on synchronization accuracy and outage probability. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the analytical models and reveal key trade-offs among beam waist, CCR array size, and background light. The proposed architecture offers a low-power, infrastructure-free solution for secure timing in next-generation smart cities.</description>

      <title>The Area Signal-to-Noise Ratio: A Robust Alternative to Peak-Based SNR in Spectroscopic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spectroscopic analysis, the peak-based signal-to-noise ratio (pSNR) is commonly used but suffers from limitations such as sensitivity to noise spikes and reduced effectiveness for broader peaks. We introduce the area-based signal-to-noise ratio (aSNR) as a robust alternative that integrates the signal over a defined region of interest, reducing noise variance and improving detection for various lineshapes. We used Monte Carlo simulations (n=2,000 trials per condition) to test aSNR on Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt lineshapes. We found that aSNR requires significantly lower amplitudes than pSNR to achieve a 50% detection probability. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves show that aSNR performs better than pSNR at low amplitudes. Our results show that aSNR works especially advantageously for broad peaks and could be extended to volume-based SNR for multidimensional spectra.</description>

      <title>QoS- and Physics-Aware Routing in Optical LEO Satellite Networks via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical inter-satellite links (ISLs) are becoming the principal communication backbone in modern large-scale LEO constellations, offering multi-Gb/s capacity and near speed-of-light latency. However, the extreme sensitivity of optical beams to relative satellite motion, pointing jitter, and rapidly evolving geometry makes routing fundamentally more challenging than in RF-based systems. In particular, intra-plane and inter-plane ISLs exhibit markedly different stability and feasible range profiles, producing a dynamic, partially constrained connectivity structure that must be respected by any physically consistent routing strategy. This paper presents a lightweight geometry- and QoS-aware routing framework for optical LEO networks that incorporates class-dependent feasibility constraints derived from a jitter-aware Gaussian-beam model. These analytically computed thresholds are embedded directly into the time-varying ISL graph and enforced via feasible-action masking in a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent. The proposed method leverages local geometric progress, feasible-neighbor structure, and congestion indicators to select next-hop relays without requiring global recomputation. Simulation results on a Starlink-like constellation show that the learned paths are physically consistent, exploit intra-plane stability, adapt to jitter-limited inter-plane connectivity, and maintain robust end-to-end latency under dynamic topology evolution.</description>

      <title>When Future Communications Shift Toward Narrow Beams: A Forward Looking Survey on Pointing Errors and Alignment Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directional links in free-space optical (FSO), millimeter-wave (mmWave), and terahertz (THz) systems are a cornerstone of emerging 6G networks, yet their reliability is fundamentally limited by pointing errors and misalignment. Existing studies address this impairment using technology-specific definitions, models, and mitigation approaches, which hinders cross-domain comparison and transferable design insight. This survey provides a unified treatment of pointing errors across optical and high frequency wireless communications. We establish consistent terminology and a cross-technology taxonomy of pointing errors, review angular misalignment and statistical distribution models, and analyze their impact on system performance. Mitigation techniques are systematically surveyed with emphasis on optical systems and their connection to underlying pointing error models. The survey further provides a detailed examination of pointing-error effects in orbital angular momentum (OAM) links and quantum optical communications, and surveys the corresponding mitigation approaches tailored to mode-dependent impairments and quantum measurement constraints. The survey also outlines open challenges and future research directions. By consolidating fragmented literature into a coherent framework, this work supports consistent analysis and robust design of next generation directional communication systems.</description>

      <title>Semantic Radio Access Networks: Architecture, State-of-the-Art, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Access Network (RAN) is a bridge between user devices and the core network in mobile communication systems, responsible for the transmission and reception of wireless signals and air interface management. In recent years, Semantic Communication (SemCom) has represented a transformative communication paradigm that prioritizes meaning-level transmission over conventional bit-level delivery, thus providing improved spectrum efficiency, anti-interference ability in complex environments, flexible resource allocation, and enhanced user experience for RAN. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive reviews on the integration of SemCom into RAN. Motivated by this, we systematically explore recent advancements in Semantic RAN (SemRAN). We begin by introducing the fundamentals of RAN and SemCom, identifying the limitations of conventional RAN, and outlining the overall architecture of SemRAN. Subsequently, we review representative techniques of SemRAN across physical layer, data link layer, network layer, and security plane. Furthermore, we envision future services and applications enabled by SemRAN, alongside its current standardization progress. Finally, we conclude by identifying critical research challenges and outlining forward-looking directions to guide subsequent investigations in this burgeoning field.</description>

      <title>BenchLink: An SoC-Based Benchmark for Resilient Communication Links in GPS-Denied Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate timing and synchronization, typically enabled by GPS, are essential for modern wireless communication systems. However, many emerging applications must operate in GPS-denied environments where signals are unreliable or disrupted, resulting in oscillator drift and carrier frequency impairments. To address these challenges, we present BenchLink, a System-on-Chip (SoC)-based benchmark for resilient communication links that functions without GPS and supports adaptive pilot density and modulation. Unlike traditional General Purpose Processor (GPP)-based software-defined radios (e.g. USRPs), the SoC-based design allows for more precise latency control. We implement and evaluate BenchLink on Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs, and demonstrate its effectiveness in both ground and aerial environments. A comprehensive dataset has also been collected under various conditions. We will make both the SoC-based link design and dataset available to the wireless community. BenchLink is expected to facilitate future research on data-driven link adaptation, resilient synchronization in GPS-denied scenarios, and emerging applications that require precise latency control, such as integrated radar sensing and communication.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Enhanced Satellite Networks: Deployment Strategies, Key Capabilities, Practical Solutions, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite networks promise wide-area 6G coverage but face two persistent barriers: blockage-induced service discontinuities and increasingly stringent spectrum coexistence across satellite layers and with terrestrial systems. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) act as low-power programmable apertures that redirect energy without the cost and power consumption of fully active arrays. We develop a deployment-first, operations-aware view of RIS-enabled satellite networking that treats RIS as both satellite/terminal antennas and inter-satellite or space-ground relays. We show that system-level gains are governed by two unifying mechanisms: connectivity restoration via virtual line-of-sight links that preserve connectivity under blockage and mobility, and angular selectivity that reshapes interference to enlarge spectrum reuse. We further discuss practical operation under high mobility, highlighting Delay-Doppler channel acquisition, predictive beam tracking, and control designs that budget overhead and latency, and summarize hardware considerations for reliable operation in space. Finally, we outline forward-looking opportunities in the generative artificial intelligence paradigm, multifunctional RIS architectures, ubiquitous satellite integrated sensing and communication, and sustainable satellite Internet-of-Things.</description>

      <title>Low-Altitude ISAC with Rotatable Active and Passive Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a low-altitude integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that leverages cooperative rotatable active and passive arrays. We consider a downlink scenario where a base station (BS) with an active rotatable array serves multiple communication users and senses low-altitude targets, assisted by a rotatable reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). A rotation-aware geometry-based multipath model is developed to capture the impact of three-dimensional (3D) array orientations on both steering vectors and direction-dependent element gains. On this basis, we formulate a new optimization problem that maximizes the downlink sum rate subject to a transmit power budget, RIS unit-modulus constraints, mechanical rotation limits, and a sensing beampattern mean-squared-error (MSE) constraint. To address the resulting highly non-convex problem, we propose a penalty-based alternating-optimization (AO) framework that alternately updates the BS precoder, RIS phase shifts, and BS/RIS array rotation angles. The three blocks are efficiently handled via a convex optimization method based on quadratic-transform (QT) and majorization-minorization (MM), Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) on the unit-modulus manifold, and projected gradient descent (PGD) with Barzilai-Borwein step sizes, respectively. Numerical results in low-altitude geometries demonstrate that the proposed jointly rotatable BS-RIS architecture achieves significant sum-rate gains over fixed or partially rotatable baselines while guaranteeing sensing requirements, especially with directional antennas and in interference-limited regimes.</description>

      <title>LEO Constellations as a Decentralized GNSS Network: Optimizing PNT Corrections in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid expansion of low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations, thousands of satellites are now in operation, many equipped with onboard GNSS receivers capable of continuous orbit determination and time synchronization. This development is creating an unprecedented spaceborne GNSS network, offering new opportunities for network-driven precise LEO orbit and clock estimation. Yet, current onboard GNSS processing is largely standalone and often insufficient for high-precision applications, while centralized fusion is challenging due to computational bottlenecks and the lack of in-orbit infrastructure. In this work, we report a decentralized GNSS network over large-scale LEO constellations, where each satellite processes its own measurements while exchanging compact information with neighboring nodes to enable precise orbit and time determination. We model the moving constellation as a dynamic graph and tailor a momentum-accelerated gradient tracking (GT) method to ensure steady convergence despite topology changes. Numerical simulations with constellations containing hundreds of satellites show that the proposed method matches the accuracy of an ideal centralized benchmark, while substantially reducing communication burdens. Ultimately, this framework supports the development of autonomous and self-organizing space systems, enabling high-precision navigation with reduced dependence on continuous ground contact.</description>

      <title>Co-Existence of Private 5G Network and Wireless Hospital Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of deploying private 5G networks in hospital environments, with a focus on the operating room at the brand new Oulu University Hospital, Finland. The study aims to evaluate the interference risk with other wireless systems, and electromagnetic safety of a private 5G network in the 3.9-4.1 GHz band, while ensuring compatibility with legacy wireless systems, such as LTE and Wi-Fi. We conducted a measurement campaign, employing state-of-the-art instrumentation and a methodology that combined high resolution and long-duration spectrum scans. The results demonstrate no measurable interference between the hospital's private 5G network with adjacent LTE (4G) or Wi-Fi bands, confirming the spectral isolation of the 5G transmissions, and vise versa. Additionally, RF exposure levels in the operating room were found to be well below ICNIRP, WHO, and IEEE safety thresholds, ensuring that the network poses negligible biological risk to patients and hospital staff. The study also proposes spectrum management strategies for private 5G networks in hospitals, focusing on adaptive sensing and guardband planning. These findings provide a solid foundation for the integration of private 5G infrastructure in hospitals environments, supporting digital transformation in patient care without compromising electromagnetic compatibility or patient safety. The results also contribute to ongoing discussions around private 5G network deployments in sensitive sectors and provide actionable guidelines for future hospitals' wireless systems planning.</description>

      <title>Cruising the Spectrum: Joint Spectrum Mobility and Antenna Array Management for Mobile (cm/mm)Wave Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large bandwidths available at millimeter wave (mmWave) FR2 bands (24-71 GHz) and the emerging FR3 bands (7-24 GHz) are essential for supporting high data rates. Highly directional beams utilized to overcome the attenuation in these frequencies necessitate robust and efficient beamforming schemes. Nevertheless, antenna and beam management approaches still face challenges in highly mobile solutions, such as vehicular connectivity, with increasing number of bands. In this work, the concepts of spectrum mobility is studied along with antenna array management in multiple frequencies to improve beamforming under mobility. The spectrum mobility problem aims to select the optimal channel frequency and beam direction in each time slot to maximize data rate. This problem is formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and Point-Based Value Iteration (PBVI) algorithm is used to find a policy with performance guarantees. Numerical examples confirm the efficacy of the resulting policy for multiple available frequency bands, even when the user mobility significantly deviates from models assumed during policy generation.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Assisted RIS Weight Optimization for Spatial Nulling in Distorted Reflector Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have recently been proposed as an effective means for spatial interference suppression in large reflector antenna systems. Existing RIS weight optimization algorithms typically rely on accurate theoretical radiation models. However, in practice, distortions on the reflector antenna may cause mismatches between the theoretical and true antenna patterns, leading to degraded interference cancellation performance when these weights are directly applied. In this report, a residual learning network-assisted simulated annealing (ResNet-SA) framework is proposed to address this mismatch without requiring explicit knowledge of the distorted electric field. By learning the residual difference between the theoretical and true antenna gains, a neural network (NN) is embedded in a heuristic optimization algorithm to find the optimal weight vector. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves improved null depth in the true radiation pattern as compared with conventional methods that optimize weights based solely on the theoretical model, validating the effectiveness of the ResNet-SA algorithm for reflector antenna systems with approximate knowledge of the pattern.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Driven 3D Semantic Spectrum Map: KE-VQ-Transformer Based UAV Semantic Communication and Map Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20984</link>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-native three-dimensional (3D) spectrum maps are crucial in spectrum monitoring for intelligent communication networks. However, it is challenging to obtain and transmit 3D spectrum maps in a spectrum-efficient, computation-efficient, and AI-driven manner, especially under complex communication environments and sparse sampling data. In this paper, we consider practical air-to-ground semantic communications for spectrum map completion, where the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) measures the spectrum at spatial points and extracts the spectrum semantics, which are then utilized to complete spectrum maps at the ground device. Since statistical machine learning can easily be misled by superficial data correlations with the lack of interpretability, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced semantic spectrum map completion framework with two expert knowledge-driven constraints from physical signal propagation models. This framework can capture the real-world physics and avoid getting stuck in the mindset of superficial data distributions. Furthermore, a knowledge-enhanced vector-quantized Transformer (KE-VQ-Transformer) based multi-scale low-complex intelligent completion approach is proposed, where the sparse window is applied to avoid ultra-large 3D attention computation, and the multi-scale design improves the completion performance. The knowledge-enhanced mean square error (KMSE) and root KMSE (RKMSE) are introduced as novel metrics for semantic spectrum map completion that jointly consider the numerical precision and physical consistency with the signal propagation model, based on which a joint offline and online training method is developed with supervised and unsupervised knowledge loss. The simulation demonstrates that our proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark schemes in terms of RKMSE.</description>

      <title>Reducing Latency by Eliminating CSIT Feedback: FDD Downlink MIMO Transmission for Internet-of-Things Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for low-latency frequency division duplex (FDD) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmission with Internet of Things (IoT) communications. Our key idea is eliminating feedback associated with downlink channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) acquisition. Instead, we propose to reconstruct downlink CSIT from uplink reference signals by exploiting the frequency invariance property of channel parameters. Nonetheless, the frequency disparity between the uplink and downlink makes it impossible to get perfect downlink CSIT, resulting in substantial interference. To address this, we formulate a max-min fairness problem and propose a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-aided efficient precoding method. In particular, to fully harness the potential benefits of RSMA, we propose a method that approximates the error covariance matrix and incorporates it into the precoder optimization process. This approach effectively accounts for the impact of imperfect CSIT, enabling the design of a robust precoder that efficiently handles CSIT inaccuracies. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms other baseline methods in terms of the minimum spectral efficiency when no direct CSI feedback is used. Moreover, we show that our framework significantly reduces communication latency compared to conventional CSI feedback-based methods, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing latency performance for IoT communications.</description>

      <title>Aerial Active STAR-RIS-assisted Satellite-Terrestrial Covert Communications</title>

Abstract: An integration of satellites and terrestrial networks is crucial for enhancing performance of next generation communication systems. However, the networks are hindered by the long-distance path loss and security risks in dense urban environments. In this work, we propose a satellite-terrestrial covert communication system assisted by the aerial active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (AASTAR-RIS) to improve the channel capacity while ensuring the transmission covertness. Specifically, we first derive the minimal detection error probability (DEP) under the worst condition that the Warden has perfect channel state information (CSI). Then, we formulate an AASTAR-RIS-assisted satellite-terrestrial covert communication optimization problem (ASCCOP) to maximize the sum of the fair channel capacity for all ground users while meeting the strict covert constraint, by jointly optimizing the trajectory and active beamforming of the AASTAR-RIS. Due to the challenges posed by the complex and high-dimensional state-action spaces as well as the need for efficient exploration in dynamic environments, we propose a generative deterministic policy gradient (GDPG) algorithm, which is a generative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to solve the ASCCOP. Concretely, the generative diffusion model (GDM) is utilized as the policy representation of the algorithm to enhance the exploration process by generating diverse and high-quality samples through a series of denoising steps. Moreover, we incorporate an action gradient mechanism to accomplish the policy improvement of the algorithm, which refines the better state-action pairs through the gradient ascent. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms important benchmarks.</description>

      <title>EEG Foundation Models: A Critical Review of Current Progress and Future Directions</title>

Abstract: Premise. Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubrics for long-term research progress remain unclear. Objective. In this work, we conduct a review of ten early EEG-FMs to capture common trends and identify key directions for future development of EEG-FMs. Methods. We comparatively analyze each EEG-FM using three fundamental pillars of foundation modeling, namely the representation of input data, self-supervised modeling, and the evaluation strategy. Based on this analysis, we present a critical synthesis of EEG-FM methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. Results. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked temporal EEG sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. Significance. Our review indicates that the development of benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna-enabled Near-Field Integrated Sensing, Computing and Semantic Communication for Emerging Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for next-generation technologies. With high-frequency bands and large-scale antenna arrays, the Rayleigh distance extends, necessitating near-field (NF) models where waves are spherical. Although NF-ISAC improves both sensing and communication, it also poses challenges such as high data volume and potential privacy risks. To address these, we propose a novel framework: near-field integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (NF-ISCSC), which leverages semantic communication to transmit contextual information only, thereby reducing data overhead and improving efficiency. However, semantic communication is sensitive to channel variations, requiring adaptive mechanisms. To this end, fluid antennas (FAs) are introduced to support the NF-ISCSC system, enabling dynamic adaptability to changing channels. The proposed FA-enabled NF-ISCSC framework considers multiple communication users and extended targets comprising several scatterers. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize data rate while accounting for sensing quality, computational load, and power budget. Using an alternating optimization (AO) approach, the original problem is divided into three sub-problems: ISAC beamforming, FA positioning, and semantic extraction ratio. Beamforming is optimized using the successive convex approximation method. FA positioning is solved via a projected Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm, and the semantic extraction ratio is optimized using bisection search. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher data rates and better privacy preservation.</description>

      <title>Unifying Common Signal Analyses with Instantaneous Time-Frequency Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work, we presented a general framework for instantaneous time-frequency analysis but did not provide any specific details of how to compute a particular instantaneous spectrum (IS). In this work, we use instantaneous time-frequency atoms to obtain an IS associated with common signal analyses: time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis, fractional Fourier transform, synchrosqueezed short-time Fourier transform, and synchrosqueezed short-time fractional Fourier transform. By doing so, we demonstrate how the general framework can be used to unify these analyses and we develop closed-form expressions for the corresponding ISs. This is accomplished by viewing these analyses as decompositions into AM--FM components and recognizing that each uses a specialized (or limiting) form of a quadratic chirplet as a template during analysis. With a two-parameter quadratic chirplet, we can organize these ISs into a 2D continuum with points in the plane corresponding to a decomposition related to one of the signal analyses. Finally, using several example signals, we compute in closed-form the ISs for the various analyses.</description>

      <title>The MIMO-ME-MS Channel: Analysis and Algorithm for Secure MIMO Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies precoder design for secure MIMO integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) by introducing the MIMO-ME-MS channel, where a multi-antenna transmitter serves a legitimate multi-antenna receiver in the presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper while simultaneously enabling sensing via a multi-antenna sensing receiver. Using sensing mutual information as the sensing metric, we formulate a nonconvex weighted objective that jointly captures secure communication (via secrecy rate) and sensing performance. A high-SNR analysis based on subspace decomposition characterizes the maximum achievable weighted degrees of freedom and reveals that a quasi-optimal precoder must span a "useful subspace," highlighting why straightforward extensions of classical wiretap/ISAC precoders can be suboptimal in this tripartite setting. Motivated by these insights, we develop a practical two-stage iterative algorithm that alternates between sequential basis construction and power allocation via a difference-of-convex program. Numerical results show that the proposed approach captures the desirable precoding structure predicted by the analysis and yields substantial gains in the MIMO-ME-MS channel.</description>

      <title>Explicit Group Sparse Projection with Applications to Deep Learning and NMF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.03896v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design a new sparse projection method for a set of vectors that guarantees a desired average sparsity level measured leveraging the popular Hoyer measure (an affine function of the ratio of the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms). Existing approaches either project each vector individually or require the use of a regularization parameter which implicitly maps to the average $\ell_0$-measure of sparsity. Instead, in our approach we set the sparsity level for the whole set explicitly and simultaneously project a group of vectors with the sparsity level of each vector tuned automatically. We show that the computational complexity of our projection operator is linear in the size of the problem. Additionally, we propose a generalization of this projection by replacing the $\ell_1$ norm by its weighted version. We showcase the efficacy of our approach in both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks on image datasets including CIFAR10 and ImageNet. In deep neural network pruning, the sparse models produced by our method on ResNet50 have significantly higher accuracies at corresponding sparsity values compared to existing competitors. In nonnegative matrix factorization, our approach yields competitive reconstruction errors against state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Data-Centric Approach to Generalizable Speech Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving robust generalization in speech deepfake detection (SDD) remains a primary challenge, as models often fail to detect unseen forgery methods. While research has focused on model-centric and algorithm-centric solutions, the impact of data composition is often underexplored. This paper proposes a data-centric approach, analyzing the SDD data landscape from two practical perspectives: constructing a single dataset and aggregating multiple datasets. To address the first perspective, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to characterize the data scaling laws for SDD, quantifying the impact of source and generator diversity. To address the second, we propose the Diversity-Optimized Sampling Strategy (DOSS), a principled framework for mixing heterogeneous data with two implementations: DOSS-Select (pruning) and DOSS-Weight (re-weighting). Our experiments show that DOSS-Select outperforms the naive aggregation baseline while using only 3% of the total available data. Furthermore, our final model, trained on a 12k-hour curated data pool using the optimal DOSS-Weight strategy, achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming large-scale baselines with greater data and model efficiency on both public benchmarks and a new challenge set of various commercial APIs.</description>

      <title>Designing Spatial Architectures for Sparse Attention: STAR Accelerator via Cross-Stage Tiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on self-attention for contextual understanding, demanding high-throughput inference and large-scale token parallelism (LTPP). Existing dynamic sparsity accelerators falter under LTPP scenarios due to stage-isolated optimizations. Revisiting the end-to-end sparsity acceleration flow, we identify an overlooked opportunity: cross-stage coordination can substantially reduce redundant computation and memory access. We propose STAR, a cross-stage compute- and memory-efficient algorithm-hardware co-design tailored for Transformer inference under LTPP. STAR introduces a leading-zero-based sparsity prediction using log-domain add-only operations to minimize prediction overhead. It further employs distributed sorting and a sorted updating FlashAttention mechanism, guided by a coordinated tiling strategy that enables fine-grained stage interaction for improved memory efficiency and latency. These optimizations are supported by a dedicated STAR accelerator architecture, achieving up to 9.2$\times$ speedup and 71.2$\times$ energy efficiency over A100, and surpassing SOTA accelerators by up to 16.1$\times$ energy and 27.1$\times$ area efficiency gains. Further, we deploy STAR onto a multi-core spatial architecture, optimizing dataflow and execution orchestration for ultra-long sequence processing. Architectural evaluation shows that, compared to the baseline design, Spatial-STAR achieves a 20.1$\times$ throughput improvement.</description>
