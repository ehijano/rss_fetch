      <title>The Spatial Structures in the Austrian COVID-19 Protest Movement: A Virtual and Geospatial Twitter User Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by policy measures to combat the virus, evoked public protest movements world-wide. These movements emerged through virtual social networks as well as local protest gatherings. Prior research has studied such movements solely in the virtual space through social network analysis, thereby disregarding the role of local interaction for protest. This study, however, recognizes the importance of the geo-spatial dimension in protest movements. We therefore introduce a large-scale spatial-social network analysis of a georeferenced Twitter user network to understand the regional connections and transnational influences of the Austrian COVID-19 protest movement through the social network. Our findings reveal that the virtual network is distinctly structured along geographic and linguistic boundaries. We further find that the movement is clearly organized along national protest communities. These results highlight the importance of regional and local influencing factors over the impact of transnational influences for the protest movement.</description>

      <title>Computational Propaganda Theory and Bot Detection System: Critical Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the classical definition, propaganda is the management of collective attitudes by manipulation of significant symbols. However this definition has changed to computational propaganda, the way manipulation takes place in digital medium. Computational propaganda is the use of algorithms, automation and human curation to purposefully distribute misleading information over social media networks to manipulate public opinion, for political polarization etc. Digital media platforms have introduced new modalities of propaganda such as the use of social bots and state-organized 'troll armies' for social astroturfing to simulate public support or opposition towards a particular topic. Along with this digital media has blurred the line between different forms of propaganda. Hence existing conceptual and epistemological frameworks in propaganda studies need a revision. One of the methods to detect the computational propaganda is to identify automation and bots. Many supervised machine learning based frameworks have been proposed for bot detection but these systems can only identify single accounts, not the coordinated activities of botnets and also these systems depend on the data structure provided by the social media platforms. Similarly, current systems have not included the image features in their detection system. Most of the systems are mainly built for Twitter while there are still uncharted areas of research in other social media platforms. Therefore, there are many unexplored research questions and methods in bot detection systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Dynamic Process of Inventions for Reducing Knowledge Search Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A knowledge search is a key process for inventions. However, there is inadequate quantitative modeling of dynamic knowledge search processes and associated search costs. In this study, agent-based and complex network methodologies were proposed to quantitatively describe the dynamic process of knowledge search for actual inventions. Prior knowledge networks (PKNs), the search space of historical patents, were constructed, representative search rules were formulated for R&amp;D agents, and measures for knowledge search cost were designed to serve as search objectives. Simulation results in the field of photolithographic technology show that search costs differ significantly with different search rules. Familiarity and Degree rules significantly outperform BFS, DFS and Recency rules in terms of knowledge search costs, and are less affected by the size and density of PKNs. Interestingly, there is no significant correlation between the mean and variance of search costs and patent value, indicating that high-value patents are not particularly difficult to obtain. The implications for innovation theories and R&amp;D practices are drawn from the models and results.</description>

      <title>The Use of Generative Search Engines for Knowledge Work and Complex Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Until recently, search engines were the predominant method for people to access online information. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) has given machines new capabilities such as the ability to generate new digital artifacts like text, images, code etc., resulting in a new tool, a generative search engine, which combines the capabilities of LLMs with a traditional search engine. Through the empirical analysis of Bing Copilot (Bing Chat), one of the first publicly available generative search engines, we analyze the types and complexity of tasks that people use Bing Copilot for compared to Bing Search. Findings indicate that people use the generative search engine for more knowledge work tasks that are higher in cognitive complexity than were commonly done with a traditional search engine.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collective Action in Recommender Systems: Promoting Songs by Reordering Playlists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate algorithmic collective action in transformer-based recommender systems. Our use case is a collective of fans aiming to promote the visibility of an artist by strategically placing one of their songs in the existing playlists they control. The success of the collective is measured by the increase in test-time recommendations of the targeted song. We introduce two easily implementable strategies towards this goal and test their efficacy on a publicly available recommender system model released by a major music streaming platform. Our findings reveal that even small collectives (controlling less than 0.01% of the training data) can achieve up 25x amplification of recommendations by strategically choosing the position at which to insert the song. We then focus on investigating the externalities of the strategy. We find that the performance loss for the platform is negligible, and the recommendations of other songs are largely preserved, minimally impairing the user experience of participants. Moreover, the costs are evenly distributed among other artists. Taken together, our findings demonstrate how collective action strategies can be effective while not necessarily being adversarial, raising new questions around incentives, social dynamics, and equilibria in recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics for Utility Maximizing Agents: Exploring the Impact of Resource Penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a continuous-time nonlinear model of opinion dynamics with utility-maximizing agents connected via a social influence network. A distinguishing feature of the proposed model is the inclusion of an opinion-dependent resource-penalty term in the utilities, which limits the agents from holding opinions of large magnitude. The proposed utility functions also account for how the relative resources within the social group affect both an agent's stubbornness and social influence. Each agent myopically seeks to maximize its utility by revising its opinion in the gradient ascent direction of its utility function, thus leading to the proposed opinion dynamics. We show that, for any arbitrary social influence network, opinions are ultimately bounded. For networks with weak antagonistic relations, we show that there exists a globally exponentially stable equilibrium using contraction theory. We establish conditions for the existence of consensus equilibrium and analyze the relative dominance of the agents at consensus. We also conduct a game-theoretic analysis of the underlying opinion formation game, including on Nash equilibria and on prices of anarchy in terms of satisfaction ratios. Additionally, we also investigate the oscillatory behavior of opinions in a two-agent scenario. Finally, simulations illustrate our findings.</description>

      <title>Silent Abandonment in Contact Centers: Estimating Customer Patience from Uncertain Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the quest to improve services, companies offer customers the opportunity to interact with agents through contact centers, where the communication is mainly text-based. This has become one of the favorite channels of communication with companies in recent years. However, contact centers face operational challenges, since the measurement of common proxies for customer experience, such as knowledge of whether customers have abandoned the queue and their willingness to wait for service (patience), are subject to information uncertainty. We focus this research on the impact of a main source of such uncertainty: silent abandonment by customers. These customers leave the system while waiting for a reply to their inquiry, but give no indication of doing so, such as closing the mobile app of the interaction. As a result, the system is unaware that they have left and waste agent time and capacity until this fact is realized. In this paper, we show that 30%-67% of the abandoning customers abandon the system silently, and that such customer behavior reduces system efficiency by 5%-15%. To do so, we develop methodologies to identify silent-abandonment customers in two types of contact centers: chat and messaging systems. We first use text analysis and an SVM model to estimate the actual abandonment level. We then use a parametric estimator and develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate customer patience accurately, as customer patience is an important parameter for fitting queueing models to the data. We show how accounting for silent abandonment in a queueing model improves dramatically the estimation accuracy of key measures of performance. Finally, we suggest strategies to operationally cope with the phenomenon of silent abandonment.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Degree Sequence Model with Edge Constraints (SDSM-EC) for Backbone Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is common to use the projection of a bipartite network to measure a unipartite network of interest. For example, scientific collaboration networks are often measured using a co-authorship network, which is the projection of a bipartite author-paper network. Caution is required when interpreting the edge weights that appear in such projections. However, backbone models offer a solution by providing a formal statistical method for evaluating when an edge in a projection is statistically significantly strong. In this paper, we propose an extension to the existing Stochastic Degree Sequence Model (SDSM) that allows the null model to include edge constraints (EC) such as prohibited edges. We demonstrate the new SDSM-EC in toy data and empirical data on young children's' play interactions, illustrating how it correctly omits noisy edges from the backbone.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Model of Dating Apps' Influence on Sexually Transmitted Diseases Spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a group of pathogens infecting new hosts through sexual interactions. Due to its social and economic burden, multiple models have been proposed to study the spreading of pathogens. In parallel, in the ever-evolving landscape of digital social interactions, the pervasive utilization of dating apps has become a prominent facet of modern society. Despite the surge in popularity and the profound impact on relationship formation, a crucial gap in the literature persists regarding the potential ramifications of dating apps usage on the dynamics of STDs. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a novel mathematical framework - an extended Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemiological model to elucidate the intricate interplay between dating apps engagement and the propagation of STDs. Namely, as dating apps are designed to make users revisit them and have mainly casual sexual interactions with other users, they increase the number of causal partners, which increases the overall spread of STDS. Using extensive simulation, based on real-world data, explore the effect of dating apps adoption and control on the STD spread. We show that an increased adoption of dating apps can result in an STD outbreak if not handled appropriately.</description>

      <title>Causal evidence for social group sizes from Wikipedia editing data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human communities have self-organizing properties in which specific Dunbar Numbers may be invoked to explain group attachments. By analyzing Wikipedia editing histories across a wide range of subject pages, we show that there is an emergent coherence in the size of transient groups formed to edit the content of subject texts, with two peaks averaging at around $N=8$ for the size corresponding to maximal contention, and at around $N=4$ as a regular team. These values are consistent with the observed sizes of conversational groups, as well as the hierarchical structuring of Dunbar graphs. We use the Promise Theory model of bipartite trust to derive a scaling law that fits the data and may apply to all group size distributions, when based on attraction to a seeded group process. In addition to providing further evidence that even spontaneous communities of strangers are self-organizing, the results have important implications for the governance of the Wikipedia commons and for the security of all online social platforms and associations.</description>

      <title>Shorts on the Rise: Assessing the Effects of YouTube Shorts on Long-Form Video Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short form content has permeated into the video creator space over the past few years, led by industry leading products such as TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels. YouTube in particular was previously synonymous with being the main hub for long form video content consumption. The monetization of long form videos was easier as it allowed multiple advertisement placements during the course of the video. This model also facilitated thematic brand partnerships. However, since the introduction of short form content, creators have found it more difficult to generate revenue as advertisement placements have decreased. This leads to a unique situation where people are spending more time watching shorter videos, and yet they generate less revenue for the creators. In this paper, we perform a study of 250 creators with significant audiences to see if the introduction of short form content has affected the view counts and engagement of long form content. Our findings reveal a noteworthy trend: since the advent of short-form content, there has been a significant decrease in both view counts and engagement in long-form videos on these channels.</description>

      <title>Safe Voting: Resilience to Abstention and Sybils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.05271v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voting rules may implement the will of the society when all eligible voters vote, and only them. However, they may fail to do so when sybil (fake or duplicate) votes are present and when only some honest (non sybil) voters actively participate. As, unfortunately, sometimes this is the case, our aim here is to address social choice in the presence of sybils and voter abstention. To do so we build upon the framework of Reality-aware Social Choice: we assume the status-quo as an ever-present distinguished alternative, and study Status-Quo Enforcing voting rules, which add virtual votes in support of the status-quo. We characterize the tradeoff between safety and liveness (the ability of active honest voters to maintain/change the status-quo, respectively) in several domains, and show that the Status-Quo Enforcing voting rules are often optimal. We comment on the applicability of our methods and analyses to the governance of digital communities.</description>

      <title>MANTRA: Temporal Betweenness Centrality Approximation through Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08356v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MANTRA, a framework for approximating the temporal betweenness centrality of all nodes in a temporal graph. Our method can compute probabilistically guaranteed high-quality temporal betweenness estimates (of nodes and temporal edges) under all the feasible temporal path optimalities, presented in the work of Bu{\ss} et al. (KDD, 2020). We provide a sample-complexity analysis of our method and speed up the temporal betweenness computation using a state-of-the-art progressive sampling approach based on Monte Carlo Empirical Rademacher Averages. Additionally, we provide an efficient sampling algorithm to approximate the temporal diameter, average path length, and other fundamental temporal graph characteristic quantities within a small error $\varepsilon$ with high probability. The running time of such approximation algorithm is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{\log n}{\varepsilon^2}\cdot |\mathcal{E}|)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $|\mathcal{E}|$ is the number of temporal edges in the temporal graph. We support our theoretical results with an extensive experimental analysis on several real-world networks and provide empirical evidence that the MANTRA framework improves the current state of the art in speed, sample size, and required space while maintaining high accuracy of the temporal betweenness estimates.</description>
