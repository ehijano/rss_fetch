      <title>The nilradical of a seaweed algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seaweed subalgebras of $\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{C})$ are combinatorially defined matrix Lie algebras whose index admits a closed-form description in terms of an associated graph called a meander. In this paper, we study the nilradicals of these algebras with our main result establishing an explicit formula for their index in terms of an edge-weighted variation of the meander. We further prove that each such nilradical decomposes as a direct sum of the center of the seaweed subalgebra with a nilpotent Lie poset algebra, and we provide a meander-theoretic procedure for recovering the underlying poset.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic interpretation for interpolation Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work of Ayyer, Martin, and Williams gave a probabilistic interpretation of the Macdonald polynomials $P_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n;1,t)$ at $q=1$ in terms of a Markov chain called the multispecies $t$-Push TASEP, a Markov chain involving particles of types $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n$ hopping around a ring. In particular, they showed that for each composition $\eta$ obtained by permuting the parts of $\lambda$, the stationary probability of being in state $\eta$ is proportional to the ASEP polynomial $F_{\eta}(x_1,\dots,x_n; 1,t)$, and the normalizing constant (or partition function) is $P_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n; 1,t)$. There is an inhomogeneous generalization of Macdonald polynomials due to Knop and Sahi called interpolation Macdonald polynomials $P^*_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n;q,t)$, as well as an inhomogeneous generalization of ASEP polynomials called interpolation ASEP polynomials $F^*_{\eta}(x_1,\dots,x_n;q,t)$ that we introduced in previous work. In this article we introduce a new Markov chain called the interpolation $t$-Push TASEP, and show that its steady state probabilities and partition function are given by the interpolation ASEP polynomials and the interpolation Macdonald polynomial, evaluated at $q=1$. This generalizes the previous result of Ayyer, Martin, and Williams.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of the Macdonald Hypergeometric Series ${}_r\Phi_s(x;q,t)$ and ${}_r\Phi_s(x,y;q,t)$ via $q$-Difference Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two widely circulated manuscripts from the 1980s, I. G. Macdonald introduced certain multivariate hypergeometric series ${}_pF_q(x;\alpha)$ and ${}_pF_q(x,y;\alpha)$ and their $q$-analogs ${}_r\Phi_s(x;q,t)$ and ${}_r\Phi_s(x,y;q,t)$. These series are given by explicit expansions in Jack and Macdonald polynomials, and they generalize the hypergeometric functions of one and two matrix arguments from statistics.
  In a recent joint paper with Siddhartha Sahi, we constructed differential operators that characterize the Jack series ${}_pF_q$ thereby answering a question of Macdonald. In this paper we construct analogous $q$-difference operators that characterize the Macdonald series ${}_r\Phi_s$.
  More precisely, we construct three $q$-difference operators $\mathcal A^{(x,y)}$, $\mathcal B^{(x)}$, $C^{(x)}$. The equation $\mathcal A^{(x,y)}(f(x,y))=0$ characterizes ${}_r\Phi_s(x,y;q,t)$, while the equations $\mathcal B^{(x)}(f(x))=0$ and $\mathcal C^{(x)}(f(x))=0$ each characterize ${}_r\Phi_s(x;q,t)$. These characterizations are subject to certain symmetry, boundary and stability condition. In the special case of ${}_2\Phi_1(x;q,t)$, our operator $\mathcal B^{(x)}$ was previously constructed by Kaneko in 1996.</description>

      <title>Coin Turning Games on Partially Ordered Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite impartial game is a two-player game in which the players take turns making moves and the game ends after finitely many moves. In this paper, we study a class of finite impartial games introduced by H.~Lenstra, which we call coin turning games. We focus on two typical classes of coin turning games, namely the order ideal games and the rulers, distinguished by their choices of turning sets. For several posets arising from enumerative combinatorics, we determine the Sprague-Grundy functions. In particular, we determine the Sprague-Grundy function of the order ideal game on the ASM poset, introduced by J.~Striker in connection with the alternating sign matrices.</description>

      <title>On stable patterns and properties on permutations of multisets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study properties and patterns on permutations of multisets whose multivariate generating functions are symmetric. We interpret this phenomenon through the lens of group actions and define such a property or pattern as stable. We provide a complete characterization of stable classical patterns, showing that the only such patterns are those of length one or two. For consecutive patterns, we establish the stability of all monotone patterns and also identify a large class of unstable patterns. We conjecture that monotone patterns are the only stable consecutive patterns. All stability results in this paper are proven via explicit bijections, which provide new combinatorial interpretations of the symmetry of the generating functions. As an application, we use stability to derive recurrence relations for the ascent distribution on permutations of multisets, resulting in a generalization of Eulerian numbers.</description>

      <title>Cycle tilings and $H$-factors in directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove several results concerning cycle tilings and $H$-factors in digraphs. We provide a minimum semi-degree condition for forcing a digraph to contain a given spanning collection of vertex-disjoint orientations of cycles. Our result is asymptotically best possible for odd cycles and can be viewed as a digraph analogue of the El-Zahar conjecture. In addition, we asymptotically determine the minimum degree threshold for forcing an $H$-factor in a digraph for a range of digraphs $H$, including the cases when $H$ is a tree or anti-directed cycle. Furthermore, an asymptotically exact Ore-type result for forcing a transitive tournament factor in a digraph is proven. Several related open problems are also highlighted.</description>

      <title>The bipartite analogue of a classical spanning tree enumeration formula, Boolean functions, and their applications to counting odd spanning trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Zheng and Wu defined the concept of odd spanning tree of a graph, meaning a spanning tree in which every vertex has odd degree. Similar to Cayley's formula, Feng, Chen and Wu counted the number of odd spanning trees in complete graphs via Pr\"ufer code and the exponential generating function. In this note, we give a simple proof via a classical spanning tree enumeration formula and the Boolean function.We also generalize it to complete bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Internally-disjoint directed pendant Steiner trees with three terminal vertices in Cartesian product digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D=(V(D),A(D))$ be a digraph with a terminal vertex subset $S\subseteq V(D)$ such that $|S|=k\geq 2$. An out-tree $T$ of $D$ rooted at $r$ is called a directed pendant $(S,r)$-Steiner tree (or, pendant $(S,r)$-tree for short) if $r\in S\subseteq V(T)$ and $d_{T}^{+}(r)=d_{T}^{-}(u)=1$ for each $u\in S\backslash \{r\}$. Two pendant $(S,r)$-trees $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ are internally-disjoint if $A(T_{1})\cap A(T_{2})=\varnothing$ and $V(T_{1})\cap V(T_{2})=S$. The pendant-tree $k$-connectivity $\tau_{k}(D)$ of $D$ is defined as $$\tau_{k}(D)=\min\{\tau_{S,r}(D)\mid S\subseteq V(D),|S|=k,r\in S\},$$ where $\tau_{S,r}(D)$ denotes the maximum number of pairwise internally-disjoint pendant $(S,r)$-trees in $D$.
  In this paper, we derive a sharp lower bound for the pendant-tree 3-connectivity of the Cartesian product digraph $D\square H$, where $D$ and $H$ are both strong digraphs. Specifically, we prove the lower bound $\tau_{3}(D\square H)\geq \tau_{3}(D)+\tau_{3}(H)$. Moreover, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for finding internally-disjoint pendant $(S,r)$-trees which attain this lower bound.</description>

      <title>Fully Leafed Induced Subtrees in Penrose P2 Tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent article by C. Porrier, A. Blondin Mass\'e and A. Goupil, a first bi-infinite fully leafed induced subcaterpillar of Penrose P2 tilings is presented. In this paper, we formally construct this caterpillar for the first time. We then prove that every fully leafed induced subtree in Penrose P2 tilings is a caterpillar with at most one appendix of at most two internal tiles, and we characterize fully leafed induced subtrees that have the property of saturation. We also refute the conjecture that there is a unique bi-infinite fully leafed induced subcaterpillar by constructing a new one. Finally, we present progress on the construction of all bi-infinite fully leafed induced subcaterpillars in Penrose P2 tilings.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Well-Totally Dominated Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph with no isolated vertices. A set of vertices $S$ is a total dominating set (TDS) if every vertex in $G$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $S$. We say $G$ is well-totally dominated (WTD) if every minimal TDS has the same size. In this paper, we present two characterizations of well-totally dominated trees, one being descriptive and the other being constructive. In particular, our characterizations imply that it takes only polynomial time to verify whether a given tree is WTD.</description>

      <title>The strong fractional choice number of triangle-free planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $a,b$ be positive integers with $a\ge b$. A graph $G$ is $(a,b)$-choosable if, for every assignment of lists $L(v)$ of size $a$ to the vertices of $G$, there exists a choice of subsets $C(v)\subseteq L(v)$ with $|C(v)|=b$ for each $v$ such that $C(u)\cap C(v)=\emptyset$ whenever $uv\in E(G)$. We show that every triangle-free planar graph is $(15m,4m)$-choosable for any positive integer $m$. As an immediate consequence, the strong fractional choice number of triangle-free planar graphs is at most $15/4$. This appears to be the first non-trivial upper bound on this parameter for this class of graphs. In particular, the case $m=1$ answers affirmatively a question posed by Jiang and Zhu in [J.~Combin.\ Theory Ser.~B, 2019].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oriented Tur\'{a}n number of a given oriented graph $\overrightarrow{F}$, denoted by $\exo(n,\overrightarrow{F})$, is the largest number of arcs in $n$-vertex $\overrightarrow{F}$-free oriented graphs. This parameter could be seen as a natural oriented version of the classical Tur\'{a}n number. In this paper, we study the supersaturation phenomenon for oriented Tur\'{a}n problems, and prove oriented versions of the famous Erd\H{o}s-Simonovits Supersaturation Theorem and Moon-Moser inequality, and supersaturation theorems for transitive tournaments and antidirected complete bipartite graphs.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}\subseteq{[n]\choose k}$ be a $t$-intersecting family. Define the $t$-covering number $\tau_t(\mathcal{F})$ of $\mathcal{F}$ as the minimum size of a subset $S$ of $[n]$ with $|S\cap F|\geqslant t$ for each $F\in\mathcal{F}$. In this paper, we characterize $\mathcal{F}$ for which $|\mathcal{F}|$ takes the maximum value under the condition that $\tau_t(\mathcal{F})\geqslant t+2$ and $n$ is sufficiently large, thereby generalizing two results by Frankl.</description>

      <title>Word-Representation of Melon Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of word-representable graphs is a generalization of comparability graphs, in which graphs are represented by words. The complexity of word-representation of a word-representable graph is captured through the representation number, whereas the corresponding concept is the permutation-representation number for comparability graphs. The graphs with the (permutation-)representation number at most two were characterized in the literature. While certain examples in the class of graphs with the (permutation-)representation number three are known, no characterization for these classes is available. In this work, we prove that the representation number of melon graphs is at most three. Further, we characterize the class of melon graphs restricted to comparability graphs and show that their permutation-representation number is also at most three. Moreover, this work characterizes the word-representable line graphs of melon graphs and establishes that their representation number is at most three.</description>

      <title>On the levels of rational regular orthogonal matrices for generalized cospectral graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with adjacency matrix $A$, the walk matrix $W(G)$ of $G$ is the matrix $[e,Ae,\ldots,A^{n-1}e]$, where $e$ is the all-ones vector. Suppose that $W(G)$ is nonsingular and $p$ is an odd prime such that $W(G)$ has rank $n-1$ over the finite field $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$. Let $H$ be a graph that is generalized cospectral with $G$, and $Q$ be the corresponding rational regular orthogonal matrix satisfying $Q^\mathsf{T} A(G) Q=A(H)$. We prove that
  \begin{equation*}
  v_p(\ell(Q))\le \frac{1}{2}v_p (\det W(G))
  \end{equation*}
  where $\ell(Q)$ is the minimum positive integer $k$ such that $kQ$ is an integral matrix, and $v_p(m)$ is the maximum nonnegative integer $s$ such that $p^s$ divides $m$. This significantly improves upon a recent result of Qiu et al. [Discrete Math. 346 (2023) 113177] stating that
  $v_p(\ell(Q))\le v_p (\det W(G))-1.$</description>

      <title>On the maximum $\sigma$-irregularity of trees with given order and maximum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\sigma$-irregularity index of a graph is defined as the sum of squared degree differences over all edges and provides a sensitive measure of structural heterogeneity. In this paper, we study the problem of maximizing $\sigma(T)$ among all trees of fixed order $n$ and prescribed maximum degree $\Delta\ge4$. By expressing the problem in terms of edge--degree multiplicities, we derive a linear programming formulation and analyze its dual. This approach yields sharp upper bounds for $\sigma(T)$ and leads to a detailed description of extremal degree--pair distributions. We show that the extremal problem can be completely resolved for the congruence classes $n\equiv1\pmod{\Delta}$ and $n\equiv0\pmod{\Delta}$. When $n\equiv1\pmod{\Delta}$, the linear program admits an integral optimal solution, and the bound for $\sigma(T)$ is tight. When $n\equiv0\pmod{\Delta}$, the linear relaxation is not attainable by any tree; nevertheless, by introducing a penalty function derived from dual slack variables, we determine the exact maximum value of $\sigma(T)$. In both cases, all extremal trees are characterized explicitly and consist exclusively of vertices of degrees $1$, $2$, and $\Delta$, with edges incident to $\Delta$-vertices playing a dominant role.</description>

      <title>The construction of $q$-analogues via $_3\phi_2$-series and $q$-difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the EKHAD-normalization method given in our recent work to obtain, via the $q$-version of Zeilberger's algorithm, $q$-WZ pairs $(F, G)$ such that $\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} F(0, k)$ may be expressed as a basic hypergeometric series of the form ${}_{3}\phi_2$ with multiple free parameters, and in such a way so that $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} F(0, k) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} G(n, 0)$. In contrast to how previous applications of EKHAD-normalization relied on $q$-analogues for specific WZ pairs introduced by Guillera, our multiparameter approach provides a broad framework in the construction of $q$-analogues for accelerated series for universal constants such as $\pi$. We apply this multiparameter version of EKHAD-normalization to obtain and prove new $q$-analogues for accelerated hypergeometric series attributed to many authors, including (alphabetically) Adamchik and Wagon, Ap\'{e}ry, Chu, Chu and Zhang, Fabry, Guillera, Ramanujan, and Zeilberger.</description>

      <title>Two Dimensional Subtraction -- Transfer Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the results and conjectures of Tam\'{a}s Lengyel, showing that the \textsc{nim}-values of a large class of two-dimensional subtraction-transfer games are periodic. These are impartial, normal-play games with two piles of tokens, where players alternate either taking some tokens from a pile or transferring tokens from one pile to the other. In many cases, we calculate the exact period. We also develop several new notions of periodicitiy.</description>

      <title>Hamilton Cycles in Semisymmetric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of Lov\'{a}sz's longstanding question on the existence of Hamilton paths in vertex-transitive graphs, this paper considers a natural variant: what if vertex-transitivity is relaxed, yet a high degree of symmetry--specifically edge-transitivity--is retained? To investigate this, we focus on the class of semisymmetric graphs, which are regular, edge-transitive, but not vertex-transitive. In this paper, it will be shown that every connected semisymmetric graph of order $2pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are two distinct primes contains a Hamilton cycle and that every connected cubic semisymmetric graph of order less than 3000 contains a Hamilton cycle too. Based on these observations, the following question is posed: construct a connected semisymmetric graph which has no Hamilton cycle.</description>

      <title>Modular generalized Nahm sums with arbitrary rank $r$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct two families of generalized Nahm sums of arbitrary rank $r\geq 2$ with the symmetrizers ${\rm diag} ({2,\ldots, 2},1)_{r\times r}$. Specifically, the cases corresponding to $r = 2$ and $r = 3$ of these two families have been previously demonstrated by Mizuno, Warnaar, and B. Wang-L. Wang. Additionally, we establish a family of Rogers-Ramanujan type identities associated with the index $({1,\ldots, 1},2)_{r\times r}$ for any rank $r\geq 2$. Building upon these three families, combined with another family of generalized Nahm sums (with the symmetrizers ${\rm diag} ({1,\ldots, 1},2)_{r\times r}$) established by B. Wang and L. Wang, we construct two vector-valued automorphic forms, one of which is a vector-valued modular function when $r$ is odd.</description>

      <title>Mutual k-Visibility in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutual visibility in graphs requires pairs of vertices to be connected by shortest paths that avoid all other vertices of a prescribed set, a condition that is often overly restrictive. In this paper, we introduce a new variant, called mutual $k$-visibility, which permits at most $k$ internal vertices of the set to lie on a shortest path. This parameterized approach naturally generalizes classical mutual visibility and provides a graded notion of obstruction tolerance. We define the mutual $k$-visibility number $\mu_k(G)$ of a graph $G$ and establish its basic properties, including monotonicity and stabilization for sufficiently large values of $k$. Some bounds on $\mu_k(G)$ are obtained in terms of diameter, maximum degree, and girth. We further analyze $(X,k)$-visibility in convex graphs and determine exact values of $\mu_k(G)$ for some fundamental graph classes. In addition, for block graphs, we introduce the notion of $k$-admissible sets in the associated block--cutpoint tree and show how these sets characterize mutual $k$-visibility in the original graph. Moreover, we present a polynomial-time algorithm, MkV, that decides whether a given subset $S \subseteq V(G)$ forms a mutual $k$-visibility set in $G$. The algorithm has time complexity $O\bigl(|S|(|V(G)|+|E(G)|)+|S|^2\bigr)$.</description>

      <title>Pollyanna and Polynomially \c{hi}-Bounded Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hereditary graph class is called polynomially $\chi$-bounded if there exists a polynomial function $f$ such that $\chi(G) \le f(\omega(G))$ for every induced subgraph $G$. A class $\mathcal{C}$ is called Pollyanna if, for every $\chi$-bounded class $\mathcal{F}$, the class $\mathcal{C} \cap \mathcal{F}$ is polynomially $\chi$-bounded.
  In the paper by Chudnovsky et al., \emph{Reuniting $\chi$-boundedness with polynomial $\chi$-boundedness} (J.\ Combin.\ Theory Ser.\ B 176 (2026), 30--73), the authors posed twelve problems and one conjecture concerning the Pollyanna framework. In this work, we investigate several of these problems by studying the chromatic number of hereditary graph classes defined by forbidden induced subgraphs.
  We prove three new strong Pollyanna results. In particular, for every $t \ge 2$, every $\{\text{diamond}, \mathrm{hammer}(t)^+\}$-free graph is $t$-strongly Pollyanna. We also show that graph classes obtained by forbidding suitable combinations of bowties and dumbbells are $(2t-2)$-strongly Pollyanna.
  We show that the class of $\{(2,2)$-bowtie, $P_5$, $(3,3)$-dumbbell$\}$-free graphs is polynomially $\chi$-bounded. We also prove polynomial $\chi$-boundedness for diamond-free graphs in which every edge lies in at least two triangles, under additional forbidden configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a unified combinatorial framework connecting Entringer numbers, Dumont-Viennot snakes, and elliptically weighted continued fractions, which gives a structural interpretation of the Jacobi elliptic identity \begin{equation} \mathrm{sn}'(u)=\mathrm{cn}(u)\,\mathrm{dn}(u), \end{equation} where $\mathrm{sn}$, $\mathrm{cn}$ and $\mathrm{dn}$ are the Jacobi elliptic functions. This framework allows the decomposition of weighted snakes corresponding to the derivative of $\mathrm{sn}$ into canonical $\mathrm{cn}$- and $\mathrm{dn}$-components, bridging classical combinatorics and elliptic function theory.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional convolution matrices and perfect colorings of subspace hypergraphs applied for bent functions and related designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of the present paper is to introduce new methods for the study of combinatorial designs related to bent functions. They are based on interpretations of convolution on finite abelian groups as multiplication by a multidimensional matrix and designs as perfect colorings of subspace hypergraphs of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$.
  We establish a correspondence between eigenfunctions of convolution matrices and perfect colorings of subspace hypergraphs, show that perfect colorings of subspace hypergraphs admit a characterization in terms of convolution and that two-valued eigenfunctions of subspace hypergraphs correspond to perfect colorings. As applications, we represent partial difference sets, bent and plateaued Boolean functions, spreads, and strong bent partitions of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ as eigenfunctions of convolution matrices and as perfect colorings of subspace hypergraphs. We also find some eigenvalues of convolution matrices over $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ and $\mathbb{F}_3^n$.</description>

      <title>Touchard's identity and a detailed determination of the radius of convergence of the Catalan series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the value of the radius of convergence of the generating series of the Catalan numbers is well-known, obtaining it solely from recurrence relations is less immediate. It is sometimes considered that no known proof establishes that the radius $R$ equals 1/4 without relying on the explicit closed formula for the Catalan numbers. In particular, it has been shown that one can obtain, at the cost of substantial technical effort and without resorting to the main Segner recursion relation or to the explicit formula for the Catalan number, the lower bound $R\geq 1/6$. In this work, we prove that Touchard's recurrence alone yields the optimal exponential upper bound $\limsup_{n\to\infty} C_n^{1/n} \le 4$, which implies $R \ge 1/4$. Combined with the classical lower estimate $\limsup_{n\to\infty} C_n^{1/n} \ge 4$, obtained from central binomial coefficients, this gives $R = 1/4$.</description>

Abstract: It is known that the set of square free monomials on the Chern classes of the tautological line bundles over the Peterson variety forms an additive basis of its cohomology ring. We study the expansion formula for their products. In particular, we give a square free expansion of the products multiplying degree 2 classes in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials and binomial coefficients.</description>

      <title>A mirror deformation of Markov numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a deformed squared Markov equation given by $X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2 + (q+q^{-1})(XY+YZ+XZ) = 3(1 + q + q^{-1})XYZ$. Symmetric solutions of this new equation present a remarkable factorization property which allows us to talk about their square roots. These square roots give a natural $q$-deformation of the Markov numbers that has not previously occurred in the literature. We call them mirror Markov numbers. We prove a characterization of mirror Markov numbers and discover a mutation rule, mirror mutation, to generate them all. We also prove a geometric realization of the corresponding mirror mutation on a once-punctured sphere with three orbifold points. Our mirror deformation leads to deformations of Fibonacci and Pell branches for which we give precise formulas. Furthermore, the deformed squared Markov equation specializes to many other very well known generalized Markov equations. We also obtain the super Markov numbers from a specialization of the deformed squared Markov numbers, which we use to prove a conjecture of Musiker.</description>

      <title>An improvement on the bound for the acyclic chromatic index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The acyclic chromatic index (or acyclic edge-chromatic number) of a graph is the least number of colors needed to properly color its edges so that none of its cycles has only two colors. We show that for a graph of max degree $\Delta$, the acyclic chromatic index is at most $3.142(\Delta-1)+1$, improving on the (best to date) bound of Fialho et al. (2020). Our improvement is made possible by considering unordered (non-plane) trees, instead of ordered (plane) ones, as witness structures for the Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma, a key combinatorial tool often used in related works. The counting of these witness structures entails methods of Analytic Combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Minimal Inversions in Integer Matrices of Fixed RSK Shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Robinson-Schensted-Knuth (RSK) algorithm maps an integer matrix to a pair of semi-standard Young tableaux (SSYTs) whose underlying shape has the same integer partition. We study the set of matrices associated with a given partition $\lambda$ vis-a-vis the number of inversions of the matrix. In the case where the integer matrix is a permutation matrix, the resulting tableaux are standard Young tableaux or SYTs. Han (EJC, 2005) combinatorially studied the set of permutations that map to SYTs of shape $\lambda$ under the RSK algorithm and counted the permutations with the minimum number of inversions in that set, as well as formulated the minimal number of inversions. Han's work can be extended to a case where the matrix is a general integer matrix and the tableaux are semi-standard Young tableaux. We have conjectured a formula for the minimal number of inversions in the set of matrices with a fixed shape $\lambda$. We further provide a conjecture for the characterisation of the minimal generalised matrices.</description>

      <title>Vertex decomposable complexes of directed forests, conflict graphs and chordality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a multidigraph. We study the simplicial complex $\mathrm{Dlf}(D)$, whose vertices are the directed edges of $D$ and whose faces correspond to directed linear forests, that is, vertex-disjoint unions of directed paths. We also consider the related directed tree complex $\mathrm{DT}(D)$. Our main approach is to associate with $D$ a simple graph encoding the local incompatibilities among the edges of $D$. Under mild acyclicity assumptions, we show that $\mathrm{Dlf}(D)$ and $\mathrm{DT}(D)$ can be realized as the independence complexes of respective graphs. This correspondence allows us to apply structural results from the theory of independence complexes to obtain graph-theoretic criteria guaranteeing vertex decomposability, shellability, and sequential Cohen-Macaulayness of these complexes. In particular, we describe explicit forbidden induced directed subgraphs that obstruct vertex decomposability, and we identify classes of multidigraphs-including certain acyclic multidigraphs and multidigraphs whose underlying graphs are forests or cycles-for which $\mathrm{Dlf}(D)$ and $\mathrm{DT}(D)$ are vertex decomposable. We also provide examples showing that these properties do not hold in general.</description>

      <title>Edge-ends versus topological ends of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diestel and K\"uhn proved that the topological ends of an infinite graph are precisely its undominated graph ends, yielding a canonical embedding of the space of topological ends into the space of graph ends. For edge-ends, introduced by Hahn, Laviolette and \v{S}ir\'a\v{n}, such an embedding does not exist in general.
  In this note, we characterize the class of infinite graphs for which the topological ends admit a natural injective map into the space of edge-ends that is compatible with the canonical maps between end spaces. Our characterization is purely combinatorial and is expressed in terms of edge-equivalence classes of vertices.
  Moreover, when such an embedding exists, we identify precisely which edge-ends arise from topological ends, showing that they are exactly the edge-ends containing a non-dominated ray. This establishes a parallel result to the theorem of Diestel and K\"uhn for edge-end spaces.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Rigidity Framework for Order-Oblivious Deterministic Black-Box PIT of ROABPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministic black-box polynomial identity testing (PIT) for read-once oblivious algebraic branching programs (ROABPs) is a central open problem in algebraic complexity, particularly in the absence of variable ordering. Prior deterministic algorithms either rely on order information or incur significant overhead through combinatorial isolation techniques.
  In this paper, we introduce an algebraic rigidity framework for ROABPs based on the internal structure of their associated matrix word algebras. We show that nonzero width-$w$ ROABPs induce word algebras whose effective algebraic degrees of freedom collapse to dimension at most $w^2$, independent of the number of variables. This rigidity enables deterministic witness construction via intrinsic algebraic invariants, bypassing rank concentration, isolation lemmas, and probabilistic tools used in previous work.Thus, we obtain the first order-oblivious deterministic black-box PIT algorithm for ROABPs, running in quasi-polynomial time $n\cdot(wd)^{O(w^2)}$. This establishes that algebraic rigidity alone suffices to derandomize PIT in this model, without assuming ordering information.
  The framework further isolates a single remaining obstacle to full polynomial-time complexity. We formulate a Modular Stability Conjecture, asserting that width-$w$ ROABPs are stable under hashing into cyclic quotient rings $\mathbb{K}[\lambda]/&lt; \lambda^r-1 &gt;$ once the modulus exceeds a polynomial threshold in $w$ and the individual degree. This conjecture arises naturally from the low-dimensional coefficient structure revealed by rigidity and is supported by extensive empirical evidence.
  Assuming the conjecture, our methods yield a fully polynomial-time deterministic black-box PIT algorithm for ROABPs, matching the complexity of the best-known white-box algorithms and reducing the black-box problem to a concrete algebraic stability question.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the spectral gap and diameter of Cayley graphs depend strongly on the choice of generating set.
  We answer a question of Pyber and Szab\'o (2013)
  by exhibiting a sequence of finite groups $G_n$ with $|G_n| \to \infty$ admitting bounded generating sets $X_n,Y_n$ such that $\operatorname{Cay}(G_n,X_n)$ is an expander
  while $\operatorname{Cay}(G_n,Y_n)$ has super-polylogarithmic diameter.
  The construction uses the semidirect product $G_n = C_p^{n-1} \rtimes S_n$ with $p$ exponentially large in $n$,
  and the analysis reduces to bounding some exponential sums of permutational type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Difference graph $\mathcal{D}(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is the difference of the enhanced power graph $\mathcal{P}_{E}(G)$ and the power graph $\mathcal{P}(G)$ with all the isolated vertices removed. In this paper, we characterize the vertex set of the difference graph of finite nilpotent groups and obtain its cardinality. Consequently, we obtain the metric dimension of the difference graph of finite nilpotent groups. Moreover, this paper determines the metric dimension of the difference graphs of certain non-nilpotent groups, namely: dihedral groups, the generalized quaternion groups, and the semi-dihedral groups.</description>

      <title>Can a Lightweight Automated AI Pipeline Solve Research-Level Mathematical Problems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable success in generating rigorous mathematical proofs, with "AI for Math" emerging as a vibrant field of research. While these models have mastered competition-level benchmarks like the International Mathematical Olympiad and show promise in research applications through auto-formalization, their deployment via lightweight, natural-language pipelines for research problems remains underexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that next-generation models (e.g., Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.2 Pro), when integrated into a streamlined automated pipeline optimized for citation-based verification, can solve sophisticated research-grade problems. We evaluate our pipeline on two novel datasets: (1) the ICCM problem sets (comparable to the S.-T. Yau College Student Mathematics Contest) proposed by leading mathematicians, and (2) the "First Proof" problem set, consisting of previously unpublished research questions. Our pipeline generated candidate proofs for all problems in the first two ICCM sets and the "First Proof" set. The solutions for the first two ICCM sets and Problem 4 of the "First Proof" set have been fully verified by our team. All generated proofs have been submitted to the official organization, and our generated results are publicly available. We plan to open-source the complete pipeline methodology in due course.</description>

      <title>Min-Max Connected Multiway Cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a variant of the multiway cut that we call the min-max connected multiway cut. Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a set $\Gamma\subseteq V$ of $t$ terminals, partition $V$ into $t$ parts such that each part is connected and contains exactly one terminal; the objective is to minimize the maximum weight of the edges leaving any part of the partition. This problem is a natural modification of the standard multiway cut problem and it differs from it in two ways: first, the cost of a partition is defined to be the maximum size of the boundary of any part, as opposed to the sum of all boundaries, and second, the subgraph induced by each part is required to be connected. Although the modified objective function has been considered before in the literature under the name min-max multiway cut, the requirement on each component to be connected has not been studied as far as we know.
  We show various hardness results for this problem, including a proof of weak NP-hardness of the weighted version of the problem on graphs with tree-width two, and provide a pseudopolynomial time algorithm as well as an FPTAS for the weighted problem on trees. As a consequence of our investigation we also show that the (unconstrained) min-max multiway cut problem is NP-hard even for three terminals, strengthening the known results.</description>

      <title>Vertex operators, infinite wedge representations, and correlation functions of the t-Schur measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $t$-Schur measure on partitions, defined by $ \mathbb{P}(\lambda)=Z^{-1}S_\lambda(x;t)s_\lambda(y) $, where $S_\lambda(x;t)$ denotes the $t$-Schur symmetric functions and $s_\lambda(y)$ the ordinary Schur functions, and $Z$ is the normalising constant. Using vertex operator calculus, we realise $S_\lambda(x;t)$ in the charged free-fermion Fock space, yielding a $t$-deformation of the classical boson-fermion correspondence. These realisations give vertex-algebraic proofs of the $t$-Cauchy identities and $t$-Gessel identity. Building on this framework, we compute the correlation functions of the $t$-Schur measure and show that the associated point process is determinantal, with an explicit correlation kernel. The Poissonised $t$-Plancherel measure appears as a specialisation of our construction, so its correlation functions follow as a corollary. As an application, we derive the limiting distribution for the length of the longest ascent pair in a random permutation. Our results interpolate the Schur case at $t=0$, connect to the Schur-$Q$ theory at $t=-1$, and provide a probabilistic interpretation of a natural $t$-refinement of increasing subsequences via a generalised RSK correspondence.</description>

Abstract: A finite group $G$ is called a Schur group if every $S$-ring over $G$ is schurian, i.e. associated in a natural way with a subgroup of $Sym(G)$ that contains all right translations of $G$. The list of all possible abelian Schur groups was obtained by Evdokimov, Kov\'acs, and Ponomarenko in 2016. In two papers, we finish a classification of abelian Schur groups. In the present paper, we study schurity of several groups from the list. Namely, we prove that a direct product of the elementary abelian group of order 4 and a cyclic group, whose order is an odd prime power or a product of two distinct odd primes, is a Schur group and establish nonschurity of some other groups from the list.</description>

Abstract: We prove that chess played on the infinite chessboard $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with infinitely many pieces is as powerful as it could possibly be, by showing that every open Gale-Stewart game with draws is strategically equivalent to some infinite chess position and vice versa. As our construction is computable and open Gale-Stewart games are well understood, this allows us to resolve many open questions about the complexity of infinite chess with infinitely many pieces. In particular, all countable ordinals arise as the game value of some such chess position. We also give an alternate construction that realizes all countable ordinals as game values, with the pleasing property that it consists only of the king pair and pawns.</description>

Abstract: A finite poset (partially ordered set) $P$ with ${\hat 0}$ is called of distributive type if every interval $[{\hat 0}, a]$, $a \in P$, of $P$ is a distributive lattice. From a viewpoint of ASL's (algebras with straightening laws), the join-meet toric ring on a finite distributive lattice is generalized to an ASL on a finite poset of distributive type. Our target is the questions when a finite poset of distributive lattice is Cohen--Macaulay and when the ASL on it is Gorenstein. We focus on a natural class of finite posets of distributive type and study various aspects of the above questions.</description>

      <title>Lower Estimates for $L_1$-Distortion of Transportation Cost Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the degree of dissimilarity between two probability distributions on a finite metric space is a fundamental task in Computer Science and Computer Vision. A natural dissimilarity measure based on optimal transport is the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). A key technique for analyzing this metric, pioneered by Charikar (2002) and Indyk and Thaper (2003), involves constructing low-distortion embeddings of EMD(X) into the Lebesgue space $L_1$.
  It became a key problem to investigate whether the upper bound of $O(\log n)$ can be improved for important classes of metric spaces known to admit low-distortion embeddings into $L_1$. In the context of Computer Vision, grid graphs, especially planar grids, are among the most fundamental. Indyk posed the related problem of estimating the $L_1$-distortion of the space of uniform distributions on $n$-point subsets of $R^2$. The Progress Report, last updated in August 2011, highlighted two key results: first, the work of Khot and Naor (2006) on Hamming cubes, which showed that the $L_1$-distortion for Hamming cubes meets the described above upper estimate, and second, the result of Naor and Schechtman (2007) for planar grids, which established that the $L_1$-distortion of for a planar $n$ by $n$ grid is $\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})$.
  Our first result is the improvement of the lower bound on the $L_1$-distortion for grids to $\Omega(\log n)$, matching the universal upper bound up to multiplicative constants. The key ingredient allowing us to obtain these sharp estimates is a new Sobolev-type inequality for scalar-valued functions on the grid graphs. Our method is also applicable to many recursive families of graphs, such as diamond and Laakso graphs. We obtain the sharp distortion estimates of $\log n$ in these cases as well.</description>

      <title>A Pragmatic Method for Comparing Clusterings with Overlaps and Outliers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering algorithms are an essential part of the unsupervised data science ecosystem, and extrinsic evaluation of clustering algorithms requires a method for comparing the detected clustering to a ground truth clustering. In a general setting, the detected and ground truth clusterings may have outliers (objects belonging to no cluster), overlapping clusters (objects may belong to more than one cluster), or both, but methods for comparing these clusterings are currently undeveloped. In this note, we define a pragmatic similarity measure for comparing clusterings with overlaps and outliers, show that it has several desirable properties, and experimentally confirm that it is not subject to several common biases afflicting other clustering comparison measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both the antiferromagnetic Ising model and the hard-core model could be said to be tractable on line graphs of bounded degree. For example, Glauber dynamics is rapidly mixing in both cases. In the case of the hard-core model, we know that tractability extends further, to claw-free graphs and somewhat beyond. In contrast, it is shown here that the corresponding extensions are not possible in the case of the antiferromagnetic Ising model.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly describe the tropicalization of a type C cluster variety by identifying it with the space of axially symmetric phylogenetic trees. We also study the signed tropicalizations of this cluster variety, realizing them as subfans of the tropicalization that are dual to either associahedra or cyclohedra.</description>

      <title>The projective coinvariant algebra, Young invariants and bigraded coordinate rings of Segre embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a flat degeneration P_n of the classical coinvariant algebra R_n, a bigraded Artinian Gorenstein algebra that arises from the coordinate ring of the Segre embedding of the n-fold self-product of the projective line. The Frobenius character of P_n is computed by a natural bigraded refinement of the classical Lusztig--Stanley formula for the character of the coinvariant algebra. Young invariants in P_n get related to coordinate rings of general Segre embeddings of products of projective spaces; their bigraded Hilbert polynomials get expressed in terms of major-descent generating functions of words in multisets. Relations to the diagonal coinvariant algebra, cohomological interpretations including quantum cohomology, and Garsia-Stanton-style bases are also explored.</description>

      <title>Exactly-solvable self-trapping lattice walks. II. Lattices of arbitrary height</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing self-avoiding walk (GSAW) is a walk on a graph that is directed, does not visit the same vertex twice, and has a trapped endpoint. We show that the generating function enumerating GSAWs on a half-infinite strip of finite height is rational, and we give a procedure to construct a combinatorial finite state machine that allows one to compute this generating function. We then modify this procedure to compute generating functions for GSAWs under two probabilistic models. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the expected length and displacement for GSAWs on the quarter plane, half plane, full plane, and half-infinite strips of bounded height for which we cannot compute the generating function. Finally, we prove that the generating functions for Greek key tours (GSAWs on a finite grid that visit every vertex) on a half-infinite strip of fixed height are also rational, allowing us to resolve several conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19270v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a digraph, an ordering of its vertices defines a backedge graph, namely the undirected graph whose edges correspond to the arcs pointing backwards with respect to the order. The degreewidth of a digraph is the minimum over all ordering of the maximum degree of the backedge graph. We answer an open question by Keeney and Lokshtanov [WG 2024], proving that it is \NP-hard to determine whether an oriented graph has degreewidth at most $1$, which settles the last open case for oriented graphs. We complement this result with a general discussion on parameters defined using backedge graphs and their relations to classical parameters.</description>

      <title>Strongly connected orientations and integer lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $D=(V,A)$ be a digraph whose underlying undirected graph is $2$-edge-connected, and let $P$ be the polytope whose vertices are the incidence vectors of arc sets whose reversal makes $D$ strongly connected. We study the lattice theoretic properties of the integer points contained in a proper face $F$ of $P$ not contained in $\{x:x_a=i\}$ for any $a\in A,i\in \{0,1\}$. We prove under a mild necessary condition that $F\cap \{0,1\}^A$ contains an integral basis $B$, i.e., $B$ is linearly independent, and any integral vector in the linear hull of $F$ is an integral linear combination of $B$. This result is surprising as the integer points in $F$ do not necessarily form a Hilbert basis. In proving the result, we develop a theory similar to Matching Theory for degree-constrained dijoins in bipartite digraphs. Our result has consequences for head-disjoint strong orientations in hypergraphs, and also to a famous conjecture by Woodall that the minimum size of a dicut of $D$, say $\tau$, is equal to the maximum number of disjoint dijoins. We prove a relaxation of this conjecture, by finding for any prime number $p\geq 2$, a $p$-adic packing of dijoins of value $\tau$ and of support size at most $2|A|$. We also prove that the all-ones vector belongs to the lattice generated by $F\cap \{0,1\}^A$, where $F$ is the face of $P$ satisfying $x(\delta^+(U))=1$ for every dicut $\delta^+(U)$ with minimum size.</description>

Abstract: We describe all the Bier spheres of dimension $d$ with chromatic number equal to $d+1$ and prove that all other $d$-dimensional Bier spheres have chromatic number equal to $d+2$, for any integer $d\geq 0$. Then we prove a general formula for complex and mod $p$ Buchstaber numbers of a Bier sphere $\mathrm{Bier}(K)$, for each prime $p\in\mathbb{N}$ in terms of the $f$-vector of the underlying simplicial complex $K$. Finally, we classify all chordal Bier spheres and obtain their canonical realizations as boundaries of stacked polytopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short paper, we establish relations between the domination number $\gamma$, the total domination number $\gamma_t$, and the connected domination number $\gamma_c$ of a graph. In particular, we prove upper and lower bounds for $\gamma_t$ in terms of $\gamma$ and $\gamma_c$. Moreover, we propose the following conjecture: for every connected isolated-free graph $G$, \begin{equation*}\label{eq:low}
  \gamma_t(G) \geq \left \lfloor \frac{3\gamma(G) +2\gamma_c(G)}{6}\right\rfloor. \end{equation*} As evidence to support the conjecture, we prove that the conjecture holds when $\gamma_t(G) = \gamma_c(G)$ and also, when $\gamma_t(G) = \gamma_c(G) -1$.</description>

      <title>Linear Recurrences of Generalized Schreier Sets Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $p, q\in \mathbb{N}$, a finite nonempty set $F$ is said to be $(p,q)$-Schreier (or maximal $(p,q)$-Schreier, respectively) if $q\min F\ge p|F|$ (or $q\min F = p|F|$, respectively). For $n\in \mathbb{N}$, let $$\mathcal{S}^{p/q}_{n}\ :=\ |\{F\subset\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\,:\, q\min F\ge p|F|\mbox{ and }n\in F\}|.$$ Using the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, Beanland et al. proved the recurrence $$|\mathcal{S}^{p/q}_{n}|\ =\ \sum_{k=1}^q(-1)^{k+1}\binom{q}{k}|\mathcal{S}^{p/q}_{n-k}| + |\mathcal{S}^{p/q}_{n-(p+q)}|.$$ We show that $(|\mathcal{S}^{p/q}_n|)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a subsequence with terms taken periodically from Padovan-like sequences which satisfy simple recurrence relations. As an application, we obtain an alternative proof of the above linear recurrence. Furthermore, a similar result holds for the sequence $(|\mathcal{M}^{p/q}_{n}|)_{n=1}^\infty$ that counts maximal $(p,q)$-Schreier sets. We end with a discussion of the relation between $(|\mathcal{S}^{p/q}_{n}|)_{n=1}^\infty$ and $(|\mathcal{M}^{p/q}_{n}|)_{n=1}^\infty$.</description>

Applying a technique described in [Rabern, B \&amp; Rabern, L 2008, 'A simple solution to the hardest logic puzzle ever', \textit{Analysis}, vol. 68, no. 2, pp.~105-112.] allows for questions with tripartite responses; we explain this innovation and give an optimal strategy for two players applying it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop certain combinatorial tools for the study of discriminants of general systems of polynomial equations. Applying these tools in a sequel paper, we completely classify components of such discriminants, generalizing the classical results of Gelfand, Kapranov, and Zelevinsky on discriminants of one general multivariate polynomial.
  The developed tools are targeted at vector subspace arrangements and naturally extend to their combinatorial abstraction called polymatroids, which are the subject matter of this work.
  We explore relations between polymatroids and their induced matroids for bases, circuits, cycles, and rank functions. We define contractions for polymatroids corresponding to the contractions of the induced matroids. With a view towards applications to discriminants, we construct a new combinatorial structure induced by polymatroids, called BK-sets.</description>

      <title>The odd independence number of graphs, I: Foundations and classical classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An odd independent set $S$ in a graph $G=(V,E)$ is an independent set of vertices such that, for every vertex $v \in V \setminus S$, either $N(v) \cap S = \emptyset$ or $|N(v) \cap S| \equiv 1$ (mod 2), where $N(v)$ stands for the open neighborhood of $v$. The largest cardinality of odd independent sets of a graph $G$, denoted $\alpha_{od}(G)$, is called the odd independence number of $G$. This new parameter is a natural companion to the recently introduced strong odd chromatic number. A proper vertex coloring of a graph $G$ is a strong odd coloring if, for every vertex $v \in V(G)$, each color used in the neighborhood of $v$ appears an odd number of times in $N(v)$. The minimum number of colors in a strong odd coloring of $G$ is denoted by $\chi_{so}(G)$. A simple relation involving these two parameters and the order $|G|$ of $G$ is $\alpha_{od}(G)\cdot\chi_{so}(G) \geq |G|$, parallel to the same on chromatic number and independence number. We develop several basic inequalities concerning $\alpha_{od}(G)$, and use already existing results on strong odd coloring, to derive lower bounds for odd independence in many families of graphs. We prove that $\alpha_{od}(G) = \alpha(G^2)$ holds for all claw-free graphs $G$, and apply this result to prove that determining $\alpha_{od}(G)$ is in general NP-hard (and also when restricted to line graphs). We also present many results, using various techniques, concerning the odd independence number of cycles, paths, Moore graphs, Kneser graphs, the complete subdivision $S(K_n)$ of $K_n$, the half graphs $H_{n,n}$, and $K_p \Box K_q$. Further, we consider the odd independence number of the hypercube $Q_d$ and also of the complements of triangle-free graphs. Many open problems for future research are stated. Further related results can be found in part II of this work, arXiv: 2510.01897.</description>

      <title>(Treewidth, Clique)-Boundedness and Poly-logarithmic Tree-Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An independent set in a graph $G$ is a set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices. A tree decomposition of $G$ is a pair $(T, \chi)$ where $T$ is a tree and $\chi : V(T) \rightarrow 2^{V(G)}$ is a function satisfying the following two axioms: for every edge $uv \in V(G)$ there is a $x \in V(T)$ such that $\{u,v\} \subseteq \chi(x)$, and for every vertex $u \in V(G)$ the set $\{x \in V(T) ~:~ u \in \chi(X)\}$ induces a non-empty and connected subtree of $T$. The sets $\chi(x)$ for $x \in V(T)$ are called the bags of the tree decomposition. The tree-independence number of $G$ is the minimum taken over all tree decompositions of $G$ of the size of the maximum independent set of the graph induced by a bag of the tree decomposition.
  The study of graph classes with bounded tree-independence number has attracted much attention in recent years, in part due its improtant algorithmic implications. A conjecture of Dallard, Milani\v{c} and Storgel, connecting tree-independence number to the classical notion of treewidth, was one of the motivating problems in the area. This conjecture was recently disproved, but here we prove a slight variant of it, that retains much of the algorithmic significance. As part of the proof we introduce the notion of independence-containers, which can be viewed as a generalization of the set of all maximal cliques of a graph, and is of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relation between the real eigenvalues of the non-backtracking matrix and those of the non-backtracking Laplacian is considered with respect to node clustering. For this purpose we use the real eigenvalues of the transition probability matrix (when the random walk goes through the oriented edges with the rule of ``not going back in the next step'') which have a linear relation to those of the non-backtracking Laplacian of Jost and Mulas. ``Inflation--deflation'' techniques are also developed for clustering the nodes of the original graph when it comes from the sparse stochastic block model of Bordenave and Decelle. Via the symmetrized normalized non-backtracking Laplacian, ``bottlenecks'' in the non-backtracking graph are detected, where the random walk goes through rarely in any direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a grid graph as a Cartesian product of path-graphs $P_n$ or cycle-graphs $C_n$, and define a grid design as a $G$-design where the graph $G$ is a grid graph, that is, a decomposition of a complete graph into edge-disjoint subgraphs isomorphic to $G$. We show that when $n$ is an odd prime or the square of an odd prime, the toroidal grid-graph $G = C_n \square C_n$ admits a $G$-design. In the less symmetrical case of products of path-graphs, we prove that $G = P_3 \square P_3$ does not admit a $G$-design but that $G = P_4 \square P_4$ does. This last result is the special case that motivated the present paper: a $P_4 \square P_4$-design corresponds to a way of successively scrambling a Connections puzzle so that each pair of words occurs adjacently exactly once. Our constructions use the arithmetic of finite fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a consequence of the Littlewood-Richardson (LR) commuters coincidence and the Kumar-Torres branching model via Kushwaha-Raghavan-Viswanath flagged hives, we have solved the Lecouvey- -Lenart conjecture on the bijections between the Kwon and Sundaram branching models for the pair $({GL}_{2n}(\mathbb{C}), {Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{C})) $ consisting of the general linear group ${GL}_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ and the symplectic group ${Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$. In particular, thanks to the Henriques-Kamnitzer $gl_n$-crystal commuter, we have recognized that the left companion of an LR-Sundaram tableau is characterized by the Kwon symplectic condition. We now use the construction of the left Gelfand-Tsetlin pattern, or left companion tableau, of an LR-Sundaram tableau to exhibit the Kwon symplectic property, a mirror of the flag on its right companion tableau. This is equivalent to the restriction of the Berenstein-Gelfand-Zelevinsky LR model, on the interpretation of Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns, to symplectic Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns as left companions of LR-Sundaram tableaux.</description>

      <title>Self-avoiding walks on cubic graphs and local transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite its elementary definition, the self-avoiding walk (SAW) poses notoriously hard enumerative problems: exact connective constants are known for only a handful of infinite graphs, notably the honeycomb lattice \cite{ds}. We establish a general substitution principle for SAWs on infinite connected quasi-transitive cubic graphs under port-transitive vertex replacements, where each degree-$3$ vertex is replaced by a fixed finite three-port gadget. Writing $g(x)$ for the associated two-port SAW series, we prove that for $G_1=\phi(G)$, \[ \mu(G)^{-1}=g\bigl(\mu(G_1)^{-1}\bigr), \] equivalently $\mu(G_1)^{-1}$ is the unique solution $x\in(0,1)$ of $g(x)=\mu(G)^{-1}$, thereby extending the Fisher-triangle relation of Grimmett--Li to arbitrary symmetric three-port gadgets. We also obtain the corresponding identity for bipartite graphs when one or both colour classes are transformed, and show that the critical exponents $\gamma$ and $\eta$ (and $\nu$ under a standard regularity hypothesis) are invariant. For explicit gadget families, including complete-graph gadgets $K_N$ and Fisher-type constructions, these identities turn base graphs with known $\mu$ into infinite families of new quasi-transitive graphs whose connective constants are determined exactly as the unique roots of explicit algebraic equations.</description>

      <title>Erd\H{o}s Matching (Conjecture) Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of $k$-sized subsets of $[n]$ that does not contain $s$ pairwise disjoint subsets.
  The Erd\H{o}s Matching Conjecture, a celebrated and long-standing open problem in extremal combinatorics, asserts the maximum cardinality of $\mathcal{F}$ is upper bounded by
  $\max\left\{\binom{sk-1}{k}, \binom{n}{k}-\allowbreak \binom{n-s+1}{k}\right\}$.
  These two bounds correspond to the sizes of two canonical extremal families: one in which all subsets are contained within a ground set of $sk-1$ elements, and one in which every subset intersects a fixed set of $s-1$ elements.
  In this paper, we prove the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism counting for immersion-closed classes is not isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lov\'{a}sz proved that two graphs $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic if $\hom(K,G) = \hom(K,H)$ for all graphs $K$, where $\hom(G_1,G_2)$ denotes the number of homomorphisms from $G_1$ to $G_2$. Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k showed that it suffices to count homomorphisms from all $2$-degenerate graphs $K$. On the other hand, for several interesting graph classes $\mathcal{M}$, it has been shown that there exist non-isomorphic graphs $G$ and $H$ such that $\hom(K,G)=\hom(K,H)$ for all $K\in \mathcal{M}$. Most such classes are minor-closed and Roberson conjectured that every proper minor-closed graph class $\mathcal{M}$ has the property that there exist non-isomorphic graphs that are indistinguishable by homomorphism counts from $\mathcal{M}$. There has been an effort to prove Roberson's conjecture as it is believed that minor-closed classes play a special role in demarcating the graph classes that satisfy this property.
  We show that this special role, if it exists, must be shared, by proving an analogue of Roberson's conjecture for a rich family of non-minor-closed classes. Namely, we prove that for any proper immersion-closed graph class $\mathcal{M}$, there exist non-isomorphic graphs $G$ and $H$ such that $\hom(K,G) = \hom(K,H)$ for all $K \in \mathcal{M}$.
  This extends a result of Roberson on homomorphism indistinguishability over bounded degree graphs, and cannot be extended in the natural way by replacing immersions with topological minors due to a result of Neuen and Seppelt.
  Our main result is obtained as a consequence of a colouring result which may be of independent interest: Every graph with a $\oddbound$-oddomorphism admits a $K_{t}$-immersion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1909.06398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a class of amenable Weyl group elements in the Lie types B, C, and D, which we propose as the analogues of vexillary permutations in these Lie types. Our amenable signed permutations index flagged theta and eta polynomials, which generalize the double theta and eta polynomials of Wilson and the author. In geometry, we obtain corresponding formulas for the cohomology classes of symplectic and orthogonal degeneracy loci.</description>

      <title>Critical values for the $\beta$-transformation with a hole at $0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.10012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given $\beta\in(1,2]$, let $T_\beta$ be the $\beta$-transformation on the unit circle $[0,1)$ such that $T_\beta(x)=\beta x\pmod 1$. For each $t\in[0,1)$ let $K_\beta(t)$ be the survivor set consisting of all $x\in[0,1)$ whose orbit $\{T^n_\beta(x): n\ge 0\}$ never hits the open interval $(0,t)$. Kalle et al. proved in [Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems, 40 (9): 2482--2514, 2020] that the Hausdorff dimension function $t\mapsto\dim_H K_\beta(t)$ is a non-increasing Devil's staircase. So there exists a critical value $\tau(\beta)$ such that $\dim_H K_\beta(t)&gt;0$ if and only if $t&lt;\tau(\beta)$. In this paper we determine the critical value $\tau(\beta)$ for all $\beta\in(1,2]$, answering a question of Kalle et al. (2020). For example, we find that for the Komornik-Loreti constant $\beta\approx 1.78723$ we have $\tau(\beta)=(2-\beta)/(\beta-1)$. Furthermore, we show that (i) the function $\tau: \beta\mapsto\tau(\beta)$ is left continuous on $(1,2]$ with right-hand limits everywhere, but has countably infinitely many discontinuities; (ii) $\tau$ has no downward jumps, with $\tau(1+)=0$ and $\tau(2)=1/2$; and (iii) there exists an open set $O\subset(1,2]$, whose complement $(1,2]\setminus O$ has zero Hausdorff dimension, such that $\tau$ is real-analytic, convex and strictly decreasing on each connected component of $O$. Our strategy to find the critical value $\tau(\beta)$ depends on certain substitutions of Farey words and a renormalization scheme from dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.13134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete characterisation of automaticity of uniformly recurrent substitutive sequences in terms of the incidence matrix of the return substitution of the underlying purely substitutive sequence. This resolves a recent question posed by Allouche, Dekking and Queff\'elec in the uniformly recurrent case. We show that the same criterion characterizes automaticity of minimal substitutive systems.
  Furthermore, we construct a minimal substitutive system whose maximal equicontinuous factor is the 2-adic odometer, and for which the corresponding factor map is everywhere uncountable-to-one. We conjecture that a minimal substitutive system is k-automatic if and only if it is an everywhere finite-to-one extension of a k-adic odometer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce rotation groups as a common generalisation of Coxeter groups and graph products of groups (including right-angled Artin groups). We characterise algebraically these groups by presentations (periagroups) and we propose a combinatorial geometry (mediangle graphs) to study them. As an application, we give natural and unified proofs for several results that hold for both Coxeter groups and graph products of groups.</description>

      <title>Planar site percolation via tree embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00923v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an infinite, connected planar graph that is properly embedded in $\RR^2$ and has minimal vertex degree at least $7$. We prove that for i.i.d.\ $\mathrm{Bernoulli}(p)$ site percolation on $G$, for every \[ p \in \bigl(p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G),\, 1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)\bigr), \] there are almost surely infinitely many infinite open $(1$-)$\,$clusters. In particular, we show that $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)&lt;\tfrac12$, so the non-uniqueness interval is nonempty. This verifies Conjecture~7 of Benjamini and Schramm~\cite{bs96} for this class of properly embedded planar graphs.
  The main new ingredient is an explicit construction of trees embedded in $G$ with controlled local geometry (degrees $3$ and $4$ away from the root). These trees yield non-uniqueness near $p=\tfrac12$ and, via an embedded forest of pairwise disjoint trees, imply exponential decay of two-point connection probabilities in the matching graph $G_*$. To treat the complementary regime $p&gt;\tfrac12$, we introduce a ``binary-tree'' version of uniform percolation that yields stability of infinite clusters under edge additions without any bounded-degree assumption.
  Beyond planarity, we also obtain a general two-point connectivity inequality on arbitrary infinite, connected locally finite graphs, which implies a non-transitive criterion for the existence of infinitely many infinite clusters in the regime $p_c&lt;p&lt;p_{\mathrm{conn}}$.</description>

      <title>Minimum transformation representations of diagram monoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain formulae for the minimum transformation degrees of the most well-studied families of finite diagram monoids, including the partition, Brauer, Temperley--Lieb and Motzkin monoids. For example, the partition monoid $P_n$ has degree $1 + \frac{B(n+2)-B(n+1)+B(n)}2$ for $n\geq2$, where these are Bell numbers. The proofs involve constructing explicit faithful representations of the minimum degree, many of which can be realised as (partial) actions on projections.</description>

Abstract: In the space of square matrices, we characterize row-generated subspaces, on which the determinant is an irreducible polynomial. As a corollary, we characterize square systems of polynomial equations with indeterminate coefficients, whose discriminant is an irreducible hypersurface. This resolves a conjecture of Esterov, and, in a sequel paper, leads to a complete description of components and codimensions for discriminants of square systems of equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of functions that behave like classical Eisenstein series in many ways, but with a key distinction: only their non-holomorphic completions transform like (quasi)modular forms. We show how the partition rank generating function can be expressed in terms of partition traces of these functions. A key feature of our construction is that the completions satisfy a holomorphic anomaly equation - a phenomenon typically seen in the context of quantum field theory and string theory. We also show that the Fourier coefficients of these Eisenstein-type series are integral.</description>

Abstract: Given an arbitrary abstract simplicial complex $K$ on $[m]:=\{1,2,\ldots, m\}$, different from the simplex $\Delta_{[m]}$ with $m$ vertices, we introduce and study a canonical $(2m-2)$-dimensional toric manifold $X_K$, associated to the canonical $(m-1)$-dimensional complete regular fan $\Sigma_K$. This construction yields an infinite family of toric manifolds that are not quasitoric and provides a topological proof of the Dehn-Sommerville relations for the associated Bier sphere $\mathrm{Bier}(K)$. Finally, we classify the canonical real and complex moment-angle manifolds of Lusternik-Schnirelmann category $\leq 2$ and prove a criterion for orientability of the canonical real toric manifolds.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we show that the Matsushita model structure on loop graphs, which is right-transferred from the Kan-Quillen model structure on simplicial sets, factors through two other right-transferred model structures on simplicial complexes and reflexive graphs. We show that each Quillen adjunction between these right-transferred model categories is a Quillen equivalence. These model structures are analogous to the Thomason model structure on small categories, and we prove that they are all cofibrantly generated and proper. Furthermore we show that all cofibrant simplicial complexes are flag complexes, and all forests are cofibrant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a resistive electrical network, we would like to determine whether all the resistances (edges) in the network are working, and if not, identify which edge (or edges) are faulty. To make this determination, we are allowed to measure the effective resistance between certain pairs of nodes (which can be done by measuring the amount of current when one unit of voltage difference is applied at the chosen pair of nodes). The goal is to determine which edge, if any, is not working in the network using the smallest number of measurements. We prove rigorous upper and lower bounds on this optimal number of measurements for different classes of graphs. These bounds are tight for several of these classes showing that our measurement strategies are optimal.</description>

      <title>Planar Site Percolation, End Structure, and the Benjamini-Schramm Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an infinite, connected, locally finite planar graph and consider i.i.d.\ Bernoulli$(p)$ site percolation. Write $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$ and $p_u^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$ for the critical and uniqueness thresholds. Using a well--separated Freudenthal embedding $G\hookrightarrow\mathbb S^2$, we introduce a cycle--separation equivalence on ends and associated ``directional'' thresholds $p^{\mathrm{site}}_{c,F}(G)$.
  When the set of end--equivalence classes is countable, we show that $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)=\inf_F p^{\mathrm{site}}_{c,F}(G)$ and that for every $p\in\bigl(\tfrac12,\,1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)\bigr)$ there are almost surely infinitely many infinite open clusters. Combined with the $0/\infty$ theorem of Glazman--Harel--Zelesko for $p\le \tfrac12$, this yields non--uniqueness throughout the full coexistence interval $\bigl(p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G),\,1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)\bigr)$, and hence $p_u^{\mathrm{site}}(G)\ge 1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$ in this setting. This resolves the extension problem posed by Glazman--Harel--Zelesko for the upper half of the coexistence regime under a natural countability hypothesis.
  In contrast, for graphs with uncountably many end--equivalence classes we give criteria guaranteeing infinitely many infinite clusters above criticality, and we construct an explicit locally finite planar graph of minimum degree at least $7$ for which $p_u^{\mathrm{site}}(G)&lt;1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$. Consequently, the Benjamini--Schramm conjecture (Conjecture 7 in \cite{bs96}) that planarity together with minimal vertex degree at least 7 forces infinitely many infinite clusters for all $p\in(p_c,1-p_c)$ does not hold in full generality.
  Our proofs combine a cutset characterization of $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}$ with a planar alternating--arm exploration organized by an end--adapted boundary decomposition.</description>

Abstract: We derive Singleton-type bounds on the free distance and column distances of trellis codes. Our results show that, at a given time instant, the maximum attainable column distance of trellis codes can exceed that of convolutional codes. Moreover, using expander graphs, we construct trellis codes over constant-size alphabets that achieve a rate-distance trade-off arbitrarily close to that of convolutional codes with a maximum distance profile. By comparison, all known constructions of convolutional codes with a maximum distance profile require working over alphabets whose size grows at least exponentially with the number of output symbols per time instant.</description>

      <title>Permanents of matrix ensembles: computation, distribution, and geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a computational and experimental study of permanents. On the computational side, we use the GPU to greaatly accelerate the computation of permanents over $\mathbb{C},$ $\mathbb{R},$ $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{Q}.$ First, for Haar-distributed unitary matrices~$U$, the permanent $\perm(U)$ follows a circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma^2)$ -- we confirm this via a number of tests for $n$ up to~23 with $50{,}000$ samples. The DFT matrix permanent is an extreme outlier for every prime $n\ge 7$. In contrast, for Haar-random \emph{orthogonal} matrices~$O$, the permanent $\perm(O)$ is approximately real Gaussian but with positive excess kurtosis that decays as~$O(1/n)$, indicating slower convergence. For matrices with Gaussian entries (GUE, GOE, Ginibre), the permanent follows an $\alpha$-stable distribution with stability index $\alpha\approx 1.0$--$1.4$, well below the Gaussian value $\alpha=2$. We test Aaronson's conjecture that $|\perm(X)|^2$ is asymptotically lognormal for Gaussian~$X$: it is plausible for the complex Ginibre and GOE ensembles, but appears to fail for GUE and real Ginibre, where the $\alpha$-stable tails prevent convergence. Anti-concentration, however, holds for all Gaussian ensembles and is more robust than for Haar unitaries.
  Secondly, we study the permanent along geodesics on the unitary group. For the geodesic from the identity to the $n$-cycle permutation matrix, we find a universal scaling function $f(t)=\frac{1}{n}\ln|\perm(\gamma(t))|$ that is independent of~$n$ in the large-$n$ limit, with a midpoint value \[
  \perm(\gamma({\textstyle\frac12}))
  = (-1)^{(n-1)/2}\cdot 2e^{-n}\bigl(1+\tfrac{1}{3n}+O(n^{-2})\bigr) \] for odd~$n$ and zero for even~$n$. We also study the geodesic forom the identity to the DFT matrix.</description>

      <title>Bases of Permutation Groups and Boolean Representable Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A base of a permutation group (X,G) is a subset B of X such that its pointwise stabilizer is the trivial group. A list (x1,x2, ... ,xk) of elements of X is irredundant if each element is not in the pointwise stabilizer of its predecessors. We define a Boolean representable simplicial complex B(X,G) such that a subset Y of X is independent if and only if some enumeration of its elements is irredundant. In addition Y is a base if and only if its closure is X. We give a number of examples and close with a conjecture whose solution leads to a new proof of the Feit-Thompson Theorem.</description>
