      <title>Elasticity in orders of an algebraic number field with radical conductor ideal and their rings of formal power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orders in an algebraic number field form a class of rings which are of special historical interest to the field of factorization theory. One of the primary tools used to study factorization is elasticity - a measure of how badly unique factorization fails in a domain. This paper explores properties of orders in a number field and how they can be used to study elasticity in not only the orders themselves, but also in rings of formal power series over the orders. Of particular interest is the fact, proven here, that power series extensions in finitely many variables over half-factorial rings of algebraic integers must themselves be half-factorial. It is also shown that the HFD property is not preserved in general for power series rings over non-integrally closed orders in a number field.</description>

      <title>A study of perfectoid rings via Galois cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his foundational study of $p$-adic Hodge theory, Faltings introduced the method of almost \'etale extensions to establish fundmental comparison results of various $p$-adic cohomology theories. Scholze introduced the tilting operations to study algebraic objects arising from $p$-adic Hodge theory in mixed characteristic via the Frobenius map. In this article, we prove a few results which clarify certain ring-theoretic or homological properties of the tilt of an extension between perfectoid rings treated in the construction of big Cohen-Macaulay algebras.</description>

      <title>Decomposing conditional independence ideals with hidden variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of determinantal ideals whose decompositions encode the structural zeros in conditional independence models with hidden variables. We provide explicit decompositions of these ideals and, for certain subclasses of models, we show that this is a decomposition into radical ideals by displaying Gr\"obner bases for the components. We identify conditions under which the components are prime, and establish formulas for the dimensions of these prime ideals.
  Moreover, we show that the components in the decomposition can be grouped into equivalence classes defined by their combinatorial structure, and we derive a closed formula for the number of such classes.</description>

      <title>Chen-Macaulay squares of edge ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite graph and $I(G)$ its edge ideal. The question in which we are interested is when the square $I(G)^2$ is Cohen--Macaulay. Via the polarization technique together with Reisner's criterion, it is shown that, if $G$ belongs to the class of finite graphs which consists of cycles, whisker graphs, trees, connected chordal graphs and connected Cohen--Macaulay bipartite graphs, then the square $I(G)^2$ is Cohen--Macaulay if and only if either $G$ is the pentagon, the cycle of length $5$, or $G$ consists of exactly one edge.</description>

Abstract: Consider A to be a commutative, integral and non-degenerate residuated lattice. In this work, we introduce the graph of comaximal filters on the residuated lattice A. We willdenote by Cf(A) this graph for which the set of vertices are proper filters of A which are not contained in the radical of A, and the adjacency relation on vertices is given as: consider two filters F and G, there are adjacent if and only if F v G; the filter generated by F u G is equal to A. The elementary properties of this graph are provided, we establish a link between this comaximal filter graphs and the zero-divisor graphs. Furthermore, we investigate the chromatic number, the clique number, the planarity and the perfection of the graph Cf(A). We also briefly describe all the comaximal filter graphs constructed on specific residuated lattices of small size.</description>

      <title>On three families of dense Puiseux monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:1701.00058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A positive monoid is a submonoid of the nonnegative cone of a linearly ordered abelian group. The positive monoids of rank $1$ are called Puiseux monoids, and their atomicity, arithmetic of length, and factorization have been systematically investigated for about ten years. Each Puiseux monoid can be realized as an additive submonoid of the nonnegative cone of $\mathbb{Q}$. We say that a Puiseux monoid is dense if it is isomorphic to an additive submonoid of $\mathbb{Q}_{\ge 0}$ that is dense in $\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ with respect to the Euclidean topology. Every non-dense Puiseux monoid is known to be a bounded factorization monoid. However, the atomic structure as well as the arithmetic and factorization properties of dense Puiseux monoids turn out to be quite interesting. In this paper, we study the atomic structure and some arithmetic and factorization aspects of three families of dense Puiseux monoids.</description>

      <title>Macaulay Posets and Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Macaulay posets are posets in which an analog of the Kruskal-Katona Theorem holds. Macaulay rings (also called Macaulay-Lex rings) are rings in which an analog of Macaulay's Theorem for lex ideals holds. The study of both of these objects started with Macaulay almost a century ago. Since then, these two branches have developed separately over the past century, with the last link being the Clements-Lindstr\"om Theorem.
  For every ring that is the quotient of a polynomial ring by a homogeneous ideal we define the poset of monomials. Under certain conditions, we prove a Macaulay Correspondence Theorem, a ring is Macaulay if and only if its poset of monomials is Macaulay. Furthermore, the tensor product of rings corresponds to the Cartesian product of the posets of monomials. This allows us to transfer results between rings and posets. By using this translation, we give several answers to a problem posed by Mermin and Peeva, a positive answer to Hoefel's question about applying Macaulay poset theory to ring theory, and deduce several other results in algebra and combinatorics.
  A new proof of the Mermin-Murai Theorem on colored square free rings is presented by using star posets. We extend the Mermin-Murai Theorem to rings that are not square free. Using a result from Mermin and Peeva we give an answer to a question posed by Bezrukov and Leck. Some results of Chong also give answers to the Bezrukov-Leck problem. All of these results have a common feature. They involve the tensor product of rings whose Hasse graphs of the poset of monomials are trees. We call such rings, tree rings. We give a classification of Macaulay rings that are the tensor product of a tree ring. Finally, we show that there are Macaulay rings that are not the tensor product of tree rings, and present the first examples of Macaulay rings that are not quotients by a monomial ideal and not quotients by a toric ideal.</description>

      <title>On Conjecture of Binomial Edge Ideals of Linear Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ideal $I$ of a commutative ring $R$ is said to be of linear type when its Rees algebra and symmetric algebra exhibit isomorphism. In this paper, we investigate the conjecture put forth by Jayanthan, Kumar, and Sarkar (2021) that if $G$ is a tree or a unicyclic graph, then the binomial edge ideal of $G$ is of linear type. Our investigation validates this conjecture for trees. However, our study reveals that not all unicyclic graphs adhere to this conjecture.</description>

Abstract: In [24], Yassine et al. introduced the notion of 1-absorbing prime ideals in commutative rings with nonzero identity. In this article, we examine the concept of 1-absorbing prime elements in C-lattices. We investigate the C-lattices in which every element is a finite product of 1-absorbing prime elements (we denote them as OAFLs for short). Moreover, we study C-lattices having 2-absorbing factorization (we denote them as TAFLs for short).</description>

Abstract: Let R be a commutative ring with identity and N(R) be the set of all nilpotent elements of R. The aim of this paper is to introduce and study the notion of nil-prime ideals as a generalization of prime ideals. We say that a proper ideal P of R is a nil-prime ideal if there exists x \in N(R) and whenever ab \in P, then a \in P or b \in P or a+x \in P or b+x \in P for each a,b \in R. Also, we introduce nil versions of some algebraic concepts in ring theory such as nil-maximal ideal, nil-minimal ideal, nil-principal ideal and investigate some nil-version of a well-known results about them.</description>

      <title>Valuation Ideal Factorization Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An integral domain $D$ is a valuation ideal factorization domain (VIFD) if each nonzero principal ideal of $D$ can be written as a finite product of valuation ideals. Clearly, $\pi$-domains are VIFDs. In this paper, we study the ring-theoretic properties of VIFDs and the $*$-operation analogs of VIFDs. Among them, we show that if $D$ is treed (resp., $*$-treed), then $D$ is a VIFD (resp., $*$-VIFD) if and only if $D$ is an ${\rm h}$-local Pr\"ufer domain (resp., a $*$-${\rm h}$-local P$*$MD) if and only if every nonzero prime ideal of $D$ contains an invertible (resp., a $*$-invertible) valuation ideal. We also study integral domains $D$ such that for each nonzero nonunit $a\in D$, there is a positive integer $n$ such that $a^n$ can be written as a finite product of valuation elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the notion of multiplicity for weakly graded families of ideals which are bounded below linearly. In particular, we show that the limit $e_W(\mathfrak{I}):=\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}d!\frac{\ell_R(R/I_n)}{n^d}$ exists where $\mathfrak I=\{I_n\}$ is a bounded below linearly weakly graded families of ideals in a Noetherian local ring $(R,\mathfrak m)$ of dimension $d\geq 1$ with $\dim(N(\hat{R}))&lt;d$. Furthermore, we prove that ``volume=multiplicity" formula and Minkowski inequality hold for such families of ideals. We explore some properties of $e_W(\mathfrak J)$ for weakly graded families of ideals of the form $\mathfrak J=\{(I_n:K)\}$ where $\{I_n\}$ is an $\mathfrak m$-primary graded family of ideals. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the equality in Minkowski inequality for the weakly graded family of ideals of the form $\mathfrak J=\{(I_n:K)\}$ where $\{I_n\}$ is a bounded filtration. Moreover, we generalize a result of Rees characterizing the inclusion of ideals with the same multiplicities for the above families of ideals. Finally, we investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the length function $\ell_R(H_{\mathfrak m}^0(R/(I_n:K)))$ where $\{I_n\}$ is a filtration of ideals (not necessarily $\mathfrak m$-primary).</description>

Abstract: Let $R$ be an associative ring with a nonzero ideal $I$ and a semiprime ideal $T$ such that $T\subsetneq I.$ Let $K$ be a nonempty subset of $R$ and $d:R\to R$ be a derivation of $R$, if $[d(x),x]\in T$ for all $x\in K,$ then $d$ is said to be a $T$-commuting derivation on $K.$ In this article, we show that if $d$ satisfies some $T$-valued identities that it is $T$-commuting. Consequently, we provide semi-prime ideal variants of some known results on derivations.</description>

(i) We describe the extension of the Singular library sagbiNormaliz.sing to the computation of defining ideals of subalgebras of polynomial rings. (ii) We give a complete classification of the algebras of minors for which the generating set is a SAGBI basis with respect to a suitable monomial order and we identify universal SAGBI basis in three cases.

      <title>Bounded powers of edge ideals: Gorenstein toric rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S=K[x_1, \ldots,x_n]$ denote the polynomial ring in $n$ variables over a field $K$ and $I \subset S$ a monomial ideal. Given a vector $\mathfrak{c}\in\mathbb{N}^n$, the ideal $I_{\mathfrak{c}}$ is the ideal generated by those monomials belonging to $I$ whose exponent vectors are componentwise bounded above by $\mathfrak{c}$. Let $\delta_{\mathfrak{c}}(I)$ be the largest integer $q$ for which $(I^q)_{\mathfrak{c}}\neq 0$. For a finite graph $G$, its edge ideal is denoted by $I(G)$. Let $\mathcal{B}(\mathfrak{c},G)$ be the toric ring which is generated by the monomials belonging to the minimal system of monomial generators of $(I(G)^{\delta_{\mathfrak{c}}(I)})_{\mathfrak{c}}$. In a previous work, the authors proved that $(I(G)^{\delta_{\mathfrak{c}}(I)})_{\mathfrak{c}}$ is a polymatroidal ideal. It follows that $\mathcal{B}(\mathfrak{c},G)$ is a normal Cohen--Macaulay domain. In this paper, we study the Gorenstein property of $\mathcal{B}(\mathfrak{c},G)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Newton polytopes of $F$-polynomials in a TSSS cluster algebra $\mathcal A$ and generalize them to a larger set consisting of polytopes $N_{h}$ associated to vectors $h\in\Z^{n}$ as well as $\widehat{\mathcal{P}}$ consisting of polytope functions $\rho_{h}$ corresponding to $N_{h}$.
  The main contribution contains that
  (i) obtaining a {\em recurrence construction} of the Laurent expression of a cluster variable in a cluster from its $g$-vector;
  (ii) proving the subset $\mathcal{P}$ of $\widehat{\mathcal{P}}$ consisting of Laurent polynomials in $\widehat{\mathcal{P}}$ is a strongly positive $\Z Trop(Y)$-basis for $\mathcal{U}(\A)$ consisting of certain universally indecomposable Laurent polynomials when $\A$ is a cluster algebra with principal coefficients. For a cluster algebra $\mathcal A$ over arbitrary semifield $\mathbb P$ in general, $\mathcal{P}$ is a strongly positive $\Z\P$-basis for the intermediate cluster subalgebra $\mathcal{I_P(A)}$ of $\mathcal{U(A)}$. We call $\mathcal P$ the {\em polytope basis};
  (iii) constructing some explicit maps among corresponding $F$-polynomials, $g$-vectors, $d$-vectors and cluster variables to characterize their relationship.
  Moreover, we give three applications of (i), (ii) and (iii) respectively.</description>

Abstract: For integers $k,n \geq 0$ and a cost vector $c \in Z^n$, we study two fundamental integer linear programming (ILP) problems: \[
  \text{(Standard Form)} \quad \max\bigl\{c^\top x \colon Ax = b,\ x \in Z^n_{\geq 0}\bigr\} \text{ with } A \in Z^{k \times n}, \text{rank}(A) = k, b \in Z^k, \] \[
  \text{(Canonical Form)} \quad \max\bigl\{c^\top x \colon Ax \leq b,\ x \in Z^n\bigr\} \text{ with } A \in Z^{(n+k) \times n}, \text{rank}(A) = n, b \in Z^{n+k}. \] We present improved algorithms for both problems and their feasibility versions, parameterized by $k$ and $\Delta$, where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum absolute value of $\text{rank}(A) \times \text{rank}(A)$ subdeterminants of $A$. Our main complexity results, stated in terms of required arithmetic operations, are: \[ \text{Optimization:}\quad O(\log k)^{2k} \cdot \Delta^2 / 2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log \Delta})} + 2^{O(k)} \cdot \text{poly}(\varphi), \] \[ \text{Feasibility:} \quad O(\log k)^k \cdot \Delta \cdot (\log \Delta)^3 + 2^{O(k)} \cdot \text{poly}(\varphi), \] where $\varphi$ represents the input size measured by the bit-encoding length of $(A,b,c)$. We also examine several special cases when $k \in \{0,1\}$, which have important applications in: expected computational complexity of ILP with varying right-hand side $b$, ILP problems with generic constraint matrices, ILP problems on simplices. Our results yield improved complexity bounds for these specific scenarios.
  As independent contributions, we present: An $n^2/2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})}$-time algorithm for the tropical convolution problem on sequences indexed by elements of a finite Abelian group of order $n$; A complete and self-contained error analysis of the generalized DFT over Abelian groups in the Word-RAM model.</description>

      <title>Classes of functions in the set of circulant matrices and their characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce new classes of functions that extend the known classes of functions of complex variable, such as entire functions, meromorphic functions, rational functions and polynomial functions and take values in the set of circulant matrices with complex entries. For these new classes of functions, we extend the recently obtained characterization theorems in [Li, B. Q. Two elementary properties of entire functions and their applications. Amer. Math. Monthly 122(2) (2015), 169--172] and [Li, B. Q. A characterization of rational functions. Amer. Math. Monthly. 132(3) (2025), 269--271] to an algebraic structure of circulant matrices that includes several complex variables. Our characterization theorems lead to the generalization of the variant of the fundamental theorem of algebra established recently in [Abramov, V. M. Extension of the fundamental theorem of algebra for polynomial matrix equation with circulant matrices. Amer. Math. Monthly. DOI: 10.1080/00029890.2024.2440298].</description>
