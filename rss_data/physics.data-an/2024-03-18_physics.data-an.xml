      <title>NuGraph2: A Graph Neural Network for Neutrino Physics Event Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detector technology offers a wealth of high-resolution information on particle interactions, and leveraging that information to its full potential requires sophisticated automated reconstruction techniques. This article describes NuGraph2, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for low-level reconstruction of simulated neutrino interactions in a LArTPC detector. Simulated neutrino interactions in the MicroBooNE detector geometry are described as heterogeneous graphs, with energy depositions on each detector plane forming nodes on planar subgraphs. The network utilizes a multi-head attention message-passing mechanism to perform background filtering and semantic labelling on these graph nodes, identifying those associated with the primary physics interaction with 98.0\% efficiency and labelling them according to particle type with 94.9\% efficiency. The network operates directly on detector observables across multiple 2D representations, but utilizes a 3D-context-aware mechanism to encourage consistency between these representations. Model inference takes 0.12 s/event on a CPU, and 0.005 s/event batched on a GPU. This architecture is designed to be a general-purpose solution for particle reconstruction in neutrino physics, with the potential for deployment across a broad range of detector technologies, and offers a core convolution engine that can be leveraged for a variety of tasks beyond the two described in this article.</description>

      <title>Potential of Domain Adaptation in Machine Learning in Ecology and Hydrology to Improve Model Extrapolability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the heterogeneity of the global distribution of ecological and hydrological ground-truth observations, machine learning models can have limited adaptability when applied to unknown locations, which is referred to as weak extrapolability. Domain adaptation techniques have been widely used in machine learning domains such as image classification, which can improve the model generalization ability by adjusting the difference or inconsistency of the domain distribution between the training and test sets. However, this approach has rarely been used explicitly in machine learning models in ecology and hydrology at the global scale, although these models have often been questioned due to geographic extrapolability issues. This paper briefly describes the shortcomings of current machine learning models of ecology and hydrology in terms of the global representativeness of the distribution of observations and the resulting limitations of the lack of extrapolability and suggests that future related modelling efforts should consider the use of domain adaptation techniques to improve extrapolability.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Tensor Basis Neural Networks for Reynolds stress modeling: application to plane channel and square duct flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several Tensor Basis Neural Network (TBNN) frameworks aimed at enhancing turbulence RANS modeling have recently been proposed in the literature as data-driven constitutive models for systems with known invariance properties. However, persistent ambiguities remain regarding the physical adequacy of applying the General Eddy Viscosity Model (GEVM). This work aims at investigating this aspect in an a priori stage for better predictions of the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor, while preserving the Galilean and rotational invariances. In particular, we propose a general framework providing optimal tensor basis models for two types of canonical flows: Plane Channel Flow (PCF) and Square Duct Flow (SDF). Subsequently, deep neural networks based on these optimal models are trained using state-of-the-art strategies to achieve a balanced and physically sound prediction of the full anisotropy tensor. A priori results obtained by the proposed framework are in very good agreement with the reference DNS data. Notably, our shallow network with three layers provides accurate predictions of the anisotropy tensor for PCF at unobserved friction Reynolds numbers, both in interpolation and extrapolation scenarios. Learning the SDF case is more challenging because of its physical nature and a lack of training data at various regimes. We propose to alleviate this problem based on Transfer Learning (TL). To more efficiently generalize to an unseen intermediate $\mathrm{Re}_\tau$ regime, we take advantage of our prior knowledge acquired from a training with a larger and wider dataset. Our results indicate the potential of the developed network model, and demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the TL process in terms of training data size and training time. Based on these results, we believe there is a promising future by integrating these neural networks into an adapted in-house RANS solver.</description>

      <title>Entropy corrected geometric Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is widely employed for modeling stochastic processes, yet its solutions are characterized by the log-normal distribution. This comprises predictive capabilities of GBM mainly in terms of forecasting applications. Here, entropy corrections to GBM are proposed to go beyond log-normality restrictions and better account for intricacies of real systems. It is shown that GBM solutions can be effectively refined by arguing that entropy is reduced when deterministic content of considered data increases. Notable improvements over conventional GBM are observed for several cases of non-log-normal distributions, ranging from a dice roll experiment to real world data.</description>

      <title>Principle of Information Increase: An Operational Perspective of Information Gain in the Foundations of Quantum Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A measurement performed on a quantum system is an act of gaining information about its state, a view that is widespread in practical and foundational work in quantum theory. However, the concept of information in quantum theory reconstructions is multiply-defined, and its conceptual foundations remain surprisingly under-explored. In this paper, we investigate the gain of information in quantum measurements from an operational viewpoint. We show that the continuous extension of the Shannon entropy naturally admits two distinct measures of information gain, differential information gain and relative information gain, and that these have radically different characteristics. In particular, while differential information gain can increase or decrease as additional data is acquired, relative information gain consistently grows, and moreover exhibits asymptotic indifference to the data or choice of Bayesian prior.
  In order to make a principled choice between these measures, we articulate a Principle of Information Increase, which incorporates Summhammer's proposal that more data from measurements leads to more knowledge about the system, and also takes into consideration black swan events. This principle favors differential information gain as the more relevant metric in two-outcome quantum systems, and guides the selection of priors for these information measures. Finally, we show that, of the beta distribution priors, the Jeffreys' binomial prior is the prior ensures maximal robustness of information gain to the particular data sequence obtained in a run of experiments.</description>

      <title>The IAEA electronic stopping power database: modernization, review, and analysis of the existing experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the electronic stopping power data within the IAEA database, assessing the abundance and scarcity of available data as a function of energy and collisional systems. Our analysis includes an examination of the experimental values, their evolution in time, the dispersion among data, and trends of the more recent measurements. Additionally, we provide comparisons with SRIM-2013 calculations for select cases of interest. Notably, we identify sparsely measured systems and energy regions, emphasizing the pressing need for new, reliable data and independent theoretical predictions.</description>
