      <title>Prices and Concentration: A U-shape? Theory and Evidence from Renewables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study firms' strategic interactions when each firm may own multiple production technologies, each with its own marginal cost and capacity. Increasing industry concentration by reallocating non-efficient capacity to the largest and most efficient firm can decrease market prices as it incentivizes the firm to outcompete its rivals. However, with large reallocations, the standard monotonic relationship between concentration and prices re-emerges as competition weakens due to the rival's lower capacity. Thus, we demonstrate a U-shaped relationship between market prices and industry concentration when firms are diversified. This result does not rely on economies of scale or scope. We find consistent evidence from the Colombian wholesale energy market, where strategic firms are diversified with fossil-fuel and renewable technologies, exploiting exogenous variation in renewable capacities. Our findings not only apply to the green transition but also to other industries and suggest new insights for antitrust policies.</description>

      <title>The geographic flow of bank funding and access to credit: Branch networks, local synergies and competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geographic dispersion of depositors, borrowers, and banks may prevent funding from flowing to high loan demand areas, limiting credit access. Using bank-county-year level data, we provide evidence of the geographic imbalance of deposits and loans and develop a methodology for investigating the contribution to this imbalance of branch networks, market power, and scope economies. Results are based on a novel measure of imbalance and estimation of a structural model of bank competition that admits interconnections across locations and between deposit and loan markets. Counterfactual experiments show branch networks and competition contribute importantly to credit flow but benefit more affluent markets.</description>

      <title>Minute-by-Minute: Financial Markets' Reaction to the 2020 U.S. Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find striking correlations between the presidential election outcome probability and major financial indicators, including USD currency pairs, bond prices, stock index futures, and a market volatility measure. The correlations are consistent with 'risk-on' behavior in markets, a term which describes investors moving toward riskier asset classes, as the election results became clearer. Further, we decompose the market reaction into a 'reduction in uncertainty' component and a 'probability of a Democratic party presidency' component. This decomposition reveals how markets reacted to the increasing certainty of the outcome as election results came in. Finally, we analyze the differing market reactions to the presidential election and the Senate election, including data from the unique Georgia runoffs, and demonstrate that bond prices were particularly sensitive to the probability of a combined Democratic Senate and Presidency.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Economic Forecasting: An Application to China's GDP Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to explore the application of machine learning in forecasting Chinese macroeconomic variables. Specifically, it employs various machine learning models to predict the quarterly real GDP growth of China, and analyzes the factors contributing to the performance differences among these models. Our findings indicate that the average forecast errors of machine learning models are generally lower than those of traditional econometric models or expert forecasts, particularly in periods of economic stability. However, during certain inflection points, although machine learning models still outperform traditional econometric models, expert forecasts may exhibit greater accuracy in some instances due to experts' more comprehensive understanding of the macroeconomic environment and real-time economic variables. In addition to macroeconomic forecasting, this paper employs interpretable machine learning methods to identify the key attributive variables from different machine learning models, aiming to enhance the understanding and evaluation of their contributions to macroeconomic fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence and Algorithmic Price Collusion in Two-sided Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic price collusion facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms raises significant concerns. We examine how AI agents using Q-learning engage in tacit collusion in two-sided markets. Our experiments reveal that AI-driven platforms achieve higher collusion levels compared to Bertrand competition. Increased network externalities significantly enhance collusion, suggesting AI algorithms exploit them to maximize profits. Higher user heterogeneity or greater utility from outside options generally reduce collusion, while higher discount rates increase it. Tacit collusion remains feasible even at low discount rates. To mitigate collusive behavior and inform potential regulatory measures, we propose incorporating a penalty term in the Q-learning algorithm.</description>

      <title>Simple method for efficiently solving dynamic models with continuous actions using policy gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes the Value Function-Policy Gradient Iteration-Spectral (VF-PGI-Spectral) algorithm, which efficiently solves discrete-time infinite-horizon dynamic models with continuous actions. It combines the spectral algorithm to accelerate convergence. The method is applicable not only to single-agent dynamic optimization problems, but also to multi-agent dynamic games, which previously proposed methods cannot deal with. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is not limited to models with specific functional forms, and applies to models with multiple continuous actions. This study shows the results of numerical experiments, showing the effective performance of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion And The Minimum Price Markov Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Minimum Price Markov Game (MPMG), a dynamic variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma. The MPMG serves as a theoretical model and reasonable approximation of real-world first-price sealed-bid public auctions that follow the minimum price rule. The goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a framework to study market fairness and regulation in both digitized and non-digitized public procurement processes, amidst growing concerns about algorithmic collusion in online markets. We demonstrate, using multi-agent reinforcement learning-driven artificial agents, that algorithmic tacit coordination is difficult to achieve in the MPMG when cooperation is not explicitly engineered. Paradoxically, our results highlight the robustness of the minimum price rule in an auction environment, but also show that it is not impervious to full-scale algorithmic collusion. These findings contribute to the ongoing debates about algorithmic pricing and its implications.</description>

      <title>Duration Dependence and Heterogeneity: Learning from Early Notice of Layoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to distinguish the impact of duration-dependent forces and adverse selection on the exit rate from unemployment by leveraging variation in the length of layoff notices. I formulate a Mixed Hazard model in discrete time and specify the conditions under which variation in notice length enables the identification of structural duration dependence while allowing for arbitrary heterogeneity across workers. Utilizing data from the Displaced Worker Supplement (DWS), I employ the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) to estimate the model. According to the estimates, the decline in the exit rate over the first 48 weeks of unemployment is largely due to the worsening composition of surviving jobseekers. Furthermore, I find that an individual's likelihood of exiting unemployment decreases initially, then increases until unemployment benefits run out, and remains steady thereafter. These findings are consistent with a standard search model where returns to search decline early in the spell.</description>

      <title>Can Base ChatGPT be Used for Forecasting without Additional Optimization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates whether OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 can forecast future events. To evaluate the accuracy of the predictions, we take advantage of the fact that the training data at the time of our experiments (mid 2023) stopped at September 2021, and ask about events that happened in 2022. We employed two prompting strategies: direct prediction and what we call future narratives which ask ChatGPT to tell fictional stories set in the future with characters retelling events that happened in the past, but after ChatGPT's training data had been collected. We prompted ChatGPT to engage in storytelling, particularly within economic contexts. After analyzing 100 trials, we find that future narrative prompts significantly enhanced ChatGPT-4's forecasting accuracy. This was especially evident in its predictions of major Academy Award winners as well as economic trends, the latter inferred from scenarios where the model impersonated public figures like the Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell. As a falsification exercise, we repeated our experiments in May 2024 at which time the models included more recent training data. ChatGPT-4's accuracy significantly improved when the training window included the events being prompted for, achieving 100% accuracy in many instances. The poorer accuracy for events outside of the training window suggests that in the 2023 prediction experiments, ChatGPT-4 was forming predictions based solely on its training data. Narrative prompting also consistently outperformed direct prompting. These findings indicate that narrative prompts leverage the models' capacity for hallucinatory narrative construction, facilitating more effective data synthesis and extrapolation than straightforward predictions. Our research reveals new aspects of LLMs' predictive capabilities and suggests potential future applications in analytical contexts.</description>
